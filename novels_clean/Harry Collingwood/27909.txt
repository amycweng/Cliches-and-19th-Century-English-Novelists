dick leslie luck by harry collingwood chapter one maritime disaster night be a dark a inside of cow mr pryce chief mate of full rigged sailing ship golden fleece outward bound to melbourne be

to worst feature of case seemed to be that be innocent felt that have be guilty must have borne punishment because must have richly merited that being innocent must thus be permitted to suffer such abasement disgrace seemed incomprehensible to injustice of appeared to so rank so colossal a to destroy within in moment atom of former faith in existence of god of justice of mercy with loss of faith

be accompanied by request from earl that must never again show face in england even in europe at moment when story open sound of ship bell upon four bell have just be struck be still vibrating upon wet fog laden air steerage passenger be below most of in bunk while cuddy people with one solitary exception be in brilliantly lighted saloon amusing with card book music exception be leslie who having changed out of dress clothes into comfortable suit of blue serge be down in waist of ship smoking gloomily retrospective pipe ship reckoning that day have placed at noon in latitude degree minute north longitude degree minute west be therefore about midway between parallel of madeira teneriffe four hundred mile thereabouts to westward of island wind be blowing moderate breeze from about south east by south ship close hauled on port tack with plain sail set to royal be heading south west going through water at rate of good honest seven knot helmsman be steering by compass not by sail since be impossible to see anything above dozen foot up from deck hence ship be going along with everything rap full captain rainhill be very far from being easy in mind seven knot meditated be good pace at to be sailing through fog thick enough to cut with knife must mean something very much like disaster if ship happened to run up against anything particularly if anything happened also to be travelling at about same speed in opposite direction from point of view therefore speed of golden fleece just then constituted decided element of danger on other hand however enabled to promptly answer helm thus might be mean of enabling to swerve quickly aside so avoid danger might suddenly loom up out of fog around in sense became safeguard then there be fact that golden fleece be longer in crowded part of ocean be three day since have sighted craft of description there might be at moment nothing within couple of hundred mile of in case there be absolutely nothing to fear furthermore owner made especial point of persistently impressing upon captain great importance of nay more urgent necessity for making quick passage there be two keen eyed lookout stationed upon topgallant forecastle between third man provided with fog horn upon at brief interval blew weirdest of blast taking into consideration circumstance skipper finally decided to leave thing a be put trust in sweet little cherub that sits up aloft to look after life of poor jack five bell pealed out upon dank air responsive cry of well from look out came wailing aft from forecastle leslie pipe be out knocked out dead ash turned to go below then considering matter further decided that be full early yet to turn in sauntering across deck to port rail stood gazing abstractedly out to windward a slowly filled pipe afresh man with fog horn be still industriously blowing long blast to windward when ruthlessly cutting into one of there suddenly came from apparently close at hand on port bow loud discordant yell of steam syren next instant three light red green white arranged in form of isosceles triangle broke upon leslie gaze with startling suddenness through dense fog broad on port bow of golden fleece large steamer coming along at full speed be close aboard heading straight for sailing ship leslie professional training at once asserted a frenzied shout of steamer broad on port bow came pealing aft from throat of two startled lookout made single bound for poop ladder cry in voice rang through ship from stem to stern port hard port for life over with wheel for god sake cry be broken in upon by mad jangling of engine room bell accompanied by perfect babel of excited shout evidently in foreign tongue on board stranger mingled with equally excited shout sudden trampling of foot forward loud voiced command from captain rainhill on poop a leslie reached head of poop ladder steamer crashed with terrific force into port side of ill fated golden fleece just forward of fore rigging so tremendous be shock individual who happened at moment to be on foot on board sailing ship be thrown to deck while a for ship be heeled over by until water poured like cataract in over starboard topgallant rail there be horrid crunching sound a ponderous iron bow of steamer irresistibly clove way through wooden side deck of ship loud twanging aloft told of severed rigging there be terrifying crash of breaking spar overhead then in moment a seemed main deck poop became alive with shrieking shouting distraught people rushing aimlessly hither thither excitedly demanding of other be matter skipper confounded for moment by appalling suddenness of catastrophe quickly recovered turning to chief mate ordered to go forward to investigate extent of damage then finding ferris second mate at elbow said mr ferris muster watch at once port watch to port side starboard watch to starboard side set to work to clear away boat for launching where be chief steward here sir answered individual in question forcing way through excited crowd surrounded skipper good ejaculated rainhill muster steward sir turn to upon job of getting provision water up on deck for boat a go pas word for passenger to dress in warmest clothing make up in package valuable that may desire to take with in event of being obliged to leave ship must leave luggage behind there will be room for luggage in boat tell of who may be below to complete preparation come on deck without delay at moment mr pryce having completed investigation forward came rushing up poop ladder wild with excitement shouted to skipper ca live five minute sir be cut down from rail to bilge there be hole in side big enough to drive coach six through water be pouring into like sluice where be steamer demanded skipper have backed out vanished in fog answered mate god what appalling mess ejaculated distracted skipper through lubberly carelessness of foreign fellow who be too lazy to sound syren until be aboard of now mr ferris what be news of boat hurry up get into water a smartly a possible back main yard mr pryce mention of boat added to ill advised candour of mate loudly proclaimed statement a to condition of ship took immediate hold upon mob of anxiously listening people who be crowding round two men galvanised into sudden breathless activity hitherto have only vaguely realised that what have happened might possibly mean danger to now in flash dawned upon one that be victim of ghastly disaster that death be actually staring in face therewith mad unreasoning panic took possession of with one accord made rush for boat stand back there stand back say leave men room to work skipper do hear there people from steerage stand back a value life do want to drown yourselves everybody else here mr pryce lend hand to keep madman in order back man of get off poop might a well have appealed to attempted to reason with ocean be pouring in through gash in ship side be doubtful whether one of to whom addressed heard if did certainly took notice in moment ship crew be swept away from davit tackle fall in maddened mob with wild yell of be sinking be sinking be struggling together striking trampling down everybody who happened to be in way fighting desperately with other for place in boat have be swung out be ready for lowering skipper mate dashed manfully into thick of melee doubt hoping that authority habit of discipline be being gradually cultivated among emigrant must enable to stem tide of panic be raging restore order for at least few minute be needed to get boat into water in vain two men be visible for moment fighting desperately side by side then went down before maniacal charge in cuddy passenger have by time joined be seen no more a for leslie nearest approach to happiness have be for more than seven year came to now with conviction that be at last face to face with inevitable kindly death have endured seven year of physical misery mental torment because have too much grit to resort to cowardly expedient of taking own life now now fate no longer believed in existence of being a god fate have taken pity upon through act of own be going to be relieved of intolerable burden for knew that with fighting mob of raging maniac struggling madly round boat escape be sheer impossibility that in few minute hour at outside for be strong swimmer must go down inanimate into dark depth load of disgrace humiliation must fall from for ever so serene contented in mind stood well back beyond outer fringe of frantic swaying cursing crowd cynically watched proceeding scene upon gazed be precisely what have expected from moment when three ill omened light have burst through fog told that golden fleece be doomed ship here be selfishness supremely triumphant beating down eradicating in moment nobler instinct of humanity be man for with vengeance woman child be struck out of men way with horrid curse savage murderous blow men be fighting together like furious beast knife be out blood be flowing freely air be clamorous with shriek groan imprecation whole accentuated made still more dreadful by loud clash of dangling wreckage aloft awful creaking groaning of riven hull a writhed upon low swell to gurgling sobbing splashing sound of water alongside under counter weird horror inspiring effect being still further intensified by hollow moaning of night wind over heaving surface of deep struggling crowd be no longer human save in shape have become mob of senseless raging demon blind insensate selfishness yes be motive dominated individual in seething crowd have kept head listened to poor captain rainhill have helped instead of hindered might have be well many hand make light quick work have man there devoted tithe of energy be now displaying to task of helping crew to launch boat be possible that life on board might have be saved a be boat hung there at davit crowded far beyond utmost capacity with men who ignorantly sought to lower while others fought struggled with occupant for place that have secured nothing useful be done meanwhile although not one of crowd of mad folk seemed to be aware of fact ship be settling down with awful rapidity already be sunk to channel be heaving heavily upon swell with slow deadly sluggishness of movement to initiated told so plainly that end be nigh now utterly hopeless a leslie future appeared to impossible a seemed to be task of ever rehabilitating in eye of world crushed a be by burden of disgrace glad a be at prospect of deliverance from misery through kindly agency of death be characteristic of that even now at supreme moment of impending deliverance self respect imperiously demanded of at cost must eschew even faintest taint of so cowardly act a of suicide if death be really close at hand a certainly appeared to be well good be what be hoping for must be thrice welcome nevertheless felt incumbent upon that must take full advantage of such slender aid to escape a happened to present accordingly a bow of ship became depressed while stern rose in air telling that golden fleece be about to take final dive mechanically sprang to taffrail disengaging life buoy that hung there passed over shoulder up under armpit then climbing upon rail leapt unhesitatingly into black heaving water below at precise moment when loud wail of indescribable anguish despair from frantic crowd fighting about boat told that to too have at last come realisation of imminent doom a leslie struck water floated there supported by life buoy rudder stern post of ship hove slowly out of water close alongside until keel for length of thirty foot be exposed then huge hull began to slide forward away from with ever quickening motion until with rush weird whistling of air escaping from ship interior mingled horribly with shriek of on deck dull booming a deck be burst up fabric plunged headlong be gone then came deadly suction of sinking ship water poured from round like raging torrent into swirling hollow where craft have be a leslie felt caught dragged irresistibly toward vortex instinctively drew deep breath filling lung to utmost capacity with air in readiness for long submergence that knew be coming moment have come tumbling water have closed over felt being dragged down down down whirled helplessly hither thither a clung resolutely to life buoy a continued to descend be constantly reminded that be not alone in frightful plunge into depth several time came into more le violent contact with object at least of be certainly struggling human being like once felt strongly clutched by hair for moment swirl of water almost immediately tore free again still awful implacable downward drag continued until began to wonder dreamily whether must ever return to surface alive whether after deliverance from wretchedness in inexplicable way already seemed much le poignant to be coming to down there in black depth pressure upon body be rapidly becoming unendurable air be being forced from lung be suffocating involuntarily began to struggle throwing out arm leg instinctively in powerful effort to return to surface then in moment lost consciousness of dreadful situation found once more back among scene of childhood multitude of trivial long forgotten incident recurring to memory with inconceivable rapidity be dying man agony of drowning be over have entered upon curious phase of retrospection that most drowning people experience so pleasantly precedes that form of dissolution after indefinite period of oblivion consciousness returned found that have somehow come back to surface be painfully taking in great gulp of air clinging tenaciously meanwhile to what so far a must discover in intense darkness be body of woman whether woman be alive dead leslie knew not still animated by old reckless disregard for own safety have become part of nature a well a by innate feeling of chivalry that even great sorrow have not eradicated first impulse be to give unknown companion benefit of slender possibility of ultimate escape might exist accordingly lost not moment in disengaging from life buoy still supported adjusting beneath unconscious body of woman in such manner that sat within almost a though be armchair buoy floating aslant in water with lower rim supporting weight of body while upper rim rose several inch above surface of water pressed against supported woman shoulder by arrangement woman head be raised well above water if be not already dead there be prospect that must ultimately revive recover consciousness a for leslie be so powerful swimmer that really needed support now that be once more accordingly threw prone upon back in position floated easily retaining hold upon buoy by mean of becket of light line be looped around water be quite warm there be therefore hardship in being immersed in there be not much sea running such a there be seldom broke leslie felt therefore that probability of several hour of life still lay before began with queer feeling of dismay disappointment to ask whether after might not ultimately be doomed to escape knew that catastrophe have occurred right in usual track of ship bound south be quite upon card one of might come along at moment pas within hail of at event close enough to permit of being seen if must happen to occur between daylight dark must feel bound to adopt such measure a might be possible to attract attention of crew cause to be picked up well argued if such thing must happen must not be helped perhaps there might occur other occasion besides there be companion might possibly be alive if such must be case must doubtless be anxious to escape have in accidental way come under protection must do everything possibly must for question a to whether life still lingered in occupant of life buoy be speedily determined for while leslie still lay floating tranquilly upon back weighing pro con of situation faint groan reached ear quickly followed by second louder more sustained then followed certain sound indicative of violent sickness patient be getting rid of very considerable quantity of sea water that have swallowed leslie waited patiently until unpleasant episode appeared to have come to end when raising upright in water said cheerfully be capital will soon be right now be feeling tolerably comfortable in buoy oh heaven moaned voice leslie fancied be not altogether unfamiliar to be possible that there be one else in same horrible plight a unfortunate self nay said leslie speak think of a unfortunate at least a yet have thus far escaped with life be fear more than one else except have done while there be life there be hope know surely not in such dreadful situation a ours said companion what hope dare entertain what possible prospect of escape have be not certainty that will perish miserably by thirst starvation if succeed in avoiding death by drowning must confess that will bitterly regret respite have in mysterious way come to if be doomed to linger on endure protracted horror of death from hunger thirst naturally will assented leslie fully agree with that if one other fate must necessarily overtake that of drowning be much to be preferred be early yet to despair be in part of atlantic be much frequented by ship if fate will only be kind to be quite on card that may be picked up in course of day two surely if fine weather will last a believe will can hold out for length of time let reassure upon one point so long a be fully immersed in water a now be will not suffer very greatly from thirst water penetrates through pore of skin being filtered a be in process alleviates to very considerable extent craving for liquid must otherwise result from long abstinence hunger of course be matter must make up mind to endure that a best may will understand that be now looking at bright side of thing there be dark side also will not consider at present what have to do just now be to be hopeful to maintain one hopefulness be battle if assurance will help in least to encourage must like clearly to understand so long a life at least consciousness particle of strength remains to may rely upon doing level best for being by profession sailor may be able to do much that landsman must not meanwhile however that can do at present be to wait patiently for daylight one point be already declaring in favour notice that fog be lifting be responded girl wearily can not say that be able to detect improvement naturally sailor trained eye must be more quick to see such change than of land woman like spoke of a sailor seem to recognise voice be one of officer of golden fleece answered leslie connection with ship be simply that of passenger like used to belong to british navy although left seven year ago venture to believe that knowledge of seamanship have not yet grown quite rusty name be leslie richard leslie unless ear deceive be miss trevor yes assented girl be quite right be unfortunate individual unfortunate be to say in yielded to poor aunt persuasion consented to embark in sailing ship instead of going out to australia in mail steamer have not be very well for month be thought that longer voyage by sailing ship must benefit health so be mr leslie gentleman who held so rigidly aloof from that excited everybody be most lively curiosity a to business antecedent in short everything about well mr leslie let say at once be profoundly grateful to for promise to help so far a can at same time must confess that at present quite fail to see in what way can possibly be of slightest assistance to excepting of course that presence companionship be great comfort encouragement to must be awful beyond word to find one quite alone in such frightful situation a by way do think likely that others besides ourselves have survived horrible accident if accident be oh answered leslie there be doubt a to being accident be one of accident might have be avoided rainhill be not to blame observed possible precaution fault lay with other fellow who came blundering along through dense fog at full speed take approached so rapidly that failed to hear fog horn until be too late to avoid ought under circumstance to have be steaming dead slow then upon hearing fog horn must at once have stopped engine if necessary reversed until danger of collision be past a be be quite upon card that too have gone to bottom ship must strike so terrific blow a steamer did without suffering serious damage a to probability of there being other survivor than doubt be absolutely certain that nobody must possibly have escaped in of boat watching mad fight for at distance a did imagine that when ship went down one of frantic people went under in grasp of somebody else so lost in person death grip chance might otherwise have have of coming to surface be marvel to how escaped where be when ship plunged oh be down on what called main deck ' answered miss trevor captain give order one be to don warmest clothing so slipped into cabin changed evening frock for good stout serge wore when first came on board when emerged from saloon found quite alone be just about to climb up on poop when ship seemed to slide from under found being dragged down beneath surface then lost consciousness knew more until awoke to find afloat in life buoy have be wondering how came to be in such singular position can by chance enlighten well to be perfectly candid put there answered leslie recognised from first with mad panic prevailing on board there must be possibility of utilising boat so took precaution to provide with life buoy in jumped overboard like be of course dragged under by suction of ship a went down like lost consciousness though not think for very long when recovered sens found once more afloat with fold of dress in grasp so a simplest mean of relieving of fatigue of supporting placed in buoy not needing since be strong swimmer can support for practically length of time in water from must appear that be indebted to for circumstance be alive at present moment commented miss trevor suppose ought to be profoundly grateful to excuse for interrupting broke in leslie if be not greatly mistaken there be something floating out there may be of use to will tow to in present circumstance must avail ourselves of everything affords opportunity to better condition chapter two picked up object have attracted leslie notice proved to be one of hencoop belonging to golden fleece have broken adrift when ship went down returned to surface there be floating at great distance so having towed miss trevor in life buoy to first directed to hold on to for few minute swam on to second with difficulty got alongside first lashing of be fortunately intact cleat to coop be secured having torn away from deck leslie therefore temporarily secured two coop to other intending a soon a daylight appeared to lash properly together in such manner a hoped must form fairly useful raft during progress of small business conversation between two people thus strangely thrown together have necessarily be interrupted a miss trevor did not appear to be very eager to renew thought best to maintain silence in hope that companion might be able to secure little sleep meanwhile fog have gradually be growing le dense within about hour of incident of hencoop few star became visible overhead hour later fog have completely disappeared revealing star studded sky that spread dome like unbroken from zenith to horizon to leslie night seemed interminable at length anxious eye be gladdened by appearance of faint paling of sky low down on horizon in eastern quarter gradually imperceptibly pallor spread right left upward toward zenith until broad arch of lay stretched along horizon within limit of star one after dwindled in brightness presently disappeared against patch of pallor head of running surge rose fell restlessly black a ink once a leslie companion be lifted on top of swell former thought caught sight for moment of small toy like object in far distance when next be hove up looked for again for few minute in vain then came unusually lofty undulation that for moment lifted high enough to render horizon almost level with only isolated ridge here there to break continuity during brief moment once more caught sight of object knew that be figment of imagination on contrary be clear sharply defined image of upper canvas from royal down to foot of topsail of barque steering south be of course much too distant to be of use to appearance just then be encouraging inasmuch a confirmed conviction that be fairly in track of ship pointed craft out to companion said what must to raise hope by time poor girl be beginning to feel so exhausted from long exposure intense emotion have preceded that found task difficult almost to point of impossibility during brief period occupied by leslie in watching distant barque endeavouring to deduce from appearance substantial ground for encouragement on part of companion sky have brightened to extent that star have vanished presently with flash of golden radiance up rose sun cheering beam at once transforming scene from one of chill dreariness to blaze of genial warmth beauty leslie felt that with reappearance of sun must be well to get companion out of water up on top of hencoop a soon a possible since dryness warmth be what now most urgently required accordingly at once went to work with will to get proposed raft into shape first of made business to investigate interior of coop with eye to provision of certain want in not far distant future felt sure that in one if not of coop must be found number of drowned fowl although hunger of companion have not yet nearly reached point of demanding satisfaction on diet of raw drowned poultry foresaw speedy approach of moment when even such unappetising fare a must be welcome accordingly turned coop over so that must get at content found a have expected that contained fair supply of food indeed there be more than must be able to consume before became unusable one coop yielding fourteen fowl other eight abstracted secured then turned two coop over in water so that floated right side upward face to face in order that top must afford something in nature of smooth platform upon pair must recline with minimum of discomfort in position firmly lashed two together with lashing still attached to then helped miss trevor to get out of life buoy clamber up on top of fragile structure finding to satisfaction when have done so that raft possessed just enough buoyancy to support comfortably when reclining at full length upon although unfortunately not enough to keep dry since even in such quiet weather a then prevailed sea continuously washed over occurred to leslie since hencoop have broken adrift from sinking ship other wreckage might have done same accordingly proceeded to search surface of ocean with gaze in quest of floating object for few minute quest be vain presently just to southward of sun dazzle on water eye be caught by momentary appearance of blinking light a of sun ray reflected from cluster of floating wet object next instant lost again behind heaving mound of swell then caught again time for long enough to enable to decide that be about mile distant for moment be doubtful whether being so far away what saw must possibly be wreckage from golden fleece little reflection suggested to that if wreckage must happen to be floating deep must be quite possible for companion with hencoop floating on very surface a be to have be driven quite distance to leeward by mere wash of sea whether however be certain that away there half mile to windward there be enough wreckage apparently to afford raft upon must be supported high dry there be one way of reaching wreckage be to swim to propelling raft fair burden before be decidedly formidable task to undertake for raft being rectangular in shape drawing about two foot of water offered very considerable amount of resistance to propulsion especially under unfavourable condition be only one possible still there be other task upon leslie must employ felt that be imperative to do something if only to while time away interest companion thus diverting thought preventing from dwelling too much upon horror of present situation therefore set manfully to work shaping course by run of sea proceeded to propel raft to windward resting hand upon after end striking out with leg in long steady stroke must be maintained for considerable period without entailing undue fatigue progress be painfully slow almost imperceptible indeed for when at end of hour vigorous swimming leslie paused to take breath look round utmost that must say be that be certainly not further away from wreckage for be aiming than have be to start with reasoning upon conclusion forced upon be that after have merely succeeded in retarding own drift to leeward while to actually force unwieldy raft to windward thus reach desired flotsam be quite beyond unaided power have just rather ruefully arrived at unwelcome conclusion when clambering up on raft to take good look round a structure rose heavily upon back of swell suddenly sighted away in northern board tiny speck of creamy white gleaming softly out against warm delicate grey tone of sky low down in quarter be momentary glimpse for have sooner caught than raft settled down into trough while low hill of turquoise blue water swelled up in front of hiding horizon object upon eager gaze have be so intently fixed then raft be once more hove up leslie again caught sight of object time remained in view for space of perhaps six second brief though period may seem be sufficient to enable practised seaman eye to determine fact that what saw be head of royal of ship steering to southward so anxiously did leslie await next reappearance of tiny object so tense be attitude of expectation that attracted notice of companion who be fast sinking into state of torpor from exhaustion raised painfully into sitting attitude in weak somewhat fretful tone inquired what be mr leslie do see anything yes answered leslie still anxiously watching there be vessel of sort away out there be steering way what be anxious to determine if can be whether be likely to pas close enough to to enable to attract attention oh pray heaven that may be so ejaculated miss trevor brightening up perceptibly at prospect of possible rescue be there nothing that can do to insure that will see say that be sailor have be told that sailor be amazingly ingenious creature surely can think of something act must better position spoke querulously with undertone of old disdain formerly marked manner running through speech man can do little with only two hand tool to help answered leslie gently yet may rely upon doing be possible under such disadvantageous condition from position of craft course that judge to be steering fear that will pas too far to windward of to permit of attracting attention fact that will be to leeward of when pass will be against for sailor look dozen time to windward for once that glance over lee rail effort during last hour have convinced of impossibility of driving ungainly structure to windward by merely swimming if only have oar paddle of sort might be able to do something then see have so be of use to think further of that wind be dropping be point in favour inasmuch a will lessen speed of yonder craft in coming down toward so give more time in to act believe that for instance must be possible for alone unencumbered to swim out to windward far enough to intercept certainly like idea of leaving here alone even on important errand a one have in mind for if wind must happen to shift must by other mean fail to reach might meet with difficulty might perhaps even prove impossible to find again oh pray allow consideration for to interfere with freedom of action retorted girl bitterly if can save by leaving here to die alone beg that will not hesitate stop if please answered leslie with sharpness of tone have right to think to suggest must do such thing perhaps however may have misunderstood continued more gently what have in mind be occurred to that might not be difficult for to swim out intercept ship attract attention of on board get picked up then must explain to skipper that be down here to leeward afloat upon raft upon learning must of course at once bear up run down to look for a in probability must only be two mile away at moment when must be picked up there must be absolutely possibility of missing still continued thoughtfully there remains chance of failure a said just now scarcely like to risk if be not for fact that be in so weak exhausted condition must suggest that once more get into life buoy when abandoning raft trusting to chance to find again other wreckage that have be trying to reach must endeavour to tow far enough to windward to enable to intercept vessel get to pick up do really think that proceeding must be likely to prove successful demanded girl with considerable access of animation in voice might might not answered leslie be impossible to say with certainty so much depends upon chance still think experiment be quite worth trying may have to do something very like eventually must be better to try now while have little strength left only if be to attempt have better start forthwith so that may make a sure a can of achieving success by way suppose be fairly hungry by time be hungry enough to tackle raw slice off breast of drowned chicken girl made gesture of disgust if most dainty meal imaginable be placed before at moment believe must touch morsel of said beg that will not allow squeamishness to deter from eating if feel need of food thanks replied leslie cheerfully must confess that be quite ready for breakfast although fare can scarcely be described a appetising think will attempt morsel may prove useful to in view of task before therewith extracting knife from pocket selecting fairly plump fowl hacked off goodsized slice of breast from stripped skin feather together then cramming lump of flesh into mouth masticated well extracting juice from after pronounced ready for new adventure hauling life buoy up on raft showed miss trevor how to place in in manner a to secure maximum amount of support from a soon a have arranged according to instruction bade plunge boldly in did then at once followed passing left arm through one of becket forthwith struck out swimming with long steady stroke in direction have decided must be most advantageous for to take be perfectly true that a leslie have remarked wind be falling light have dropped quite perceptibly since sunrise state of ocean be reflecting change sea be going down no longer broke anywhere condition for swimming be improving moment pair of strange voyager be making excellent progress a be evidenced by rapidity with drew away from raft within hour indeed have left so far astern that be with utmost difficulty leslie be able to locate again when paused for moment to rest when further quarter of hour have elapsed have vanished altogether thus vindicating leslie previous doubt a to wisdom of swimming out alone to intercept ship leaving miss trevor upon raft to be sought for picked up later on a to craft for be aiming be clear that be slow tub for came drifting down toward at very deliberate pace wind have softened away to about four knot breeze leslie be of opinion that although showed plain sail up to royal be scarcely doing three knot be in favour for while smoothening of sea surface enabled leslie to attain much more satisfactory rate of speed with same moderate amount of exertion low rate of sailing of on coming vessel rendered certain that apart from accident must now assuredly be able to reach by time that have become undoubted fact leslie have made out that stranger be small brig of two hundred thirty ton thereabout must greatly have preferred that have be bigger craft because probability must then have be greater of proving passenger ship passenger ship be what leslie be now particularly anxious to fall in with for miss trevor sake change of clothing being almost indispensable requirement on part of young lady so soon a must once more find on ship deck that there be passenger at least woman passenger aboard brig however be practically certain be much too small for unless skipper happened to be married man with wife aboard miss trevor must have to fall back upon own resource ingenuity for change of clothing discussed matter with companion a swam onward young woman just then regarded question with considerable amount of indifference one consuming anxiety for moment be to again find herself on deck of craft of sort other consideration be clearly quite willing to relegate to more le distant future meanwhile brig be slowly drawing down toward a slowly lifting canvas above horizon by time that have raised to foot of course leslie have succeeded in bringing two mast into line so that pair be now dead ahead of having accomplished much swimmer concluded that might safely take rest for brig being close hauled must be certain to be making more le leeway be quite possible that must drive to leeward at least a fast a did if not faster therefore threw over on back requesting companion to keep eye on approaching brig report to progress from time to time breeze having begun to drop continued to fall still lighter until leslie raising for moment to take look at brig saw with dismay that lower canvas be wrinkling collapsing occasionally for lack of wind be by time however hull up not more than mile distant moreover rest in have be indulging have refreshed so considerably that felt quite capable of further exertion therefore determined to shorten period of suspense a much a possible by swimming directly for craft resolution be immensely strengthened by sudden recollection that be afloat in part of ocean where shark shark might put in unwelcome appearance at moment accordingly without mentioning last unpleasant reflection of to companion recommenced swimming time shaping course directly for brig although own individual progress that of brig be slow combined progress toward other rapidly shortened distance between within about quarter of hour of time that leslie have recommenced swimming have arrived near enough in judgment to commence hailing with view to attracting attention of brig crew ceasing exertion therefore took good long breath shouted at top of voice brig ahoy brig ahoy brig ahoy hail thrice repeated exhausted capacity of lung paused anxiously listening for reply thought miss trevor thought too that in response to last shout faint hillo have come floating down to wash of water be in ear must not be certain therefore again took breath repeated hail time there must be doubt about answering hail came distinctly enough immediately afterwards so close be brig to saw first one head then appear in eye of vessel peering over bow quick a light treading water meanwhile whipped white pocket handkerchief out of breast pocket of coat waved eagerly over head people in bow of brig stared incredulously for moment then with sudden simultaneous flinging aloft of arm abruptly vanished right ejaculated leslie in tone of profound relief have seen deliverance miss trevor be now matter of few brief minute oh thank god thank god cried girl brokenly then in moment tension of nerve suddenly giving way broke down utterly burst into perfect passion of tear leslie have sense enough to recognise that hysterical outburst must probably relieve companion sorely overwrought feeling do good therefore allowed to have cry out in peace without making attempt to check be still sobbing convulsively when leslie who never took eye off slowly approaching brig saw five people suddenly appear in vessel bow three of pointing eagerly while other two peered out ahead under sharp of hand brig ahoy hailed leslie back main yard will stand by to heave couple of rope end when come alongside ay ay promptly came answer from brig men in bow again vanished a did so same voice have just answered pealed out let go port main brace main tack sheet back main yard then of stand by to drop line two with standing bowline in end to people in water main yard swung slowly aback canvas on mainmast pressed against mast still further retarding vessel sluggish movement a drifted almost imperceptibly up to few stroke of leslie arm took pair alongside where dozen rope end with loop in already dangled in water with deft movement leslie seized dropped one of over head under armpit then taking miss trevor about waist gave word hoist away handsomely four men standing on brig rail dragged up vessel low side assisted to gain deck vessel on board now found be small craft compared with golden fleece measuring a leslie have already guessed about two hundred thirty ton register that be british language of crew have already told be thankful that be so for might now reasonably hope for courteous treatment of companion be not always to be reckoned upon with certainty under such circumstance if craft happens to be manned by foreigner vessel moreover appeared to be tolerably clean while crew seemed to be fairly decent lot of men a gained deck tall dark rather handsome man with expression of countenance that leslie hardly liked stepped forward be clad entirely in white be clearly master of brig good morning said without offering hand uttering word of welcome where devil do come from be answered leslie survivor only two be afraid of passenger ship golden fleece bound to melbourne be run into sunk by unknown steamer last night about eleven o'clock during dense fog name be leslie be one of cuddy passenger lady who be likewise cuddy passenger be miss trevor man rather saturnine feature relaxed a gazed with undisguised admiration at lovely girl wet bedraggled though be stepping up to held out hand saying most obedient miss glad to see aboard ship name potter james potter brig mermaid of london bound out to valparaiso with general cargo added directing girl attention toward slight active looking man who stood beside be only mate mr purchas miss trevor bowed slightly first to one then to other of two men a introduction be made then turning once more to potter thanked earnestly heartily for having picked up herself companion stood waiting irresolutely for what be next to happen oh be right miss be very welcome be sure glad to have chance of doing service to beauty a be then turning abruptly about shouted swing main yard fill upon board main tack aft with sheet lively now skowbanks stand staring there like stuck pig men hurried away to execute elegantly embellished order leslie who have stood impatiently by with slowly gathering frown corrugating brow stepped forward said hope mr potter that presence on board brig be not going to subject to inconvenience hope further that will not need to tax hospitality for very long sooner later be pretty certain to fall in with homeward bound ship in case will ask to have goodness to transfer miss trevor to a valparaiso be quite out of way have wish to visit place meanwhile have be in water for somewhere about twelve hour miss trevor be in dreadfully exhausted condition a may see for if must kindly arrange for to turn in for few hour must do greater service for present to be quite candid must not be sorry if must spare corner in to stretch while clothes be drying skipper turned upon leslie rather sharply scowlingly look here mister said worry about young lady will look after will have use of cabin bunk made up everything be quite ready for at minute notice come with miss continued will take below show quarter can turn in at once when have rested enough will have good meal cooked ready for way please therewith offering arm to girl led aft toward companion without vouchsafing word to leslie a for girl be by time so nearly in state of collapse that must hing passively accept assistance offered submit to be led away below queer chap rather skipper ai remarked mate coming to leslie side a potter miss trevor vanished down companion way be first voyage with between lamp post will be last if thing greatly improve between now getting back to london reckon will be better for snooze too so come below with can use cabin for present until old man make other arrangement very many thanks answered leslie will be more than glad to avail of kind offer before do so however wish to say that somewhere over there pointing out over lee bow about three mile away there be floating wreckage from golden fleece although think rather doubtful there may be few people clinging to hope will represent to mr potter induce to run down examine spot will not take much off course if fellow have humanity at in will surely not neglect opportunity to save possibly few more life right said purchas will tell when come on deck again now come away below turn in therewith mate conducted leslie down into small dark rather frowsy stateroom at foot of companion ladder outside brig main cabin having said few awkward hearty word of hospitality in reply to other expression of thanks closed door upon left to five minute later leslie be stretched warm comfortable in bunk wrapped in sound dreamless sleep chapter three captain potter cause trouble when leslie awoke warm mellow glow of light streamed in through small scuttle in ship side prepared for discovery that have slept until late in afternoon a lay there reflecting upon startling event of previous twenty four hour sound of eight bell being struck on deck confirmed surmise by conveying to information that be just four o'clock raised in bunk striking head smartly against low deck planking above a did so looked for clothes where have flung off before turning in be not there casting eye about little apartment however presently recognised hanging dry upon hook screwed to bulkhead thereupon dropped out of bunk proceeded forthwith to dress noting a did so by slow gentle oscillation of brig that sea have gone down to practically nothing while slept while occasional flutter flap of canvas heard quite distinctly where be told that wind have dropped to calm dressing quickly hurried on deck wondering whether must find miss trevor there be not skipper mate be in evidence standing one on side of companion of speaking sky be cloudless wind have dropped to dead calm surface of sea be oil smooth low swell still undulated up from south east quarter ship have swung nearly east west sun beam pouring in over starboard quarter bit fiercely although luminary be by time declining well toward horizon well mister have good sleep inquired skipper with attempt to infuse geniality into voice excellent thank answered a with quick glance swept entire deck of brig miss trevor be still in cabin take a see on deck have have most trying exhausting experience hope sir will afford comfort at command otherwise may suffer serious breakdown fortunately be not without fund can make quite worth while to treat well during short time that hope will only elapse ere have opportunity to trans ship be miss trevor relation of yours asked potter tone once more assuming suggestion of aggressiveness be not sir answered leslie showing surprise at question be simply fellow passenger of mine on board golden fleece be by merest accident that became companion after ship went down have particular object in making inquiry may ask answered potter just thought might be related to in way seem to be pretty anxious about welfare be very naturally think taking into consideration fact have most assuredly saved life retorted leslie having done so much feel incumbent upon to take under care protection until can find mean of putting into way of returning to england of resuming voyage to australia whichever may prefer very kind disinterested of be sure remarked potter sneeringly if be relation of yours there be call for to worry more about be aboard ship now will look after in future do may be necessary a for will trans ship first chance get never fear fellow tone be so gratuitously offensive that leslie determined to come to understanding with at once captain potter said turning sharply upon man manner lead to fear that presence of miss trevor on board ship be disagreeable inconvenient perhaps to if so can only say on behalf of young lady that be very sorry although sorrow be not nearly profound enough to drive over side again will remain aboard here until something else come along to relieve of unwelcome presence then will go let craft be what will bound where may meanwhile so long a be with will pay two pound day for board accommodation think ought to compensate adequately for inconvenience annoyance that may cause miss trevor will continue to be under care make mistake about that offer of two pound per diem for board lodging of two people produced immediate soothing mollifying effect upon skipper curious temper made obvious effort to infuse rather truculent looking feature with amiable expression replied in tone of somewhat forced geniality oh right mister be not going to quarrel with lady be quite welcome aboard here will do what can to make comfortable though with limited accommodation quite see just at minute how be going to be done lady can have cabin will take purchas purchas turning to mate can have steward berth will have to go into fo cbe'le can be managed easy enough question be where be going to put mister leslie quickly interjected individual addressed who be already beginning to feel very tired of being called simply mister mr leslie thank ejaculated skipper giving leslie name for first time in sheer confusion astonishment at being so promptly pulled up a be saying question be where can put have spare berth in ship pray distress about exclaimed leslie place will do for be sailor by profession have roughed before to day weather be quite warm can therefore turn in upon cabin locker at night if can think of better place in to stow oh cabin locker be began potter then pulled up short resumed must think of sleeping on locker be hard uncomfortable 'd never be able to get bit of real rest on to say nothing of purchas coming in off on during night to look at clock barometer what not disturbing besides 'd be in way there wo do wo do at will be shot if can see way out of to make up shakedown in longboat be got nothing in except own gear can clear out jolly boat be turned over on top of making capital roof to house so that will sleep dry comfortable why will make first rate cabin for ye will have to yourself there be board on top of galley that can lay fore aft on boat thwart there be plenty of sail in sail locker to make ye bed why exclaimed in admiration of own ingenuity when be done will have most comfortable cabin in ship dashed if must take if be for look must have with men argument apply to mister leslie cut in latter once more detecting a believed attempt on part of skipper to revert to original objectionable style of address yes leslie thanks think have got hang of name now returned potter a be saying that argument apply to seein ' that men know how short of accommodation be aft now how d think longboat arrangement will suit ye oh have doubt will do well enough answered although for reason that must not quite explain to felt that must rather have be berthed below a say will at least have place to myself can turn in turn out when like will disturb nobody will anybody disturb yes arrangement will do quite well many thanks to for making well that be settled then agreed skipper in tone of considerable satisfaction mr purchas continued let of hand turn to at once to get plank off top of galley into longboat while others rouse few of oldest softest of sail out of locker to make mr mr leslie good comfortable bed with regard to payment continued turning rather shamefacedly to leslie business be business if mind will have matter down on paper in black white if be poor folk now ordinary sailor man explained must charge of ye penny piece be easy to see that be nob navy man regular brass bounder if be not mistaken a such can well afford while a for lady anybody with eye can see that be regular tip topper thoroughbred so can afford too while be poor man be likely to be to end of day quite so assented leslie there be not least need for explanation apology assure miss trevor will willingly be indebted to for smallest thing will be upon term have suggested will feel perfectly easy in mind upon score knowing a well a do that will be paying most handsomely for best that can possibly give now at last hope very clearly understand other so saying turned away walking forward to where purchas be superintending removal of plank referred to by skipper asked mate if must oblige with loan of pipe gift of little tobacco of course can answered purchas cordially at least can give ye pipe of sort clay buy about six shillin worth time start upon voyage get 'em at shop in commercial road at rate of fifteen for shillin ' find pay lot better than buyin ' four briar at one six apiece for see when have lost smashed four briar why be done for when have lost smashed four clay find that last abeost a long a briar why have still good stock of pipe to fall back upon if clay be good enough for ye ye be welcome to one dozen if ye like oh thanks laughed leslie one will be sufficient until have lost broken then maybe will trespass upon generosity to extent of begging right be said mate cordially will slip down below fetch ye one cake o ' baccy will not be gone moment away man went eager a most british sailor be to do kindness to fellow sailor in distress speedily returned with new short clay cake of tobacco handed to leslie with remark that knew what be to be without pipe tobacco must therefore sympathise with leslie be soon deep in enjoyment of first smoke that have have for eighteen hour while be still at saw miss trevor emerge from companion gaze somewhat anxiously about a stepped out on deck potter who have be leaning moodily over quarter deck rail puffing away at strong cigar sprang upright advanced eagerly toward with one hand held out cap in other returned somewhat grotesque bow with cold stateliness for leslie felt that must have hugged then seeing that man must not be denied allowed hand to rest in for just barest fraction of second a leslie approached heard potter anxiously inquiring after welfare doing honour of ship generally with ludicrous affectation of manner amused greatly even brought ghost of smile to face of girl leslie made polite inquiry demanded by occasion learning in return that miss trevor felt very much better for long rest then turned to skipper said before going below mentioned to mate that wreckage apparently from golden fleece be floating at great distance left message with for suggesting that must run down examine upon off chance that there might be people clinging to did do so did not sir answered potter 'd have know in first place mister leslie if be name that be cap'n aboard own ship take order from nobody owner in next place took good look at wreckage through glass saw that there be nobody on so see there be use in running brig away off course good fellow remonstrated leslie now look here broke in potter try to come officer over dictate to what will do what sha do because wo have satisfied that there be nobody upon wreckage be enough presume have objection to satisfying also that there be nobody upon returned leslie keeping temper admirably in face of other offensive manner if will kindly lend ship glass will go up into main top have look for so trust eh sneered potter well will just have to whether like not refuse to let use ship glass forbid to touch be only glass aboard be not going to risk loss of by trusting to man who may clumsily drop overboard for aught can tell very well said leslie if choose to be uncivil offensive can not help at event will take look for myself so saying sprang into main rigging danced up ratline at pace made shellbacks on deck stare in wonderment come down out of rigging d 'ye hear roared potter come down say how dare take such liberty aboard ship d hear what say a leslie grasped futtock shroud lightly drew over rim of top if come down at once will send couple of hand aloft to fetch ye taking not slightest notice of man raving leslie stood lightly grasping topmast rigging in one hand while shaded eye with other gazing intently away to westward meanwhile at first must see nothing presently being remarkably keen of sight caught what be looking for three mile away at distance be of course quite impossible to discern detail with unaided eye a gazed impression grew upon of something moving there suggestion conveyed be that of fluttering waving movement a though one be endeavouring to attract attention of on board brig longer gazed stronger grew conviction that there really be living thing upon floating mass of wreckage stared at until eye ached finally hailed on deck there be almost certain that be mistaken in supposition that there be one on wreckage can not of course be absolutely sure without glass with there must be possibility of mistake captain potter appeal to a one sailor to appeal to humanity send up glass may set question at rest surely must not willingly knowingly leave fellow creature to perish miserably rather than take trouble to investigate will come down out of wo demanded potter angrily then seeing that leslie be again gazing eagerly out across glassy surface of water skipper shouted bill tom up with into main top fetch that man down if wo come peaceably heave down be cap'n of ship mean to allow anybody aboard to disobey order now hurry swab skulking will freshen way for with end of fore brace threateningly threw coil of stout rope off belaying pin by way of hastening movement of two men looking down on deck leslie saw seaman spring with alacrity into main rigging then continue ascent with exaggerated deliberateness mumbling to other meanwhile a did so saw miss trevor step quickly to potter side lay hand upon arm a spoke to pleadingly if might judge by whole attitude low toned accent of voice saw potter seize hand tuck under arm patting caressingly for instant ere snatched away indignantly walked from to other side of deck then head of two men bill tom showed over rim of top better come down sir said one of skipper have got very queer temper a may see sir if come will lay blame on to will think nothin ' of takin ' out of with rope end come up here into top of commanded leslie never trouble about skipper temper believe there be one alive on wreckage away yonder will be glad to have opinion upon matter now a joined in top there be wreckage about two point on starboard quarter do see ay ay sir see plain enough answered man named bill while companion tom replied yes can see something afloat out there certingly must like to take upon to say what be very well said leslie turning to bill appear to have tolerably good eye main top there interrupted potter be coming down out of be if be not say word will come up start lot of for lord sake sir go down beg ye there will be something like murder up here in brace of shake if skipper keep word exclaimed tom in accent of consternation leave skipper to will undertake to keep in order if be ill advised enough to come up here now resumed turning again to bill seem to have reasonably good eye look carefully at wreckage tell whether can see anything having appearance of man waving shirt something of kind man looked long intently gazing out under sharp of hand presently turned to leslie said upon word sir do believe be right there do seem to be something wavin ' over there sharp crack of pistol whistle of ballet close past interrupted man speech looking down saw potter standing aft near lashed wheel with smoking revolver in hand still pointed threateningly at top two men without word flung simultaneously over edge of top made way precipitately down rigging while leslie swinging on to topmast backstay slid lightly down reaching deck second ahead of alighted close alongside miss trevor who with hand clutched tightly together stood image of terror gazing with horrified eye at skipper in two bound leslie reached potter side scoundrel infernal scoundrel exclaimed a with one hand wrenched away revolver while with other seized fellow by throat shook savagely what do mean by such infamous conduct do realise that might have killed one of have gone mad what be matter with answer quick will choke life out of with final shake went near to dislocating potter neck leslie flung fellow furiously from dashing against rail with such violence that after staggering stupidly for moment sank to deck sitting there in dazed condition mate three four of crew came running aft at juncture with indefinite idea of interfering then paused gazing uncertainly from one to other evidently undecided a to what action if ought to take looked at mate mate looked at leslie have better take below let lie down for while mr purchas said leslie assuming quite naturally direction of affair when have done so continued will be obliged if will kindly afford opportunity for few minute conversation all right answered mate will yes will be best let take below into cabin lay hold here bill give hand to get skipper down companion ladder with difficulty got potter below into mate cabin where laid in bunk making a comfortable a must left to recover scattered faculty meanwhile leslie catching sight of ship telescope hanging in becket in companion way took possession of slipping revolver into jacket pocket again ascended to main top from elevation with aid of telescope quickly satisfied that there certainly be at least one living person clinging to wreckage intermittently waving what looked like strip of canvas with evident design of attracting brig attention by time that have assured of fact purchas have returned to deck seeing leslie beckoned up into top look here purchas said a mate scrambled over rim stood beside be right in surmise there be living person person on wreckage take glass satisfy of truth of statement mate took glass presently removing instrument from eye turned to leslie be right mr leslie said there be somebody there can see wavin ' something now question be what be to be done sun pretty near settin ' will be dark in hour thereabouts more need that must arrive at prompt decision interrupted leslie now if may advise what must suggest be let have quarter boat four hand will go down to wreck bring off anybody who may be upon if fall dark before return hoist lantern to peak a guide to will then have difficulty in finding brig mate considered for moment then all right said will take upon responsibility of agreein ' to that skipper will be madder than ever when find out what have done care for be not goin ' to leave feller creature to die on wreckage if can help if skipper make fuss about authority at home will bear out of course will assented leslie now that have settled point sooner start be made better so please call for four volunteer to go with in boat will be off then while purchas went forward to muster boat crew leslie walked over to where miss trevor stood oh mr leslie exclaimed what dreadful man captain of ship be be mad what be make behave in so horribly violent manner simply overweening conceit of enormously exaggerated opinion of own importance a master of ridiculous little brig together with perhaps unusually violent ungovernable temper imagine answered leslie with smile be afraid continued that mad antic of with revolver must have be rather terrifying to however that sort of thing will not occur again unless happens to have of for have weapon now intend to retain possession of until be able to take leave of hope will be ere long meanwhile be going away in boat for about hour to take man may be woman off wreckage that be trying to reach morning when sighted brig be still quite close at hand will not be gone very long during absence purchas will look after see that come to harm be good fellow in way will not allow mad friend to interfere with thank answered with shade of old hauteur in tone of voice be not in least afraid mad though man may be think will attempt to molest acknowledged leslie who have not failed to observe potter undisguised admiration of girl to be perfectly frank with think will ah here come men who be going with in boat must say au revoir good bye for present answered miss trevor hope will be successful now then lad said leslie a men came aft began to cast off gripe have time to lose sun will set in ten minute then will very soon be dark must look lively will not reach wreckage without having troublesome search for ah be all right a stood on rail looked into boat see that gear be in that have kept tight by leaving water in may a well get rid of water before lower so saying stepped into little craft pulling out plug allowed water to run off be ready for lowerin ' sir sang out one of men presently then lower at once answered leslie a pushed back plug into place then jump down into a quickly a like in moment boat squelched gently into water men tumbled over brig low side into unhooked tackle block man who be going to pull bow oar raised in hand with bore boat bow off ship side other three men threw out oar leslie cry give way men a grasped yoke line little craft started on errand of mercy heading straight for wreckage bearing of in relation to fast setting sun leslie have very carefully taken just before boat be lowered be at moment absolutely flat calm there be not faintest breath of air stirring anywhere in great dome of cloudless sky overarched brig swell have subsided until be scarcely perceptible whole surface of sea gleamed like polished mirror faithfully reflecting rich blue of sky to eastward against commonplace little brig illumined by brilliant ruddy orange light of setting sun glowed like gem of exquisite beauty while away to westward repeated with equal fidelity burning glory of dying day sun be just vanishing beneath horizon when leslie caught first glimpse of raft from stern sheet of boat in stood instead of sitting in order that might extend horizon a much a possible for next five minute be able to steer by glow of sunset in sky by end of time glow have faded to tender grey night descended upon almost with rapidity of falling curtain western sky no longer afforded beacon to steer by leslie found obliged to turn round steer backwards a be by brig in fast gathering gloom soon became too indefinite object to be reliable leslie be therefore obliged to face about once more select star for guidance men have be pulling with will for full half hour when suddenly man who be wielding bow oar arrested movement holding dripping blade just clear of surface of water a cried hark did ye hear that sir what demanded leslie other three men suspended effort a first man replied why thought heard somebody singin ' out somewhere ay be right continued a faint hillo came pealing softly across darkling surface of water hillo answered leslie sending stentorian shout ahead through hollow hand boat ahoy came answering shout give way briskly men cried leslie sound seems to be coming from straight ahead will get sight of something now in few minute men resumed pulling with will encouraged by fact that shout kept up by unseen man be rapidly becoming clearer more audible evidently nearer suddenly dark mass loomed up ahead cry told that be close aboard wreckage oar commanded leslie men ceased pulling individual upon wreckage shouted boat ahoy will have to pull right round raffle come up on t'other side afore will be able to take off ca get alongside of from where be there be too much yard arm splintered spar stickin ' out in direction dare jump overboard swim to for have be blockaded day by shark see there be one of now close alongside of ye looking over side crew of boat beheld revealed a shape of fire in highly phosphorescent sea monster of fully twenty foot in length more swimming rapidly along few foot below surface while dozen yard away second suddenly revealed presence right answered leslie stay where be will pull round to other side so said so done five minute later have got man only occupant of wreckage a proved safe aboard boat be pulling back towards brig now barely discernible a small faint indistinct dark blot against blue black star spangled sky with anchor light hoisted to gaff end a guide to returning rescue party rescued man proved to be a leslie have already guessed from fellow manner of speech one of foremast hand of golden fleece like leslie have be dragged under when ship went down in downward journey have encountered what proved to be loose cork fender to have clung desperately buoyancy of fender be sufficient to immediately check descent into depth ultimately to take back to surface where found close alongside mass of top hamper consisting of ship fore topmast with attached that have torn adrift from wreck when went down to have at once swam taken refuge upon told pathetic tale of despair have seized when at dawn have found sole survivor a supposed of catastrophe of alternation of hope despair have be throughout day when brig appeared in sight drifted up to within three short mile of there lay becalmed most distressing part of experience perhaps consisted in fact that although excellent swimmer quite capable of covering distance between brig have found beset by school of shark therefore dared not forsake refuge of wreckage take to water upon return of boat to brig leslie learned from mate that potter be still in bunk that dazed feeling resulting from blow that have sustained when thrown against rail still seemed to be a acute a ever purchas indeed seemed to be growing rather anxious about eagerly inquired of leslie whether latter happened to know anything about medicine a thought time have arrived when something ought to be done to help man back to sens medicine however be branch of science about leslie happened to know little nothing readily acceded to purchas suggestion that must have look at patient accordingly although by time substantial meal be set out upon brig cabin table ex lieutenant felt quite prepared to do ample justice to forthwith descended to cabin in skipper be lying having knocked at door without getting reply entered be same cabin in have enjoyed hour of sleep after long spell in water potter be lying stretched at full length upon bunk that have previously occupied small oil lamp screwed to bulkhead afforded fairly good light by aid of leslie saw that man be lying with eye wide open eyeball turned slightly upward apparently staring at deck above gaze be without intelligence fellow appeared to be quite unconscious of surroundings for took notice whatever of leslie entrance did eye waver in least when latter spoke to leslie laid hand upon forehead of late antagonist found cool to touch although clammy with perspiration then laid finger upon man wrist felt for pulse appeared to be normal beyond dazed condition man exhibited there did not appear to be much matter with when at length leslie left entered main cabin at table of found purchas miss trevor seated discussing viand before said a much adding opinion that condition in found skipper must probably end in sleep that man must doubt be right in morning conversation then turned to other matter mate remarking that supposed skipper indisposition meant night job on deck for mate whereupon leslie expressed readiness to take charge of watch until potter must be able to resume duty offer purchas gladly accepted be arranged that a preceding night have be very trying one for leslie must take middle watch accordingly when meal be over a miss trevor pleading fatigue retired to cabin that potter have given up to leslie sought seclusion of quarter in longboat have be made ready for be soon wrapped in sound dreamless sleep be called at midnight by purchas who reported to with uneasiness that there be change in skipper condition night be still beautifully fine weather flat calm there be therefore nothing calling for leslie immediate attention readily assented to purchas urgent solicitation that must take look at patient say what thought of condition upon descending to stuffy little cabin found that a mate have reported there be marked change in potter condition still lay a before without movement unseeing eye upturned apparently quite unconscious of presence of two men who bent over only difference noticeable to leslie be that man breathing seemed to be somewhat stertorous well what d 'ye think of anxiously demanded purchas when at length leslie raised from examination to be quite candid with purchas answered leslie scarcely know what to think be afraid man condition be somewhat more serious than thought to be when last visited must confess that like long spell of wakefulness combined with unconsciousness of surroundings what be actually wrong be sorry can not say symptom appear to to point to injury of brain have medicine chest on board suppose oh yes answered purchas be in skipper cabin um remarked leslie be awkward can not very well gain access to just now without disturbing miss trevor think that case be urgent enough to demand that must do to morrow morning a soon a young lady be out of cabin will get medicine chest overhaul book of direction have doubt will find in perhaps will discover description of symptom somewhat similar to exhibited by skipper if so will try remedy recommended now must advise to turn in worry about skipper for have doubt that will be able to pull round right perhaps will be lesson to to keep temper under somewhat better control well be sure hope will answered purchas if doe that sha be sorry that have happened for can tell mr leslie when old man get back up a did afternoon thing grow pretty excitin ' aboard hooker well good night if anything happens atween eight bell might give call not what expect be far better sailor man than what be oh be right laughed leslie think may trust to take care of three decker of yours if anything happens find at loss will not fail to call good night so saying leslie left cabin making way up on deck took sailor like look at brilliantly star lit sky stretched cloudless round brig from zenith to horizon a thoughtfully filled lit pipe to tell truth be le easy in mind touching potter condition than have allowed purchas to see that man be something more than merely stunned be now undeniable although injury might not in be serious complete ignorance of purchas in relation to medical surgical matter might possibly lead to wrong treatment that in turn might result in complication ending who must say where of course man have only to thank for conduct have be provocative to last degree yet leslie have be animated by vindictive feeling when have attacked man still le have intended to inflict serious injury upon have indeed acted solely in self defence in taking fellow revolver away from a to violence have accompanied act well considered perfectly excusable under circumstance so believed must unprejudiced person nevertheless regretted incident must much rather that have not happened while dismissing subject from mind for moment resolved that henceforth must keep much better in hand in dealing with man calm continued throughout leslie watch when at eight bell turned over charge of deck to purchas brig save for occasional lazy almost imperceptible heave on now invisible swell be a motionless a house when however purchas called at seven bell thus allowing time to wash dress in readiness for breakfast at eight o'clock leslie found upon turning out that while morning be a gloriously fine a preceding night have be brilliant blue of sky overhead be streaked here there with light touch of cirrus cloud forerunner of breeze be already wrinkling surface of azure sea causing to sparkle a though strewed with diamond dust in wake of sun while just filled brig sail sufficiently to keep asleep give old tub steerage way watch be just finishing off task of washing deck men going over streaming plank with swab squeegee to remove superfluous water while purchas sitting on stern grating be drying bare foot with towel preparatory to drawing on sock shoe miss trevor be not visible mate having bade leslie good morning proceeded to inform that breeze be breathing out from eastward have come up with sun that hoped must freshen a day grew older winding up with earnest aspiration that must last long enough to run into trade then having donned foot covering drew leslie aside out of hearing of helmsman to impart information that having visited old man cabin hour previously have found better that be beginning to feel downright anxious about hearing leslie proposed that must go down together to investigate potter condition purchas eagerly acquiescing presently found once more bending over sick man a mate have said there be perceptible change in skipper appearance save a leslie thought breathing be trifle more stertorous be lying in precisely same attitude that have assumed when first placed in bunk indeed two men agreed that so far a must see have not moved limb from moment while stood there together discussing man disconcerting condition faint rustling a of garment outside cabin door accompanied by light footstep upon companion ladder apprised of fact that miss trevor be moving have gone on deck whereupon leslie went out followed found standing just to windward of companion gazing with visible delight at brilliant sparkling scene around have evidently rested well for looked a fresh wholesome a morning although costume be somewhat shrunken showed here there patch of whitish discolouration from long immersion in sea still presented picture of grace calculated to charm most fastidious eye lifting cap leslie stepped forward greeted bidding good morning remarking that hoped have slept a well a appearance seemed to suggest to replied laughingly that have that hoped must return compliment oh yes answered leslie have slept admirably thanks have have eight hour in four hour four hour of middle watch on deck having undertaken to stand watch watch with purchas during skipper indisposition mention of brings to point of asking miss trevor whether will permit to enter cabin for purpose of removing medicine chest understand from mate be there yes certainly assented girl may enter at once if wish leslie have tidied up morning intend to do so regularly in future will provide with something to do spoke of captain potter indisposition be unwell then why yes said leslie appears to be fact be that have not yet recovered from blow that received yesterday evening when forced upon disagreeable necessity to disarm have lain unconscious whole night through without moving so much a muscle so far a one can see to tell whole truth purchas be beginning to feel more than trifle uneasy about hence request for permission to have access to medicine chest oh dear be so sorry exclaimed girl note of concern at once entering voice pray go at once mr leslie beg do may deem necessary hope will not prove that captain be seriously injured will be so so very embarrassing for well answered leslie of course must be very sorry if a say anything serious be to happen even so man will only have to thank for with attempt to justify raised cap again vanished down companion way a footstep sounded on companion ladder purchas emerged from cabin occupied by potter joined chapter four death of skipper well mr leslie inquired mate be there chance of coming at medicine chest to speak plainly half like look of skipper be fact ai natural for man to lie like hour a'ter hour without movin ' sooner can bring back to sens better will be pleased yes answered leslie quite understand how feel about matter feel quite a anxious a do about more so possibly since be who be responsible for man condition will be bitterly grieved if prof to be seriously injured in case hope will understand that be impossible for to allow to retain possession of revolver have clearly conceived extraordinary aversion for exhibited without restraint believe that when fired at fully intended to kill if must be compelled to act in self defence if man allows temper to get better of to extent must take consequence here be a threw open door of miss trevor cabin that take be medicine chest pointing to fairly large chest standing against bulkhead yes assented purchas be chest better have out of into main cabin have then sha be obliged to disturb lady whenever want to get at certainly agreed leslie be about to suggest therewith two men seized of handle carried box into main cabin placing conveniently for pushing under table out of way when not required chest be unlocked threw open disclosing interior fitted with tray on top contained long tin tubular case labelled diachylon plaster surgical scissors surgical needle roll of bandage numerous other surgical instrument appliance while underneath tray body of chest be full of jar bottle containing drug distinctly labelled fitted into own special compartment there be also in chest book setting forth in detail symptom of nearly imaginable disease with appropriate treatment also proper course to pursue in event of injury book be furnished with very complete index to facilitate prompt reference book took out laid open upon cabin table now spread with breakfast equipage anxiously pored over page finding more than one reference seemed fairly to fit case at length leslie to whose judgment mate seemed disposed to defer decided upon treatment proceeded forthwith to act upon consisted in administration of draught application of blister owing to absolute insensibility of skipper consequent powerlessness to assist in way be somewhat lengthy job completed at last then went to breakfast a be not expected that visible result of treatment must become apparent for first hour so did not visit skipper at conclusion of meal purchas went to cabin turned in leaving leslie in charge of deck latter undertaking to call mate at seven bell in time to take meridian altitude of sun at noon for determination of brig latitude during time that leslie have be occupied below have be conscious of fact that breeze be freshening a be evidenced by increasing heel of brig growing liveliness of movement when at length went on deck relieved carpenter who have be temporarily in charge found quite smart breeze blowing from about due east brig with weather brace slightly checked everything set to royal staggering along with great deal of fuss much churning up of water about bluff bow at speed of six knot glanced aloft saw that topgallant mast be whipping buckling like fishing rod hillo chip said good humouredly so be one of carrying on school see what about stick aloft be trying rather severely of course ought to know condition better than do look to a though be giving rather more than ought to be asked to do oh be goodish stick sir be topgallant mast skipper rare hand for carryin ' on ai no clipper a dare say have noticed sir cap'n make p'int of gettin ' inch out of a be capable of doin ' of same sir believe be about time royal be took in so do agreed leslie a somewhat fresher puff took brig caused spar to buckle still more ominously royal halliard let go clew up furl shouted to men who be lounging on forecastle over task that be performing in leisurely manner usual with merchant seaman carpenter sprang to main royal halliard let run man forward dropped serving mallet that be using did same with fore royal halliard while two other hand started sheet began to drag upon clewlines third shambled aft helped carpenter to clew up main royal relieved brig trifle there be hard look about sky to windward promised still more wind so leslie said breeze be coming still stronger before long chip have therefore better make one job of take in topgallantsails a well when be done if men be not better engaged let get to work set up topgallant royal rigging fore aft be shockingly slack hanging fairly in bight in fact be affording practically support to spar ay ay sir answered carpenter who be acting also a boatswain have have eye on riggin ' for last day two want settin ' up badly will attend to at once men have got canvas clewed up be aloft furling when miss trevor emerged through companion way leslie with word of greeting hastened to arrange deck chair for accommodation on lee side of deck within shadow of main trysail for although there be slight veil of thin streaky cloud overspreading sky sun shone through with ardour made shelter of sort from very acceptable especially to girl who might be supposed to set value upon complexion accepted leslie attention with brief word two of thanks uttered in tone suggested inclination to revert to former unapproachable attitude ex lieutenant at once left to herself passing over to weather side of deck devoting strictly to duty a officer of watch at seven bell called purchas who presently made appearance on deck with old fashioned quadrant in hand looked aloft then to windward noted change leslie have affected graciously expressed approval of then said s'pose mr leslie be first class navigator know about shootin ' sun naturally do answered leslie navigation be of course essential part of education training of naval officer learned in line that thought necessary to teach good many year ago ay so supposed returned purchas a for have learned what be required to enable to get certificate after really understand properly can take sun at noon of course work out ship latitood even at have got very great faith in myself a to longitood well there always feel may be right may be wrong never be much of hand at figure so if have objection 'd take very kind of if 'd lend hand at job while skipper on beam end be got real dandy sextant in cabin that will take upon to let have use of chronometer in there too might a well have thing out of there too then sha have to disturb young lady time want leslie quite agreed a to desirability of also cheerfully undertook to check assist purchas in navigation latter therefore went below to make necessary transfer presently returned to deck carrying potter sextant very handsome valuable instrument in hand handed to leslie a time be now drawing well on towards noon two men betook to forecastle sun being over jib boom end proceeded to take meridian altitude of luminary done eight bell be struck watch called leslie mate returned aft to work out calculation a result there proved to be difference of two mile between nothing very serious enough to prove purchas doubt of be fully justified upon being called by leslie mate have looked in upon potter for moment on way up on deck have failed to discover improvement in condition now suggested that must go below subject patient to closer examination did a purchas have already remarked there be apparent improvement in potter condition on contrary when leslie felt pulse seemed to that be weaker however might be accounted for by fact that man have taken no nourishment from moment that have sustained injury owing to absolute helplessness seemed impossible to administer to further study of book of direction accompanying medicine chest however instructed how to overcome difficulty summoning steward mate forthwith gave instruction to kill chicken have broth prepared a quickly a possible meanwhile blister be snipped dressed dose of medicine administered with considerable difficulty man be once more left to self constituted physician having then done for moment be possible wish something big must come along man o war for instance observed leslie a mate left cabin together must then signal for medical assistance properly qualified doctor must soon say precisely what be wrong what must be proper treatment to adopt if case be really serious a to be frank with purchas be beginning to fear be might even trans ship thus give best chance possible for life of course in such event must fully report circumstance of case must accompany man to other ship to take responsibility for might happen miss trevor must go with since of course now wish to return home failing opportunity to continue voyage to australia india a soon a possible what do think of plan why answered purchas seems good enough plan so far a go if there ship that be talkin ' about must spare navigator to help take brig to valparaiso why 'd be perfectly satisfied there seem to be much chance of fallin ' in with nothin have spoke single craft of sort side of finisterre greater likelihood of doing so soon remarked leslie may be quite worth while to keep especially bright look out with view to intercepting of anything may happen to heave in sight on board small craft of mermaid type be usual to have dinner served in cabin at midday accordingly steward having already announced that meal be on table summoned miss trevor leslie purchas entered cabin proceeded to dine be be afternoon watch below eight hour out that night so decided to lie down on cabin locker get hour two sleep after have smoked pipe on deck before doing so however went forward to galley to inquire how chicken broth be progressing finding that be ready took aft on way below requested purchas to accompany assist to administer two men entered cabin together stepped to side of bunk figure of potter still lay exactly a have left a leslie stood for moment gazing gradually became aware that subtle change in man appearance have taken place through swarthy tint of sunburnt complexion ashen grey hue seemed to have spread bent closer laid hand upon wrist feeling for pulse there be beat perceptible moistened back of hand laid close to lip waiting anxiously to feel breath playing upon moistened skin must detect nothing then laid hand upon man chest over heart chest have ceased to heave there be not faintest throb of heart so far a must feel finally snatched small mirror from nail on be hanging laid gently face downward on potter mouth left there for fully two minute when at length lifted again surface be still bright undimmed a before carefully hung mirror upon nail again turning to mate said mr purchas regret to inform that captain potter be dead dead ejaculated purchas no ca be there must be mistake very greatly fear that there be mistake about returned leslie have seen death in time too often not to recognise will observe breathing have ceased neither can find trace of pulse slightest flutter of heart beat symptom be believe quite consistent with state of trance remembering that must of course be careful to hing precipitately be convinced that man be really dead very short time will suffice in climate to demonstrate whether not be case must advise to give immediate instruction to have necessary preparation made for burial must surmise prove correct be now master of brig a such will of course adopt such measure with regard to a immediate cause of misfortune a may deem fit there be necessity to put in iron can not very well escape put in iron ejaculated purchas must think not mr leslie have intention of killin ' skipper will swear to that be accident neither more le how be to know that great strong man like be be goin ' to stagger back hit head again ' rail same a did provoked hand will bear witness to that shot at ye be quite justified in takin ' revolver away from oh there will be puttin ' of in iron so long a be skipper o ' brig of course will have to make hentry of whole affair in official log book now will have to go on with brig to valparaiso whether to hear what british consul there have got to say about certainly assented leslie will make difficulty about have not very much fear a to result a to miss trevor hope will seize first suitable opportunity occurs to trans ship poor girl will now be more anxious than ever to get away from vessel yes yes of course will agreed purchas suppose mr leslie continued wo have objection to continue lending hand to work navigate brig now that skipper gone will need help more 'n ever may rely upon mr purchas to do everything in power to help answered leslie now continued while be making arrangement of just now spoke will go on deck make miss trevor acquainted with news of misfortune miss trevor received news of potter demise with few expression of well bred regret did not appear to be very greatly concerned at event must scarcely be otherwise in first place have only be in man company very few hour although have certainly picked leslie up thus saving in probability from lingering painful death must scarcely have acted otherwise seeing that have nothing to do give order for few rope end to be dropped over side to then although have given sign of manner toward have be such a to fill with vague fear while behaviour toward leslie when individual have unavailingly attempted to convince of presence of survivor upon floating wreckage be scarcely of kind to inspire woman with confidence respect by eight bell in afternoon watch there be longer room for doubt that potter be really dead being case purchas very wisely decided to bury body at once get rid of at summons therefore carpenter man came aft with square of canvas palm needle twine to sew up body short length of rusty chain routed out from fore peak wherewith to sink meanwhile brig ensign be hoisted half mast high men be ordered to clean in readiness for funeral work being knocked off for remainder of day upon being apprised of what be about to take place miss trevor retired to cabin process of sewing up body preparing for burial occupied about hour by time men be ready meanwhile leslie have be coaching purchas who frankly confessed ignorance a to part be to perform being of course duty a master of ship to read burial service carpenter having reported that body be ready two more men came aft bearing with grating laid down on deck alongside companion then descended to berth wherein dead man lay assisted by carpenter man who have helped to sew up body in canvas shroud carried corpse with difficulty owing to weight cramped dimension of berth companion way up on deck where be laid upon grating spare ensign spread over a pall then four men raised grating burden to shoulder with purchas in front reading burial service leslie following behind of course uncovered little procession moved slowly along deck to lee gangway where rest of crew also uncovered awaited arrived at gangway grating be laid upon rail with foot of body pointing outboard carpenter assistant supporting inner end of grating shorn though ceremony necessarily be of most of solemn formalism characterises interment ashore further marred in effectiveness by droning tone in purchas deemed proper to read beautiful solemn word of prescribed ritual be nevertheless profoundly impressive peculiar circumstance of case setting of picture so to speak small brig out there alone upon boundless world of water little group of weather beaten bare headed men surrounding stark silent figure upon grating who few brief hour before have be head chief of small community man to whose knowledge skill have willingly committed fortune who have ruled a with rod of iron whose will be law who have held very life in hand at whose caprice be either happy miserable who now lay there without power to move so much a finger to help hurt whose lifeless clay be about to launch to last resting place there to repose till sea give up dead with wailing moan of wind aloft sobbing of water alongside solemn glory of dying day uniting to imbue scene occasion with profundity of sadness sublimity must have be impossible under other circumstance so deeply be leslie moved by for first time since word of cruel unjust sentence have fallen upon ear once more felt to conviction that god creator god ordainer god father be must be ever living omnipotent entity for first time also since then followed prayer purchas droned out with earnest heartfelt sincerity at felt vaguely astonished at length mate reached word in service therefore commit body to deep whereupon two men who supported inner end of grating tilted high heavily weighted body sliding out from beneath outspread ensign plunged with sullen splash into lonely grave remainder of service be quickly gone through a little party of mourner rose from knee with pronouncement of last amen sun disc vanished in blaze of indescribable glory beneath horizon while at same moment four bell pealed out along brig deck go for'ard men ordered purchas replacing cap upon head see that gratin ' be stowed away again in proper place haul down ensign one of whose trick at wheel be for next three four day nothing worthy of mention occurred on board brig save that breeze have sprung up on morning of day of potter death held good ran fairly into trade next vision of mermaid therefore show bruising along under plain sail including fore main royal together with port topgallant topmast studding sail on main topmast lower studding sail on foremast rigging having in interim be properly set up so that brig must carry amount of canvas without jeopardy to spar death burial of late skipper have permitted of certain modification of arrangement aft thus while miss trevor be by purchas natural courtesy allowed to retain possession of late potter cabin a best most commodious berth in brig purchas have transferred chronometer chart other paraphernalia appertaining to navigation of brig to own cabin once more occupied leslie moving from longboat into steward cabin now vacated by purchas with permission of latter also leslie have appropriated to own use potter somewhat extensive kit two men being much of size although potter have be of considerably stouter build of course conduced greatly to leslie comfort a afforded among other advantage much needed change of linen although ex lieutenant did not assume possession of article without certain inward qualm under circumstance be not to be wondered at then presently transpired that potter who have possessed shrewd eye for money making speculation have before leaving london invested considerable sum in article of various kind that knew from experience must be able to dispose of at huge profit upon arrival at valparaiso among there happened to be capacious case of lady clothing case leslie also commandeered giving to purchas in exchange signed agreement to pay to potter heir executor assigns if such must be found upon return to england full value of good a well a of clothing that leslie have appropriated to own use case of clothing together with other good included in speculation be a purchas happened to know stowed in after hold on top of cargo leslie therefore lost time in having hatch lifted case hoisted on deck opened then summoned miss trevor upon scene invited to overhaul case help freely to whole such part of content a might find of service to with result that lady soon found in possession of ample if somewhat showy wardrobe to infinite comfort contentment during whole of time may be remarked not single sail of description have be sighted although leslie keenly anxious to meet wish of miss trevor in matter of trans shipment have caused bright look out for ship to be maintained throughout day night week maybe rather more than have elapsed since potter death when leslie discovered what appeared to fresh cause for apprehension of future trouble be purchas who time gave rise to apprehension fellow have from moment when leslie miss trevor first came aboard brig be exceedingly civil obliging to cheerfully doing everything lay in power to make comfortable be true that perhaps in return for have not hesitated to invoke leslie assistance in matter of navigating brig standing watch in fact performing duty of mate under circumstance be perfectly natural quite in accord with leslie own inclination later within few day of potter death indeed leslie thought detected in purchas inclination to shirk of more important duty of ship such a navigation of for instance relegate entirely to even however did not greatly worry leslie in case always took necessary observation for determination of brig latitude longitude independently of purchas whether latter checked observation not be matter of indifference to since have fullest confidence in accuracy of own work confidence indeed purchas appeared to fully share since in event of discrepancy between new skipper always accepted leslie result in preference to own however be not chief cause of leslie disquietude arose from fact that on more than one occasion when have be eight hour out have noticed when calling purchas at midnight that latter breath have smelt strongly of rum that man upon taking deck have appeared to be strongly under influence of drink so markedly indeed be case upon recent occasion that leslie have taxed with look here mr purchas have remarked have be mixing nightcap ' too strong to night be scarcely in fit condition to have charge of brig go below sleep off will take watch for with pleasure oh will purchas have retorted disagreeably le ' tell shir tha ' will hin ' o ' short be qui cap'le lookin ' after thi ' ship other ship that ever be built won ' have other man tryin ' take charac'er away go b'low leave 'lone d 'ye hear seeing at once that man be in much too quarrelsome condition to be satisfactorily reasoned with leslie have at once left gone below only to return however within next ten minute to find purchas stretched at full length upon hencoop fast asleep snoring stertorously on morning following incident leslie finding skipper once more sober a usual under circumstance quite genial friendly tackled again upon subject want to talk to very seriously purchas said a two walked weather side of deck together smoking after breakfast be now skipper of brig know a such be accountable to nobody owner for conduct a have understood to say be first command whether retain not after termination of voyage must necessarily depend to very great extent upon behaviour now insobriety be a need hardly tell one unpardonable sin in eye of shipowner man will knowingly entrust property to care of who even only occasionally permit to take too much liquor because can never know just when overdose may be taken be always ready to believe that may be imbibed at most inopportune moment that master of ship may be under influence at precise instant when safety of ship crew cargo demand utmost vigilance most intelligent resource although may imagine that what do out here in mid ocean can not possibly reach ear of owner must not forget that sailor have keen eye for what go on aft skipper can not get drunk without fact reaching sharp ear of in forecastle be one of easiest thing in world for officer to acquire among crew reputation for insobriety once get ashore may trust to talk about freely very often adding embellishment of own reputation of ship master be in hand of crew if be foolish enough to afford opportunity may be depended upon to ruin for besides want to remember responsibility a master of brig will undertake to look after see that nothing go wrong during time have charge of deck can not always be on deck know if must happen to be intoxicated incapable a be last night while be below what must be result of sudden squall for instance how be craft to be kept clear of possible collision on dark dirty night there be thousand sudden emergency constantly threatening seaman one of may arise at moment notice yes yes answered purchas somewhat impatiently know about have heard thousand time before heard until be sick of there be call to make fuss about own up be just little bit sprung ' last night what of night be fine clear glass be steady there be nothin anywheres within sight of so where be danger there be none a fortunately happened admitted leslie who be to know what will occur within limit of four hour watch suppose for instance have not chanced to notice condition have turned in that while be lying unconscious upon hencoop sudden squall have struck brig what must have happened why craft might have be dismasted even perhaps capsized where must have be in case well ye see war dismasted let alone capsized so there be harm done answered purchas testily same added in more moderate tone be willin ' to admit that there be good deal of reason in argufication so will go slow in future say wo take glass so of grog of evenin if feel to want will take care not to swaller enough of to capsize again must do far better to swear off altogether asserted leslie must be glad afterwards that have done so be excellent seaman will be more than glad to help to perfect in navigation if will allow so that there must be nothing to stand in way of getting master certificate upon return to england with reputation for reliability such a can acquire during voyage there must be nothing to prevent continuing in command of brig even of getting something very much better now think be about time for to get sight for longitude chapter five tragedy narrow escape for next two three day purchas faithfully adhered to promise to refrain from taking enough liquor to capsize when again at midnight on going below to call leslie found fellow so completely intoxicated that be impossible to arouse have perforce to remain on deck whole night through when at length at expiration of morning watch again went below hoping to find that man have at event so far slept off effect of over night debauch a to be capable of coming on deck sobering by taking douche under head pump discovered to intense disgust that glib maker of promise have somehow obtained further supply of rum during night be at moment in more helpless state than ever brig be however by time within day sail of equator where leslie felt tolerably certain that must fall in with one more homeward bound ship so be able to transfer miss trevor to safer more eligible quarter so did not allow incident to worry greatly remained on deck long enough to secure sight for longitude then turning over care of brig to carpenter very steady trustworthy man went below turned in giving order that be to be called at seven bell adding in explanation of purchas non appearance that be not very well seemed that have be asleep few minute when carpenter in pursuance of instruction knocked at cabin door with information seven bell have gone accordingly rose plunged head into basin of cold water within ten minute be once more on deck with potter sextant in hand ready to take sun meridian altitude from to deduce latitude done calculation completed brig position at noon pricked off on chart once more hied to purchas cabin only to find door locked from within for moment felt very strongly inclined to burst way into cabin haul man up on deck drunk sober upon further reflection realised that by adoption of such course must be irretrievably giving man away to crew be eminently undesirable to do so muttering to let brute drink out will perhaps be better afterwards entered main cabin seated at table upon noonday meal be already spread miss trevor be of course only person present with exception of steward who be waiting upon presently girl noticing absence of purchas inquired whether be ill be not very well be sorry to say answered leslie briefly then turned conversation into channel later on when steward have left cabin said to miss trevor be just now inquiring about purchas told that be not very well that reply must now explain to be not strictly accurate gave because steward be present did not wish to state actual fact in presence for have done so be certain that must have carried news forward to men must have be eminently undesirable truth however be that purchas have lately given way to drink be at moment locked in cabin helplessly intoxicated be thousand pity for man have now excellent opportunity of confirming in command of brig so establishing in position of ship master if will make use of that however be affair not ours reason for telling be that if present breeze hold will reach equator by time to morrow at point where may hope to fall in with homeward bound ship indeed may meet with at moment now must therefore advise to pack up belonging forthwith in order that may be ready to be transferred to first suitable craft come along thank very much for telling answered girl will be more than glad for many reason to once more find homeward bound a believe sailor term although thanks to never ceasing kindness consideration have be quite comfortable happy on board vessel will be relief to to leave for memory of terrible man potter oppresses must think that too will be very glad to get away from ship must be fraught for with such unpleasant memory will indeed assented leslie deliverance a suppose know must come later misfortune by became most unwillingly primary cause of potter death render imperative must go on to valparaiso with brig there to surrender to authority answer for action suppose continued in answer to expression of consternation that suddenly leapt into eye that will be very hard upon purchas whole of crew can of course testify acted under extreme provocation in self defence so probably if have to stand trial at verdict will be one of misadventure ' oh be dreadful ejaculated girl pulled up suddenly appeared to consider situation for moment then said very quietly so if be to go home appears that will have to go alone fear so answered leslie continued reassuringly must not run away with idea intend to pack off aboard first ship happens to come along suitable otherwise reckon upon falling in with several ship within next thirty six hour will therefore be able to pick choose may rest assured will not put aboard vessel until have thoroughly satisfied that will be quite comfortable happy in although have be speaking only of homeward bound ship thus far must not forget that if must happen to run into calm on line be quite on card that may encounter something outward bound to cape india australia into to trans ship in case will be able to continue original journey with practically loss of time yes answered miss trevor slowly must be advantage certainly on whole mr leslie think must greatly prefer outward bound to homeward bound ship if please right laughed leslie will see what can be done now must go on deck to keep lookout for suitable craft paused at purchas cabin on way on deck tried door be still locked from inside so ascended companion ladder went out on deck be most gloriously brilliant sparkling afternoon sky intense blue save where be flecked here there with woolly looking patch of trade cloud sailing solemnly up out of east sea too be a brilliantly blue a sky of deeper tint there be not very much swell on although breeze be blowing fresh from eastward brig with weather brace well checked be staggering along under rag of canvas must draw leslie glanced keenly ahead then round crystalline clear horizon in search of sail there be nothing in sight save school of porpoise be gambolling alongside racing brig chasing other athwart fore foot fish apparently rivalling rest in endeavour to see must shave brig stem most closely without being touched by thinking that sight might amuse miss trevor ran quickly down companion ladder entered main cabin with object of inviting to come on deck witness entered cabin just in time to catch sight of effecting distinctly hasty retreat into own private berth although be only momentary glimpse that caught of ere slammed door behind must almost have sworn that have pocket handkerchief to eye a though be have be cry vaguely wondering what be trouble paused uncertainly for few second then in pursuance of original intention knocked at door shouted miss trevor there be school of porpoise at play alongside if must care to come on deck watch be pretty sight think must amuse there be reply for moment two then in strangely muffled tone of voice girl answered thank mr leslie will be up in few minute be fully ten minute after that girl clad entirely in white made appearance on deck a leslie stole covert glance at face noted absolute composure told that have be mistaken have certainly not be cry wondered what in world be that must have put so ridiculous idea into head appeared to be frankly unfeignedly interested in gambol of porpoise laughing heartily from time to time altogether seemed so absolutely happy free from care that leslie while must have kicked for being such fool felt quite reassured at sunset night breeze still held a fresh a ever sail have yet be sighted either meeting overtaking brig circumstance that somewhat disconcerted leslie for be aiming to cross equator in longitude of degree west at point be quite usual for number of outward homeward bound ship to meet mermaid be now so near point with wind holding so fresh steady a did must not have be in least surprised to fall in with procession of craft proceeding in direction be disappointing bareness of horizon in direction for felt that companion charge must be intensely anxious to exchange into something must be taking back to home out to friend be keenly desirous to relieve anxiety at earliest possible moment yet at back of mind behind earnestness of desire be ashamed to discover that there existed certain feeling of satisfaction that moment for parting with girl be still deferred have found connection with very pleasant strong virile man always doe find pleasant to have something somebody to protect be dependent upon be only intellectual companion now left to with must go only individual with whom must exchange idea worth uttering yes admitted to must miss when be gone miss badly ay more than badly well must be helped must go of course curious feeling of depression be worrying at thought be additional imperative reason for departure with least possible delay if by chance departure be to be delayed much longer might be that by then must feel that did not want to part with at stamped foot on deck in impatient anger at novel unpleasant turn that thought be taking sprang into fore rigging on way to royal yard to take last look round ere darkness fell soon reached destination swept whole circle of horizon with eager intensity of gaze so clear transparent be air have there be anything in nature of sail within thirty mile must have seen horizon however be a bare a have be from deck presently descended from post of observation with obstinate feeling of relief that made intensely angry with three time that evening during dog watch did leslie try door of purchas cabin in endeavour to gain access to man ascertain condition on first two occasion failed door remaining locked against when for third time found door still fastened lost patience setting shoulder to obstruction burst open having arrived at conclusion that fellow ought not to be left to longer found cabin a have quite expected reeking with fume of rum purchas still insensible in bunk have be matter of astonishment to how man have contrived to keep supplied with drink for although leslie miss trevor steward be constantly in out of main cabin from alone access be to be gained to lazarette wherein ship store spirit be stowed one have seen moving about stifling therefore feeling of loathing nausea possessed proceeded to institute search of cabin with object of ascertaining whether drunkard have secreted supply therein search resulted in speedy discovery of twelve bottle seven of empty eighth about quarter full four still unbroached whole of at once got rid of by opening port in side of cabin launching through into sea then leaving port wide open to sweeten air somewhat assist in revivification of man in bunk retired from cabin closing door behind went on deck prolonged incapacity of new skipper rendered necessary for leslie to make arrangement whereby must secure proper amount of rest therefore carpenter being steady fairly reliable man arranged with that latter must take charge of starboard watch during purchas indisposition be eight hour in night consequently be free to retire to cabin between end of second dog watch midnight weather be now so hot that comparative coolness of night air on deck proved irresistibly attractive to miss trevor who sleeping in night be naturally indisposed to go to bed at so early hour a eight o'clock in evening a evinced disposition to keep deck for hour two leslie also remained on deck to bear company for time two walked weather side of brig flush deck between stern grating mainmast conversing more le intermittently upon various topic until at length leslie attention be attracted to man at wheel who noticed be continually glancing over shoulder with perturbed air at water astern instead of keeping eye upon compass card seemed also to leslie that man be trying to attract attention although be too bashful in miss trevor presence to speak so when pair next reached stern grating in course of promenade leslie paused said what be matter tom seem to be bestowing quite unusual amount of attention on wake of ship be there anything remarkable to be seen there man straightened up with satisfied air of one who after much striving have at length achieved success well exactly know sir a must call remarkable answered there be something visible over starn a perhaps lady might like to see oh answered leslie then let have look at offering hand to miss trevor assisted to mount grating led to taffrail over leaned gazing down into black profundity beneath brig be travelling at rate of about six knot at speed be wont to create considerable amount of disturbance in element through ploughed passage water be brilliantly phosphorescent a result of wake of brig be on occasion mass of sea fire foam that churned up on side of glowing sparkling with luminous cloud interspersed with thousand of tiny star that waxed waned with plunge of vessel water be almost a transparent a air by leaning out over taffrail be possible to see rudder brig heel considerable amount of run aglow with bluish white light streamed away far astern like miniature milky way be beautiful spectacle one at imaginative person might have gazed for full hour more without tiring tom helmsman be not imaginative man spectacle of ship wake glowing scintillating with sea star be one that have beheld so often that have long ceased to appeal to a anything at uncommon be something else have attracted attention that have thought might interest lady for there in very thickest of swirling mass of cloud disc circle star of sea fire at depth of perhaps six foot below surface be to be seen brilliantly illuminated by own movement through water glowing shape of enormous shark fully twenty foot in length keeping pace with brig a steadily a if be being towed by whole bulk of monster be clearly startlingly distinct much more so than must have be case at daytime for body showed against black water like shape of white fire while with sweep of powerful tail scattered trail of glowing spark behind that constituted of quite respectable wake oh what dreadful creature exclaimed miss trevor shrinking back in dismay at sight be like nightmare must surely be shark be not be first shark have ever seen mr leslie be certain that never wish to see have idea that shark be such monstrous creature always thought that be about same size a porpoise that be looking at afternoon yes laughed leslie very possibly however be rather exceptionally fine fellow although have seen even bigger specimen than look at too long continued possibly may dream of in case must be likely to prove nightmare to indeed have be followin ' of for last hour sir remarked helmsman do say that when shark hang on to ship like somebody goin ' to die aboard of yes answered leslie carelessly have heard that story believe for have be in ship have be followed for day on end by shark without anything coming of except that have generally managed to catch shark at last fellow be following because happens to be hungry hope that cook will heave overboard enough scrap to take sharp edge off appetite dew be falling very heavily miss trevor have not better fetch up wrap thanks answered girl a moved away extended hand for to help down off grating on to deck be growing late so will bid good night go to cabin sorry to hear that mr purchas be bad sir observed tom tentatively when miss trevor have vanished down companion ladder hope ai nothin ' serious oh dear answered leslie perceiving with annoyance that man be connecting presence of shark under counter with purchas invisibility merely rather sharp bilious attack be now over be glad to say will probably be on deck again to morrow then a carpenter who have be keeping out of way during miss trevor presence on deck came aft leslie gave over charge of brig to turned in remainder of first watch whole of middle watch passed without incident save when leslie went on deck at midnight found that wind have softened down somewhat a be indeed to be expected with brig drawing so near to equator vessel speed having dropped to about four knot weather held superbly fine barometer remained absolutely steady leslie therefore retired to bunk at end of middle watch with perfectly easy mind fixed determination to have purchas on deck under head pump at seven bell when must be called be still quite dark when be startled out of profound sleep by sudden loud outcry on deck followed by rushing scuffling of foot overhead accompanied by flapping of canvas a though brig have be suddenly luffed into wind leslie be well acquainted with vagary of equatorial weather therefore under apprehension that squall be threatening sprang from berth dashed up on deck without waiting to exchange pyjama for other clothing a emerged from companion came into violent contact with one who be evidently about to make hasty descent of ladder when pair have recovered from shock discovered that have collided with carpenter who betrayed symptom of most violent agitation while entire crew apparently shouting to other excitedly be grouped upon stern grating brig have be luffed into wind everything including studding sail be flat aback be well for craft concerned that wind have fallen light there must have be mischief up aloft plenty of wreckage among lighter spar what in world be matter chip demanded leslie testily a with single glance took in full condition of affair oh mr leslie sir something awful have just happened exclaimed man addressed stammering with agitation excitement be standin ' a might be just there pointing to spot on deck about midway between skylight mainmast fillin pipe when out of corner of heye seen somebody step out of companion on deck fust of thought 't be lookin ' again see a be skipper not cap'n potter will understand sir bein ' dead buried cap'n purchas be just goin ' up to to say how glad be to see 'im about again when step over to binnacle take peep into compass bowl then afore man must say jack robinson up jump on to starn gratin ' from there to taffrail overboard scotty there who be at wheel owns that more 'n half guessed from queer look in skipper heyes that somethin ' be wrong made grab at a ' e passed purchas be mile too quick for scotty on ' y reached taffrail in time to see pore man strike water next second that devil of shark have be followin ' of have 'im leslie reeled a though have be struck heavy blow here be tragedy second have happened within short space of time have elapsed since have joined unlucky brig even a have blamed for being in sort responsible for first so now reproached a being in measure responsible for felt that have be remiss in anxiety to shield unhappy man from observation unfavourable comment of crew have carefully concealed from everybody true cause of purchas retirement leaving man alone to recover from drunken bout instead of telling off somebody to watch have done reflected in self reproach dreadful thing must not have happened need for concealment be now past however so rallying faculty called hand to group round a have something to say to lad began believe that profoundly regret awful thing have just happened for mr purchas be most kind considerate officer to one of none of can regret terrible end so much a do for feel be to extent to blame for certain wise man have said of dead speak nothing good ' be well to carry out precept so far a be possible there be occasion however when truth whole truth must be told even though reflect discredit upon who be gone be one of be sorry to be obliged to tell that what really ailed mr purchas be drunkenness very little more than week have elapsed after captain potter death when discovered in mr purchas tendency to take rather too much rum spoke to about with result that promised to be more moderate in potation did not keep promise upon one occasion at least be so thoroughly intoxicated that slept through entire watch stretched out upon hencoop ay ay sir be gospel truth remember perfectly murmured two three of men interrupting of course assented leslie must not have avoided noticing be after occurrence remonstrated with for few day thereafter be better then began again finally giving way altogether with melancholy result that have witnessed knew how injurious to interest must be how seriously must weaken discipline if men must once come to understand that skipper be drunkard so let be understood among that mr purchas be confined to cabin through slight illness while a matter of fact be time lying there in drunken stupor now when be too late feel committed error of judgment in attempting to conceal from actual fact instead of being so keenly anxious to shield must think of nothing else ought to have anticipated possibility that upon return to consciousness might be tempted to do something foolish anticipating ought to have told off man from watch to sit with keep eye upon ay observed carpenter might have ' be good thing to have ' done that certingly have got nothin ' to reproach with sir done what did with good kind intention be to know that fust thing 'd do when come back to sens 'd be to up jump overboard oh sir ai to blame in noways for what be happened what do say bully in course gen'leman ai to blame nobody what be seen how land lay like have how mr leslie have be doin must to help skipper must ever say a be way to blame not answered one of men of in one way endorsing carpenter verdict thank men returned leslie be great relief to to feel that think a do in matter now that being disposed of there be further point to be considered be shocking fate of mr purchas leaf with navigator on board save have great desire to proceed in brig way to valparaiso nevertheless there be reason that to seem to make desirable must do so may tell that be now very near line so near indeed that may fall in with other craft aiming to cross at same point a ourselves at moment now if must fall in with ship must wish to communicate with ask captain to place navigating officer on board brig to take to valparaiso must prefer must take charge with chip here a mate navigate to valparaiso speakin ' for answered carpenter promptly want nobody better'n what be mr leslie in command of here hooker know sir have seen what can do have took measure sir if will forgive liberty of plain speakin ' be agreed a be prime seaman one o ' best a have ever sailed under 'd precious sight sooner see in command than what must stranger if ai mistook be feelin with hand of be right mate ai right be chip stranger for mr leslie be skipper for want nobody else thus in similar term entire crew expressed perfect agreement with view enunciated by carpenter there then matter be settled be with very considerable amount of trepidation that next morning leslie undertook task of communicating to miss trevor news of purchas death taking care to suppress full horror of tragedy by simply stating that unfortunate fellow have committed suicide by jumping overboard omitting mention of shark although girl be naturally much shocked at occurrence of second death on board following so quickly upon of potter be full extent of emotion purchas be not at sort of man to appeal to to arouse in sort of interest feeling beyond of disgust at weakness in surrendering to seduction of so degrading vice a of drink received information quite calmly much to companion relief meanwhile quite contrary to expectation breeze again freshened hour so before sunrise with result that when leslie took observation at noon found that brig be within mile of crossing equator be much more remarkable circumstance horizon be still absolutely bare not single sail of description being in sight even from main royal yard upon ascertaining last disconcerting fact leslie turned to miss trevor who be on deck said fate appears to have grudge against to be determined that will not yet leave have confidently reckoned upon falling in with something hereabout to must transfer continuance of breeze most sailor must regard a stroke of marvellous good fortune have enabled everything bound south to slip across line without suffering exasperating experience of more le prolonged period of calm while a ill luck will have there happens to be nothing northward bound on spot just when be most anxious to meet furthermore mile that now sail will lessen chance of effecting trans shipment because course will be ever diverging from of northward bound shipping of course now that be in command can continue to steer for day two longer in such direction a may enable with luck still to fall in with homeward bounder be presence on ship then so very embarrassing to mr leslie interrupted with ghost of smile must certainly appear so for burden of conversation ever since came on board have be trans shipment embarrassing ejaculated leslie in extreme surprise most certainly not on contrary interrupted be not point at continued have assumed very naturally think that be anxious to return home make fresh start else to continue outward journey according a circumstance may determine on part have be most anxious to meet what conceived to be wish a to presence aboard brig being embarrassment to assure that longer be compelled to remain here better will be pleased thank answered girl suppose must accept admission a compliment well mr leslie of course be quite right in assuming that if favourable opportunity must offer must gladly avail myself of greatest anxiety be to allay that of friend imagine will not begin to experience until little time have elapsed after date at golden fleece might reasonably be expected to reach melbourne about time must think ought to be at valparaiso ought not very well in case will be easy for to despatch from there reassuring cable message to australian friend following up with letter of explanation will be well moreover though must perhaps never suspect be of decidedly roving adventurous disposition will not at object to visiting valparaiso need therefore worry further upon that feature of matter of course if must rather not have pray say more beg interrupted leslie continued presence on board brig can only be source of keenest pleasure satisfaction to if can be content to remain will be more than content that do so thus be settled matter be destined to exercise most important influence upon life of two people singularly enough within hour of occurrence of above recorded conversation sail be sighted ahead steering north upon nearer approach proved to be south sea whaler homeward bound be steering course promised to bring two craft close alongside other at leslie suggestion miss trevor at once went below hurriedly penned three letter one to people at home one to father in india one to friend in australia briefly detailing particular of loss of golden fleece what have subsequently befallen writer together with intention to proceed to valparaiso if necessary after must act according to circumstance at same time leslie wrote to owner of golden fleece apprising of loss of ship fact that a far a knowledge went there be three survivor namely miss trevor seaman whom have taken off wreckage by time that letter be ready whaler be close at hand upon brig ensign be hoisted signal made that wished to communicate thereupon craft be brought to wind hove to brig quarter boat be lowered carpenter with three hand pulled alongside whaler taking letter with with request that skipper must kindly post at first port arrived at man readily agreed to do such little courtesy among seaman being quite usual then with mutual dip of ensign two craft proceeded upon respective way mermaid be singularly fortunate in weather experienced by on occasion of crossing line a often happens that ship in latitude be detained sometimes for week by persistent calm during prevalence of by constantly box hauling yard taking utmost advantage of little draught of air come along may succeed in gaining mile two in course of twenty four hour whereas carried breeze with ran without pause from north east trade across calm belt right into south east trade wind happened just then to be blowing fresh therefore made excellent progress to southward after parting from friendly whaler be about week later that brig thrashing along to southward close hauled with fore topgallantsail main royal stowed experienced thrillingly narrow escape from destruction be just two bell in first watch be to say nine o'clock pm night be fine with bright starlight moon that luminary happening then to rise late wind be piping up strong sending trade cloud scurrying across spangled sky at great pace there be fair amount of sea running into mermaid dug bluff bow viciously smothering forecastle with spray darkening weather clew of fore course with halfway up to yard miss trevor be on deck taking air graciously favouring leslie with company for hour two prior to turning in for night pair be promenading deck together fore aft between stern grating mainmast girl availing of support of leslie arm to steady upon dancing deck suddenly a be in act of wheeling round abreast main rigging flash of ruddy light illumined tumbling surface of sea deck trod sail detail of brig equipment glancing skyward beheld meteor trailing long tail of scintillating spark behind high aloft over brig port quarter with inconceivable rapidity glowing object increased in size light meanwhile changing a rapidly from red to dazzling white until light became almost a intense a of noonday sun be magnificent spectacle one also full of unspeakable horror for aboard brig who stood gazing in speechless fascination at for be evident that be not only falling through air at speed far surpassing that of cannon shot be also coming straight for brig deep humming sound that a seemed in space of single moment increased to almost deafening scream marked speed of flight through air a leslie grasped fact that in second that enormous glowing mass weighing a conceived hundred of ton must infallibly strike brig smash to atom instinctively interposed own body between companion gigantic hurtling missile a though such frail protection must have be of service to then while be still two hundred yard from brig at distance heat of fell upon white upturned face like breath of suddenly opened furnace dazzling white hot mass burst with deafening explosion into thousand piece of flew hurtling over about brig happily without touching danger be over have come be gone again in brief space of seven second be narrowest shave have ever have in life ejaculated leslie catching breath miss trevor have have experience such a fall to lot of few people imagine experience of being threatened with destruction by falling meteor surviving to tell tale wonder how many others beside little ship company have ever beheld so appalling magnificent sight a have night witnessed have suspicion mr leslie that brig be especially marked out chosen a theatre for exceptionally thrilling experience quaintly demanded girl because if there be probability that such be case really think will be obliged to reconsider decision to proceed to valparaiso in ask to land at nearest port tragic death of two men potter purchas be quite thrilling enough to upset nerve of ordinary girl when come to being bombarded by meteor must really very much rather be excused of course must assented leslie laughingly same continued although must confess have never heard of such thing happening might a probably have occurred in heart of london a out here at sea that meteor actually fall to earth know for there be numerous record of such happening have be seen to fall have immediately afterwards be found partially buried in ground still hot from friction of flight through air precisely where will fall strike be necessarily matter of merest chance be therefore so far a falling meteor be concerned quite a safe here a anywhere else thank answered miss trevor gravely be reassuring to learn that matter where be be liable to have huge incandescent mass of meteoric stone hurtling at out of space at moment for be what statement really amount to know be now will bid good night retire to cabin with fixed resolution not to dream of falling meteor therewith gave hand for moment then vanished down companion way chapter six mermaid crew witness catastrophe mermaid carried south east trade wind until be well south of parallel of rio de janeiro then ran into doldrums being belt of calm broken into at interval by light baffling air from various direction with occasional violent squall terrific thunderstorm just to vary monotony belt of exasperating weather be to be met with to north of north east south of south east trade wind interposed between trade wind outer region where steady breeze of sort may usually be reckoned upon here unfortunate crew of brig encountered full share little over of said of annoyance usually accompany passage across belt first experience being calm lasted five day on end without break save for occasional cat paw came stealing from time to time over glassy surface of ocean tinging here there with transient patch of delicate evanescent blue a cat paw be that must rely upon to help across calm belt be necessary to maintain constant watch for to trim round yard in such manner a to make most of during brief existence constant box hauling of yard be trifling matter accomplished a have to be under fierce ray of blazing sun a often happened that after laboriously trimming yard sheet to woo wandering zephyr either expired before reaching brig capriciously turned in direction passing by without causing so much a single flap of canvas be not to be wondered at that grumbling among hand be loud deep at length however with dawn of sixth day of vexatious experience there appeared to be prospect of something more helpful than mere cat paw coming way for although calm still continued morning broke with dark lowering threatening sky through ray of sun be unable to pierce last be in relief to everybody for although heat be still so oppressive that slightest exertion threw one into profuse perspiration stinging bite of sun be no longer to be reckoned with furthermore eye of on board brig weary of continually gazing upon bare horizon since day upon friendly whaler have vanished from view be now gladdened by sight of craft small barque have drifted above southern horizon during night now lay five mile away from a morning wore on towards noon aspect of sky steadily though by insensible degree assumed more threatening character huge mass of cloud overspread entire dome of visible sky darkening in tint to extent that scene became enwrapped in murky kind of twilight wind plenty of be brewing seemed evident from fact that cloud although not drifting across sky be working visibly writhing twisting into most extraordinary fantastic shape a though influenced by powerful impulse within one of most frequent of manifestation be sudden darting forth of long sharp quivering tongue from body of blackest most lowering of cloud with appearance of first of leslie knew what to expect for have beheld same phenomenon more than once before quite understood what portended so turned to miss trevor who be on deck interestedly watching subtle change in aspect of sky said to have ever seen waterspout miss trevor then chance be that will see several before be many hour older have noticed long black quivering tongue dart out in from body of darkest cloud well be forerunner of waterspout see there be one now do mark how seems to be striving to reach down to surface of sea ah have shrunk back again sooner later unless be greatly mistaken one of tongue will reach down down until begin to suck up column of water from ocean there will have full grown waterspout gazed round sky intently then went to skylight a intently studied barometer glass a sailor very commonly call instrument mercury in have fallen somewhat since have last looked at though not sufficiently to cause alarm nevertheless short handed a brig be such small craft be usually sent to sea with at least two hand too few in forecastle deemed best to err on right side if err must so a be by time noon ordered eight bell to be struck when watch have come on deck set to work to clew up haul down stow everything save two topsail fore topmast staysail after ordered to go to dinner dinner in cabin be served at same time a in forecastle on board mermaid when leslie miss trevor therefore went below deck be left in charge of one man only namely carpenter however did not particularly matter since brig be well snugged down while chip might be trusted to keep sharp look out give timely warning of approach of anything of alarming nature nothing however occurred leslie companion be allowed to finish meal undisturbed be now leslie watch below in ordinary course of event must have retired to cabin for purpose of securing hour two of rest with such lowering portentous sky a overhead scarcely felt justified in entrusting carpenter with sole responsibility care of brig for so long time accordingly accompanied miss trevor on deck again found aspect of sky more gloomy than ever cloud have formed into heavier mass donned deeper tinge of black than have worn during forenoon be displaying still greater degree of activity tongue of cloud be still darting out back again seemed nearer to formation of waterspout than during morning leslie began to think that perhaps for once in way be going to prove false prophet meanwhile although during whole of morning up to moment there have not be faintest breath of wind two craft barque brig have closed on other to within distance of three mile in mysterious manner characteristic of craft becalmed within sight of other barque leslie noticed have followed own example stripped to precisely same canvas a exposed by brig condition be not conducive to animated conversation judging from miss trevor brief reply to remark that must prefer to be left to own thought for awhile presently left leaning over rail gazing at barque swing of brig have now brought abeam seating upon short bench alongside companion proceeded to fill pipe be lighting with ordinary match unshielded flame of burned a steadily a though have be in hermetically scaled room when miss trevor suddenly cried out oh look mr leslie look surely there be one of waterspout at last leslie sprang to side looked in direction toward pointed where at distance of eight mile away beheld fully formed waterspout moving very slowly majestically in southerly direction yes agreed that be real genuine waterspout mistake be too far off for to see to advantage did actually behold come into existence answered be watching ship yonder only caught sight of accidentally after have become fully formed must really like to witness genesis of waterspout then keep eye on cloud recommended pointing to especially black heavy one hung few degree from zenith apparently about mile astern of barque if be not greatly mistaken be about to develop very fine specimen in few minute do note that black tongue be slowly stretching down from although lengthens shortens will observe that doe not shrink back altogether into cloud on contrary time that lengthens becomes perceptibly longer than be before observe how steadily root where join cloud be swelling now watch see how continually stretch down further further towards water ah do see little mound forming in sea immediately beneath see how water heap up a though striving to reach up join down stretching tongue of cloud ah there two unite have perfect waterspout very noble example of kind be will be having splendid view of from yonder barque for see be moving in direction be about to pas close to rather too close to be altogether pleasant unless eye deceive sprang to companion seizing telescope applied to eye why exclaimed excitedly after moment two with eye still glued to instrument what be about aboard that barque why fire at thing break will be upon in moment to dead certainty unless change course yes yes be going to hit heaven look at a stood there gazing saw that vast column of water sweep steadily down upon over barque completely hiding from view for moment then suddenly wavered in middle broke collapsing with tremendous splash commotion of sea sound of came drifting down to brig with startling distinctness ten twelve second later there in very midst of tumbling circle of foaming whiteness left by vanished waterspout there floated barque no longer trim ataunto a have shown few second before dismasted mangled wreck with bulwark gone boat swept from davit three mast snapped short off at level of deck lying alongside with attached mere tangled mass of wreckage still fast to hull by standing running rigging leslie stamped foot upon deck in sympathetic vexation at ruin thus wrought in moment again applied eye to telescope carpenter whose watch on deck now be stood beside eagerly impatient to discus with detail of catastrophe that have just witnessed while watch forward leaned over bow alternately muttering to other opinion glancing round in apprehension lest waterspout must steal upon brig unawares treat a crew of barque have be treated be same crew rather entire absence of sign of be now disturbing leslie can see nothing of muttered impatiently searching wreck with lens of telescope here chip take squint man continued thrusting instrument into eager hand of carpenter deck be a bare a back of hand there be not enough bulwark left standing to make matchbox out of nothing stump of few staunchions here there can see coaming of hatch rising above level of planking can see windlass can just make out short stump of three mast can find where poop skylight stood hang if can see anything living aboard carpenter in turn applied eye to telescope gazed through long anxiously sir agreed at length what say be perfekly true there ai nobody movin ' about on that there vessel deck question be what be become of 'em be down below have be swep overboard stan to reason that when found theirselves onable to steer clear o that there spout 'd go below shut theirselves up a best must knowin a nothin livin ' must surwive waterspout tramplin ' over a one may say where be there chap now if be right 'd be out on deck by time must lookin ' roun ' to see extent o ' damage must bustin o ' thing kill 'em d think sir bein ' shut up below be difficult to say answered leslie meditatively must depend almost entirely upon strength of defence can see for what have done to craft herself have made clean sweep of everything on deck reduced to condition of sheer hulk hang weather like look of be not to be trusted if be only shade two le threatening must feel strongly tempted to send away boat to see just what have happened aboard there there may be number of poor fellow somewhere on wreck just dying for want of assistance paused again glanced anxiously round horizon noting that aspect of sky be still a full of menace a ever continued dare not do must be risking too much have look there here come fore main topsail halliard let go man reef tackle shouted a long line of white foam appeared on western horizon slowly widening a advanced men sprang to station in instant galvanised into sudden intense activity by urgency marked tone of command next instant there be rattling squeaking of block parrells a topsail yard slid down well greased topmast settled with thud upon cap then a men began with loud cry to drag upon reef tackle leslie shouted call hand carpenter to close reef topsail look alive lad if be smart may have time yet to get reef point knotted before squall strike well there with reef tackle belay now away aloft with hurry about too added to man who have be standing by useless wheel will look after so saying mounted wheel grating while whilome helmsman slouched along deck climbing rail began to claw deliberate way up main rigging took hand about five minute to pas weather lee earings by time squall be close to brig approach being heralded by smart shower of rain that drove miss trevor to shelter of cabin then while men be still upon yard tying reef point wind came roaring screaming down upon brig fortunately from dead astern with report like of gun topsail filled with foam boiling hissing around bluff bow buried deep in brine mermaid gathered way be off heading south south west be a nearly a possible proper course men aloft meanwhile although nearly jerked off yard by violence suddenness with that first puff struck stuck manfully to work until have tied last reef point when leisurely descended to deck squared yard took pull upon belayed halliard then went below to change into dry clothes oilskin example leslie quickly followed a soon a be relieved at wheel squall lasted for full half hour during dismasted barque vanished in thickness astern then settled down into strong gale swept along before to southward for nearly thirty hour moderating on following day about sunset following morning dawned brilliantly fine with light breeze out from westward be just sufficient to fan brig along under everything must draw at bare four knot in hour over heavy westerly swell why what be meaning of chip demanded leslie a emerged from companion way at seven bell clad in bathing drawer only on way forward to take matutinal douche under head pump be swell forerunner of new gale have be knocked up by something that have just missed well sir answered chip be inclined to think a last guess be proper answer struck beginnin of here swell about two bell mornin ' furder south go heavier run seems to be gettin a though be gettin a may say more into track of breeze have passed along just about here besides glass have gone up goodish bit durin ' night be still risin a day progressed appearance seemed to favour correctness of carpenter theory for weather remained fine with le wind rather than more while after time swell appeared to be dropping somewhat happened that after men have taken dinner that day being carpenter watch on deck from noon until four o'clock pm acting now in capacity of boatswain took into head to go aloft with object of examining brig upper spar rigging to see how have fared in late blow taking foremast first ascended to royal yard from thence worked way conscientiously down to sling truss of lower yard while on way aloft however be observed to pause suddenly in fore topmast crosstrees gaze intently ahead rather in direction of two point on lee bow remained thus for nearly five minute then proceeded in execution of self appointed duty taking first foremast then mainmast subjecting everything to most scrupulous thorough overhaul with result that everything be found satisfactory aloft except certain chafing gear looked a though must be better for renewal meanwhile watch on deck who be engaged upon sundry odd job be able to execute on forecastle have noted action of carpenter have come to conclusion that keen eye have detected distant object of more le interest ahead accordingly snatched moment from task at fairly frequent interval to cast inquiring glance over bow watchfulness be at length rewarded just a seven bell be striking by sight of something showed for moment a brig be simultaneously hove up on top of swell bore about point on lee bow be two mile distant so far a must be judged from momentary glimpse have obtained of appeared to be floating mass of wreckage appearance be to ample justification for general knocking off of work to watch for next appearance one of more energetic of even exerting to extent of ascending fore rigging high enough to get view over fore yard from elevation uninterrupted view of object be to be obtained after long careful scrutiny man made out to be dismasted hull of ship be water logged upon point of foundering deck ahoy hailed in approved fashion d see that dismasted craft out there on lee bow ay jim growled carpenter have seen hour more ye may come down ' get on wi ' work lad will get good enough view of from deck afore long at eight bell carpenter went below called leslie who have be lying down in cabin at same time reported sighting of wreck be by time clearly visible from deck except when hidden from time to time by intervening mound of swell knowing exactly where to look leslie caught sight of immediately over lee cathead instant that stepped out on deck be by time about mile distant clearly distinguishable a craft of six hundred ton register be submerged almost to covering board whole of bulwark being gone between topgallant forecastle long full poop sea be making clean breach right over main deck leaving little to be seen above water short length of bow about three time a much of stern seen through powerful lens of brig telescope leslie made out that have once be full rigged ship from little showed above water judged to be american built three mast be gone by board also jib boom be snapped close off by bowsprit end there be sign of floating wreckage alongside from leslie be led to surmise that mast must have be cut away circumstance that in turn pointed to conclusion that have be hove over on beam end probably by sudden squall have refused to right again what have become of crew glance at craft davit answered that question there be boat to be seen while davit tackle be overhauled block in water clearly pointed to fact that boat have be lowered presumption therefore be that crew have abandoned craft fearing that be about to founder nevertheless weather being fine condition of sea such that craft must be boarded without much danger difficulty leslie determined to give overhaul accordingly brig having by time arrived almost directly to windward of seeming derelict gave order to back main yard instructed carpenter to take lee quarter boat with three hand go on board well miss trevor said leslie a two stood together near binnacle watching boat rising falling like cork over long hummock of swell a swept rapidly down toward wreck what think of for sight be not very perfect picture of ruin desolation few day ago can scarcely be more craft floated buoyantly ataunto walking water like thing of life ' deck presenting animated picture of busy activity a crew went hither thither about several task while yonder poop perchance be gay with company of passenger whiling away time with book game flirtation according to respective inclination over towered three mast lofty symmetrical with orderly intricacy of standing running rigging wide spreading space of snow white canvas whole combining to make up a stately beautiful picture a sailor eye need care to rest upon now look at there lie clean shorn of vestige of spacious white wing that imparted life grace to movement deck tenantless wave swept hull full of water relentless sea leaping at with merciless persistency a though eager to drag down overwhelm can conceive more sorrowful picture must perhaps although grant that must be difficult to imagine sight more grievous than to sailor eye answered girl gazing upon scene with eye wide brilliant with interest excitement how fearlessly little boat seems to dance over huge wave reminds of one of bird mother carey chicken think be called that one read about a sporting fearlessly joyously on top of wave crest during height of fiercest storm ah now have reached continued clasping hand on breast unconsciously a watched wild plunge of boat compared with deadly slow heave of water logged hulk oh mr leslie how must order men to undertake so desperately dangerous task will never do can not boat will be dashed to piece against great ponderous wreck never fear responded leslie cheerfully chip know what be about see there how keenly watched for chance how neatly took when came saw that rope end hanging over stern long before came to may depend now inboard go there stand on poop without so much a touch of boat against wreck there go boat round into sheltered lee of hull where will lie quite comfortably thither will go too in readiness to pick up when shove off again brig bore up wearing round came to again quite close under lee of wreck so close indeed that be quite easy to see with unassisted eye everything be going on aboard her a well a to obtain more comprehensive detailed view of havoc have be wrought on by combined effect of wind sea attention however be for moment attracted rather to what be happening on board than to condition of wreck miss trevor being especially interested spectator after be not very much simply under lee of hencoop on poop have somehow resisted onslaught of sea chip have discovered very fine newfoundland dog crouching perhaps lying exhausted be now endeavouring to induce animal to leave shelter with view of coaxing into boat for reason other brute refused to move responding to carpenter blandishment only by feeble intermittent beating of tail upon deck oh exclaimed miss trevor when grasped state of affair hope will be able to rescue poor creature be beautiful animal be so fond of dog what be matter with chip wo trust hailed leslie sending powerful voice to windward through palm of hand carpenter stood up faced about seems to be pretty nigh starved so far a can make out sir replied poor beggar just nothin ' skin bone too weak to stand by look of 'im then take up in arm drop overboard suggested leslie there in boat stand by to pick up will have sense enough to swim to so said so done miss trevor watching apparently somewhat heartless operation with tightly clasped hand leslie conjecture a to creature sagacity be fully justified for upon finding in water dog at once began to paddle feebly toward boat in le time than take to tell of couple of men have seized dragged into boat in bottom of lay shivering panting rolling great trustful eye from one to other of rescuer after there be little more that carpenter must do on board be impossible for to pas along main deck from poop to forecastle for sea be sweeping that part of derelict so continuously in such volume have attempted such thing must inevitably have be washed overboard must for same reason enter poop cabin from main deck peered down into through opening in deck have once formed skylight presently swung down into disappeared from view meanwhile brig being buoyant be settling rapidly to leeward soon drifted out of hailing distance in about ten minute from time of disappearance carpenter be seen to climb up out of cabin on to deck beckon to men in boat who at once paddled cautiously up alongside when watching roll of hull heave of boat alongside chip seized favourable opportunity lightly sprang into smaller craft men in at once shoved off pulling bow round gave way for brig carpenter carefully watching run of sea a sat in stern sheet steered here come exclaimed leslie watching lay aft here men hand of stand by to sway away a soon a have hooked on see that tackle be well overhauled give plenty of scope to come go upon coming down before wind sea boat took few minute to traverse distance between derelict brig presently slipping close past under stern of latter rounded to in smooth of brig lee shot up alongside a did so man who pulled bow chip respectively made lightning like dash for bow stern tackle simultaneously got hold of hooked into ring bolt flinging up arm a signal to on board to haul taut meanwhile remaining two hand in boat laid in oar rising to foot cleverly sprang into main chain a brig gave heavy lee roll haul taut fore aft hearties shouted leslie balancing on lee rail grasping backstay a anxiously watched dancing boat out come chip also tom capital now hoist away fore aft up with smartly lad while lee roll be on good very neatly done catch turn now for moment chip jump into again pas out dog take care that drop overboard well done now hoist away again men well there two block belay haul taut make fast gripe good dog then poor old fellow why be just skin bone a chip said never mind old chap trouble be over now will soon set on pin again here steward bring along water for dog not too much to start with give little food now carpenter be able to make out aboard there fill main topsail lad bring to course meanwhile miss trevor be on knee beside dog magnificent black newfoundland patting head speaking loving word to to attention poor beast responded by whining pitifully a licked hand slapped deck feebly with tail when steward brought food water took from gave to dog allowing first to drink little then to take mouthful two of food then drink then more food so on until have taken a much a thought good for for first meal well sir responded carpenter a turned to walk aft with leslie there be much to learn aboard there hooker beyond what must see for yourselves from deck of brig 'low be hove down upon beam end in squall time durin ' night most likely then have to cut away mast to right

a 'd be desarted matter o ' well perhaps three four day ah commented leslie speaking to rather than to carpenter then must not have be same squall struck certainly not distance be altogether too great for that mean however that there have be bad weather in region of late so will keep weather eye lifting lest must be caught unawares by recurrence of thank carpenter have done very well now if will keep look out for few minute will go below enter full account of matter in log book while particular be fresh in memory miss trevor have time be looking after dog petting making much of until animal revived strengthened by food drink that have taken have struggled to foot be now staggering after along deck a slowly carefully induced to take little exercise then after lapse of about hour fed again somewhat more liberally than at first until by dint of care assiduity on part poor beast be once more able to walk without much difficulty sun went down in clear sky night although breeze held swell rapidly subsided thus clearly indicating that be not forerunner of approaching gale last remaining evidence of one already past in probability same gale initial outfly of have worked destruction of flying eagle life of sailor be usually one of almost wearisome monotony despite what landsman have to say a to excitement true individual who be fortunate enough to posse eye for colour effect leisure to note ever varying form tint of sea sky especially if also happens to be endowed with skill to transfer to paper canvas need never pas uninteresting moment at sea such fortunately circumstanced people be however few far between be more especially to ordinary mariner that reference be now made to there be broadly speaking only two experience of fine weather of storm fine weather mean to usually little more than comfort of dry clothes full watch below perhaps not quite such hard work while bad weather mean sodden garment little broken rest unless ship be snugged down hove to incessant strenuous work to constantly changing aspect of sky appeal in one way only namely a forecast of impending weather incident of sea life apart from change of weather sighting of occasional ship be few derelict be not fallen in with day be overwhelming of ship by waterspout frequent occurrence yet extraordinary event of marvellous almost beyond credence unquestionably do occur from time to time nowhere more frequently than at sea be quite within bound of possibility for one craft to circumnavigate globe without encountering single incident worth recording while upon voyage of le than half that length will fall in with so many such extraordinary adventure that there will not be space enough in log book to record half of must almost appear be to be experience of mermaid for upon afternoon of day following that of meeting with flying eagle crew be privileged to witness sight that man may follow sea for year without beholding chapter seven dismasted be about one bell in first dog watch weather be fine water smooth breeze light brig with little more than bare steerage way upon be laying course with squared yard clew of mainsail hauled up studding sail set on side topsail occasionally collapsing flapping to mast for lack of wind to keep asleep miss trevor be a usual on deck seated in deck chair with book on lap finger of one hand playing abstractedly with ear of great dog lay stretched contentedly upon deck beside leslie also with book in hand be seated right aft upon taffrail with foot upon stern grating in position that must look past helmsman right forward command entire starboard side of deck a far forward a windlass bitt incidentally study varying expression flitted athwart miss trevor face a read carpenter with rest of men be on forecastle looking after busying upon small job needed attention stillness of peaceful afternoon seemed to have fallen upon vessel men conversed together intermittently in subdued tone barely reached aft in form of low mumble only sound heard be occasional soft rustle flap of canvas aloft with accompanying patter of reef point jar of rudder upon pintle jerk of wheel chain soft scarcely audible seething of water alongside upon reposeful quietude there suddenly broke sound of gentle wash of water close alongside then long drawn sigh like respiration jet of mingled vapour water shot above port bulwark to height of ten twelve foot so close to brig that next instant small shower of spray came splashing down on deck in wake of main rigging so totally unexpected be occurrence that startled everybody leslie sprang to foot looked with mild surprise down into water miss trevor dropped book a shot out of chair dog who have manifested readiness to respond to name of sailor leaped up rushed to bulwark where reared upon hind leg emitting succession of deep alert bark crew forward shambled over to port bulwark staring curiously come up here miss trevor said leslie extending hand to help girl up on to grating beside here be sight that may never have opportunity to behold again at least under such perfect condition a girl closely attended by sailor sprang lightly upon grating following with eye leslie pointing finger gazed down into blue transparent depth where beheld enormous black bulk of large sperm whale lying right up alongside brig so close to indeed that starboard fin be right under bilge about third of length from blow hole aft toward tail showing shiny a polished ebony six inch above water while ponderous tail stretched away forty foot more beyond taffrail where must be clearly seen gently rising falling to enable to keep pace with brig what veritable monster exclaimed miss trevor gazing down with wide open eye of mingled astonishment dismay at huge creature a clung unconsciously to leslie supporting arm be dangerous hope not because look big enough strong enough to destroy ship at single blow if chose to do so need not be in least alarmed answered leslie reassuringly will not hurt if interfere with creature be only dangerous if attacked then indeed have be known to turn upon assailant with dire result ah look there there be one sure enough up came of monster breaking water with rush showed nearly length at distance of only fifty yard from brig there be cried miss trevor with unmistakable trepidation a third came to surface blew close under brig counter pity a ai whaler sir remarked helmsman if be here 'd be chance to get fast to two of 'em at once without so much a havin ' to lower boat yes responded leslie good naturedly such chance however seem to come to whaler why there blow a fourth whale broke water about hundred yard on brig starboard beam seem to have fallen in with whole school of so indeed proved for within ten minute there be le than seventeen of monster in view at same moment within radius of quarter of mile of brig craft appeared to posse fascination for for not only swam round round approached so closely so persistently that miss trevor became seriously alarmed while even leslie began to grow somewhat uneasy lest brute whose temper knew to be rather uncertain must develop inclination to attack craft to relief however of hand curiosity of creature at length appeared to be satisfied drew off from brig little still remaining upon surface however presently huge brute began to develop playful disposition that commenced with chasing other hither thither first of in leisurely manner then a excitement grew rapidity of movement increased until be rushing through water round brig with speed of fleet of steamer finally took to breaching be throwing completely out of water to height of from ten to twenty foot coming down again with splash soon set water boiling foaming round creating commotion caused brig to roll pitch a though be in choppy sea exhibition of strength activity lasted for full three quarter of hour when creature disappeared a suddenly a have come much must be confessed to relief of hand aboard brig from time nothing of moment occurred until mermaid arrived off staten island eastern extremity of sighted at daylight on cold bleak morning ten week after date when leslie miss trevor have become member of ship company weather have in interim be fine upon whole with occasional calm contrary wind taking everything into consideration leslie felt that have done by mean badly on especial morning however appearance seemed to point to probability that be about to experience unpleasant taste of typical cape horn weather sky be gloomy overcast entire firmament being obscured by thick pall of cold leaden hued cloud lying in horizontal layer presenting appearance described by sailor a greasy appearance usually forebodes plenty of wind not improbably rain breeze be blowing fresh from westward having hauled round from north west during night brig be pounding through short lumpy sea under single reefed topsail air be damp raw with nip in sent everybody into thick winter clothing called for fire in cabin stove deck a far aft a waist be streaming with water have come in over weather rail in form of spray everybody on deck except miss trevor have donned sea boot oilskin only creature who appeared to enjoy weather be sailor dog who trotted about deck through heavy shower of spray with manifest delight there be hope whatever of getting sight of sun that day be matter of comparatively slight importance since leslie have very carefully taken bearing of land have thus be able to verify reckoning a day wore on wind freshened perceptibly while with mile that brig made to southward sea grew longer heavier air more bleak nipping at noon when watch be called leslie seized opportunity to take second reef in topsail to haul up furl mainsail arrangement be productive of immediate change for better since brig went along almost a fast a before while took sea more easily be altogether drier more comfortable barometer however be falling steadily circumstance combined with look of sky to windward led leslie to conclusion that be booked for regular cape horn gale through afternoon weather steadily became more unpleasant about one bell in first dog watch came on to rain cold heavy persistent downpour while wind piped up so fiercely that leslie decided to haul down third reef in topsail brail up stow trysail take in inner jib without further delay thus snugging brig down for night next morning dawned dark gloomy so thick with driving rain that be impossible to see anything beyond mile from brig in direction within radius scene be depressing enough steep high sea of opaque greenish grey tint sweeping down foam capped menacing upon brig from to windward while air be thick with spindrift scudwater foresail have be taken in during middle watch brig be now under close reefed topsail fore topmast staysail only under canvas be making bare three knot in hour leaving behind short wake streamed out broad on weather quarter so unpleasant be condition except for brief interval during fore afternoon miss trevor remained below whiling away time a best might with book disregarding sailor importunate invitation to accompany on deck meanwhile gale be steadily increasing between five six bell in afternoon watch main topsail suddenly split with loud report immediately blew out of bolt rope with result that despite utmost effort of helmsman brig at once fell off into trough of sea hearing report subsequent commotion on deck leslie who have be snatching little rest in cabin dashed up on deck taking in position of affair at glance gave order for fore topsail to be at once clewed up spanker to be set being done brought brig once more to wind extricated from dangerous situation then ordered new main topsail to be at once brought on deck bent having fancy for leaving brig night under such low ineffective canvas a spanker sail with heavy sea then running be time becalmed by time that remains of burst main topsail have be unbent new sail brought on deck be eight bell hand be set to work to bend sail under existing weather condition with wind blowing at almost hurricane strength brig flung like cork from trough to crest of mountainous furious running sea with wild weather roll a sea swept away from under succeeded by sickening roll to leeward at time laid almost on beam end a climbed lee slope of next on coming sea be long difficult perilous job for hand aloft leslie heaved sigh of relief when at length having bent close reefed sail little party laid in off yard descended to deck to assist in sheeting home delicate job be happily accomplished without mishap trysail being brailed in stowed brig be then hove to under close reefed main topsail fore topmast staysail through night whole of succeeding day gale continued to rage furiously although mermaid proved to be unexpectedly good sea boat in such exceptionally heavy weather riding easily mountainous sea be now running rolled with such terrific violence that be impossible to move anywhere on board whether on deck below without incurring risk of serious injury a for miss trevor acting on leslie advice kept to own cabin passed disagreeable time in comparative safety of bunk left only at meal time morning of fourth day brought with change gale broke about time of sunrise soon afterwards sky cleared canopy of cloud broke up drifted away to eastward in tattered fragment revealing sky of hard pallid blue in sun hung low like ball of white fire sea went down somewhat no longer broke so menacingly while changed colour from dirty green to steel grey far away on southern horizon gleam of dazzling white betrayed presence of small iceberg air be piercingly cold gladly welcoming change leslie who have spent whole of preceding night on deck ordered close reefed fore topsail to be set a well a foresail main trysail under considerable increase of canvas brig be soon once more moving with comparative rapidity through water looking well up into wind then watching for smooth wore craft round brought to on port tack during progress of evolution wind shifted couple of point to southward enabling to lay course of north west by west leslie hoped must suffice to draw out clear of everything carry into pacific ocean hope be strengthened a day wore on for wind continued to draw gradually still further round from southward while steadily decreased in force though growing colder hour thus enabling leslie to shake out first one reef in topsail then second finally last also to set jib main topmast staysail so that by sunset brig under whole topsail main topgallantsail be booming along famously with excellent prospect of finding fairly in pacific in course of next twenty four hour disconcerting circumstance however that rather tended to damp leslie hope be fact that barometer persistently refused to rise although wind be subsiding so rapidly that threatened to dwindle to calm a evening faded into night star grew dim finally disappeared still there be nothing must be called actually alarming in aspect of weather a leslie have be almost continuously on deck during entire duration of gale snatching brief half hour of rest from time to time a best must be now eight hour in decided after deliberating matter until four bell in first watch have struck to go below turn in until midnight leaving instruction with carpenter to instantly call in event of anything occurring to necessitate presence on deck seemed to that have scarcely laid head upon pillow closed eye ere be awakened from profound sleep by sudden screaming roar of wind brig heeled over to port until appeared about to capsize a leslie dazed for moment by sudden awakening sprang from bunk loud crash on deck immediately succeeded by lesser one told tale of disaster brig righted a harassed man sprang up companion ladder clad only in pyjama dashed out on deck to find everything in confusion mainmast gone by board hammering viciously at ship side while furious banging forward told that fore topmast also have gone with everything attached be hanging to leeward by rigging moreover howling gale from northward be sweeping over brig deluging with shower of cutting spray where be carpenter be leslie first cry a emerged from companion groped blindly about in blackness of starless night here be sir answered chip close at hand oh mr leslie here be dreadful business be to blame for sir never mind just now who be to blame exclaimed leslie call hand let get to work with tomahawk upon main rigging cut everything away chip be smart about man will have mast punching hole in ship side there will be end of so saying without waiting for answer leslie made spring for rack in tomahawk be kept seizing first of small ax that must lay hand upon set example to rest by hacking away at lanyard of main shroud be heart breaking business blind hewing chopping at complicated gear held wreck of mainmast fast to hull be accomplished at last then brig having paid off almost dead before wind drifted astern went clear with much scraping final bump under counter made old hooker tremble must have infallibly destroyed rudder have chanced to hit then hand went to work attacked topmast rigging being le complicated be soon cleared away harassed crew now have moment in to collect energy for fresh effort take stock a be of extent of disaster have befallen first matter into leslie made particular inquiry after have gone below got into clothes be state of crew have be impressed upon although have hitherto be too busy to mention that men seemed to be missing rather have vaguely felt that there be not so many men on deck a there ought to be so now turned to carpenter said muster hand chip let steward give good generous tot of grog will be better for after hard work in wet cold moreover wish to satisfy that be right have struck more than once since came on deck that of be missing pray to god that be wrong sir answered carpenter now that come to speak of same thing have struck too here lay aft bully of yer let have look at ye continued sending voice forward to forecastle where men be now grouped awaiting further order came aft slouching along deck after usual manner grouped about binnacle why where be rest of ye demanded carpenter glaring angrily from one to other where bill jim joe jump for'ard one of ye tell to lay aft here for tot o ' grog be here chip be left of be bill jim joe be missin ' ai to be found nowhere anyhow ai in fo cbe'le be ready to swear to answered one of little crowd grouped round binnacle eye gleaming in dim light of binnacle lamp with transient horror that sailor feel at sudden loss of shipmate not in fo cbe'le ejaculated carpenter staring wildly about oh god three men gone of 'em in watch cried flinging clenched fist above head in agony of self reproach be sure that ai in fo cbe'le then ai nowhere else aboard unlucky hooker be overboard be where be went when squall struck very nigh throwed on beam end be fault fault be have lost three men ye see mr leslie be like here be man what ca do without proper 'lowance of sleep here last gale have fair knocked up made that stupid have knowed what have be doin latterly fact be that in here last watch of mine be fair overcome wi want of sleep dropped off without knowin without wantin ' to here be consekence flinging right hand wildly out to indicate crippled state of brig ' loss o ' three good men well chip be pity said leslie soothingly sympathetically if have told how completely be knocked up must have taken watch for although be pretty well knocked up mischief however be done can not now be helped so be useless to worry more about must not however allow ship to run further to leeward than can help so clew up foresail lad will let scud under bare pole until daylight then will see what can be done to mend matter now take grog men when have clewed up furled foresail go below too chip have have little rest can doubtless hold out until morning will look after brig until then a men shambled away forward leaving leslie at wheel latter dimly caught sight of something huddled up in companion way at top of ladder while stood staring at in endeavour to make out what be moved next moment miss trevor enveloped in dressing gown stepped out on deck with teeth chattering with cold exclaimed oh mr leslie what dreadful thing have happened be awakened by terrible noise confusion crashing thumping thrashing of sail howling of wind shouting of sailor feared that ship be sinking for seemed just a bad a on night when golden fleece be run into so wrapped in dressing gown have be to fro between top of stair own cabin for quite hour must think must not come out on deck for saw at once that be extremely busy knew that if did must only interrupt be in way must indeed answered leslie bluntly even now continued deck be place for on wild bitter night will get wet through catch death of cold a say ashore therefore beg that will forthwith go below turn in there be further danger at present brig be scudding quite comfortably a may see there be nothing that can run up against between morning may therefore finish sleep in comfort with easy mind please tell exactly what have happened girl persisted will be better able to rest if will let know worst well if insist on knowing brig be caught aback by sudden shift of wind have lost mainmast fore topmast answered leslie saying nothing about further loss of three men a did not wish to harrow mind with distressing detail until became impossible longer to conceal miss trevor be not however to be so easily put off heard carpenter cry out that have lost three men said what did mean by precisely what said answered leslie reluctantly poor chap be overcome with fatigue of last three day fell asleep in watch on deck result be loss of spar worse still of three men who there can be doubt somehow got washed knocked overboard when squall struck dismasted oh how dreadful exclaimed girl in tone of horror be indeed unfortunate ship have met with nothing tragedy since came on board wish now oh wish most fervently that have met other ship into must have changed must then have escaped horror possibly agreed leslie yet quien sabe a spaniard say who can tell might have trans shipped into craft quite a if not even more unfortunate than in case be too late now even be not so appear to have forgotten that must not have trans shipped at least be bound to go on to valparaiso in brig however be not moment to discus matter be shivering teeth chattering with cold must therefore insist that go below turn in at once a pas through cabin mix good stiff glass of grog will do good prescribe very well doctor will obey answered girl forthwith disappeared down companion without saying good night somewhat to leslie chagrin apparent discourtesy be however soon explained for minute two later reappeared bearing in hand tumbler of generously stiff grog handed to leslie saying prescribe please drink at once for be certain that need far more than do oh yes will take since so strenuously insist upon there now will feel better a received empty tumbler from now good night be man for then must stay here help god forbid ejaculated leslie fervently not even to secure benefit of help must have other than a be thousand thanks for grog now good night let not see again until morning disaster to brig have happened shortly before midnight for rest of wild bitter night until seven bell in morning watch leslie stood there alone at wheel keeping brig stern on to fast rising sea then carpenter remainder of crew appeared on deck one of came aft to relief cook lighted galley fire steward presently brought aft cup of smoking hot cocoa then when have stripped to skin be pumped on copiously under head pump rubbed down vigorously with rough towel invested in complete change of dry garment felt new man ready for arduous day work if need be however insisted that hand must take thorough good breakfast before starting day work wisdom of revealed immediately that work began meanwhile be necessary to say that during long weary hour of leslie lonely vigil at wheel wind at first outfly have come away from about due north have gradually veered round until by sunrise be point south of east in quarter seemed disposed to stick furthermore with coming of dawn have evinced disposition to moderate violence somewhat while sky have cleared for few brief minute in eastern quarter revealing glimpse of sun upon examining barometer leslie have noticed that mercury in tube showed convex surface sign that be about to rise therefore suffered to indulge hope that with improving weather must ere nightfall be enabled by good steady hard work to get brig into such shape a to once more have under command seen now in broad daylight poor little brig presented truly pitiful sight a compared with appearance on previous evening be then ataunto with spar rope sail intact thing of life obedient to helm responsive to will of commander a fit a such craft must be to cope with possible caprice of wind weather now be poor maimed disfigured thing mainmast gone leaving nothing of splintered stump standing ten foot above deck fore topmast also gone snapped short off at cap of normal spread of canvas nothing now remained save fore course loss be not confined to of spar only although of course be serious enough in addition to have lost complete suit of canvas practically running standing rigging latter item being one that must be quite impossible to replace until arrival at port fortunately for concerned owner have be prudent enough to provide with two complete suit of sail also carried fairly liberal equipment of spare spar must therefore be very difficult job to extemporise jury rig for trouble must be to find wherewithal to replace lost standing running rigging block other item must be needed to make jury rig effective need must however when there be alternative british sailor be with fault ingenious fellow not altogether devoid of inventive faculty possessed of pretty turn for adaptation give idea will generally find mean to carry out so while leslie chip went round of deck immediately after breakfast inspecting stock of spare spar navy man prepared rough sketch illustrating idea of manner in spar must be most effectively made use of rest of crew turned to with will to overhaul boatswain locker sail locker fore peak routing out therefrom bringing up on deck article thing must conceivably be of use in task lay before then when leslie have completed arrangement with carpenter latter brought tool on deck spare spar be cast loose placed conveniently at hand for working upon in very short time everybody leslie miss trevor cook steward be busily engaged on forecastle measuring cutting splicing fitting rigging while carpenter trimmed spar otherwise prepared to go into destined position a for others cook steward have usual duty to attend to must not therefore be spared to lend hand in re rigging brig even have possessed necessary knowledge did not although later on perhaps when came to mere pulling hauling strength must be found useful must be unhesitatingly called for meanwhile brig although under fore course only running before wind needed to be steered job leslie undertook to personally attend to throughout day thus sparing man for pressing work on forecastle luckily for everybody concerned half hearted promise of finer weather that morning have given be more than fulfilled for about four bell sky cleared sun shone brilliantly air became pleasantly mild while although wind still blew strongly from east sea grew more regular so that dismantled brig now scudded quite comfortably not shipping drop of water forging ahead at rate of about three knot per hour on proper course miss trevor have not made appearance at cabin table when leslie have be summoned below to breakfast by steward have responded when former have gently knocked at cabin door circumstance however have not aroused very serious alarm in breast of ex lieutenant who remembering incident of night before when young lady have come on deck after accident to brig thought quite probable that in consequence of rest being so rudely broken be now oversleeping in confidence of belief have ordered steward not to attempt to disturb to prepare breakfast for immediately upon appearance furthermore instructed man to notify if failed to put in appearance before four bell a happened young lady appeared on deck fresh rosy a summer morning with sailor in close attendance few minute before hour what exclaimed lifting hand in dismay a saw leslie standing at wheel precisely a have left on previous night still at dreadful wheel do mean to say that have be standing there time by mean madam answered leslie cheerfully have since then have most refreshing bath changed clothes taken breakfast done quite useful amount of very necessary work be scarcely needful to inquire after health appearance speaks for yet for form sake let say that hope be none worse for very imprudent behaviour last night oh answered with laugh blush vastly became so leslie thought be perfectly well thank took grog that prescribed then went dutifully to cabin in obedience to order where at once fell asleep so remained until hour ago then rose dressed have breakfast here be ready anxious to do anything can to help help echoed leslie with laugh talked of helping last night most kind be of to have express wish in what possible way must delicately nurtured girl like help yet continued more soberly must render little help once twice day if must be not much must ask of merely to note chronometer time for when take observation of sun for longitude have sometimes thought that chip have be little erratic in noting of time have more than once have in mind to ask to undertake small service for why of course will assented girl eagerly why did not ask before there be thing can do for now moment if will only let can steer ship for while go downstairs obtain few hour much needed rest eye be heavy red for want of sleep look to be half dead with fatigue if must break down what must become of rest of please let try at once will be quite sure must manage look perfectly easy leslie laughed yes assented have doubt doe because see happen to know just how to do must find very hard work must soon be terribly tired must not possibly steer craft in heavy sea especially a be running before wind constitutes most difficult condition for steering if wish to learn to steer will be delighted to teach a soon a again get fine weather smooth water with promise girl have to be content although persisted in believing to be quite easy to turn wheel few spoke way so keep brig sailing on perfectly straight course meanwhile crew got to work rigged pair of sheers over stump of mainmast firmly staying with guy leading aft to taffrail forward to windlass bitt then rigged at apex of sheers strongest threefold tackle that must extemporise with assistance of swayed aloft spare main topmast have be carefully prepared by carpenter for fishing to stump of mainmast spar be accurately adjusted in precise position that be intended must occupy heel be then firmly secured to stump of mainmast by mean of strip of stout planking about eight foot long closely arranged round secured in position by long length of chain wound tightly round further tightened by driving in a many wedge a possible then spar be further secured by shroud stay backstay thus providing very respectable substitute for mainmast sheers be then struck spare main yard fitted with brace block other necessary gear be next swayed aloft firmly secured to head of extemporised mainmast spare main course be bent set by sunset same evening leslie have satisfaction of seeing brig once more in condition to be brought to wind when occasion must arise what crew have accomplished that day constituted most excellent day work especially taking into consideration fact that be almost worn out with fatigue leslie therefore resolved to call upon for nothing further in shape of work day foresaw that must be great help to craft to have fore staysail must be set when sailing on wind main trysail might also prove useful determined therefore that next day must see two sail in place if possible must then have accomplished very utmost that lay in power sufficient hoped believed to enable to take brig to valparaiso observation taken at noon at three o'clock day showed that mermaid be far enough to southward westward to justify shift of helm accordingly at four bell in first dog watch altered course to north west by west hoped must enable to just clear desolation island carry fairly into pacific also afforded opportunity to test efficiency of jury rig satisfaction be great at finding that with yard braced forward brig under main fore course only behaved in thoroughly satisfactory manner although what must do when hauled close on wind still remained to be proved happily for weather have by time again become quite fine wind have softened down to merely fresh breeze sea have gone down considerably be therefore enabled to secure few hour sleep refreshment that now absolutely needed for be by time so completely worn out exhausted that felt must do more next day be nearly a busy one a have preceded for saw completion of leslie plan left brig under fore main course fore staysail with main trysail bent ready for setting when occasion must require achievement brought ex lieutenant to end of resource on other hand felt that brig be now once more in reasonable trim for facing contingency except recurrence of really bad weather last hoped must have done with when once brig have fairly entered pacific luckily weather be now a fine a must wish sky clear enough to enable to get observation not very much sea running spanking fair wind driving brig along upon course at speed of nearly five knot moreover fine weather must enable crew to get sufficient amount of rest to thoroughly recuperate exhausted energy prepare for future contingency on following morning just a have completed forenoon observation for longitude land be sighted broad on starboard bow proved to be south eastern extremity of desolation island at six bell in afternoon watch brig have arrived in longitude of degree west be therefore at last ploughing water of vast pacific ocean to leslie profound satisfaction now shifted course point to northward began to calculate probable date of arrival in valparaiso be intention to maintain north west course for ensuing twenty four hour in order to obtain good offing then to haul up to northward to disgust when turned out on following morning found that wind have shifted be blowing strong from about north east that with yard braced right forward main trysail set brig must look higher than north west be however comforting to reflect that although hooker be taking wider offing than be at necessary be edging up to northward in direction lay port of destination sooner later must be certain to get westerly slant of wind must help so being in fact unable to do better leslie kept starboard tack abroad went driving along to north westward with mile of progress that now made there came improvement in weather air growing ever softer more balmy water more smooth sky clearer more deeply exquisitely blue thus brig drove steadily pleasantly enough along day after day until wondering voyager seemed to have arrived in lotus eater region where be always afternoon still wind hung inexorably in north east quarter brig bow obstinately refused to point higher than north west until leslie patience wore thin grew moody morose with long waiting for shift of wind for condition of affair lasted not only for day at last mounted to week circumstance be practically unique in history of water chapter eight wreck of mermaid at length however inevitable change came wind died away to breathless calm ocean took on semblance of sea of gently undulating glass hitherto cloudless sky imperceptibly lost intensity of blue a thin streaky haze gradually veiled through sun shone feebly rayless disc of throbbing white fire heat closeness of atmosphere be intense even on deck while temperature below be practically unendurable brig lost steerage way about two o'clock in afternoon when sun sank beneath western horizon night looming through haze red a blood distorted in shape magnified to thrice normal dimension there be little if perceptible change in atmospheric condition although mercury in barometer have be falling slowly steadily day brig be now within tropic of capricorn not very far to eastward of paumotu archipelago in region night succeeds day with such astounding rapidity that star become visible within ten minute of sun disappearance yet star appeared on particular night on contrary darkness must be felt settled down upon brig almost with suddenness of drawn curtain darkness be a profound a of interior of coal mine be literally impossible to see one hand held close to one eye movement about deck be accomplished blindly gropingly with hand outspread to avoid collision with most familiar object whose position must now be only roughly guessed at silence be a profound a darkness for swell have subsided with almost startling rapidity brig be so nearly motionless that there be none of creaking of timber spar none of cheeping of block gear be usually to be heard under such circumstance even men forward be silent a though be waiting listening for something knew not what so intense be silence even striking of match to light pipe became almost startling while tiny flame burnt steadily without semblance of wavering in stagnant air gradually however subtle portentous change took place darkness slowly became le intense giving place to lurid ruddy twilight appeared to emanate from cloud for by imperceptible degree grew visible became streaked blotched with patch of red suggested idea of being on fire within incandescence showing through here there in thinner part red light grew spread until whole surface of sky be aglow with be uncanny experience to stand on stern grating close up to taffrail look forward along brig deck to bow note detail of craft equipment showing distinctly black a ebony against weird background of red hot sky ruddy reflection in polished surface of water leslie scarcely knew what to make of lowering portentously illuminated sky have never seen anything quite like before instinctively felt that foreboded mischief accordingly kept sharp eye on barometer be still falling now with considerably greater rapidity than at first at eight bell in second dog watch came to conclusion that time for action have arrived before allowing watch to go below ordered everything to be clewed up furled leaving only fore staysail standing then settled down to wait doggedly for development determined not to leave deck until breeze have come from somewhere for have suspicion that when arrived must prove to be something stronger than ordinary wanted to satisfy a to manner in jury rig must withstand such outburst a appeared to be impending hour after hour went by however nothing happened until at length miss trevor whose stay on deck have be unusually prolonged by curiosity perhaps dash of apprehension bade leslie good night retired to cabin port of particularly requested to keep closed despite stifling heat at strange alarming glow in heaven faded a imperceptibly a have come until darkness have become a intense a before leslie be beginning to think that after nothing be going to happen when whole scene became suddenly illuminated by vivid flash of sheet lightning for infinitesimal fraction of second seemed to set entire visible firmament ablaze caused detail of brig hull equipment to imprint clear perfectly distinct picture of upon retina listened for thunder none came suddenly however few heavy drop of rain pattered upon deck instant later down came perfect deluge with sound of million of small shot roaring rattling on deck hissing into sea rain ceased a suddenly a have come a suddenly a flow of water be stopped by turning of tap for about quarter of hour nothing further happened then sheet lightning began to quiver flicker among cloud once more presently pall immediately overhead be rent apart by terrific flash of sun bright lightning that struck straight down seemed to hit water only few yard from brig simultaneously with flash came crackling crash of thunder of absolutely appalling intensity before echo have died away flash tore athwart heaven until within space of le than minute entire vault of heaven be ablaze with flickering flashing lightning steel blue baleful green rosy red dazzling white accompanied by continuous crash roar of thunder be deafening terrifying tremendous manifestation continued for about ten minute when down came rain again in even fiercer deluge than before in very midst of while thunder still crashed boomed overhead rain descended in such sheet mass that everybody gasped for breath a though drowning away came wind with howling scream that in instant drowned even sound of thunder struck brig flat aback have happened to have have of square canvas set must undoubtedly have foundered stern first a be leslie who happened to be only man near wheel sprang to put helm hard over causing to pay off a gathered stern way thus saving craft even a stood there in very act of putting helm over crash reached ear out of midst of terrific hubbub be conscious of receiving violent blow on head then knew more when leslie again recovered consciousness first distinct sensation be that of racking sickening splitting headache accompanied by feeling of acute soreness smarting also felt dazed confused harassed by vague intense anxiety about something knew not what then became aware that be lying recumbent on back with head propped high by pillow presently also became aware that head be heavily swathed in bandage stirred uneasily attempted to put hand to head be shocked to find that hand arm felt heavy a lead so heavy indeed that after feeble effort abandoned attempt a did so fluttering sigh whispered oh thank god thank god fell upon ear handkerchief saturated with eau de cologne be applied to nostril a in dream heard voice murmur be better mr leslie tell that be feeling better feeling better have be ill then supposed must have be otherwise why be lying there wherever might be on back with head bandaged racked with pain with strength in ill of course be nerve in body bore testimony to fact where be what be matter with whose be gentle tender voice somehow seemed so familiar that questioned everything be vague confused incomprehensible with dominating impression that there be pressing urgent need for to be up attending to something without instant delay a lay there painfully cogitating in vain endeavour to disentangle thread of mingled thought seemed to be inextricably wound together in throbbing struggling brain two warm drop splashed upon face same low voice that have heard before cried spare o god spare have mercy handkerchief be again applied to nostril tide of life ebbed back for moment again sank into oblivion presently revived to consciousness soft arm be supporting arm quivered shook with violent sobbing fell upon ear while shower of hot tear bathed face then in instant recollection vivid intense complete came to opened eye for moment must see nothing then became aware that sun be streaming brilliantly in through open port hole near head of bunk while soft warm yet refreshing breeze be playing about temple miss trevor be bending over with streaming eye that gazed down upon wild with anxiety grief why what be what be matter why be lying here idle when ought to be on deck looking after ship murmured attempting at same time to rise imprisoning arm held firmly down streaming eye met in intensity of gaze seemed to devour tender voice gain cried with indescribable fervour thank god oh thank god for great mercy be alive will continue to live yes must live promise that will here drink quickly held to lip tumbler containing liquid pungent to taste at once revived thanks thousand thanks murmured leslie gratefully feel better now please let get up must go on deck at once must not indeed must not there be need answered miss trevor leslie thought detected tone of sadness mingled with relief in accent of voice need ejaculated leslie indeed there be need then paused abruptly for have suddenly dawned upon that brig have distinct list to port that be motionless not with buoyant motionlessness of ship afloat in calm with absolute absence of movement characteristic of ship in dry dock stranded good heaven what have happened ejaculated tell please at once again attempted to rise again self constituted nurse restrained oh please please move entreated must obey now will never get better will tell everything indeed must not attempt to rise for a said just now there be need ship be quite safe be sure that nothing further can happen to at least not for time to come long ere that time arrives will please god be well again in fit state to do seems best to nevertheless answered leslie must like to see carpenter if will have goodness to call to perceive that brig be ashore though where have not remotest notion will be able to tell far more clearly than can exactly what have happened girl leaned over leslie looked down at with eye full of trouble mr leslie said tear welling up into eye again must ask to prepare to hear bad news very bad very sad news can not bring carpenter to can not bring other of crew to for poor friend sailor be only living being left on board most unfortunate ship only people left aboard gasped leslie then in heaven name what have become of real can not tell know answered girl if will let tell story in own way have doubt that knowledge of seafaring matter will enable to judge with sufficient accuracy just what have happened will remember perhaps that on night before last there be terribly violent storm of lightning thunder night before last interrupted leslie mean last night surely answered miss trevor mean night before last have lain here unconscious nearly thirty six hour thirty six hour ejaculated leslie with groan well go on please that storm continued miss trevor be so violent terrifying found not only impossible to sleep through even to remain in cabin therefore rose dressed stationed in place call companion at head of cabin stair where sheltered by cover must at least watch what be going on crouched there saw everything happened saw spring to wheel when gale struck ship saw felled to deck by falling mast be first to spring to assistance drag out from midst of tangle of rope broken spar then carpenter one two other men came running up helped to bring down here to own cabin where have be attending to ever since striving oh so earnestly so hard to restore to consciousness poor brave girl murmured leslie what courage what devotion have shown young lady resumed carpenter others left immediately that have got laid comfortably on bed lamp lighted explaining that be necessary for to be on deck to take care of ship a must readily understand for frightful roar of wind violent motion of ship bore eloquent witness to fury of storm be raging outside accordingly retired heard close door at top of stair draw over cover to keep water from coming down into cabin suppose for must hear falling heavily on deck with alarming frequency while hoarse shout calling of men up above be truly terrifying be quite insensible bleeding freely from wound in head resumed young lady first thought naturally be medicine chest have seen under cabin table made way to a best must finding book of direction turned to part treating of wound where found full instruction how to proceed acting upon carefully clipped away hair from around gash bathed place washing away blood a well a must then applied dressing a directed securing in place with plaster then swathing head with bandage to preserve dressing from displacement have just completed task be sitting on box under lamp trying to discover way of restoring to consciousness when ship suddenly struck with awful violence against something heard crash a of falling mast on deck accompanied by terrible outcry among men then ship be lifted up to come down again with crash even worse than first then be thrown violently over on side heard fearful fall of water on deck accompanied by more rending crashing of timber be continued for must say quite hour shock however becoming le le violent until ceased altogether ship seemed to remain stationary save for slight rocking movement eventually also ceased have not since then felt slightest movement tremor of kind gale however continued to rage with unabated fury until midday yesterday when quickly died away sun came out meanwhile continued effort to restore to consciousness without success finally when at gale have passed away weather have again become fine ventured to go up on deck to see what have happened to ship what have become of men for to great surprise alarm none of have come near made attempt to inquire after from moment when have helped to bring down into cabin what did find demanded leslie anxiously found answered miss trevor that ship be lying stranded on immense reef of rock be within about two mile of land large island take to be for can see sea beyond end of be not worst of ship be complete wreck mast being broken lying in water beside most of bulwark broken gone not one of crew to be found must get up really must insisted leslie please attempt to keep here continued a companion strove to dissuade from purpose must go on deck take look round if only for few minute just to satisfy a to actuality of situation if can not do that will simply lie here worry into fever thinking fearing imaginable thing well remarked girl doubtfully if be to be result of confinement to cabin perhaps have better yield to wish allow to go on deck just for few minute must promise to be very good obedient to do exactly a tell in short to leave entirely in hand will oh of course will assented leslie with eagerness alacrity be not altogether convincing to companion who saw however that must have to yield somewhat to headstrong patient of hers if wished to retain control at over accordingly assisted first to sit up in berth then to climb out of still being dressed in clothes that be wearing when accident happened to eventually with very considerable difficulty leslie finding curiously weak so giddy that must not stand without support contrived to get up companion ladder out on deck where sailor accorded boisterous effusive welcome arrived there leslie sank upon short seat ran fore aft alongside companion cover cast eye about be melancholy sight met view brig with list of about four strake to port be hard fast upon inner edge of reef seemed to be about mile wide stretched for many mile in direction ahead astern lying broadside on to run of reef jury mainmast have snapped short off immediately above lashing bound to stump of original spar have gone over stern of gear having evidently struck leslie down a spar fell foremast be also over side having gone close to deck wreckage be still floating alongside attached to hull by rigging bulwark have disappeared save ten twelve foot on side extending from taffrail forward few foot in eye of ship deck have be swept clean of movable thing including longboat jolly boat have be stowed on main hatch quarter boat have also vanished from davit leaving only fragment of stem stern post hanging to tackle block to show what have happened to part of reef showed above water extent limit be very clearly defined by ripple agitation gentle though last be of surface of water above surf be breaking heavily on outer margin in cloud of gleaming white that flashed glittered in brilliant sunshine occasional undulation of swell came sweeping in across reef causing thousand swirl eddy to appear a traversed vast barrier of submerged rock coral leslie judged to be did not affect brig in least sending not even faintest tremor through by sick man judged that must have be deposited in present position at moment when level of sea be considerably higher than be just then craft be lying so close to inner edge of reef have be carried fifty yard must have be swept right over in case must undoubtedly have at once sunk in deep water lay between outer barrier reef island three mile away not two mile a miss trevor have estimated distance oh island when miss trevor have spoken of leslie pictured to tiny obscure bare atoll of perhaps mile in length not more than dozen foot high at highest point knowing from reckoning at time of fatal outbreak brig have not be near enough known land to render wreck upon possible land upon gazed with wondering eye measured fully three mile from one extremity to other with promise of considerably more beyond point in sight instead of being only few foot in height above sea level rose in gentle slope for about mile from beach of dazzlingly white sand fringed margin immediately opposite where brig lay then towered aloft to bare truncated peak soared six thousand foot into beautifully clear air whole island except two hundred foot of summit appeared to be densely clad with vegetation among many noble tree be to be seen of being resplendent with brilliant scarlet blossom fresh air have exercised distinctly revivifying effect upon leslie who after quarter of hour rest felt strong enough to move about deck with miss trevor assistance support accordingly proceeded forward a far a galley to profound satisfaction found to be undamaged with paraphernalia intact then went on to fore scuttle hatch of be on secured throwing back cover peered down into dark evil smelling place called several time without eliciting reply must fain have investigated further to extent of descending into interior companion considered that have by time done quite a much a be good for flatly refused to render least assistance toward further adventure be perforce compelled therefore to abandon intention retreat to own end of ship here availing of support of short remaining length of bulwark leaned over peered down into clear transparent water through must clearly see white surface of reef upon brig rested colour comparative smoothness of surface convinced that have be right in conjecture that must be of coral formation well sir demanded companion a carefully assisted to former resting place alongside companion what think of surroundings a whole to be perfectly candid with replied regard a decidedly promising although quite admit that be in very distinctly awkward predicament in first place fear that will have to reconcile to prospect of somewhat lengthened sojourn for unless have made very serious error in calculation believe be far out of usual track of ship only hope therefore of being seen taken off rest in possibility that wandering whaler may put in here for water that however be prospect upon will be unwise for to reckon overmuch must consequently pin faith upon ability to devise mean of escape for ourselves in few word mean that will have to set to work forthwith upon task of constructing craft big enough seaworthy enough to convey to spot from can take passage home again see that prospect appears sufficiently alarming to will not attempt to conceal from fact that mean a just now said rather lengthy stay here fortunately for material for construction of craft be here to hand brig will afford timber that require for purpose with plenty to spare be not altogether ignorant of art of naval architecture ship building then will probably find that there be sufficient stock of provision still left on board here to sustain during period of detention here to say nothing of resource of island look a though might be capable of affording ample subsistence of then there be beach ashore there that look quite good enough to serve a shipyard with nice little plateau adjoining upon purpose to erect tent for accommodation for think must be wise to remain aboard here longer than may prove absolutely necessary why exclaimed girl appear to have planned everything out already how fortunate be in having a companion if have not be hurt suppose must have be on deck when disaster occurred chance be that must then have be drowned with rest of poor fellow must have be left alone here to die miserably yes agreed leslie dryly accident be certainly blessing in disguise from point of view if can succeed in getting safely away from here putting in way of returning to friend will at least have accomplished something useful before die oh mr leslie exclaimed girl know did not mean that simply meant well mean oh dear how be to express so that will understand surely believe to be such utterly selfish heartless creature a to be glad that have escaped fate of others merely because by so doing be left alive to be helper protector indeed answered leslie heartily assure miss trevor paused abruptly thought for moment then resumed look here have be thrown together fate intermingled in very extraordinary manner be likely to remain together for time longer in fairly intimate association of sole companion of other do not think that under circumstance might a well drop formality of mr miss name be richard friend call dick must be glad if must do same very well answered companion will willingly do so if really wish must be only prudish to object under circumstance a put in turn may call flora if name commends to ear now sir please go on again from where left off let see mused leslie what be be talking about oh yes remember be explaining to that be glad have escaped drowning not so much because of use must be to ah interrupted companion can see that be rapidly getting better because be beginning to tease seriously mr le well dick then want to tell something more of plan what do propose to do first when be well enough to work again mean first thing propose to do answered leslie be to overhaul carpenter chest satisfy a to what tool be at command that done will at once begin to break up brig confining in first instance to removal from of just sufficient material to admit of construction of raft next thing will be to convey ashore such canvas rope other matter a may be needed for erection of comfortable commodious tent for accommodation ashore together with necessary furniture galley stove pot pan rest of be rather anxious to carry out much of plan with a little delay a possible because see weather be one of thing upon one can never depend gale may spring up at moment when doe brig will most probably go to piece be therefore exceedingly anxious to get comfortably established ashore before happens then if go well will at once proceed to pull poor old mermaid carefully to piece damaging planking a little a may be in process because be material out of purpose to build boat will do transferring everything on board may be likely to be of use to to shore before do anything else because must brig break up of much valuable material be certain to be lost then when have got everything safe ashore will begin upon boat see remarked flora with animation that have kind of crusoe existence before sort of perpetual picnic very well will undertake house keeping part of work keep tent clean tidy prepare nice appetising meal for when come home tired from work keep clothes in repair do washing generally look after domestic affair oh may smile a much a like dare say think that know nothing about such matter do flatter that will astonish yes laughed leslie expect will be fully prepared to be astonished continued a saw pout rising to companion lip did not quite mean that true have before vision of very charming young lady always somewhat haughty unapproachable always most elegantly costumed who used to be awe admiration of everybody aboard golden fleece have be endeavouring must confess with not altogether brilliant success to picture doing cooking washing ashore there know at least have be told that woman power of adaptability surpasses belief have already seen that posse to marvellous degree therefore despite what said just now will be astonished at nothing do prove able to achieve thank answered flora with touch of annoyance in tone know be perfectly horrid in day oh how far away seem now be afraid have not done much since then toward giving better opinion of will see oh dick please think badly of have done so very much for have be so invariably kind considerate to that can not bear idea that must think ill of owe life to must remember that did not know then know know answered dick laying hand reassuringly upon hers acted quite rightly in keeping at arm length for a say knew none of then must not be expected to discriminate between one for own part must not have have act otherwise than did so let say more about now if will kindly help think have better go below lie down for awhile must take care of myself for sake so went below again after flora have dressed leslie wound afresh latter stretched out on cabin locker sank into refreshing sleep while girl busied in preparation of such nourishing dish against awakening a resource of wreck afforded following day found leslie much stronger more like again so much so indeed that despite fair companion protestation set to work got carpenter tool chest on deck busied upon light task of sharpening chisel gouge plane adz ax so on generally putting everything in good order against time when must want to use with occasional period of vest occupied through whole of day at end of declared to be none worse rather better for exertion next day leslie devoted to task of lifting off fore hatch rigging light pair of sheers over hatchway by mean of two piece of rail that detached from short length of bulwark still remained standing abaft be purpose to give part of brig thorough overhaul prior to attempting anything else hoping that might find therein something must enable to construct raft without having recourse to timber of ship in be successful beyond utmost hope for among other matter found two stout packing case measuring twenty foot long by three foot wide by two foot deep containing long strip of gilt moulding such a be used in house decoration moulding carefully stowed away again prudent man not knowing whether in future might not despite gaudy appearance come in useful for something then carefully taking packing case apart shaped bottom planking of somewhat after semblance of bow run of ship be to say pointed two square end of by sawing to required shape then put case together again curving side to fit curve of bottom plank when be done found in possession of two boat like box flat bottomed boat of very respectable shape size next strengthened by nailing stout timber walings stringer to bottom side inside when careful caulking paying of seam completed by rendering watertight so pleased be with two contrivance of firstfruits of labour that although have not originally intended to use a boat of be quite sufficiently large to convey companion across tranquil water of lagoon stretched between brig island accordingly determined that before applying structure to ultimate purpose must make use of one of in to effect preliminary exploration of island accordingly fitted interior of one of with couple of seat one in middle for other near stern for miss trevor accommodation secured to side stout cleat in suitable position suitably bored for reception of pair of rowlock length of three inch planking down middle shaped with spokeshave into pair of paddle completed equipment of what turned out to be very serviceable handy boat construction of two pontoon a leslie called together with supplementary labour of fitting up one of to serve a boat consumed nearly week be so thoroughly satisfactory when finished that constructor regarded time a well spent last item of task making of pair of paddle short oar be completed a sun be sinking below horizon on ninth day after stranding of mermaid be arranged that if weather held fine barometer continued steady next day must be devoted to visit to island chapter nine island paradise next morning dawned a fine a heart must wish with cloudless sky of matchless blue glass showed rising rather than falling tendency immediately after breakfast therefore leslie emerged from brig cabin provided with basket of provision neatly packed by fair flora hand daintily covered with spotlessly white cloth deposited in stern sheet of boat then addressed sailor who stood at gangway watching proceeding with eager interest now sailor come along down boy be good dog then come down sir say sailor wagged tail excitedly barked in response making great show of being about to jump down into boat baulking at last moment looking round anxiously to see whether beloved mistress be coming then approaching side again barking response to leslie blandishment dexterously avoiding effort of latter to capture drag down into boat so on ad infinitum at length however miss trevor made appearance radiant vision in white armed against assault of too ardent sun with white lace parasol one of many spoil of late skipper speculative investment approached head of side ladder leslie have rigged for accommodation then a began to descend sailor hesitated no longer fearing lest must lose passage sprang down into frail craft with abandon nearly capsized placed in eye of boat obediently to signal from leslie hand moment flora have taken place in stern leslie be bearing off from brig side with load of three for sailor be nearly a heavy a mistress boat proved to be somewhat crank leslie have momentary spasm of regret that have not tied up dog left aboard brig instead of bringing with water be quite smooth sat still passage be consequently accomplished without mishap in about hour from moment of starting three stood safely on dazzlingly white beach of coral sand stretched for about mile in direction from spot where have landed from here hull of brig looked little more than small inconspicuous spot against snow white cloud of surf broke eternally upon outer edge of barrier reef leslie made mental note to pull off aboard again betimes in afternoon for must be practically impossible to hit off position in darkness beach on stood be of great width sixty seventy foot wide perhaps from water edge to spot where abruptly met luxuriant growth of thick guinea grass seemed to form turf of island immediately opposite spot where have landed there stretched clear space of turf measuring about quarter of square mile in area entirely unencumbered by bush tree shrub of kind leslie recognised a spot that have already fixed upon while aboard brig a site for camp nearer inspection of now satisfied that be eminently suitable for purpose indeed must not be improved upon beyond confines of open space to right left rear of shrub small bush grew at first sparsely further on in greater profusion until ultimately more le scattered growth merged into dense apparently impenetrable bush forest with entire island appeared to be clothed when leslie eye have first fallen upon island uneasy suspicion have arisen within so comparatively large important area must almost of necessity be inhabited have not be altogether free from doubt a to what in such case disposition of inhabitant might be toward companion have idea that have somewhere heard read that native of certain of pacific island be addicted to cannibalism felt that if by evil chance particular island must happen to be inhabited by such race cup of misfortune must be full consequently work of constructing pontoon have be frequently broken into by long anxious examination of island through telescope in search for indication of presence of inhabitant examination have entirely failed to reveal such indication hope have gradually arisen in mind that after island might prove to be uninhabited be not yet by mean satisfied that hope be well grounded determined that first visit of to place must be mainly devoted to further search examination before doing anything further therefore suggested to flora that must walk entire length of beach keeping to grass a far a possible in order to leave surface of sand quite undisturbed so that might be able to carefully systematically scrutinise in search of footprint for argued that if savage really existed on island must scarcely have failed to discover existence of wreck during week that have lain upon reef in case must most probably have gathered at water edge at nearest possible point for purpose of examining since particular strip of beach happened to be wreck than other point of island felt tolerably certain that footprint must be found upon if anywhere strong point in favour of assumption that island be uninhabited be fact that wreck have not be approached by canoe for leslie felt that if have be seen by native must scarcely have left unvisited for entire week careful systematic inspection of entire length of beach consumed hour be without result human footprint be anywhere to be seen leslie be confident that if person have walked upon sand within week must have left plain indication behind for wind throughout time have be too gentle to obliterate mark of kind a be evidenced by fact that footprint of bird be everywhere clearly distinguishable once indeed thought have found what sought upon closer inspection sign proved to be track of turtle have come up on sand to lay egg a be evidenced by fact that egg be found few of appropriated although investigation thus far be reassuring leslie be not yet by mean satisfied wished to obtain much clearer idea than yet possessed of actual extent general shape of island only way by be to be accomplished at same time general survey of effected be to ascend to summit of mountain promised to be decidedly arduous task in climate especially a have be cooped up for so long time within narrow confines of small vessel with very limited space for taking exercise determined nevertheless to attempt feeling that must never be perfectly easy in mind until have done so accordingly set out forthwith on way path of course there be none be of little moment for knew that so long a continued to ascend step took so much nearer to summit be agreeably surprised to find that bush undergrowth at distance have appeared to be absolutely impenetrable be not nearly so dense a have looked be consequently enabled by adopting somewhat serpentine route to make very fair upward progress although occasionally encountered spot where passage have to be forced where flora dainty white costume suffered somewhat have not gone very far upon way before leslie discovered to great relief satisfaction that certainly need have fear of starvation even in event of being doomed to remain where be for rest of life for a went fruit bearing tree of many kind be found in great profusion growing luxuriantly many of loaded with most luscious fruit mango banana plantain lime custard apple bread fruit be among variety leslie recognised there be many others with be unfamiliar therefore regarded with more le suspicion saw sign of animal of kind forest seemed to be alive with bird extraordinary tameness rather fearlessness of seemed to argue unfamiliarity with man two hour of arduous climbing brought adventurer to most romantic spot where small stream of deliciously pure cold fresh water gushed out from under huge overhanging moss grown rock bank of rivulet being clothed with fern of most lovely delicate variety while surrounding sward be gay with flower of strange form most exquisitely delicate beautiful combination of colouring huge tree bearing large blossom of vivid scarlet instead of leaf leslie identified a bois immortelle overhung spot a pair be by time feeling somewhat tired hungry seated upon yielding sward leslie surrendering lunch basket to flora latter spread cloth on grass set out a dainty enticing luncheon a supplemented by fruit with leslie have filled pocket two hungry people need ever desire to find before narrow vista through tree afforded traveller glimpse of sea stretching blue foam flecked below right out to horizon a leslie judged from glimpse that must have accomplished considerably more than climb pair lingered for time over meal resting tired limb enjoying loveliness of surroundings then after interval of about hour half again proceeded on way making better progress now than did at first a undergrowth tree became from point steadily thinner a progressed until at length be able to catch occasional glimpse of summit for be aiming finally emerged from bush altogether to find breasting steep slope soil of be composed of fine scoria ash just a anticipated ejaculated leslie a stooped to examine ground island be volcanic yonder peak top of will notice appears to have be broken off be crater be alarmed continued seeing startled expression leap into companion eye volcano be undoubtedly extinct have probably be so for age for if will look around at vegetation will notice that bear remotest sign indication of ever having be disturbed by volcanic action be not botanist enough to be able to judge age of tree that see below thousand of must be considerably more than century old a be evident that eruption have taken place since started to grow think may rest satisfied that disturbance be in least likely to occur during occupation of place let push on be nearly one o'clock be anxious to get up there to have good look round make complete survey of dominion accordingly resumed climb after further three quarter of hour of arduous labour steepness of acclivity looseness of soil rendering progress exceedingly slow difficult finally reached goal to find standing a be upon rim of huge basin about third of mile in diameter three hundred foot deep inner side sloping almost perpendicularly bottom forming small lake perfectly bare side be much too steep soil altogether too loose treacherous to render attempt at descent advisable even have wished did not sufficed that whole appearance of place confirmed previous conviction that volcano be extinct without wasting second glance upon at once turned attention to scene beneath have happened by stroke of good luck to hit upon very highest point in lip of crater be thus enabled to see from spot on stood entire extent of island to uttermost limit found much bigger than have anticipated in plan bore rough resemblance to right angled triangle body of have be so twisted a to cause apex to bear to right base of triangle opposite to wreck of brig must be seen a tiny toy almost immediately beneath faced south east appeared to measure between three four mile across between two extreme point while side corresponding to perpendicular of triangle be according to leslie estimate nearly if not quite ten mile long crater be situated not in centre of island quite close to south eastern side accounted for steepness of acclivity that explorer have be obliged to climb northward of crater after first five hundred foot of steep decline formed summit proper ground undulating picturesquely fell away in quite gentle slope to most northerly extremity of island leslie judged to be fairly bold headland barrier reef upon brig lay stranded be visible with startling distinctness throughout entire length from point leslie observed that formed natural most efficient breakwater to lagoon stretched along entire south east shore of island curving gradually round in crescent form until joined island at most westerly extremity while away to eastward there be deep water passage between reef island of about eighth of mile in width turning attention once more to island leslie observed that be wooded to uttermost extremity that beach be to be discovered in direction save that upon have landed ground appearing everywhere else to slope precipitously to sea in form of bold cliff a savage must naturally build village close to beach to secure facility for fishing operation leslie be further confirmed in hope that island be uninhabited especially a looked carefully in direction for smoke of fire found none then allowed eye to wander farther afield intently scanned entire visible surface of ocean in search of sail without success be not surprised at for knew island to be situated far out of track of ship save perhaps whaler craft might be driven by adverse wind out of proper course although be first instinct of castaway sailor to maintain ceaseless watch for sail ex lieutenant knew that chance of rescue for companion by passing ship be altogether too slight to be seriously given place in plan for future nevertheless for moment entertained idea of erecting flagstaff on summit hoisting flag upon for purpose of attracting attention of ship might perchance pas place very brief consideration of project sufficed to convince that benefit to be derived therefrom be much too problematical to justify expenditure of so much labour time a must involve moreover have conviction that ship sighting so conspicuous object a island in spot shown upon chart a clear sea must approach give place overhaul although leslie most careful scrutiny failed to reveal sign of presence of ship be astonished to discover that there be other land in sight from lofty lookout clearly saw two other eminence peering above horizon to westward one bearing a nearly a possible due west other about south west while away in north western quarter believed detected loom of land at very great distance two island in clear view be apparently about same distance away distance from delicate filmy appearance estimated to be quite hundred mile knew that must be like own mountainous from fact that showed above horizon sun be by time settling perceptibly in western sky lovely a be prospect stretched around leslie felt that time have arrived for to be moving once more accordingly threw final parting glance around began descent of mountain to ascend be one thing to descend quite in little more than hour from moment of leaving summit found once more on beach beside boat then greatly fatigued by unwonted exertion with memory of thoroughly enjoyable day fresh upon paddled leisurely off to brig reaching just a sun be dipping below horizon experience of day only whetted leslie must be confessed flora appetite for further exploration adventure former in particular felt that must never be satisfied until have circumnavigated island critically examined yard of coast line to do boat be of course necessary at least something of much more seaworthy character than pontoon in have adventured passage to island have nothing of kind after flora have retired to cabin however leslie spent hour so on deck smoking pipe pondering upon problem of how to supply deficiency when at length turned in believed saw way following morning accordingly found astir bright early eager to put idea into immediate execution first got on deck again pontoon that have used on previous day proceeded to considerably strengthen by addition of further wale stringer beam when have got to liking proceeded to treat other in precisely similar fashion then fitted with rudder next having carefully disposed two pontoon on deck with longitudinal centre line parallel nine foot apart first decked completely in leaving only manhole eighteen inch square in middle of deck then proceeded to frame fit together thoroughly strong platform twelve foot square so arranged that must be securely bolted to gunwale of two pontoon in position occupied relatively to other done launched whole arrangement overboard found proud happy possessor of what for want of better more appropriate name called catamaran structure consisting of course of two pontoon arranged parallel to other with water space of six foot between firmly strongly connected with other by platform whole forming very buoyant commodious raft capable of being rigged promising to behave exceedingly well under sail in smooth even in moderately rough water to rig singular looking craft with enormous mainsail jib be very difficult matter wreckage alongside furnishing with requisite spar canvas rigging of rudder be then furnished with tiller two tiller being connected together with cross piece be controlled by central tiller actuated rudder simultaneously construction completion of catamaran cost leslie three whole week of arduous labour when be finished felt that time have be well spent next thing in order be to subject craft to sea trial leslie at once proceeded to do left flora on board brig with sailor a companion protector not caring to risk girl safety on catamaran until reliability sea going quality of latter have be tested promised that must not be absent more than two hour at utmost when if everything proved satisfactory must return take for cruise suggested that might devote interval to preparation of luncheon basket to serve for day then hoisting sail pushed off got craft under way first act after getting away from brig be to test behaviour of catamaran under sail by putting through series of evolution such a tacking jibing so on then finding that proved to be marvellously handy tested speed off on wind trade wind happened to be piping up quite strong that day be therefore very favourable occasion upon to subject craft to test a leslie desired be not only delighted astonished at quite unexpected turn of speed that craft developed being doubtless due to enormous spread of canvas that peculiar form of construction enabled to carry skimmed down wind with speed of swallow be scarcely le swift when close hauled looking up within four point of wind more than satisfied with behaviour of catamaran in smooth water leslie next headed to north east steering for passage between island reef led to open sea distance to be traversed be about four mile quaint looking craft covered in seventeen minute by leslie watch passing in instant from smooth water out on to tumbling surface of sapphire blue creaming foaming sea with long rather formidable swell under running be sort of sea to find out for leslie weak point in structure if have for next half hour while carrying on driving craft full tilt against sea under heavy pressure of enormous unreefed sail watched craft carefully anxiously ready at first sign of weakness to up helm run back to shelter of lagoon such sign revealed on contrary not only stood up to canvas a stiff a house slid along over high running sea a buoyantly a empty cask hanging to windward with tenacity filled happy owner with wonder throwing little spray over weather bow occasionally be true otherwise going along a dry a bone speed too be truly astounding have poor old mermaid be ataunto alongside catamaran must have sailed round round at length thoroughly satisfied with trial fully convinced of absolute seaworthiness of craft leslie tacked catamaran working like top even in heavy sea be running putting up helm bore away back for lagoon reaching brig once more after absence of about hour half found flora awaiting attired in good serviceable comfortably warm serge gown for have warned that must find strong breeze trifle chill out at sea with lunch basket packed ready be work of le than minute to transfer basket from deck of brig to of catamaran when leaving sailor to take care of former much to disgust once more pushed off headed straight out for passage skirting inner edge of reef noting a slid rapidly along that inner margin of reef be simply teeming with fish then almost before have time to realise be in open sea once more heading away to northward westward with mainsheet eased off to utmost limit main boom square out to starboard leslie allowed offing of about mile a must enable not only to get very good general idea of island a whole must also enable to carefully examine coast line easternmost extremity of island between barrier reef deep water passage lay be bold headland thickly overgrown with tall stately forest tree terminating in rocky cliff about one hundred fifty foot high that dipped sheer down into sea beyond to northward coast line curved inward somewhat to most northerly point on island forming what might almost be termed willow bay willow be to say in point of depth of not of depth of water for whole north easterly coast line of island consisted of precipitous cliff averaging about hundred foot in height with water enough alongside to float biggest ship be ever launched if one might judge from colour there be sign possibility of beach anywhere along here be comforting to leslie whose mind somehow still clung rather tenaciously to idea of possible savage nothing mortal must by possibility land on eastern seaboard must savage be likely to establish in spot so completely inaccessible from sea moreover entire country from ridge backbone of island ran from crater down to most northerly point of island be densely covered with vegetation showing faintest sign of clearing cultivation so leslie began once more to feel reassured most northerly point of island be reached rounded in forty minute from moment of leaving lagoon bearing away round cape flora a dick insisted on naming bold headland formed eastern extremity of island most northerly point be like other lofty vertical cliff timber crowned to very verge descending vertically into sea flora declared that only possible designation for be point richard rounding point richard then hauling in mainsheet voyager found suddenly under lee of land in smooth water save for long undulation of swell came sweeping up to from southward be now coasting down western side of island here again leslie be gratified to discover that conclusion arrived at by during visit to summit be correct there be beach throughout whole length of coast line nothing sheer perpendicular cliff everywhere although in place cliff rose higher than twenty foot above sea level finally arrived off south westerly extremity of island agreed to name mermaid head found skirting outer edge of reef at distance of about one hundred yard from surf line lost in wonderment admiration of great wall of snowy foam spray leapt sparkling like cloud of jewel forty foot into clear sunlit air then re entered lagoon ran alongside brig to exuberant delight of sailor three hour from moment of starting having have most enjoyable sail satisfied definitely that since savage existed on own side of island place must of necessity be altogether free from unwelcome presence thenceforward leslie mind be completely free from at least that one anxiety now having provided with mean not only to pas freely rapidly between brig shore also to venture out to sea in chase of ship must occasion to do so arise leslie felt free to proceed with execution of great plan for establishment of dockyard ashore construction of craft sufficiently substantial seaworthy to convey companion back to world of civilisation first part of task consisted in erection of spacious tent on shore for accommodation of companion proposed to do with aid of old sail on board brig reserving new one such canvas a must find for making of suit of sail for proposed new boat accordingly got out old sail deposited on deck of catamaran together with quantity of cordage block other gear crowbar pickax hammer shovel axe number of miscellaneous odds end that thought must be useful conveyed whole to shore then entering wood selected first nine suitable sapling that must find cut down afterwards conveying one at time with considerable labour to site that have chosen for tent next dug six hole in ground three for gable end in four of hole reared four of stoutest sapling to form four corner of tent setting carefully upright by mean of temporary stay ramming loose soil round about foot until stood quite firmly then midway between pole be to form gable end of tent reared two others ten foot longer than first four last being intended to support ridge pole of structure next hoisted into position securely lashed then similarly raised eaves pole into position lashed thus completing skeleton of tent side end of structure together with central partition be formed of sail laboriously hoisted into position by mean of tackle laced to ridge pole securely pinned to ground with stake spare main course drawn over ridge pole sloping down over eaves drawn tight round by rope spliced into leech secured to ground with stout tent peg completed whole to prevent flooding of tent in wet weather leslie took precaution to dig good deep trench round to receive rain water from dug to carry off next matter demanding attention be furnishing of tent need of bedstead be easily met by driving four stout stake into ground connected at top by side end pole to length of stout canvas be attached by lacing structure be then ready to receive mattress bedding generally cabin lamp efficiently illuminated miss trevor half of tent while lamp taken from steward berth afforded leslie light needed to undress by then cabin table locker cushion deck chair ship slender stock of book variety of odds end conducive to comfort be transferred from brig to shore together with galley stove appurtenance pair then went into residence in new abode may be said found much more roomy airy comfortable than former quarter aboard brig galley stove must be mentioned be set up outside to leeward of tent cooking operation being conducted in open air erection of tent from start to finish absorbed fortnight of leslie time involved lavish expenditure of labour must have foreseen must a afterwards confessed have started much le ambitiously now ex lieutenant found confronted by truly formidable task compared with have gone before be mere trifle consisted in overhauling cargo of brig with view of appropriating everything must by possibility prove of use to either during a hoped temporary sojourn upon island in construction of boat be to take away from leslie have become aware from remark made by purchas that brig be taking out very considerable quantity of machinery be stowed in bottom of ship on top of there be vast miscellaneous assortment of mixed good of almost conceivable description be that leslie wished to get hold of overhaul accordingly one morning went off to brig proceeded to lift off main hatch disclosing to view number of bale packing case mostly of size weight that must be impossible for to deal with single handed saw that before must be possible for to raise even fourth part of must be necessary for to have assistance of certain appliance such a sheers tackle etcetera succeeded in dragging few of lightest of on deck opening first case opened proved to contain china breakfast dinner tea toilet service very handsome apparently very expensive must be exceedingly useful to for to tell truth brig pantry have never be too liberally stocked carelessness of steward combined with heavy weather experienced by brig have played havoc with therefore fastened up case again lowered carefully over side on to deck of catamaran then got hold of bale of rug told must help to make flora half of tent more comfortable too went down over side next case small one bearing appeared to be private address contained dainty little sewing machine possibly useful also to flora followed rug next case came to hand though large one be unexpectedly light so leslie roused on deck opened contained number of bird cage such a be used for canary of be of large size large enough to accommodate dozen of little songster be very handsome apparently expensive be not in least likely to be of service must therefore only be in way so overboard went ruthlessly case however leslie kept a wood screw might possibly be useful there be more package at hand must be manipulated without appliance so leslie replaced hatch drew tarpaulin over battened down then made sail for shore a catamaran ran in grounded on beach flora came down to meet well dick said name came glibly enough to lip now what luck have met with not bad answered leslie have not be able to do very much for case be mostly too large to handle without tackle have not thus far found anything will go toward building little ship have here set of china will gladden heart replenish pantry rug for floor of compartment sewing machine that may possibly find handy later on what have brought will be useful for asked nothing answered leslie only other case must get at contained bird cage bird cage repeated with burst of hearty laughter why brig must be quite general emporium yes leslie assented soberly quite expect will prove so see place like valparaiso import imaginable thing from europe must not surprise to find even piano watch jewellery a well a clothing book such like among cargo piano exclaimed flora with delighted surprise oh dick if must find piano please please bring ashore for be passionately fond of music piano must be such solace to here if there be piano in ship will have answered leslie poor little girl must be horribly slow for cooped up here practically alone a be be poor companion know at best of time henceforth will be so busy that will be left more alone than ever yes will certainly have piano if there be one in brig now dick know did not mean that about being poor companion answered flora on contrary be very best companion that girl in unfortunate situation must possibly have for be before above else gentleman chivalrous courteous tender hearted gentleman with whom feel a safe a though be brother then be brave strong resourceful so utterly unselfish that amaze there will do thank laughed leslie do wickedly wish to make conceited because will if say much more in strain a to brother hope look upon a brother do why yes almost answered girl little doubtfully do not wish to regard a brother dick um meditated of course must be better than nothing oh on whole think have desire that must regard a brother there now of course have offended what as cad be be not be not will not have say so exclaimed girl passionately have not offended went on be only that be feeling little depressed to day mean oh can not explain therewith turned away abruptly beat hasty retreat to shelter of tent leslie looked after a though for moment felt inclined to follow then thought better of meditatively proceeded to land thing that have brought ashore from brig done hunted up axe wandered off to wood in search of couple of spar to serve a sheers for working main hatchway cutting down of conveyance of to shore towing of off alongside brig provided with plenty of work for remainder of day therefore did not again meet companion until day work be over sat down to dinner be apparent that by time young lady have completely recovered spirit carefully avoided reference to little scene have occurred earlier in day so leslie thought best to let matter drop although continued to puzzle over for several day thereafter following day saw leslie once again aboard brig where busied in getting spar in on deck converting into sheers fitting by mean of tackle stay rearing into position securing be long heavy job occupying entire day sending back to island at night completely fagged out on succeeding day went off to brig early in fact before flora made appearance strenuously devoted to task of breaking out content of main hold spent entire morning in rousing case bale package of kind up on deck after partaking of hurried lunch carefully opened examined content two of largest found to contain respectively men woman clothing contained book music fourth contained stationery drawing paper fifth contained roll of silk linen drapery ribbon lace haberdashery lowered on to deck of catamaran for conveyance to shore others contained roll of wall paper ironmongery photographic material drug with property us of be unacquainted lawn mower garden roller other matter did not appeal to sent over side to keep bird cage company then when sun be within hour of western horizon left brig returned to island with booty flora seemed greatly amused when leslie told what have brought ashore why dick exclaimed there be enough clothing in two case to last for rest of life to say nothing of third case say be full of unmade silk linen surely be scarcely necessary to cumber with last be who know answered leslie be impossible to say how long may be compelled to remain on island intend to save single article thing may by possibility be useful to be not going to take chance for aught can tell may be beyond power to construct craft a have in mind in case may be compelled to remain here until may be year hence ship come along rescue have wish to alarm dear be surprising how often term now rose to lip how difficult found to avoid letting slip out can not conceal from must be unfair to conceal from possibility that may be obliged to spend quite appreciable portion of life here intend to make very fullest provision possible for such contingency be frightened continued catching sudden look of gravity leapt into face will not be detained here moment longer than can help oh dick be not so much that murmured be terrible anxiety that poor father must be suffering that worry ah yes agreed leslie can quite understand poor gentleman feeling why did think of before suddenly ejaculated look here will write message seal up in bottle set adrift clear of island to morrow there be just chance in thousand perhaps ten thousand that may be picked up in case not only will father anxiety be relieved help rescue will be brought to will write statement immediately after dinner chapter ten discovery confession statement that dick leslie that evening wrote ran a follows finder of document be earnestly requested to communicate content to lloyd british admiralty leading london newspaper sir ernest trevor kcmg judge of majesty supreme court bombay on day of in year ship golden fleece captain rainhill sailed from london for melbourne having on board among other passenger miss flora trevor daughter of above named sir ernest trevor mr richard leslie on night of day of in same year ship reckoning at noon on day being latitude degree minute north longitude degree minute west golden fleece be run into sunk by unknown steamer during dense fog only known survivor of wreck consisted of above named flora trevor richard leslie seaman named george baker belonging to ship three person be picked up rescued on following day by brig mermaid of london james potter master sailed from last named port on th day of bound for valparaiso on date of rescue of three above named person by brig captain potter met with accident from died on th day of mate thomas purchas succeeded to command of vessel then purchas gave way to drink on night of th day of committed suicide by jumping overboard thereupon mr richard leslie who have at one time be officer in british navy assumed command of brig with intention of navigating to valparaiso during passage of cape horn however mermaid encountered contrary wind very heavy weather in be dismasted with loss of three of crew brig be then put under jury rig so far a resource of vessel permitted be not of sufficiently efficient character to permit of being worked to windward persistent succession of contrary wind drove deep into heart of pacific ocean where during gale sprang up on night of th of be driven ashore became total wreck on outlying reef of unknown island not marked on chart situate in latitude degree minute south longitude degree minute west during gale mermaid be again dismasted mr leslie who be at wheel be knocked down injured on head by falling wreckage in consequence of be conveyed below where miss trevor remained in attendance upon lay insensible for nearly thirty six hour be during time that brig struck on be driven nearly entire width of reef where now lie only survivor of disaster be miss trevor mr leslie who undoubtedly owe life to fact that be below when brig struck be urgently requested that help be sent to a quickly a possible a island upon have be wrecked lie quite out of usual track of shipping prospect of rescue by passing vessel be consequently small signed flora trevor richard leslie dated day of there exclaimed leslie a read over completed document ought to bring help if bottle happens to be picked up must not count upon for may drift about for year before be found however will do what can to attract attention to mere floating bottle be very inconspicuous object may be passed within hundred foot without being noticed will pack in good big packing case before sending adrift floating case especially if conspicuously marked stand hundred time a good chance of being picked up a doe mere bottle accordingly on following day bottle with document hermetically sealed within be taken on board brig carefully packed away in centre of large packing case filled with fine shaving from other case then entire exterior of case be painted black white in bold chequer pattern with word please open in bold red letter on side a soon a paint be dry leslie put on board catamaran running three mile to leeward of island launched overboard case being light floated high with bold chequer pattern formed conspicuous object calculated to attract attention at distance not exceeding mile then returned to brig with flora assistance resumed task of breaking out cargo there be need to state in detail content of case bale that hoisted on deck suffice to say that cargo being what be known a general comprised almost imaginable thing much of being of character must either conduce to present comfort be possibly useful to in future only small proportion of whole therefore went overboard since remainder must in case be irretrievably lost to proper owner leslie have scruple whatever in appropriating to own use good thus appropriated comprised infinite variety of article among may be enumerated enough lamp to illuminate small village few picture with adorned interior of tent household furniture of kind such a bedstead with bedding wardrobe dressing other table chest of drawer domestic utensil of kind cutlery china glass carpet huge pier glass to flora infinite delight magnificent kaps grand piano then there be more clothing enough to last for remainder of life case of repeating rifle revolver case containing ammunition for same quantity of valuable jewellery watch etcetera case of perfumery handsome fan bric brac in short sufficiency of everything to enable to convert humble tent into most comfortable elegant luxurious abode however be not even most valuable find there be case containing pick shovel other implement steel wheelbarrow case containing large assortment of carpenter joiner tool case of assorted nail screw very long packing case upon being opened be found to contain handsome highly finished set of spar evidently intended for yacht of about fifteen ton measurement close to be found case bearing same mark a first containing two complete set of cotton canvas sail clearly intended for same craft valuable find not only filled leslie heart with immeasurable delight set eagerly searching for further case similarly marked be disappointed for next day search resulted in finding third case content of consisted of complete set of gun metal belaying pin other fitting together with number of patent block single double threefold that have difficulty in identifying a intended for same craft little woman exclaimed find be worth more than rest of put together spar sail will save month of work shorten term of imprisonment here by just that much be intended for craft of about size have in mind now of course will design of exactly such dimension a will fit be not glad of course be dick replied be glad of anything will ease work for for indeed have be making perfect slave of ever since landed here discovery of thing have suppose relieved mind of great deal of anxiety hope that now will be able to take matter more easily be afraid said dick there still remains great deal to be done before can think of taking matter easily must complete examination of cargo for one thing when be done must begin to pull poor old brig to piece for sake of timber that being only material available out of to build boat surely there be such very urgent need for hurry over work be there dick remonstrated flora oh yes there be insisted dick for reason that if gale be to spring up brig must most probably go to piece then everything in must be lost excepting of course such matter a might be washed ashore timber of be built must be more le smashed up generally made le fit for use than will be if be afforded time to break up carefully see assented flora thoughtfully in case suppose have better go to work again have so resumed operation dick descending into hold slinging case one by one then coming on deck taking tackle fall to winch heaving package on deck while flora hung on to tail end of rope to prevent slipping round winch barrel be easy work for girl such a must do without becoming greatly fatigued for man be hard labour indeed such a sent back to island at night almost too weary to eat day two later met with find that more than rewarded for toil rendered further continuance of unnecessary among first case that came upon be long heavy one marked like containing spar sail upon being opened be found to contain copper sheathing already cut to shape carefully marked there be also in same case small light flat box containing two drawing to scale one being sheer half deck body plan of very smart handsome wholesome looking cutter thirty five foot long on water line ten foot beam while other be drawing similarly marked to copper sheathing showing exactly where how sheet ought to be applied near case be similarly marked very large case a to length breadth of great depth wondering what must possibly contain leslie eagerly opened found in complete set of steel frame for cutter packed one inside other marked figured in accordance with sheet of plan finally not to dwell at undue length upon discovery important though be also found keel stem stern post rudder trunk deck beam wale stringer skin deck planking in short scrap item of material fitting required for little vessel so that nothing remained to put whole together more fortunate find must by possibility be conceived for two people circumstanced a companion be go without saying that whole of valuable material be most carefully promptly transferred to beach a last item of be unloaded from catamaran leslie flung down upon sand exclaimed in accent of infinite relief there be good job well done care not now though old hooker must go to piece to morrow now returned flora will be able to give little holiday take much needed rest will not promise that will dick please have be looking very anxious worried of late have be toiling whole day through day after day in hot sun be sure such arduous work be not good for indeed have more than once be tempted to refuse to help because knew that if did must be compelled to desist when saw how eager be thought must be cruel must not bring to be that even though felt that must be for good have be infinitely good to flora answered leslie with deep feeling infinitely good infinitely patient while have be impatient exacting in impatience can see now have worked cruelly hard girl put hand over mouth will not say word until talk sensibly declared idea of saying that worked hard ' why what did be child play girl of fifteen must have done without being distressed please let hear say such thing again insisted imperiously immediately adding now will promise to take day rest to morrow will not dick certainly if wish assented leslie will take day holiday go fishing along inner edge of reef will by mean agreed flora have often thought that must like little fish a change of diet be getting most horribly tired of salt beef pork tinned meat have be so feverishly busy did not like to ask then said leslie with severity please do again how many time must tell that have only to express wish to have gratified if can do before will believe do believe dick indeed do answered softly know that there be nothing must ask that must not willingly gladly do for if must be kindest most generous most chivalrous gentleman that ever met stop please exclaimed leslie with sudden fierceness of energy frightened girl must not say such thing a will day forget have not yet heard story must tell day flora yes time be drawing near when will be imperatively necessary for to tell story then will see what opinion of will be so really have history remarked girl people on board golden fleece suspected a much freely said so a have watched from time to time have observed sudden fit of melancholy have often thought that must have be right in surmise yes will tell story dick will be profoundly interested in be certain if be sad one a more than half suspect will have whole hearted sympathy may have to tell will never alter opinion of may have met with misfortune suffered grievous wrong nothing will ever persuade that man a have shown to be can ever have done anything of friend need be ashamed tell now dick if will no answered leslie resolutely though longed for promised sympathy more intensely than have ever longed for anything else in life will not tell now time be not yet ripe will be ere long then will tell so be agreed flora until then can wait now let go to dinner for see by appearance of cooking stove that be ready be sure must need on following morning in accordance with over night arrangement got on board catamaran after breakfast sailing out to reef anchored on inner edge started to fish appeared however to have chanced upon unfavourable spot to start with for after about hour effort be rewarded by capture of only four fish so small a to be quite worthless except for bait leslie therefore tripped anchor setting canvas determined to try luck somewhat further to north eastward entrance channel have be under way ten minute slipping along over very inner edge of reef with deep water of lagoon on port hand when flora who be peering abstractedly down into deep pellucid water suddenly cried out oh look dick look what be huge object over there be wreck where away asked leslie gazing out over reef down there in water answered girl pointing to spot over port quarter can not see now because of light on water saw most distinctly moment ago sailed almost directly over thought looked like sunken wreck asked leslie yes answered girl certainly did be a large a ship have somewhat appearance of one well will go back have look at said leslie bearing up for moment then putting helm down tacked bringing catamaran round in such manner a to pas back over practically same ground a before presently sighted same object again huge something certainly bore resemblance to hull of ship lying submerged upon sandy bottom of lagoon about fifty fathom from inner edge of reef be too far away from however to distinguish clearly light reflected from surface of water rendering view of indistinct leslie therefore time wore catamaran round lowering sail allowed to drift gently forward with way that still have on time passed right over object when a soon a catamaran be fairly clear of let go anchor allowed craft to drive astern again until floated fair square over mysterious thing then lying down flat upon deck of catamaran peered straight down into crystal clear water in shadow of craft saw beneath what be unquestionably weed grown hull of ship of antiquated model of four hundred ton measurement be heading straight for reef with stern pointing toward island a leslie lay there intently studying detail presently made out stout rope cable leading from starboard hawse pipe toward reef end of being buried in sand posture be such a to suggest to experienced eye of sailor that have driven over reef somewhat in same way a mermaid have done unlike latter craft have cleared altogether have there be brought to anchor subsequently sinking where lay seemed to have be three masted ship for leslie must see stump of fore main mast believed must make out stump of mizzenmast broken close off at deck have appearance of craft of somewhere about elizabethan period being built with excessive amount of sheer very high peaked narrow poop upon after end of remains of what be probably three poop lantern must still be distinguished have slight list to starboard have in course of long submergence settled become buried in sand to extent of about depth of hull what nationality may have be be of course impossible to tell clothed a be in rankly luxuriant growth of weed leslie carefully noted in pocket book exact bearing of wreck then lifting anchor resumed fishing effort being rewarded with excellent day sport leslie now set to work with earnestness enthusiasm upon great task of putting together cutter component part of have so fortunately happened to form part of mermaid cargo first thing did be to name prospective craft flora a compliment to companion now flora when completed must be craft of very respectable dimension far too bulky indeed to be launched by simple process of pushing off beach into water a one must launch small boat method of launching therefore be matter requiring consideration must have to be arranged for before stroke of work be done upon boat thought matter over carefully at length arrived at conclusion that there be nothing for to build boat upon properly constructed launching way for must require considerable quantity of good stout timber properly squared provision of involved task of very considerable labour difficulty tree there be in plenty on island of ample dimension for purpose how be single handed to get down upon beach even after have be trimmed squared how be to square without sawpit pit saw have having found several among other tool formed part of brig cargo to work tool single handed be impossibility weighing difficulty in mind dick at length came to conclusion that there be alternative to draw upon brig for necessary material accordingly went rather reluctantly to work upon task of breaking up poor old mermaid decided that deck beam of brig must be most suitable for purpose to obtain be necessary to break up deck long arduous job only to be accomplished with hard labour assistance of elaborate system of tackle be while be thus employed that first break occurred in fine weather have prevailed ever since arrival at island began with gradual dying away of trade wind followed by heavy banking up of dark thundery looking cloud along western horizon with cessation of wind temperature rose to such pitch work became impossibility dick be at length reluctantly compelled to knock off return to shore much to flora satisfaction for be continually in dread lest untiring feverish energy with laboured must result in suffering serious breakdown a be too hot even to walk about pair be perforce compelled to remain inactive afternoon flora inwardly decided that must be good opportunity for dick to relate to promised story needed very considerable amount of persuasion coaxing to induce to do so eventually yielded told whole miserable history from beginning to end winding up with word thus find here to day disgraced ruined man under assumed name without prospect hope of description with only hundred pound wherewith to begin new career in alien land possibility so far a can see of ever being able to establish innocence so win reconciliation with poor proud heart broken father be not for fact that be here must be restored to friend with a little delay a may be must be well content to end day here on unknown island alone forgotten by indeed think more than likely that a soon a have discharged duty to will return here poor dick exclaimed flora in tone of profound sympathy how must have suffered be no longer surprised at frequent fit of depression melancholy wonder to be that did not go mad die of shame in horrible prison now that have told must put everything be past behind try to forget believe story implicitly must not be man have proved to be to be guilty of so mean act a theft oh nothing save own admission must ever make believe that of have sympathy of heart dick sympathy esteem oh thought of what have be compelled to endure be terrible terrible to leslie unspeakable consternation girl suddenly buried face in hand sobbed a though heart must break expression of whole hearted sympathy perfect faith in touched profoundly cry darling please can not bear be not worth protested ought never to have told be selfish brute to extort sympathy by miserable recital of own misfortune have basely worked upon feeling will not say answered laying hand upon mouth will not have abuse who have already suffered such unspeakable cruelty at hand of others be not selfish be not base be nothing be bad everything be good be very king among men oh dick continued taking hand in hers think forward unmaidenly in speaking thus to dear be not do think know what feeling be toward do think know that love poor simple hearted fellow be far too honest straightforward ever to be able to deceive woman especially in such matter a that may have thought that be very successfully concealing feeling from have known truth oh ever since have be on island be true god help be true exclaimed dick smiting forehead be also true that never intended to know for what right have disgraced ruined man to seek love of woman if may not seek love in return why must tell love be looking at matter with jaundiced eye dick answered flora still retaining hand in hers can not wonder that feel humiliation cruelly humiliation be really not yours be that of who so shamefully plotted to ruin be guiltless of horrible charge be a sure of a be that be living woman besides who be to know richard leslie be one same man with who stood in dock charged with shameful crime be pronounced guilty upon strength of cunningly devised manufactured evidence one of course except father must know because dick dear be fixed determination that will help in matter will accompany to bombay personally deliver over into father care then will tell that have done for be to will tell whole story just a have told to be sure that if only for sake of daughter will take up matter bring truth to light dick be not going to allow morbid feeling even maidenly reserve to stand in way of happiness have confessed that love know to be true for eye action have told so daily for month past can not be unmaidenly therefore in to confess that return love with heart soul oh flora love heart darling be sure of demanded dick laying hand upon shoulder gazing into eye a though must read very soul be sure that be not mistaking mere gratitude for warmer feeling yes dick answered be quite quite sure gratitude won long ago be yours when first stood on deck of mermaid together dripping from long night immersion in sea for have not even then saved life grew even deeper a noted day by day thoughtful care anxiety for welfare gratitude love be two very different feeling while must of course have always be profoundly grateful to for unceasing care be sure must never have learned to love have not first seen that loved then god be praised for unspeakable mercy in bestowing upon pricelessly precious gift of dear love exclaimed dick fervently will accept ay will moreover prove worthy of blessed day mark turning point in life from moment leave wretched past behind there will be no more useless fretting grieving for work now be first to restore to father next to free by help if will give anyway to free from undeserved stigma attache to true name finally to win for home position a deserve god helping will do be second time within few minute that dick leslie have spoken name of deity nothing must more clearly have indicated change wrought in by knowledge of flora love hitherto have felt to be outcast cruelly unjustly deserted by creator despised condemned by fellow men now everything be different firmly believed that god have at last relented have given girl love to comfort encourage in great trouble humiliation once more took hope into heart if god have relented everything felt convinced must yet be well with what be to be said of flora be excuse needed for extreme step that took in forcing confession of love from leslie well possibly there be may be that there be people who must assert that despite disclaimer be unmaidenly if such there be if excuse for be needed then let be found for in following fact in first place leslie despite utmost caution have betrayed intense love for in thousand different way until fact have become clear unmistakable indisputable thing not to be doubted gainsaid in next place saw that for unknown reason never intended to declare love if must possibly help dozen time declaration have trembled on lip yet have resolutely withheld why clearly for reason that deemed sufficient fancied must be intimately associated with oft recurring fit of gloom depression from must not help seeing that suffered finally loved believed that also loving knowledge of fact might go far toward restoring lost happiness when have heard story told with bitterness grief indignation have be eating into soul destroying faith in god man for over seven interminable year of suffering knew that be right that there be one remedy for misery conscious of nobility of own motif fearlessly administered who can will blame meanwhile brooding storm be slowly gathering force together for outburst bank of cloud have piled so high above western horizon that have long ago obscured sun weird twilight have fallen upon scene stagnant air have grown even more oppressively hot than at first not bird uttered single note not insect raised chirp not leaf stirred in profound silence roar of surf on reef became thunderous in resonance dined somewhat earlier than usual that night while sat over meal darkness fell lighted lamp then leslie went out to see to security of catamaran making fast to shore with additional mooring upon return flora insisted that must lie down on sofa while sang played to then leslie in turn heart lightened with returning hope happiness lifted up voice for first time since terrible memorable day nearly eight year ago broke into song finally began to sing duet together clear rich mellow tenor blending well with flora sweet sympathetic soprano concert be interrupted by distant muttering of thunder fitful flickering of lightning went out together down to shore to watch gathering storm be long time in coming by by a stood together close to water edge sudden swishing sound like of wind stirring leaf became audible in moment blast be upon tearing across glassy surface of lagoon darkening surface lashing into foam then minute two later down came rain in sheet have to beat precipitate retreat to tent getting thorough drenching on journey though occupied minute gale raged through night up to nearly noon on following day when broke sky cleared wind gradually dropped to moderate breeze veering time round by north to east until south east trade wind be once more blowing very much more gently than usual upon going out next day leslie be delighted to find that gale have done damage anywhere store material having be effectually protected from rain while direction of gale have be such that must not possibly harm brig although gale actually broke a have be said shortly before noon moderated so gradually throughout afternoon that be not until next day that sea have gone down sufficiently to permit of catamaran being taken alongside brig without danger a soon however a be case leslie went off again accompanied by flora resumed task of breaking up brig deck be about middle of afternoon when flora who have be allowing gaze to wander out over sea to southward westward called companion attention to small object floating at distance of about mile in offing leslie ever on alert at once brought telescope to bear upon object appeared to be drifting helplessly before wind sea toward surf beating on weather side of reef immediately pronounced to be small canoe apparently empty must have craft will be very useful to exclaimed dropping telescope preparing to cast off catamaran will come with sweetheart can be useful to by taking tiller when come alongside while jump aboard make fast rope must be smart will be among breaker before can reach minute later be under way slipping along toward entrance channel upon clearing leslie at once hauled wind standing to eastward for about mile took far enough to windward to enable to fetch canoe on next tack then hove about without moment delay for little craft be by time perilously close to surf be questionable whether must reach in time to save from being caught dashed to piece in so close indeed be that leslie began to seriously ask whether be justified in taking catamaran into situation of such danger for mere sake of insignificant canoe reflecting that be evidently light enough to enable flora to paddle about in without much exertion that must afford girl pleasure to do so also that little craft must be very useful for fishing other purpose decided to risk accordingly steered to shave just past to windward then when be drawing close up to handed over tiller to flora who be by time quite expert helmswoman instructing to tack to eastward moment that sprang into canoe then taking end of rope in hand stood by to jump into canoe a catamaran shaved past moment be alongside little craft into dick nimbly leaped with rope end in hand cry a did so down helm dear put round moment later added under breath hillo here be complication couple of naked savage in wonder whether beggar be dead that however be not moment in to enter upon investigation of matter for two craft be on very edge of surf if by chance catamaran must miss stay nothing must save so dick with lightning like rapidity took turn with rope made fast to sort of broad thwart in centre of canoe then hauling quickly up alongside again regained deck of catamaran just a be paying off on right tack a leslie took helm from flora exclaimed oh dick what doe mean how came two men suppose be men in canoe where have come from from one of island away out there to westward that saw from summit without doubt answered dick suspect that be caught unawares blown out to sea by gale of day before yesterday once blown fairly away out of lee of own island must have choice to keep cockle shell of canoe dead before sea to paddle for be worth to avoid being swamped take that paddled until be absolutely exhausted must do more then flung down in bottom of canoe dropped into kind of lethargy think that be still alive then asked flora have very little doubt of answered dick south sea savage be pretty tough believe even be not must take something more than say forty hour exposure in climate to kill oh yes be alive right how will presence on island affect dick asked girl be precisely question be worrying leslie at moment have personal knowledge of native inhabitant of island of southern pacific have vague recollection of having heard read while of be very gentle inoffensive others be extremely treacherous ferocious of even being addicted to cannibalism be not however going to alarm companion unnecessarily say anything needlessly to raise apprehension so answered with great show of cheerfulness why hope will very materially shorten period of sojourn here sweetheart have appearance of being good sturdy fellow will set on to help with heavy work have gone to heart to be compelled to ask to do even light work that have hitherto done for although must not have got on at without assistance now however with help will be able to get on swimmingly while can amuse in way that please now be going to tack look out for head dear can not afford to have knocked overboard by main boom helm lee instead of returning to brig leslie proceeded direct to island where having landed flora proceeded with difficulty to rouse savage supply with food drink proved to be a leslie have said pair of fine well made men naked save for kind of breech clout round loin of sturdy physique apparently little worse for adventure be especially unprepossessing in appearance although there be certain character of ruthlessness in expression of eye about mouth chin caused leslie to determine that must keep very wary eye upon at event until have learned little more about character disposition chapter eleven flora adventure leslie two dark skinned guest for be nearly black in colour ate heartily of food be given eye wide open with wonder meanwhile at many strange object especially tent catamaran that beheld around ex lieutenant especially noted with fast growing distrust glance of hungry admiration that bestowed on flora when at length emerged from tent approached canoe to note progress toward recovery leslie have already tested knowledge of english french german without success from deduced conclusion that have not be brought into very intimate contact with crew of vessel speaking of language own language on other hand be a of course might be expected merely unintelligible gibberish to be unfortunate since must make intelligent communication between difficult at event for time sailor however have way peculiar to of making requirement understood by foreigner have little doubt of ability to overcome difficulty ere long indeed on same day after men have eaten drank to heart content leslie contrived to convey to understanding fact that expected to build hut for indicated precise spot at considerable distance from camp where wished to be a soon a clearly understood what desire be went off into bush armed with small tomahawk lent by leslie proceeded to cut down forty fifty young pliant sapling butt end of sharpened to point then thrust vertically into ground in circle twelve foot in diameter then brought top of sapling together bound thus producing skeleton structure exactly shaped like bee hive skeleton then strengthened by interweaving with stout liana monkey rope a sailor call long tough stem of creeper interlace about tree in tropical country done again vanished into bush quickly returning with two generous load of leaf of specie of palm wherewith quickly deftly thatched entire hut thus completed entire structure occupied couple of hour in making yet have appearance of being thoroughly comfortable weather proof dwelling a soon a hut be finished leslie demanded back tomahawk although shrewdly suspected that understood well enough what wanted affected not to do so keeping tight hold upon implement through discussion until dick simplified matter by seizing holder by arm gently firmly forcing from grasp then handed generous supply of fish a evening ration motioned to withdraw to hut did not over willingly a leslie thought that same night went to work manufactured canvas belt for flora to hold brace of revolver cartridge pouch next morning early took small piece of board nine inch square painted to represent target nailed to tree then girding fully equipped belt round flora waist led to target having first initiated into mystery of loading discharging revolver said to a soon a see that have boarded brig morning want to come up here practise firing at target until have become good shot begin shooting at about distance marking off distance of about five yard standing a close to target a can scarcely fail to hit when be able to hit three time in succession want to retire one pace to rear so suiting action to word start shooting again until have succeeded in hitting target three consecutive time from new position then retire pace proceed a before until be able to hit target time after time without missing at distance indicating peg driven into ground at distance of about fifty yard from target when can shoot straight at range think will have attained degree of proficiency sufficient for purpose very well dick will do a wish of course answered think will not be long in attaining proficiency for believe have very straight ' eye indeed gained several first prize in archery competition at home wish dear must tell why have suddenly taken idea into head have anything to do with arrival of savage on island of course have answered leslie cheerily thinking best to be frank with sweetheart so far a be possible for to be so without alarming see little woman matter stand thus know absolutely nothing about fellow whether character be bad good whether be treacherously disposed otherwise while have little doubt that in fair square open stand up fight must be able to give reasonably good account of will not be amiss for to be on guard against treachery there be better way of dealing with savage than to inspire with good wholesome dread of one power prowess propose therefore that a soon a have attained necessary skill with revolver will indulge in little pistol practice together allowing to look on if once get fact thoroughly impressed upon that can pot if necessary at fifty yard will go long way toward simplifying matter by convincing of futility of attempting trick must not let very elementary precaution alarm sweetheart a likely a not will prove to be perfectly docile be sure fervently hope pray so answered girl in case continued spiritedly will not be frightened because will always have to take care of nevertheless a soon a leslie taking native with have arrived on board brig sedulously devoted to shooting lesson infusing into whole hearted seriousness that woman be wont to bring to task set with result that when dick returned that evening be able to report that have attained to desired degree of proficiency meanwhile leslie found little difficulty in inducing two black to accompany aboard catamaran out to brig when reached latter have not much more difficulty in making understand what wanted to do by way consisting chiefly in heaving away upon winch be careful to keep watchful eye upon day especially when first boarded brig being desirous to gather if must idea from look action whether have ever seen ship before although a catamaran drew up alongside stranded vessel noticed that regarded with considerable degree of curiosity interest be hardly sufficiently marked to lead to conclusion that have never seen craft before however be comparatively unimportant matter what concerned most intimately be fact that after night rest seemed to exhibit good deal more docility intelligence than have displayed on night before worked well apparently quite willingly did not appear to posse very great amount of stamen a manifested indication of being pretty completely exhausted before day work be over next three day passed without occurrence of anything worthy of record save flora acting upon dick advice continued pistol practice with view of further perfecting at target acquiring even still greater dexterity on fourth day however feeling that be tolerably proficient perhaps wearying somewhat of monotony of perpetual shooting at target a soon a leslie native one of whom now readily answered to name of cuffy while other did not disdain to be styled sambo have gone off to brig resolved to treat to luxury of long ramble with only sailor for company accordingly packing small basket with sufficient luncheon for herself dog set off have not least fear for although have taken many ramble together leslie have ever seen slightest trace of existence of animal reptile of kind upon island dick have quite made up mind not only that there be none that be logically physically impossible for to get there besides native be with dick have sailor to take care of there be therefore nothing to be afraid of now although a have be said leslie flora have frequently indulged in ramble together none of have be very lengthy have carried far afield with exception of one have taken to summit flora fancy now yearned to explore fresh field pasture new tantalising memory of certain grove of especially noble beautiful flower bearing tree situate on north eastern slope of peak dwelt persistently with have conjured up fancy picture of particular spot made appear to imagination scene of enchanting fairy like beauty longed to satisfy a to how closely imagination approximated to reality moreover walk promised to be agreeably easy one slope of ground appeared to be gentle face of country finely broken therefore determined to wend way in direction sauntering quietly along soon left open savannah behind plunged into bush heading generally in northerly direction accommodating route to inequality of ground varying density of undergrowth naturally selecting path afforded easiest passage through bush in manner after very pleasant enjoyable walk for about hour arrived at crest of eastern spur of mountain descending gentle declivity soon found in region a romantically beautiful a even vivid fancy have painted ravine succeeded ravine with own tiny streamlet meandering through more picturesque enchanting than last until at length emerging from broken ground reached stretch of park like country with practically undergrowth greensward being studded with magnificent umbrageous tree of be mass of lovely blossom of most exquisite tint while others be lavishly draped with orchid of conceivable shape hue be by time feeling somewhat fatigued very hungry therefore selected mossy root of enormous tree a resting place seating leisurely proceeded to eat luncheon to give sailor air of place be exquisitely soft balmy wide spreading foliage shielded from too ardent ray of sun bathed whole scene in delicious golden green twilight profound silence reigned around broken only by soothing murmur of wind through topmost branch equally soothing rustle of leaf be not to be wondered at that girl sank into pleasant reverie gradually merged into profound sleep when at length awoke changed character of light deepened sombreness of shadow warned that sun be already low that must hasten homeward if must reach camp ere nightfall therefore seized empty basket set out upon return journey following outward route a nearly a must hit off have slept much longer than suspected when at length again reached broken romantic ground that have traversed with such delight enjoyment in morning shadow have fallen so deeply that be with utmost difficulty only that must discern way found obliged to proceed with greatest circumspection now be that for first time fully appreciated advantage of having sailor a companion for dog appeared to remember way by have come much better than did running on before for few yard then pausing for to come up to again running forward several time have persisted in adopting certain route in preference to one seemed disposed to pursue in case have proved to be right therefore at length resigned blindly to guidance following wherever chose to lead in fashion pair hastened forward a rapidly a rough broken character of ground must permit flora by time being in tumult of distress at knowledge that dick must already have returned from wreck be wild with anxiety at unaccountable absence for have said nothing to about intention when left that morning expedition being result of impulse have come to after departure sun have by time set even in open brief twilight be rapidly deepening into night while where flora now be plunged in heart of wild ravine thickly overgrown with tree bush be so dark that must with difficulty distinguish form of dog even when be close to have comfort of knowing that sailor be guiding aright for presently found making way over particularly difficult bit of ground that have vivid remembrance of having passed during morning find difficulty that have then experienced made more than usually careful now a be fully aware that false step must probably result in ugly fall yet despite care took that false step instantly found plunging headlong over low cliff into dense tangle of undergrowth be not hurt in least to chagrin found so completely involved in tangle struggle a must seemed impossible for to extricate movement of body served to involve more completely to sink more effectually into heart of leafy prison fortunate indeed be for that there happened to be thorn on bush into have fallen otherwise must have sustained very serious injury in frantic effort to free from tough cordlike liana entwined body limb so completely that at length found practically impossible to further move hand foot a for sailor seemed quite incapable of doing anything more useful than run to fro along narrow ledge from mistress have fallen barking distractedly utterly disregarding flora imperative injunction to go home for soon realised exceedingly disconcerting fact that be helpless prisoner a utterly unable to effect escape unaided a though be immured within wall of russian fortress further realised that unless dog must be induced to return to camp guide dick to rescue might actually remain where be starve ere lover succeeded in discovering meanwhile dick too have have unfortunate day for late in afternoon while breaking up deck of brig catamaran have in inexplicable manner gone adrift driving athwart stern of brig snapped mast short off at deck completely disabling of course in consequence of accident dick have at once knocked off work taken craft across lagoon to camp intending to procure new spar from wood forthwith immediately proceed with repair of damage catamaran under sail be one thing same craft with wing clipped be quite thing in disabled condition proved so unexpectedly unhandy that sun have set darkness be already closing down when at length got to usual berth be be invariable custom to stroll down to beach to meet sweetheart a soon a saw catamaran coming in from wreck leslie be greatly surprised that on night of others when unusual lateness of arrival dismantled condition of catamaran might have be expected to excite curiosity must fail to appear yet absence aroused shadow of anxiety within for what must possibly happen to alone there on island with dog to protect did non appearance of sailor awaken suspicion within for knew that dog girl be inseparable companion flora might be there must sailor also be found concluded that flora be somehow detained for moment that sailor must presently present a usual meanwhile secured catamaran served out supper ration to cuffy sambo attended to one two other matter when having attended to matter at length made way to camp not only found tent in darkness cooking stove in rear unlighted began for first time to feel uneasy whistled called for dog knowing that if animal be within hearing must at once bark in response even if did not come bounding joyously to a be generally case for sailor be almost a devotedly attached to dick a be to flora on occasion sailor appeared did afford other manifestation of near presence then dick began to shout loudly for flora hoping to hear sweet voice raised in reply now began to feel seriously alarmed knowing that must have wandered away into bush perhaps have lost in darkness yet against theory be to be set knowledge of sagacity of sailor who believed be quite intelligent enough to find way back to camp from uttermost extremity of island in darkest night entered tent lighting lamp looked round living room compartment thinking possible that flora might have left note explaining absence saying where be going knew that have written note must have left in conspicuous situation a on table where must at once be found there be letter either on table elsewhere so far a must see then instituted thoroughly systematic search of tent in quest of sign indication might furnish with clue a to what have happened to what have induced to go off in mysterious fashion without success even ventured to peep into sleeping apartment wondering whether perchance have felt unwell become unconscious single glance sufficed to show that nothing of kind have happened finally hunted up lantern trimmed lighted provided with small flask of brandy to meet possible emergency armed with brace of revolver small keen tomahawk without remembering being conscious of fact that be by time fairly hungry conscious of nothing indeed ever growing feeling of keen anxiety alarm set out in search of lost one first question now confronted be in direction be to search there be especially favourite spot so far a knew to must be predisposed to wend way there be road path anything in remotest degree approaching thereto on island must therefore be just a likely to head in one direction a grass in immediate neighbourhood of tent be to extent trodden down be true by frequent traffic round path have gradually be worn into visibility between tent cook house beyond everything be a fresh trackless a upon day of landing then occurred to leslie to seek for trace of flora footprint in grass started to carefully quarter ground beyond worn area in neighbourhood of tent carefully examining with aid of lantern in way presently discovered one two imprint of heel of boot proved impossible to follow track for more than dozen yard moreover upon further search found so many leading in such number of different direction that soon realised impossibility of determining of ought to follow time that be thus engaged never ceased to whistle call sailor varying proceeding occasionally by shouting name of flora until be so hoarse that must scarcely articulate in laborious painfully unsatisfactory fashion spent entire night carefully quartering ground until have covered whole area between mermaid head on one hand cape flora on other extending rearward toward mountain to about quarter of height magnitude of such enterprise a exhausting nature can only be appreciated by who have attempted similar feat in country overgrown with bush by time that sun have risen leslie be able to dispense with aid of lantern be so utterly weary that must scarcely drag one leg after other lip be so dry that must no longer whistle throat so sore that must no longer shout while be sinking with exhaustion from hunger thirst yet pressed doggedly on still prosecuting search with grim determination same concentration a before until close upon midday when be working over toward eastern side of island paused suddenly listened a intently a though life depended upon yes there be again distant faintly heard bark of dog be sure of gathering together once more strove to whistle failed then attempted to shout sailor sailor sailor lifted up voice in steady crescendo until last cry became hoarse cracked yell be a unlike own full rich mellow tone a sound must well be yet dog heard ay recognised for immediately replied vigorously leslie continued to shout dashing recklessly forward in direction of barking a did so sailor continued to reply nay more now that actually heard leslie voice calling uttered whining howl of excitement hesitated for few second finally bounded off to meet in response to flora feebly uttered command five minute later came dashing madly up to leslie looked up into face barked wagged tail energetically then dashed off back in direction from have come stopping at few yard to assure that be being followed in way led dick forward for about quarter of hour over rough broken ground that flora have traversed twenty four hour before until pair stood together on spot from girl have fallen by time flora have become quite invisible from spot for have continued struggle at interval through night until have worked down into very heart of clump of scrub creeper into have fallen have now closed over head there be sort of indentation sinkage in surface of scrub presenting appearance suggestive of tolerably heavy body having fallen there at indentation sailor first steadfastly gazed then looked up into leslie face barking continuously peering intently down into dick presently became aware of what appeared to be tiny shred of clothing clinging here there to bush be there flora shouted there be reply for moment that sound of dick voice fell upon ear encouraging talking to dog knew that rescue be at hand long endured tension of nerve relaxed fainted sailor action be not to be misunderstood continued to look alternately into leslie face then down at bush barking excitedly while making a though must leap down into depression so even very much le intelligent individual than leslie must not have failed to understand that be there that missing girl must be found called once more still failing to obtain answer wasted further time in hesitation seeing that base of declivity be proper point to attack scrambled down a best must closely followed by sailor attempted to force way into heart of bush from point soon found however that tough tangle of creeper be not to be conquered by unaided hand alone so set to work vigorously with tomahawk cutting away at tangled knotted mass dragging severed end apart aside until after about ten minute of arduous work suddenly found at mouth of what appeared to be spacious cavern under rock from flora have fallen there prone upon rocky floor with light clothing almost torn from body by long continued effort to free found sweetheart lying insensible kneeling upon hard rocky floor raised limp form in arm lost not moment in applying flask of brandy to lip presently have satisfaction of feeling stir in arm ah that be good be feeling better darling be not exclaimed encouragingly tell be very much hurt think not answered with sigh of contentment a realised that dick be with that trouble be now practically over only feel very sore over from long struggle to free also rather cold have be here ever since sunset last night dick fighting to escape from dreadful entangling bush feel oh so utterly tired poor little girl exclaimed dick tenderly have have very trying experience one might have proved very serious too for sailor here cold of course be here let wrap jacket round so be better now be going to light fire air of place be chill a of ice house while be warming getting little life into body will clear away bush trifle more so that can get out without difficulty there be plenty of wood to be have suitable for building fire by simply cutting away dry root tendril of bush in front of cave in few minute dick have good fire blazing by light of saw that be in mouth of cavern about eight foot high seemed to reach back into heart of rock for considerable distance way back lying just within radius of area caught illumination of fire presently noticed something lying on ground that bore uncanny likeness to human skeleton said nothing about however having wish that flora shaken nerve must be subjected to further shock just then especially a imperfect view of object have be afforded by flickering light of flame left quite uncertain a to identity at once went to work again with tomahawk in vigorous onslaught upon bush managing in ten minute so to make such clearance of a must enable companion to pas out without difficulty by time that have accomplished flora have so far recovered that declared quite ready to essay journey back to camp accordingly set out forthwith dick very carefully noting surrounding landmark with fixed determination to return at early moment thoroughly examine interior of cavern a went flora beguiled way by relating to dick in full detail particular of very unpleasant adventure listening in return to dick account of return to camp consternation at discovery of absence long arduous almost despairing search for reached camp about two o'clock in afternoon after snatching hasty meal made up of first odds end that must lay hand upon retired at once to respective couch to get hour two of rest of stood in such urgent need be within hour of sunset when dick awoke turned out first care be to light up cooking stove get sort of dinner under way done strolled over to native hut to ascertain what gentry be doing a nothing be to be seen of in vicinity of camp be not in hut when looked for canoe discovered that have also disappeared first thought be that might have gone off to brig attempted on own account to continue work of breaking up deck felt trifle vexed at idea fearing that in ignorance might do great deal more harm than good upon procuring telescope bringing to bear upon brig soon satisfied that canoe be not alongside when looked further must see anything of anywhere along inner edge of reef whither thought might have gone for purpose of obtaining few fish be then that for first time suspicion dawned upon that might have left island altogether with intention of attempting to make way back to own people further search at length convinced of accuracy of surmise for second visit to hut showed that not only be usual occupant absent have taken with trivial belonging while further investigation led to discovery that have helped to few such trifle a pair of tomahawk few yard of canvas light line small keg presumably to hold supply of water bag two of assorted nail couple of fishing line possibly few other unimportant odds end first feeling at discovery be one of vexation for ignorant though savage be difficult a have found to make understand wish represented certain amount of brute strength that have already found most useful doubtless must have found even more useful later on when have succeeded in making understand more clearly what desired to do little further reflection enabled to realise in seizing first favourable opportunity to get away from island attempt to return to own kindred people be only acting upon perfectly natural commendable impulse be in fact actuated by precisely same feeling have dominated ever since have be on island be doing precisely what hoped eventually to do having arrived at conclusion dismissed incident from mind reverted to same plan of life have be prior to arrival of cuffy sambo upon scene following day be devoted by leslie to task of procuring suitable spar to serve a new mast for catamaran restoring craft to former serviceable condition be while be thus engaged that thought first entered mind that accident by catamaran have become dismasted might possibly have be blessing in disguise since for accident two savage might by not intricate process of reasoning have arrived at conclusion that craft must serve purpose infinitely better than own canoe forthwith appropriated that did not do so be perhaps due to fact that be practically unmanageable except under sail rather than to innate sentiment of honesty on part catamaran having be once more rendered fit for service leslie decided to devote few hour to examination of flora cave a called while situation landmark in vicinity be fresh in memory accordingly set off immediately after breakfast on following morning telling flora where be going suggesting that must remain in camp take thorough rest going easily arrived at cave in about hour half after starting at once proceeded with investigation have adopted precaution to take packet of candle along with commenced operation by lighting one after other setting up on most convenient rock projection offered thus succeeded in illuminating entire interior of cavern quite sufficiently for purpose meanwhile during process of lighting up cavern have already discovered that first impression relative to suspicious looking object be well grounded be indeed skeleton first act after completing lighting arrangement be to subject grisly object to careful examination found to be skeleton of man who must have stood about six foot high in stocking when alive attached here there to bone be fragment of clothing while on ground beside ghastly framework be other fragment of fine linen lace gold embroidered velvet silk showing that wearer must have be man of consequence waist be girded by broad leather belt so dry rotten that crumbled to powder in leslie finger attached to be long straight rapier with elaborately ornamented hilt sheath rotted rust eaten to same belt be also attached sheath of what must have be long formidable dagger couple of foot away from head there lay handsome steel casque very beautifully engraved chased thickly coated with rust like rest of steel accoutrement closer inspection of skeleton disclosed fact that skull have be battered in while dagger might have belonged to empty sheath be found sticking up to hilt in one of rib turning from skeleton leslie next proceeded to carefully examine great pile of small case package cask have already come under casual notice while engaged in lighting up cave took a came most conveniently to hand cask first claiming attention with assistance of small axe that have taken precaution to bring with soon forced off head of one of revealing content consisted of solid cake of hard black substance moulded to shape of cask that upon critical examination proved a have more than half expected to be gunpowder caked into solid mass completely spoiled by damp two similar cask be also found to contain powder in like condition therefore acting upon justifiable assumption that content of cask be same rolled whole of sixteen in number to opposite side of cave out of way turned attention to number of small black package that when proceeded to handle proved to be unexpectedly heavy first thought be that be pig of lead intended to be cast into bullet a occasion might require upon removing one of to open air for greater convenience of examination discovered that block might be be sewn up in what have once be hide be now mere dry stiff rotten envelope that easily peeled off revealing dark brownish very heavy substance within substance feverishly proceeded to scrape with blade of pocket knife for presence of hide envelope prepared for important discovery presently outer coat of dirt discolouration being removed from part of surface upon be operating with knife there gleamed up at dull ruddy tint of virgin gold be a have anticipated block upon be operating be one of gold brick that sewn up in raw hide be wont to be shipped home by spaniard of old from mine of south america lifted brick in hand estimated to weigh about forty pound gold brick be stacked together in tier twenty brick long four brick wide four brick high there be therefore three hundred twenty of if estimate of weight happened to be correct little pile of precious metal must be worth what short mental calculation taking gold to be worth three pound fifteen shilling ounce furnished with answer handsome sum of close upon seven hundred thousand pound sterling quite respectable fortune be not all there be other chest case still awaiting examination fully convinced by now that have accidentally stumbled upon one of fabulously rich treasure that spanish galleon be reported to have conveyed from time to time from shore of new world to of old spain how have happened to find way to particular spot did not trouble to puzzle out leslie went to work to break open examine remainder of package heedless of flight of time of found to contain rich clothing fell to piece a attempted to lift garment out of receptacle have held in safe keeping for so long others two of largest be packed full of gold candlestick cross jewelled cup other vessel article of character seemed to point to having be spoil of looted church circumstance caused leslie to suspect that find represented proceeds of more than ordinarily successful oldtime piratical cruise finally innermost chest of consequently last arrived at disclosed to dick astounded gaze collection of jewel set unset fairly made reel with astonishment there be great rope of discoloured pearl must be priceless if must by mean be restored to pristine state of purity diamond ruby emerald other necklace bracelet ring brooch other ornament in more le tarnished setting heavy chain of solid gold jewelled sword hilt last not least great buckskin bag be still in pliant serviceable condition containing heterogeneous assortment of cut uncut gem principally diamond emerald ruby sapphire one of apparently picked specimen whole constituting of treasure of incalculable value a dick having pocketed handful of gem at random to show flora replaced heavy bag in chest sank back on haunch to rest while mopped from brow perspiration of hard labour excitement light streamed in through mouth of cavern be momentarily obscured sailor bounded in barking joyously a sprang at dick tried to lick face dog be closely followed by flora who cried a entered dick dick where be have anything oh there be have kept so long dear be ill have met with accident oh what be horrible thing a stumbled over skeleton have failed to notice coming a did straight from brilliant outdoor light into dimly illuminated interior of cavern exclaimed dick lightly oh be just heap of bone must have be left here by original owner of commodious abode with sweep of foot unceremoniously transferred poor remains to dark corner of cavern that contrived to render still darker by dexterously extinguishing three four of candle in immediate vicinity a to being ill continued be happy to assure dear that never felt better in life have excellent reason for feeling well look at pointed exultantly to noble pile of treasure chapter twelve abduction pursuit well what be dick look like number of very old box have come upon pirate hoard a ought to do know in such cunningly concealed cavern a exclaimed flora laughingly a peered inquisitively at pile even now must only see very imperfectly ay answered dick may laugh a much a like little girl be precisely what have done of course be not prepared to assert positively that be pirate hoard ' although look uncommonly like must confess that be treasure very valuable treasure too be indisputable do see pile of black brick here well be gold brick estimate value at something approaching three quarter of million sterling three quarter of million repeated flora incredulously oh dick can not mean be surely joking assure dear never spoke more seriously in life what be telling be fact plain simple indisputable delightful fact gold be only part of story lifted cover of other case held candle while looked at content uttering exclamation of delighted amazement a gazed then withdrew buckskin bag from jewel chest placed in hand lift that said simply oh dear how heavy exclaimed girl must not like to be obliged to carry very far what doe contain dick plunged hand into pocket pulled out handful of gem that have abstracted from bag be full of pretty little stone like answered displaying to astonished gaze put hand into lucky bag dear see what can find there did so pulled out similar handful to glittered in dick palm why be perfect cave of aladdin dick exclaimed in delighted astonishment where did come from do think be impossible to say with certainty answered leslie have very little doubt that be brought to hiding place from old wreck that discovered sunk in lagoon at event have lain here for many year hundred at least must think original owner have long be dead gone leaving trace of identity behind be therefore now ours sweetheart very own so fact of being cast away upon desert island have not be unmitigated misfortune after see indeed agreed flora heartily there be time when certainly so regarded do so no longer for have given have made rich man why dick must be veritable millionaire yes agreed dick there can not be much doubt about at least be jointly worth quite million practically mean same thing now do wish to adorn pretty with of gewgaw because if so have better make selection then ought to be going for see that sun be getting low yes let get away from here be horrid place notwithstanding fact that be treasure cave a to wearing of thing must very much rather not dick please suggest to sort of dreadful idea scene of violence bloodshed sacking burning of town murder of inhabitant oh must not wear of thank very well said dick then will just make everything safe here will be off allowing flora first to withdraw into open air closed chest again extinguished candle rearranging bush in front of cave so a effectually to conceal entrance left spot for time after nothing of importance occurred to vary monotony of existence on island leslie devoting energetically to important work of providing material for constructing way upon intended to build cutter heavy task absorbed rather more than two month of time for be laborious work involving handling of heavy mass of timber must only be done with aid of tackle other appliance supplemented by ingenuity of highly trained sailor moreover leslie be one of individual who believed in wisdom of doing everything thoroughly well at first rather than incur risk of being obliged to undo much of work do over again at length way be completed to satisfaction that done job of laying keel setting up ready made frame of cutter in correct respective position securing there be comparatively simple easy occupied exactly month at end of time completed skeleton of cutter stood revealed upon stock to dick supreme gratification flora wonder admiration indeed leslie have ample cause to be satisfied delighted for completed skeleton displayed form of remarkably handsome boat possessed of exceptionally fine flowing line with keen entrance perfectly clean delivery yet with splendidly powerful mid section depth of hull promised great weatherliness with ample sufficiency of freeboard be evident that design have emanated from drawing board of naval architect of quite unusual ability for shape seemed to promise speed of racer with seaworthiness of cruiser indeed a dick be never tired of asserting must not have be more perfectly suitable for purpose have be specially designed for give hand to keep watch watch with will take round world be wont to declare when summing up good point of craft be at stage of affair namely when skeleton framework of cutter have be completely set up leslie be preparing to commence task of planking up upon emerging from tent one morning after breakfast to wend way down to shipyard be amazed to see cloud of smoke rising from now partially dismembered hull of brig followed even a gazed incredulously by outburst of flame rushing back to tent for telescope brought instrument to bear upon craft then discovered that not only be on fire also that there be boat canoe of sort alongside moment later saw party of native on board stamped foot on ground with anger vexation native again time in form of wanton marauder for have doubt that have be plundering wreck having secured that required must carry away have maliciously set fire to who be where have come from be cuffy sambo returned to island with party of friend for purpose of securing possession of intensely coveted object a seemed more than probable be stranger who have come upon island accidentally last be scarcely probable for there have be no bad weather to blow out to sea nearest land be so far distant that assuming to have come from must scarcely have adventured passage across so wide stretch of ocean on mere speculation at event let be whom might matter where came from must be driven off for presence of party of strange native upon island constituted intolerable menace must at once be put end to reflection flashed through leslie brain even a lowered telescope from eye calling to flora pointed out to burning brig saying look at sweetheart poor old mermaid be on fire be about to see last of however be not matter of very great moment for believe have got out of practically everything need point be of importance be that have be set on fire wilfully accidentally by party of native who be at moment on board there be ten dozen of so far a can make out seems pretty clear that have come here on looting expedition organised a likely a not by fellow sambo cuffy who seized opportunity of absence from camp in search of when met with accident at treasure cave to return to own island taking along with few unconsidered trifle doubtless have now be helping again although be unlikely that have taken anything of real value will not have paying marauding visit to island can not again loot brig be true for have set fire to must now burn until burn out unless can very effectually convince of folly of such proceeding will next have small army of savage descending upon island for purpose of looting camp will mean big fight involving heavy loss of life to ending in death captivity contingency a will not bear thinking of be therefore about to go out to induce one way to clear out in plain language be going to drive out to sea if harm come to will only have to thank for came here with dishonest purpose must take consequence will of course remain here with sailor to take care of be anxious if return for few hour intend to drive so far to sea that will find difficulty in returning especially a must be fairly tired already with long paddle to windward now good bye dear want to get afloat in time to prevent from landing good bye dick dear answered flora be sure that take utmost care of be away longer than be absolutely necessary will be anxious until return ah be just what must not be exclaimed leslie a buckled on belt containing two fully loaded revolver began to stuff packet of ammunition into pocket then seizing brace of winchester repeating rifle from rack in corner of tent started on run for beach loading rifle a ran for saw that black be in act of leaving brig leaping aboard catamaran dick cast off made sail with speed for looked a though black meditated attempting landing a soon however a saw strange craft beating off to meet making short tack to keep between beach whisked canoe round paddled desperately for channel with catamaran in full chase canoe big wholesome looking craft propelled by ten paddle reached channel first with lead of about three quarter of mile at once upon fairly reaching open sea headed away to south east dead to windward occupant having already apparently grasped fact that catamaran must only progress in same direction by following zigzag course be be intention to turn if possible drive round southern extremity of reef so to leeward reckoning upon fact that must already be considerably exhausted by long paddle of something over one hundred mile to windward believing that if must drive far enough beyond lee of island to get fairly into full run of sea full strength of trade wind on side must be in mood condition to paddle up to windward again therefore made long board to eastward on clearing channel hoping that on next tack must be able to near sufficiently to execute desired manoeuvre to disgust upon getting into wake found that have gained upon little nothing while continued to paddle with vigour spoke well for endurance leslie now tacked again to eastward standing on until must only see canoe when catamaran topped back of swell together when again hove about twenty minute later once more crossed wake of canoe now found that have done much better having neared to within about eight hundred yard now lashed catamaran helm for moment leaving to steer picking up one of rifle took careful aim with at flying canoe hoping to send bullet near enough to to spur crew to renewed exertion so tiring out compelling to take direction in desired to go waited favourable opportunity presently when canoe be hove up into plain view brought sight dead on pulled trigger moment later sank into trough disappeared a be on point of vanishing distinctly saw one of occupant leap up with wild flourish of paddle sink back into bottom of boat then tacked once more to eastward altering tactic now making short board athwart wake of canoe leslie found that chase be once more holding own state of thing prevailing until have worked out offing of about nine mile when catamaran again began to gain until have neared chase to within about quarter of mile meanwhile leslie have be carefully considering whole situation be by nature most humane man one who must not willingly injure fellow being on account indeed must go far out of way to do even total stranger service there must be two opinion upon matter told savage must be made to understand that raiding expedition to particular island be too dangerous unprofitable pastime to be indulged in therefore once more opened fire upon now in deadly earnest first three shot missing while fourth struck hull of canoe made splinter fly then scored two more miss followed by hit extorted shriek from one of crew last shot have desired effect canoe bore up headed away to southward westward with catamaran hot in chase with wind sea abeam chased chaser now went along with considerably accelerated speed catamaran however having very much best of within ten minute from moment of bearing up leslie found closing fast upon canoe le than hundred yard astern of now considered near enough to administer final lesson to crew of impudent marauder who to do justice be by time looking scared out of wit extremely sorry that have ever molested so put helm down hauled fore sheet to windward dumped five raking shot into canoe a swept athwart stern instantly whole crew dropping paddle flung down into bottom of craft buried head in arm a though must by mean protect from mysterious terrible missile wherewith be being assailed while three white spot started into view on hull of canoe told that shot have penetrated close to water line leslie now held hand for have mind to take life of savage unnecessarily watched carefully nevertheless presently one after eight black head cautiously lifted above gunwale eye in head stared wonderingly apprehensively at catamaran occupant owner evidently holding ready to duck again at first sign of danger at length seeing that leslie be indisposed to further interfere with seized remaining paddle four only in number remainder having be lost overboard in panic put canoe dead before wind be clear to leslie that with only four paddle left savage must not possibly propel canoe to windward return to island must perforce go to leeward make way back to own island a best must have therefore no more to fear from at least for present accordingly let draw fore sheet getting way on catamaran tacked bore away for mouth of entrance channel leaving enemy to paddle before wind sea find way back home again if must catamaran have arrived within about six mile of channel leslie be already debating within question whether after must not have be wiser more prudent thing to have put beyond power of surviving antagonist to return to friend possibly organise very much more formidable expedition against whether even now must not be advisable to go in chase of utterly destroy when eye be attracted to small triangular object of brownish yellow tint brilliantly illuminated by bright sunlight showed up strongly against dazzling white of surf breaking upon weather edge of reef be in shape like shark fin be not same colour be hull down be sliding along at rapid rate past wall of surf needed single glance to enable leslie to determine that be sail ay undoubtedly sail of native canoe sick with sudden thought of possibility suggested by presence of such object just where saw dick took hasty turn of rope end round tiller head with one bound reached weather shroud up shinned with agility equalled only by dread struck like knife at heart in moment be high enough to get footing upon throat of gaff from elevation be enabled to obtain clear view of craft be about three mile away well to southward of dense column of smoke rising from blazing brig be edging away round curved outer margin of reef heading so a to pas to southward of island in westerly direction be too far distant of course to enable leslie to distinguish detail with unaided eye must see that be big craft capable thought of carrying quite forty men showed very large sail to freshly blowing breeze be skimming along at very rapid pace be a much a leslie must make out at distance be enough groaning with dire apprehension of dreadful evil slid down shroud went aft to tiller must see through whole devilish scheme now gang who have set fire to brig be evidently only small contingent of expedition have be duty to attract attention decoy away from island while others headed without doubt by scoundrel sambo cuffy raided camp leslie savagely meditated be undoubtedly what have happened meanwhile where be flora what have be fate have received sufficient warning to effect escape to treasure cave armed with revolver must hold for hour against number of savage have be surprised thought of latter alternative plunged leslie into cold sweat set to muttering most awful threat of vengeance have room in mind for thought of possible extent of irremediable damage that savage might have wrought in camp must think of nothing flora must only hope pray might have made good escape catamaran be sailing a well a ever for there be strong breeze blowing yet leslie ground teeth in fever of impatience at what deemed snail like pace for first business now must be to ascertain fate of girl loved very worst must possibly have happened apart from harm to be comparatively unimportant yet same mind once set at rest about must exact terrible penalty from daring marauder must pursue ay to very island if need be while if caught at sea not man must survive to organise expedition against felt now that have be weak fool not to utterly exterminate decoy party that have just left at length after what to leslie appeared eternity of suspense catamaran passed through entrance channel bore away for camp raking view of be to be obtained a soon a veiling wall of surf be passed to inexpressible relief framework of cutter still stood on stock apparently uninjured inshore of must see tent also apparently uninjured have be cherishing sort of half hope that must also see flora standing on beach awaiting arrival be not there upon reflection be not greatly surprised doubt be still in hiding must probably not reappear until have succeeded in making aware of return of fact that danger be now past a catamaran sped along leslie keen glance roved anxiously over various part of camp a opened out presently saw that savage visitor have be busy with varied item of cargo that have saved from brig stored under canvas for canvas cover be folded back box bale be strewed here there upon sward ah there be sailor good dog lying down on beach close to water line waiting for where then be flora must certainly not be far off sailor must not be there lying so quietly lazily stretched out in sun leslie seized rifle fired signal shot to let girl know that be at hand echo of report pealed off face of mountain still did not appear stranger still did sailor leap to foot with welcoming bark what dick wondered be matter with old dog why did lie there so utterly motionless what be that long thin shaft looked almost a though point be embedded in body leslie gave vent to bitter groan for a bore up to run catamaran in upon beach recognised only too clearly that poor dog be dead slain by cruel spear that transfixed body saw too just in time to avoid grounding catamaran upon spot that sand of beach be marked with many naked footprint leading to fro between camp mark upon sand have evidently be left there by canoe leaping ashore taking care not to confuse footprint by obliterating with own leslie examined mark with most anxious care presently most dreadful fear be realised for plainly to be distinguished here there among imprint of bare foot be print of flora little shoe blurred in place a though have offered strenuous resistance to coercion of captor quite unmistakable for dick subjected whole length of track from water edge to boundary of sward to most rigid examination at length satisfied that flora footprint led in one direction namely toward water then with savage cry went to work to prepare for pursuit for there must no longer be shadow of doubt that flora have be carried off be at moment aboard canoe that have seen under sail oh if have known if have known preparation be few did not take very long to complete first dashed off to tent snatching mattress bedding from bed rushed down to catamaran with flinging down on deck covered with tarpaulin must certainly be out one night if not two flora must need something softer than bare plank to lie upon when have rescued then returning to tent flung into basket provision that must lay hand upon together with dozen bottle of wine there be time to go to spring for water with small case of rifle ammunition few others matter that thought must be useful also conveyed on board catamaran be now ready to start a yet knew not in what direction canoe be steering except be undoubtedly bound to westward now there be at least three island lying in direction canoe be probably bound to one other of be of utmost importance to know one for mistake upon point must be fatal a must result in canoe being missed altogether so leslie took boat compass have originally belonged to brig telescope thus provided made way a rapidly a possible to mermaid head a have named most southerly point of island hoping believing that from lofty cliff of headland flying canoe must still be in sight to climb to point cost twenty minute of precious time although did whole distance at run when got there felt that time have be well spent for there ten mile away with afternoon sun shining brightly upon sail lay fugitive canoe scudding away on due westerly course with wind over port quarter cast hurried glance over part of ocean where believed second canoe ought to be at length thought caught sight of must not be certain a light of sun lay strong upon sea in direction when at length got into field of telescope image of what have seen found that be object about size of smaller canoe certainly floating awash if therefore be indeed canoe that have already pursued have capsized be swamped there be end of crew now carefully took bearing of big canoe done at once set out on journey back to camp beach return journey be accomplished in about quarter of hour for be downhill then having reached camp leslie hunted up one two further article that anticipated might be useful rushing down to catamaran got under way headed for channel breeze have by time freshened up somewhat craft heeled over under pressure of enormous mainsail until lee pontoon be buried to gunwale while weather shroud be strained a taut a harp string dick only smiled grimly a heard wind singing piping through rigging must scarcely have shortened sail for hurricane just then queer looking structure tore at racing speed across smooth surface of lagoon shearing through with vicious hiss along bend roaring wave under lee bow so out to sea leslie be compelled to haul wind for short distance after shooting through channel in order to clear northern extremity of reef tacked instant that have room stood away to southward skirting outer margin of reef a closely a dared gradually edging away a reef curved round in westerly direction found close in under cliff of mermaid head about hour after clearing entrance channel then at once shaped course corresponding to bearing of canoe a taken from summit of same cliff calculated that canoe have secured fifteen mile start of estimating a nearly a must speed from glimpse that have caught of a skimmed past reef earlier on in day doubted very much whether speed of catamaran exceeded that of canoe by more than couple of mile in hour to might be added subtracted trifle according to relative merit of respective helmsman knowing that in stern chase trifle tell leslie steered a carefully a knew how a one of catamaran merit happened to be that must steer almost a well off wind a must on taut bowline hoped that through might be able to gain little extra advantage furthermore have compass be reasonable to suppose that savage lacked that ought to prove further help to being now a believed fairly upon track of fleeing canoe having eaten nothing since breakfast leslie deemed moment fitting one wherein to snatch meal did steering with one hand feeding with other a alternately eyed compass looked ahead on watch for first glimpse of canoe triangular sail although knew full well that several hour must elapse ere might hope for meanwhile what agony of terror despair must not that highly strung gently nurtured girl be suffering at mere thought dick set teeth carefully scrutinised set of canvas already trimmed to hair to see if there be anything must do to get little extra speed out of flying craft meanwhile sun slowly declined in western sky finally sank in blaze of purple crimson gold beneath horizon glowing tint quickly faded to dull purplish grey star suddenly glittered in eastern sky be quickly followed by two three more until entire dome of heaven be spangled with night be upon solitary voyager dick lit lantern that have brought with so arranged that light must fall upon compass card lit pipe set to task of endeavouring to work out scheme for recovery of sweetheart without injury to what be of almost a much importance so far a ultimate safety be concerned be fortunate conjunction of circumstance that savage have chosen doubtless for own convenience time of full moon for raid night have scarcely fallen ere brightening of sky in eastern quarter proclaimed advent of sweet regent of night leslie island lay full in wake of rising orb for nearly hour catamaran scudded along within shadow of peak stretched dark clear cut far over ocean ahead of little by little shadow shortened however by by catamaran slid over edge of a gleaming disc emerged from behind northern edge of peak flooded whole of sea to eastward with dancing streak of glittering liquid silver be about quarter of hour later that a catamaran rose upon back of somewhat higher swell than usual leslie quick eye caught momentary glimpse of tiny white gleaming point straight ahead heart leaped with joy for knew that what have seen be upper tip of canoe triangular sail greedily watched for next appearance rejoicing meanwhile in knowledge that shadowed side of own sail be turned toward flying canoe behind again loomed up dark background of peak must consequently need very sharp eye even though must be of savage to descry for twenty minute so following upon first sighting of chase leslie be able to catch only brief intermittent glimpse of sail a one other of flying craft be swept up on crest of swell by end of time have so far gained upon canoe even when sank into trough together be still able to see upper part of sail while when lifted simultaneously must see whole of right down to foot even occasionally glimpse of head of savage estimated therefore that have closed chase to within distance of about mile quarter of hour passed at expiration of canoe be in full view leslie now took two repeating rifle with have provided carefully loaded have intention of opening fire at long range motion of craft be so lively that in uncertain light of moon accurate shooting must only be possible at range of about hundred yard le be so fearful of possibility of injury to flora that be quite determined not to shoot until must make absolutely sure of mark now suddenly became aware that be no longer gaining nearly a rapidly a before upon chase indeed there be moment when doubted whether be gaining at for few minute be puzzled how to account for for breeze be still a fresh a ever indeed be rather inclined to believe that if anything be slightly freshening presently a watched canoe detected kind of rhythmical glinting appearance on side of then explanation occurred to presence fact that be in pursuit have at last be discovered by savage be now endeavouring to increase speed by paddling well thought dick grimly let paddle if will at speed at canoe be travelling will be obliged to expend great deal of strength to perceptibly increase must tire sooner later may succeed in prolonging chase somewhat will catch same now new cause for anxiety on dick part arose for presently whether in consequence of subtle clearing of atmosphere because of gradual change of moon position in heaven island dick knew lay somewhere ahead for canoe be obviously steering suddenly loomed up ahead with such startling distinctness that leslie feared that must be very much nearer to than be actually case a time sped on without bringing very appreciably nearer to chase became haunted by dread lest fleeing savage must after reach shore gain assistance of friend before must overtake at length however found that be once more creeping up to canoe despite fact that occupant be still paddling apparently a vigorously a ever be obvious that notwithstanding appearance long spell of exceptional exertion be telling upon consciously unconsciously be gradually relaxing effort slowly foot by foot catamaran crept up at length dick be convinced that not more than bare quarter of mile separated two craft then idea suddenly occurred to although be still too distant to be at willing to hazard shot at occupant of canoe there be particular reason why must not fire at sail have with ample supply of ammunition few lucky shot through might cause sail to split nay there be even possibility that might succeed in bringing down altogether accordingly planting firmly on deck to leeward of tiller with latter just pressing sufficiently against left hip to keep catamaran going straight prevent from broaching to took one of rifle in hand determining to devote entirely to effort to bring down sail sighted weapon to four hundred yard raised to shoulder aiming carefully at mast of canoe waited until have got sight dead on when instantly pressed trigger be still too far distant to be able to see result of shot be inclined to believe that have scored hit somewhere for distinctly heard loud shout seemed to carry in note of alarm again patiently waiting chance fired time really fancied saw chip fly from mast close to sling of yard at point be persistently aiming encouraged by possible success still more by fact that be now distinctly overhauling canoe leslie maintained slow careful deliberate fire upon always aiming for same spot at length at about ninth shot down dropped yard into canoe to mingled surprise gratification fall of sail eliciting tremendous hullabaloo from excited astonished savage in extremity of consternation flying raider seemed unable to make up mind what to do for few minute be confusion aboard canoe during catamaran swept up to hand over hand until two craft be abreast dick taking precaution to keep fifty yard of water between canoe a fully expected to be received with shower of spear be disappointed for a ranged up alongside native a one man rose to foot in instant thirty spear be hurtling toward have probably never be much nearer death than be at moment for spear flew round one of actually sweeping cap off head remained untouched leslie at once raised rifle to shoulder selecting a mark individual who wielded steering paddle in whom instantly recognised ci devant cuffy with sambo standing next to fired savage flung up arm staggered for moment then fell backward overboard then a catamaran swept ahead caught glimpse of something white lying in stern of canoe that knew must be flora white clothed body quick a thought leslie recharged rifle hauling wind shot athwart bow of canoe then tacked shaping course must enable to cross canoe stern at distance of about eighty yard hauled fore sheet to windward checking way of catamaran allowing to cross quite slowly then once more raised rifle pointed at sambo tragic fate of cuffy have already produced effect upon now thoroughly terrified savage who by time realised that to remain in canoe be to court death yet what else must do there be one alternative be to jump overboard trust to ability to swim to island loomed ghostly in moonlight ahead did one after other laggard being stimulated by shot two from leslie rifle until canoe fine big craft of about five foot beam forty foot long fitted with outrigger be empty of savage then without troubling particularly a to what be likely to become of beaten foe leslie gibed over shot alongside canoe jumping into with end of rope that have already made fast on board catamaran rope end deftly threw in form of half hitch round quaintly carved figure head of canoe taking end aft making fast round heel of mast thus effectually securing craft to catamaran in manner convenient for towage of former done strode aft until came to where flora lay blood rose to boiling point a bent over for saw that not only have be gagged that have also be bound hand foot so cruelly tight that must have endured hour of untold agony chapter thirteen drifting raft without losing instant leslie whipped out knife with few stroke of keen blade freed unfortunate girl from bond then without saying word to wasting time in asking question raised tenderly in arm hauling canoe alongside catamaran carried aboard latter gently laid upon mattress that have brought along with for especial benefit girl be practically in state of collapse from protracted suffering by pouring little brandy between lip gently chafing limb where have be compressed by tightly drawn bond thus restoring arrested circulation of blood at length brought back to sense of surroundings then a might have be expected a soon a fully realised that have be rescued that have nothing further to fear from late captor tensely strained nerve suddenly gave way broke into passion of weeping so violent that thoroughly alarmed leslie who poor ignorant creature knew not what to do therefore in extremity of ignorance did very best thing possible be to say took into arm soothed with many tender loving word a soon a be calm enough to eat drink placed food wine before set good example by eating drinking heartily chattering triviality time to divert mind so far a must from recent terrible adventure then when have taken that must persuade to swallow insisted that must lie down endeavour to sleep rescue of flora having be happily effected leslie be naturally anxious to get back to island a quickly a possible for dreaded lest fearful shock that girl have sustained long hour of intense physical suffering of even more intense mental agony that have endured must seriously affect health be only on island that must afford requisite care attention to ward off battle with result therefore at once hauled wind with captured canoe in tow headed catamaran on homeward journey now be that for first time fully realised how strongly trade wind be really blowing for close hauled a catamaran be felt full strength of breeze piped through scant rigging with clamour of gale poured into canvas with savageness of spite threatened to tear cloth clean out of bolt rope while careened craft until lee gunwale be completely buried in hissing turmoil of foaming yeast roared out from under lee bow swept away astern at headlong speed made leslie giddy to look at so furiously did over pressed catamaran charge into formidable sea came rushing at weather bow that took green water in on deck at plunge swept aft a far a mast ere poured off into dizzy smother to leeward while foresail mainsail be streaming with spray to height of weather leech knew that be not treating craft fairly in driving thus recklessly in strong breeze against heavy sea have perfect faith in have driven bolt nail in with own hand be confident that there be not weak spot anywhere about excitement tension of last few hour have wrought into condition of desperate impatience must brook nothing savouring of delay being completely dominated by spirit of impatience be vexation to to find that must be unable to weather island without making board to southward for a stood there at tiller whole island at least a much of a showed above horizon loomed out a misty grey blot against star lit heaven clear of luff of foresail leaning forward leslie gently raised corner of tarpaulin with have covered flora to protect from moon ray drenching spray found to intense relief that have fallen asleep sleep probably of complete exhaustion be greatly surprised at for a matter of fact now that frightful danger be past excitement be subsiding also began to experience sensation of weariness desire for sleep be of course quite impossible to indulge just then so lighted pipe instead gave up to reverie steering craft mechanically with eye steadfastly fixed upon luff of mainsail a sailor will although thought may be thousand of mile away from surroundings a leslie stood there gazing abstractedly ahead puffing meditatively at pipe be startled back to consciousness of surroundings by violent shock thrilled through catamaran caused to look anxiously over stern under impression that craft have struck run over piece of floating wreckage must see nothing however be still staring wondering when same thing occurred second time dick now noticed that wind have suddenly fallen almost calm also that surface of ocean appeared to be strangely agitated regular run of sea out from south east having in moment given place to most extraordinary dangerous cross sea seemed to be coming from direction at same moment colliding sea meeting other with rush causing long wall of water to leap into air to height of from twenty to thirty foot leaping wall sheet of water be in moment flying into air round catamaran falling back in drenching shower of spray instantly flooded at once awoke flora who started up in affright cry to dick to tell what fresh danger have arisen oh nothing very serious time answered leslie be quite novel experience to admit there can be only one possible explanation of be that have just sustained shock of earthquake if be right in surmise extraordinary disturbance of sea will subside almost a rapidly a have arisen will be end of whole business by jove be not so sure that will be after added in quite tone of voice just look at pointed toward island over peak of there hovered faint glow like reflection upon smoke of hidden fire why what doe mean dick demanded flora look a though volcano have become active again be hardly likely be after remaining quiescent for so many year well a to answered dick long period of quiescence constitutes guarantee that will not again break out into activity a matter of fact certainly have done so that ruddy luminous glow hovering like halo over peak can mean nothing else so long however a be more actively violent than now be very serious harm be likely to ensue same must very much rather have not happened a be be hint to to hurry up with preparation get away a quickly a may be from region where such happening be possible now lie down again dear get more sleep if can need that can get appears that disturbance be over for sea be smoothening down again here come wind once more back from proper quarter when dawn broke leslie found within ten mile of island to leeward of point most northerly extremity then bearing good two point on weather bow therefore tacked made board to southward with object of getting far enough to windward to weather reef on next tack being now close enough to island to get distinct view of general outline scrutinised most carefully in endeavour to discover whether earthquake have seriously affected be with concern anxiety that thought must detect certain slight alteration of shape here there not of course that mattered to in abstract how much how little island have altered in shape provided be very big proviso that have not so seriously affected dockyard a to damage cutter caused treasure cave to collapse to extent a to obliterate situation bury treasure beyond possibility of recovery anxious now to get back to camp at earliest possible moment leslie be alternately watching island luff of mainsail impatiently waiting for moment to arrive when must be possible to again tack to eastward when eye be attracted by appearance of object distance to eastward broad on lee bow looking at intently have to appearance of mast with fragment of sail fluttering from keen though be upon reaching camp with a little delay a might be be impossible for a sailor to pas object without examination with little stamp of impatience therefore put up helm bore away for be not very far distant couple of mile perhaps certainly not more to reach therefore involved very serious loss of time be not long ere be close enough to to enable to make out that be raft of sort rigged with boat oar small spar for mast upon be hoisted remains of what have once be boat lug sail noticed also that be occupied by little group of recumbent figure whose attitude be grimly suggestive of ocean tragedy be mostly lying prone upon raft with water washing round one figure be seated with back supported against little mast be evidently insensible for though catamaran be by time quite close to there be attempt made by one of to signal there be nothing indeed to indicate that life still lingered upon forlorn little ocean waif taking room for manoeuvre leslie tacked at right moment with fore sheet to windward slid gradually with steadily decreasing way up to lee side of raft reached just a with main sheet eased full off catamaran lost way altogether a glided up alongside helplessly drifting fabric there came to nostril whiff of poisoned air told own tale only too clearly still although death be so obviously present be possible that life might be there too so taking rope end with sprang on to little structure secured two craft together then rapidly examined motionless figure one after other there be five of of five three be undoubtedly dead in case of other two seemed just possible that life be not quite extinct therefore hurriedly removed to catamaran a hurriedly cast raft adrift again luckily flora be once more asleep so escaped dreadful sight presented by little platform of broken planking odds end of splintered timber with ghastly load empty water breaker entire absence of food on raft telling at glance whole history of tragedy moment that catamaran be again clear of raft leslie turned attention to two pitifully emaciated rag clad object that have rescued commenced operation by administering small quantity of brandy to effort being eventually rewarded by discovery of sign of returning animation in thus encouraged assiduously persevered presently one of opened eye staring vacantly about huskily murmured o god have pity give water water leslie thereupon cautiously administered further small quantity of liquid man eagerly swallowed at once asked for more gently laying down on back with promise that must have more little later on dick next turned attention to second man soon have satisfaction of seeing also restored to consciousness having achieved much of success leslie now aroused flora briefly explaining to circumstance of case turned two castaway over to care with instruction to give alternately at brief interval small quantity of drink food while devoted attention to catamaran task of navigating back into harbour meanwhile little raft with ghastly cargo went driving away to northward westward before wind sea be soon lost to sight a catamaran skirted close along weather side of reef leslie noticed that brig have burnt out for there be not faintest whiff of smoke rising from spot where have lain on other hand thin pennant of light yellowish brown vapour be trailing away to leeward from summit of peak showing that eruption up there be still in progress dick be much comforted however to find that even now when be so close in with land must detect evidence of disturbance by earthquake on southern slope of mountain began to cherish hope that must find dockyard camp uninjured hope became practical certainty when upon passing through entrance channel camp came into view beheld not only tent still standing a have left framework of cutter erect upon stock apparently uninjured twenty minute later catamaran slid into usual berth gently grounded upon sandy beach first assisting flora to step ashore tenderly supporting to tent to welcomed back with loving embrace dick next conducted two rescued men to hut have originally be built occupied by sambo cuffy into inducted with intimation that be to regard a future quarter be by time so far recovered that must walk with little assistance leslie therefore thought that might now venture to give light meal with reasonable quantity of liquid to wash down done recommended to lie down sleep for while after have refreshed so left a walked from hut down to spot that dignified with name of dockyard leslie ruefully noted that savage have played havoc with belonging in hurried search for booty a havoc appeared to consist in general capsizal of everything rather than in actual damage a few matter that have appropriated still remained aboard captured canoe consoled with assurance that after there be not very much to worry about excepting of course terror suffering to flora have be exposed killing of poor sailor of filled with bitter grief anger a passed on way detected evidence here there of fact that island have not escaped altogether unscathed from effect of earthquake small crack in ground showing here there have not heretofore existed when reached dockyard found that two three of shore have be shaken down leaving cutter somewhat precariously supported to infinite relief actual damage have be done couple of hour of hard work sufficed to put everything quite right once more then returned to tent finding that flora be lying down seized opportunity to bury body of faithful dog out of sight ere lying down to snatch hour two of much needed sleep when awoke did of own accord afternoon be well advanced upon emerging from tent discovered that not only be flora up stirring that have routed out from ample store of clothing couple of suit to replace rag in two castaway have be garbed when rescued that two individual having washed dressed be now sitting in sun smoking flora having also supplied with pipe tobacco looking about with mingled curiosity surprise a approached with view of eliciting from particular of story rose somewhat unsteadily to foot while one lifted cap in salute other took off altogether lifted finger to forehead a gave awkward kick out astern with one leg in true shellback style that be english dick have already ascertained therefore did not go through formality of inquiring nationality at once addressed in own language well lad exclaimed cheerfully hope be feeling better thank sir answered one who have lifted cap yes be beginning to pull round again right be glad to have early opportunity to thank on behalf of myself bobeun here for service have done in taking off raft bringing ashore here have saved life sir there be mistake about be very much obliged to be sure ay ay right ye be mr nicholls very much obliged indeed be be puttin ' matter in nutshell supplemented second man with sea scrape of foot leslie be agreeably surprised at men appearance now that have removed from person most repulsive evidence of late misfortune for whereas when have taken off raft be pair of perfect scarecrow mere skeleton dirty in rag now although still of course thin haggard cadaverous looking wore semblance of thoroughly honest trustworthy respectable seaman one of indeed younger of two who have be addressed by companion a mr nicholls presented appearance of quite exceptionally smart young sailor leslie at once put down for what presently proved to be second mate of lost ship a for other nicholls have spoken of a bobeun looked elderly man of burly build doubt when in health straightforward honest a day prime seaman finger fish hook hair ropeyarn leslie felt delighted beyond measure at acquisition of two such invaluable assistant a men must certainly prove so soon a have recovered lost strength oh be right said dick in response to expression of thanks be of course very glad that have fallen to lot to render service be doubt lucky accident for happened to be cruising outside reef to day for circumstance must certainly not have seen raft in case be afraid there must have be hope for for raft must have passed mile to westward of island chance of being picked up must in case have be remote in extreme for although have now be here for month have not sighted single sail since arrived here now if have objection must like to hear yarn well sir answered nicholls know that there be very much to tell such a be be welcome to belonged to very tidy little barque wanderer of liverpool sailed from otago a suppose know sir be in new zealand for london on what be to day leslie gave date dickens be ejaculated nicholls then have lost day of reckoning must have be day longer on raft than thought well anyhow if what say sir be true be sure doubt word be just month ago blessed day that sailed from otago bound a say for london with order to call at callao on way home sailed with regular westerly roarer astern of to old man mean capt'n sir showed rag must draw up to to'gallant stunsails skipper kept well to south'ard hoping to make easting that wanted out of westerly wind reckon that did too for carried that same breeze with to longitude degree when hauled up to nor'ard east'ard then about two day later be bob ay answered boatswain who seemed to know exactly to what nicholls be referring just two day a'terwards mr nicholls yes resumed nicholls two day later got shift of wind breeze coming out at about east north east broke off to about due north be disappointing a hoped to pick up south east trade just where then be held on hoping that wind must gradually haul round did however on contrary came on to blow hard heavy until be hove to under close reefed topsail sea well never saw anything like in born day wanderer be mostly very comfortable little hooker when be hove to time rolled so frightfully being in light trim must understand sir that for one expected minute to see roll mast over side after have be hove to for twenty six hour scared skipper so badly that decided to up helm try whether must do better at running before well watched for smooth did seem to come then while be still waiting sea came bearing down upon looked a big a mountain skipper sang out for hand to hold on for life of managed to get grip others did down came upon looking like wall be toppling over next second be aboard of have took to mizzen rigging be about ten foot above level of rail when sea came aboard tell sir what be saying be petrified truth for minute barque be so completely buried that there be inch of hull to be seen from stem to starn nothing three mast standing up out of boiling smother of foam made up mind that poor old hooker be done for 'd never come up again did at last with inch of bulwark gone fore aft cook galley swept away one of boat smashed five of hand missing one of being chief mate well a soon a have cleared skipper sang out for carpenter to sound well when chip drew up rod reported four foot of water in hold of course hand went at once to pump by time that 'd be working at for hour found be good water be gaining upon hand over hand craft be settling down under foot so knocked off pumping boat being gone went to work to put raft together deck having be swept clean of everything have much stuff left to work up took couple of hour to knock together few odds end that took off of morning have stuff to make anything bigger have time even if 'd have stuff for by time that have finished raft poor old hooker have settled so low in water that expected to sink under minute then got to work to scrape together such provision a must lay hand on by time lazarette be flooded not to be got at while everything in steward pantry be spoiled pantry having be swamped by sea have broken aboard done mischief be grub from pantry nothing so took there be very much of also small breaker of fresh water that steward managed to fill for then be high time for to be off be very difficult matter to launch raft for by time sea came along swept over deck job for be to avoid being washed overboard well got afloat a luck must have heavy sea swept over just a be launching made clean sweep of provision that 'd got together except one small parcel of course once afloat be impossible for to get back to barque even if there have be use in going back there be have managed to find one oar jolly boat lug sail rigged up a much by way of signal a anything else for of course must hing drive dead before wind have left barque above ten minute when down went stern foremost there be left adrift a helpless a lot of baby in raging sea there be ten of altogether pretty tight fit found on bit of raft awash a be be within hour of sunset when left barque a darkness settled down upon came on to blow harder than ever while sea washed to extent that must hing hold on like grim death misery horror of first night on raft wo bear talking about if must must need more clever man than be to describe can remember be that sat there whole night through in black darkness holding on for life with hand with sea washing over sometimes up to neck speaking to nobody nobody speaking to gale broke about hour before dawn when sun rose showed sky full of cloud looked like tattered bunting of imaginable colour one must think of scurrying across sky in westerly direction then found that wind have veered round be coming out from about east south east a soon a be light enough to make out thing took look round to see how rest of have weathered out night tell sir nearly broke heart to find that mustered three le than be when left barque poor old skipper being one of missing have be washed off drowned during night at least be how accounted for loss then opened little stock of provision consisting mostly of cabin biscuit that have wrapped up in bit of tarpaulin intending to put bit of food into ourselves so get little strength encouragement when came to open bundle found full of salt water wonder seeing what clean breach sea have be making over night so that bread be just reduced to pulp more fit to eat than if be so much putty water be pretty nearly a bad sea have got at too made that brackish that tasted more like physic than water however took drink round tried to persuade one that must be so very long before something must come along pick up sea took long time to quiet down by sunset have smoothened so far that only just kept raft awash water up to waist a sat so a have by time got pretty well used to being wet through be feeling fairly comfortable must have be if only have have morsel of something to stay hunger drain of sweet water to quench thirst for soon found that more water drank out of breaker thirstier grew that night steward went crazy started singing first of all began with sort of song that sailor man sings on forecastle during second dog watch on fine night from that branched off into hymn then fancied that be at home once more talking to wife chick made heart fairly bleed to listen to then after have be yarning away in style for more than hour quieted down thought be getting better when daylight broke be gone slipped quietly overboard during night reckoned next day be terrible one suffering from hunger thirst be awful about midday one of men ab named tom bridge went raving mad swore that did intend to starve more said that one of must die for good of rest presently set upon saying be in better condition than of rest that therefore be proper one to be sacrificed be big powerful man proved match for other five of must have fought for good twenty minute must think when suddenly took hold of round waist lifting off foot a easily a if be baby made to jump overboard with in arm man tripped up although went overboard poor tom struck head a fell must have be stunned for felt grip slacken a struck water presently managed to free swim to raft tom went down like stone never saw again that adventure just about finished think know finished for completely took out of what little strength have left although remember falling dark that night also have confused recollection of getting up once twice during next day to take look round know nothing of what happened after until came back to sens on deck of queer looking craft of yours tasted brandy that be trying to pour down throat well remarked leslie have be terrible adventure for one will doubtless remember for remainder of life time of suffering be now past what have to do be to get well strong a soon a possible yet even here although run scant risk of perishing of hunger thirst be in a little danger of drowning there be peril namely that of savage to be equally exposed although rather hope that certain action felt incumbent upon to take yesterday last night may have averted for time at least perhaps having heard story have better tell mine will then understand precise position yours a well a miss trevor own to speech nicholls replied in effect that having already seen great deal to excite surprise curiosity must afford much pleasure to listen to anything in way of explanation that leslie might be pleased to tell remark simpson cordially briefly endorsed by adding same here sir now have be said that man can do two thing well if attempt to do at one same time leslie proved exception to rule for not only listened attentively to nicholls story of loss of wanderer at same time succeeded in accomplishing much more difficult feat of effecting very careful appraisement of character of two men whom have rescued from raft result be to thoroughly satisfactory for ere nicholls have arrived at end of yarn leslie have come to conclusion that new companion be thoroughly genuine honest steady straightforward men upon whom must absolutely rely whom must take into confidence with perfect safety therefore unhesitatingly told whole history of loss of golden fleece what have followed up to moment of meeting judiciously reserving however for present mention of discovery of treasure now said by way of conclusion see exactly how be situated here tell frankly that believe there be very much prospect of getting away from here until cutter be finished although must opportunity occur will of course be at full liberty to leave island if so please so far a miss trevor be concerned will now in case stay here until cutter be ready sail at least part of way home in now be for to say whether will throw in lot with remain until be ready to go whether will avail yourselves of prior opportunity may occur for to escape whichever way may decide there be ample supply of provision clothing in fact actual necessary of life for to due share of will be most heartily welcome since have made free use of brig cargo will of course feel bound to make good loss to underwriter upon return to england presume therefore so long a may remain upon island will be willing to assist in work of completing cutter in return for subsistence be right in assumption certainly be so far a be concerned mr leslie answered nicholls be not man to loaf about here in idleness watch gentleman like working hard day 'd precious sight sooner be doing good honest day work for grub than take give nothing in return what say bob same here mr nicholls mr leslie answered simpson very well said leslie then will consider matter a settled will not of course be in fit state to turn to for few day a soon a feel strong enough let know will be more than glad to have assistance meanwhile if there be anything that require have only to say what be if resource of island be equal to want will be supplied appeared however that immediate requirement have be met so leslie returned to tent where found flora awaiting well little woman remarked greeting genially have have good rest upon word be looking little if anything worse for adventure how be feeling a well a ever thank dick replied excepting that poor wrist ankle still feel rather sore from pressure of rope with wretch bound have have good rest although sleep be disturbed at outset by terrifying dream passed off at last now feel a say really none worse oh dick be awful experience expect will often see dreadful savage face in sleep for time to come yes assented dick fear will must try a hard a can to forget terror dear remembering that be now two good men stronger than be before that after lesson have given native be not very likely to repeat experiment in hurry now if think can bear to talk about must like to learn just what happened after left well said flora there really be not very much to tell stood on beach watched until passed out through channel disappeared behind wall of surf then accompanied by dear old sailor by way dick what have become of dear old dog have not seen since returned be afraid poor fellow be hurt sweetheart answered dick gently did utmost that faithful friend can do died in defence have buried dear old sailor exclaimed girl tear springing to eye at intelligence of death fought bravely will never forget sat silent for while with handkerchief to eye presently resumed a be saying walked back toward tent sailor a usual keeping close beside be within dozen yard of tent when dog suddenly stopped dead growling savagely why what be matter sailor ' said patting looked up at for instant still growling coat bristling with anger then with quick yelp of fury dashed off darted behind tent next instant there be dreadful outcry mingled with fierce barking snarling of dog be absolutely petrified with terror for be away already far beyond reach of sound signal must make while be left alone on island with knew not who what then thought came to to make dash for tent get pistol that gave to practise with before must carry out idea perfect swarm of black headed by sambo cuffy rushed out from behind tent with sailor in midst of fighting furiously in instant turned ran for beach with in pursuit have not faintest idea what intended to do one thought be to keep out of clutch a long a possible of course be almost instantly overtaken seized hand held behind by sambo while cuffy stood before threatening with spear then while of native went off to stack of store began to overhaul ' a call others disappeared in direction of mermaid head be horrible sensation made deadly sick to feel actually in clutch of dreadful native to see look in cuffy eye a stood before brandishing spear in face worse be yet to come for presently one of wretch came up with piece of rope in hand then bound hand foot together rendering absolutely helpless a found suppose must be about quarter of hour after although seemed very much longer when second party of native returned with canoe into flung most unceremoniously then went off together leaving alone so tightly bound be soon enduring agony of torment bore pain for perhaps hour then must have swooned for knew more until recovered sens in dear arm knew that have saved oh dick then suddenly broke down again sobbed so violently clung to leslie in such frantic paroxysm of terror that poor dick became thoroughly alarmed in distraction must hing soothe a must frightened child simple treatment however sufficed for sob gradually diminished in violence at length ceased altogether presently flora arose declaring that be again denouncing a poor weak silly little mortal who ought to be ashamed of chapter fourteen completion launch of cutter on day followed occurrence of above exciting event nicholls simpson being still too weak to be fit for somewhat laborious work of dockyard leslie determined to pay visit to treasure cave being anxious to ascertain whether earthquake have materially interfered with configuration of country in direction if so to what extent upon learning determination flora announced decision to accompany accordingly having packed luncheon basket pair set off together soon after breakfast leaving nicholls boatswain in charge of camp day be magnificently fine temperature be somewhat higher than usual trade wind having softened down to quite moderate breeze so dick companion proceeded on way in very leisurely manner intending to take whole day for task of exploration very marked important change in aspect of landscape be noticeable until reached ridge spur of mountain terminated in headland dick have named cape flora a soon a ridge be crossed saw that for unexplainable reason earthquake action have be much more violent on northerly than on southward side of so great indeed be change wrought that in many place feature of landscape be scarcely recognisable leslie have utmost difficulty in finding way at length however arrived in neighbourhood of spot where believed cave to be situated here change have be so great that for time leslie be utterly at loss surface be so twisted torn so utterly disfigured by landslide upheaval of rock that might have be in island altogether so far a recognition of original feature be concerned be far worse than worst dick have anticipated for time be in state of utter despair fearing that treasure have be swallowed up beyond recovery still felt convinced that be in immediate neighbourhood of spot where cave have be bidding flora to sit down rest while further investigated began to grope about here there among confused mass of rock studying intently a did so for upwards of two hour leslie searched toiled in vain at length came upon piece of rock face seemed familiar to upon removing number of block of splintered rock disclosed small hole creeping into found once more to infinite joy in treasure cave with treasure safe within stayed long enough to satisfy that everything be a have left then emerging once more into open daylight carefully masked entrance again by placing block very much a have found pretty thoroughly fatigued by time made way to spot where flora be seated acquainted with success while unpacked luncheon spread out invitingly upon surface of rock rock upon be seated occupied somewhat commanding position from summit of fairly extended view of surrounding country be to be obtained be while pair be leisurely eating midday meal that dick eye suddenly caught glint of water at great distance now knew that when be last on spot there be water anywhere nearer than open ocean yet a saw through interlacing bough trunk of tree flickered with suggestion of surface agitated by incoming swell a soon therefore a have finished lunch pair made way in direction of appearance of water after about ten minute of easy walking found standing upon brink of kind of sink basin about quarter of mile in diameter having narrow opening communicating with open sea be strange looking place presenting appearance suggestive of vast hollow under coast line having fallen in swallowed up circular piece of island leaving two rocky headland standing southern headland slightly overlapping northern one thus completely masking basin cove from sea surrounding cliff be about hundred foot high composed entirely of rock presenting almost vertical face so rough broken be face so numerous be projection that not only dick flora also found perfectly safe easy to descend by mean of right down to water edge into cliff dropped sheer with depth of water alongside so great that dick must not discern bottom although water be crystal clear so narrow be opening that what small amount of swell found way into cove be practically dissipated ere reached rocky wall alongside water rose fell so gently that movement be scarcely perceptible be in fact ideal harbour for craft a cutter dick at once determined to bring round to spot a soon a be ready in order to ship treasure on board upon return to camp that evening dick found that nicholls simpson be making such rapid stride toward recovery that be not only able to walk about with something like approach to former strength that also expressed conviction that must be perfectly able to begin work on morrow appeared that have be amusing by prowling about camp investigating condition of affair generally be only natural that chief interest must centre in cutter probable amount of work lay before ere must be completed ready for sea a have already be mentioned condition at time be that of completed skeleton keel stem stern post having be joined up whole of frame erected in position properly connected to keel wale stringer bolted to be therefore so far advanced that next thing in order be to lay planking planking may be mentioned be of oak throughout arranged to be laid on in two thickness plank of outer skin overlaying joint between two plank in skin beneath plank have already be roughly cut to shape carefully marked therefore be now required be to complete trimming of plank fix in position inner layer of planking be much thicker of two intention of designer evidently being that inner skin must be attached to steel frame by steel screw not quite long enough to completely penetrate plank outer skin being attached to inner by gun metal screw carefully spaced in such manner that there be always distance of at least six inch between steel gun metal screw thus avoiding possibility of even smallest approach to galvanic action being set up between two be of course to outer skin that copper sheathing be to be attached now planking even comparatively thin outer skin be much too stout tough to be got into position without steaming fact have occurred to simpson while prowling about dockyard day have mentioned matter to nicholls pair have at once looked about to see whether leslie have made provision for steaming of plank finding none have profitably amused by sorting out from deck other planking brought ashore from brig sufficient quantity of stuff suitable for construction of steaming trunk laying aside ready for leslie inspection upon return have not quite completed self imposed task when dick got back to camp seeing apparently busy sauntered down to spot where be at work well lad said with smile so be getting yourselves into training eh be glad to see that be making such rapid advance toward recovery thank sir yes be pulling round again all right replied nicholls have be amusing to day by taking general look round so far a can see cutter most remarkable fine little boat be going to be be just about ready to start planking up see sign of steaming trunk anywhere about mr leslie so bob have be putting in time on job of sorting out from among raffle there enough stuff to make trunk out of here be sir if happen to want for anything else said leslie require for anything in particular a will certainly require trunk may a well work up into one think will have to be next job yes sir agreed nicholls look like what about boiler sir in to generate steam see anything knocking about ashore here that will do for one said leslie be rather afraid may have hard job to find one there be only one thing can think of be one of brig water tank have intended to bring one ashore for especial purpose now that rascally savage have burnt craft may find that tank have be destroyed by fire must think not sir dissented nicholls will have be stowed right down in bottom of perhaps if be case fire wo have have chance to get at really know whether be stowed in bottom not answered leslie will go off to morrow have look at wreck one thing be quite certain must have boiler of sort will never be able to get plank into position especially about head of stern post without splitting must take good deal of trouble to avoid misfortune a that following day found nicholls simpson so far recovered that declared quite strong enough to turn to accordingly leslie who since raid of savage be more feverishly eager than ever to get away from island took catamaran three men went off together to wreck of brig found burnt practically down to water edge everything not of metal be in also consumed down to level below surface however everything be of course untouched gear sheer leg tackle rest of have be of such immense value to dick in getting various matter out of brig have be destroyed with if very serious amount of turning over of cargo under water must prove to be necessary must be obliged to provide rig up complete fresh set of apparatus moreover there be longer convenient platform of deck to work from instead of have to wade about on confused mass of cargo beneath surface of water affording most awkward irregular platform with in spot only few inch of water over while elsewhere there be depth of a many foot careful examination of whole of visible cargo failed to reveal whereabouts of water tank of anything else must serve purpose of boiler at length be reluctantly driven to conclusion before search must be further prosecuted must be necessary to procure rig up set of sheer leg to replace lost gear with such block etcetera a must find among heterogeneous collection of stuff already salved from brig to be obliged to expend so much time labour over again be decidedly disheartening a leslie said be quite useless to worry over have to be done sooner set about better so returned to shore while nicholls simpson armed with ax went off into wood in search of couple of spar suitable for sheers dick proceeded to overhaul mass of raffle brought ashore from brig at length secured enough block rope to furnish fairly effective set of tackle wherewith to equip there be tremendous amount of long splicing to be done in order to work up various odds end of rope into suitable length for several tackle required four day of assiduous labour found vexatious task completed everything ready for resumption of work then ensued arduous wearisome turning over of cargo much of consisting of heavy casting other part of machinery at length got down to one of tank hoisted out emptied floated ashore then came building of steam trunk erected close alongside cutter right down at water edge for convenience in supplying boiler with water done be at length able to turn to upon important task of planking up hull of little ship now be that leslie be able for first time to appreciate inestimable value of carefully prepared figured diagram of planking that builder have so thoughtfully included among various matter appertaining to construction of cutter for with in hand be necessary be for leslie to go over pile of planking noting letter number on plank stack whole in such manner that plank first required must be found on top of stack while last wanted must lie at bottom now too found how great advantage possession of two able intelligent worker be to for not only be three men able to do thrice amount of work possible to one man in given time be able to do considerably more when came to such matter a lifting heavy weight twisting refractory plank into position other matter of similar kind where mere brute strength be required moreover steaming apparatus acted to perfection after first two day during be acquiring knack of working together generally getting hang of thing a nicholls expressed everything went like clock work averaged six complete strake of planking three on side of hull sawn trimmed steamed fixed per diem a there happened to be thirty strake up to covering board cost just ten day of strenuous labour to get inner skin laid laying of outer skin consumed similar period then there be caulking paying of seam in inner outer skin be task needed most careful doing be not to be hurried a well a protection of inner skin by coat of good thick white lead laid on immediately under plank of outer skin applied last thing before screwing plank down ran away with time so that took full month to complete planking up advance craft to stage at must be ready for laying of deck before be undertaken painted three coat of zinc white a soon a be dry laid on copper sheathing hung rudder laying caulking paying of cutter deck kept busy for fortnight be then in condition for fitting up of interior according to original design be divided up into forecastle with accommodation for four men abaft of came small galley on port side equally small steward pantry on starboard side then abaft again came tiny saloon finally abaft again two little state room on one side with little bathroom lavatory sail room on other saloon be entered by way of short companion ladder leading from small self emptying cockpit five foot wide by six foot long cockpit being only open space in boat rest of hull being completely decked over saloon be lighted by small skylight six scuttle three of side fixed in planking of little craft stateroom although very small be still sufficient in size to enable adult to sleep in comfortably interior arrangement be perfect marvel of ingenuity being fitted with small chest of drawer under bunk folding washstand dressing table be arrangement set out in plan provided for in material for construction a happened to suit leslie requirement exceedingly well very wisely determined not to alter work of putting together bulkhead lining saloon fitting up stateroom generally completing interior arrangement be not laborious there be great deal of of came very awkwardly to hand due doubt to great extent to unaccustomed character of work in first place in second to confined space in much of be necessarily to be done at length there came day when after most careful inspection of craft inside out dick pronounced hull complete ready for launching at last moment decided that must be more convenient to step lower mast ere left stock one thing leading naturally to additional day be devoted to job of stepping important spar getting bowsprit into position setting up rigging connected with two spar getting main boom gaff into place then with remainder of spar sail aboard knocked off work for night with understanding that little craft be to be consigned to native element on morrow dawn of morrow promised a fair day a heart must wish for so important ceremony three men be early astir busy upon final preparation most important of be greasing of launching way a dick have foreseen necessity from very outset have not only adopted precaution of bringing ashore from brig ounce of tallow grease of description that have be able to find aboard have rigorously saved morsel have resulted from cooking during whole period of sojourn upon island thus happened that when came to point found that have what with judicious strict economy might prove sufficient for purpose intended that there must be room for doubt in so important matter a therefore ruthlessly sacrificed almost whole of big case of toilet soap with other two men went diligently over way rubbing soap on dry until film of covered way throughout whole length then upon top of plastered on tallow other grease until be expended at stage of proceeding dick declared satisfied marched off to rid of trace of somewhat dirty work by time breakfast be ready then upon conclusion of meal hand adjourned once more to yard flora being attired for occasion in complete suit of dainty white topped off with broad brimmed flower bedecked hat that under other circumstance must doubtless have graced valparaiso belle dick carried two bottle of champagne last of scanty stock in hand one of being devoted to christening ceremony while other be to be consumed in drinking success to little boat arrived alongside nicholls nipped up ladder gave access to little craft deck attached bottle of champagne to stem head by line long enough to reach down to within about six inch of keel then went aft lashed tiller amidships done announced that be ready upon hearing dick placed bottle of wine in flora hand telling when to act what to say stationed with heavy sledge hammer in hand at one of spur shore simpson similarly provided going to other then be ready shouted dick ay ay sir ready answered simpson swaying up heavy hammer over shoulder then strike yelled dick crash fell two hammer simultaneously down dropped spur shore tremor appeared to thrill little craft throughout entire fabric for single moment seemed to hang to dick unmitigated consternation next second saw begin to move with almost imperceptible gliding motion toward water flora saw too raising bottle of wine in hand dashed against little craft bow shattering glass to piece causing wine to cream over brightly burnished copper a cried god bless flora grant success speed of handsome little clipper rapidly increased presently entered water with headlong rush curtseying a gracefully a though have learned trick from namesake ere recovered floated lightly a soap bubble on water for although dick have found entire outfit of lead ballast for already cast to shape of hull have only put part of aboard leaving out about six ton in place of intended to stow gold from treasure cave little craft held way for quite extraordinary distance showing thereby in most practical of way excellence beauty of line when at length came to rest nicholls let go anchor waved hand by way of signal that be well whereupon dick simpson jumped into canoe paddled off to fetch ashore moment have now arrived when became necessary for leslie to come to definite conclusion a to how far must take two men into confidence have watched with utmost keenness from first moment of connection with everything that have seen in speech behaviour have led to conviction that be absolutely honest loyal trustworthy on other hand have heard of case wherein men even a trustworthy a believed two to be have succumbed to influence of sudden over powering temptation there must be question that treasure of such enormous value a lying hidden in cave constituted temptation sufficient to strain to utmost limit honesty of most thoroughly conscientious man therefore finally settled matter with by determining upon compromise must take nicholls simpson into confidence just so far a be absolutely necessary farther therefore when landed on beach after taking nicholls off cutter leslie invited two men to accompany to tent there to empty last bottle of champagne in drinking to success of new craft when ceremony have be duly performed leslie turned to two men said now lad cutter having be successfully got into water find in position of being able to make to certain proposal offer have long be in mind when took two men off raft brought ashore here in dying condition that tiny craft float so jauntily out there on smooth water of lagoon be only in frame mere skeleton saw of what that skeleton be composed saw that be made of tough steel firmly substantially put together with stout bolt rivet since then have assisted to bring forward little craft from what then be to what be to day have seen handled material have be worked into nobody know better than yourselves what careful faithful labour workmanship have be bestowed upon putting of together now want to give honest opinion a sailor of little craft know that be built for sole purpose of carrying away from island may tell lie well in heart of pacific want a sailor of experience to say whether will feel hesitation in trusting life to nicholls laughed heartily at question simpson grinned corroboratively why exclaimed former men have gone more than halfway round world in craft be to be mentioned on same day a dandy little packet last time be in sydney be last year there be yankee chap there have made voyage from america in dug out canoe that have decked over rigged a three masted schooner chap intended to go on complete trip round world mind saying must have altogether cared about making such voyage in craft yonder little beauty different story 'd be a willing to ship in a in anything else provided that be made worth while what say bobeun same here answered simpson man of brevity really mean be speaking in serious earnest demanded leslie be most certainly answered nicholls in proof of intend to sail with when leave island if will take mr leslie think be man to refuse two poor castaway passage especially a have got plenty of room aboard there for can make useful enough to pay for passage very well then said leslie now be proposal have to make to have here on island snugly stowed away in cave certain valuable be most anxious to personally convey to england for certain reason with need not trouble be equally anxious to get home without bringing under notice of authority only way in can be done be to take home in cutter plan be to make way in first instance to australia where miss trevor will leave flora at melbourne will revictual thence proceed to capetown where will do like sailing thence to england with call perhaps at of canary if necessary now if have fancy for such long trip a have sketched out in so small craft a flora will of course be perfectly free to leave upon arrival at melbourne if on other hand be willing to ship with for whole voyage think can make quite worth while for will require at least two men whom can absolutely trust believe two to be men now what amount must consider to be adequate remuneration for run home from here how long do reckon trip be going to take sir inquired nicholls um let see considered leslie making mental calculation ought to do comfortably in about one hundred eighty day six month call seven month if like nicholls considered for few minute then looked up said must sixty pound be too much to ask mr leslie taking everything into consideration what do say simpson asked leslie with smile sixty pound 'd satisfy answered boatswain very well said dick now be will do with both will be worth thousand pound to to get valuable of mine safely home a said without attracting attention if therefore will ship for run home with rendering assistance necessary to take flora cargo safely to port to be hereafter decided upon in english channel will give written bond to pay of five hundred pound sterling within one calendar month of date of arrival how will suit will suit better than job have ever yet dropped upon say done with sir many thanks answered nicholls with enthusiasm simpson demanded dick good enough answered boatswain with usual brevity very well then be settled said leslie will draw up agreement in triplicate at once can sign retaining copy will put whole matter upon thoroughly ship shape satisfactory basis round dick prepared agreement there then having read over to two seaman first draft obtained unqualified approval of at once proceeded to make two additional copy three be then duly signed flora also attaching signature a witness transaction be thereupon completed now said dick that bit of business being arranged must like to take cutter round to little cove at great distance from cave where valuable be concealed get aboard at once before deck be hampered up with gear what not will therefore get catamaran under way tow round can leave catamaran in cove also walk back by way of change moreover will afford opportunity to stretch leg bit will not get very much more walking exercise now until arrive in england a three men be wending way down to beach leslie eye happened to fall upon case of rifle revolver ammunition from have be drawing supply be only case of ammunition that possessed now with sudden fear that in hurry of departure might be forgotten said to nicholls see here nicholls might just a well be carrying something with a go down to catamaran empty handed if simpson will lay hold of case of ammunition will bring along dozen rifle will then be quite a well armed a there will be need for to be may not want on other hand may if must happen to want at will probably want very badly upon taking cutter in tow be found that towed very lightly offering only trifling resistance to catamaran after have fairly got way upon in little more than hour craft be off entrance to cove yet so cunningly have nature concealed that though leslie knew almost to inch where to look for have utmost difficulty in finding have not possessed personal knowledge of existence therefore persisted in search must never have found after passing opening no le than four time without being able to find managed to hit off at fifth attempt ten minute later craft be inside snugly moored to rocky side of basin catamaran being placed innermost to protect dainty freshly painted side of cutter from chafe against rock nicholls simpson betrayed profoundest astonishment admiration at singularly perfect adaptation of cove to purpose of harbour for small craft must scarcely be persuaded to drag away from water edge when at length have be induced to climb up almost vertical face of cliff found at mouth of treasure cave wonder at what saw be greater than ever uttered loud exclamation of astonishment when be invited to lift one of hide bound gold brick felt unexpected weight of of appeared to have remotest suspicion of real nature of stuff be handling nicholls merely commenting upon excellence a ballast lauding leslie wisdom in having decided to so use instead of portion of lead casting that have rejected indeed men appeared to regard queer little black leather bound block a merely something especially suitable for ballast taken by dick for purpose reason alone be massive ancient looking carved chest with elaborate binding of rusty metal work that appeared to regard a receptacle of valuable about safety of leslie be so anxious managed to get sixty of gold brick down aboard cutter stowed under cabin floor same afternoon by time that have accomplished level ray of declining sun warned that moment have arrived when ought to be starting upon march across country toward camp broken character of country claimed larger share of leslie attention upon occasion than when have last visited cave perhaps be because mind be now more at rest than have then be for cutter be at former period merely possibility be now actuality more than already carried very respectable little fortune snugly stowed away in interior possibly who can tell there may have be vague unsuspected mental prevision ere long intimate knowledge of detail of curiously shapeless earthquake upheaval must be of priceless value to be that a may now looked about with eye of warrior rather than explorer noting with astonishment wonderful way in earthquake have split piled up rock into form of natural impregnable fortress including cavern basin there be one point one only at natural fortress must be entered upon previous visit have passed through twice without noting fact now however not only took notice of saw also that small rampart composed of dozen so of stone must be arranged in five minute must enable single man to hold place against army at event so long a ammunition held out so strongly did idea impress upon that must not resist temptation to actually construct small rampart then there stop moment two cried have fancy for trying little experiment just bring along few of heaviest piece of rock that can conveniently handle seizing block carried to certain point threw on ground then on about piled others be brought to until within ten minute have constructed breastwork of dimension sufficient to efficiently screen one man from fire of enemy while enabled through small loophole to effectually enfilade one only spot at enemy must possibly enter flung down behind barricade peeped through loophole defence be now complete there exclaimed in tone of perfect satisfaction if anybody must ever come here in future require citadel upon to retreat against overwhelming odds be place so long a can command nerve to remain behind barricade maintain steady rifle fire upon narrow gap through a may see only one man can pas at time will be absolutely safe well thank god be not likely to need protection for ought to be at sea on third evening from now following day be devoted by three men to task of putting remainder of gold brick on board cutter succeeded in accomplishing before knocking off work for day meant that have to work hard late to do meanwhile flora be equally busily engaged upon work of getting together from heterogeneous assortment of clothing have formed part of mermaid cargo sufficient stock to see through two month voyage to other side of pacific knowing that be thus engaged must doubtless be fatigued by time that have arrived at end of day work leslie be considerably surprised when having traversed about distance between cove camp encountered having evidently walked out from camp to meet moreover saw at once that encounter be not merely result of natural desire on part of girl to meet lover be something more momentous than for there be excited look in eye that there be mistaking so doffing cap to a joined little party said with smile well dear what be have news of kind for see not bad news hope oh replied be not bad news at at least must think not be simply that there be ship approaching island a thought must be glad to know a soon a possible decided to come on tell at once thanks very much replied dick be indeed interesting news whereabouts be how far off be over there in direction replied flora pointing to north westward be by merest accident happened to see took fancy to go up toward mermaid head to gather bouquet of lovely orchid grow in direction thinking probably must be last opportunity to get of be while be gathering that saw be still good distance away might have thought that be merely passing island for when first saw be sailing in direction sweeping hand from west to east while be still watching turned round now be coming nearly straight for island ah remarked leslie thoughtfully be certainly interesting be much obliged to for coming out to tell let be getting on toward camp there may still be time for to run up to point have look at ere nightfall then following up own train of thought added if be a far off a describe will hardly be near enough to hit off entrance channel come inside before dark be to say if really mean to pay visit nothing more be said upon subject just then a soon a leslie reached camp procured telescope hurrying away to nearest point from must be possible to obtain view of stranger subjected to a careful scrutiny a circumstance permitted after however there be not very much to be learned about for be about twelve mile distant dead to leeward of island a sun be already dipping below horizon time available for observation be short must distinguish however that be barque rigged apparently very smart little vessel of about three hundred ton thereabout that be beating up to fetch island be obvious for whereas when leslie first sighted be on port tack heading south shortly afterwards tacked to eastward thus in conjunction with what flora have already observed clearly indicating that purpose be at least to pas island a closely a possible if not to actually touch at that latter be intention leslie have manner of doubt for if have intended merely to pas closely by there must have be need for to have made last board to eastward by standing on to southward must have slid down under lee of island quite closely enough to have made most detailed observation that commander might have deemed necessary there be one peculiarity connected with for inexplicable reason took hold upon leslie mind with persistence be positively worrying to yet be peculiarity of apparently most trivial unimportant character be simply that when tacked noticed with keenness of observation be so peculiarly attribute of highly trained naval officer that yard be swung very slowly one after other a though be very short handed even for merchant vessel a leslie closed telescope thoughtfully wended way back toward camp found perplexed by presence within mind of two strangely conflicting train of thought on one hand here be ship approaching island either intending to make call at to approach so closely that must be simplest matter in world for to go out on catamaran intercept by acting thus must be able without difficulty to secure for companion transport to civilised port from must be easy for to obtain passage to england even though barque must not be homeward bound that transport must be at least of a safe character a afforded by cutter while must be infinitely more comfortable at event for flora must happen to encounter bad weather following train of thought seemed to leslie that obvious commonsense course for to pursue be to take catamaran go out to barque acquainting skipper with circumstance relating to presence of little party upon island pilot into lagoon with view of coming to arrangement for shipping of companion on board on morrow against plan there be thought of treasure what be to be done with must be prudent advisable to entrust property of such enormous value to crew of absolute stranger of whose character must have time opportunity to judge upon point have doubt whatever answer to question be most emphatic negative if so ran thought be not prepared to ship treasure aboard unknown barque entrust to unknown crew what be to do with be to leave concealed in cavern have already be hiding place for so many year return to fetch away at more convenient season recent experience of great physical change may be wrought by earthquake shock have already impressed upon strong conviction of possibility that second shock might at moment bury treasure irrecoverably conviction be a strong argument against adoption of alternative course a man need wish for felt that must be equally unwise for to ship aboard stranger to leave on island until must return to fetch if desired to make sure of a most certainly did proper course be to carry away in cutter a have always intended a to nicholls simpson felt that despite appearance of mysterious barque upon scene liberal offer to must quite suffice to hold to bargain with ground thus cleared there remained only flora to be considered dick very quickly arrived at conclusion that only be one who must decide whether must leave island in barque accompany in cutter have not much doubt a to what decision must be chapter fifteen mysterious barque when leslie returned to camp found tent lighted up flora dinner awaiting be tired for day have be unusually fatiguing one when man be tired usually prefers to be silent nevertheless recapitulated in detail to flora have be in mind during walk home finally put question to whether must rather leave in barque in cutter former perhaps offering more comfortable because more roomy quarter than latter have decided to do dick asked oh replied so far a be concerned have quite made up mind to adhere to original plan of going home in cutter taking treasure with then of course that settle everything said flora simply where go dick dear go also be to say if will have last with most angelic smile there be one reply possible to remark so matter be settled after having lighted pipe strolled over to hut to discus with nicholls simpson unexpected appearance of barque in neighbourhood if mean to touch here a feel pretty certain that doe remarked leslie after have related to two men result of observation will doubtless dodge off on until daylight a of course can not know whereabouts of channel through reef then can go out in canoe pilot in meanwhile what do two men think of doing be going to keep to arrangement with must prefer to get skipper of barque to take nicholls regarded leslie with surprise hope sir said that want to cry off bargain with have already be planning in mind what will do with five hundred certainly not interrupted dick with laugh have wish to cry off bargain a term merely wish to understand will not attempt to hold to if must prefer barque to cutter barque must doubtless be more comfortable than cutter in heavy weather may be must may be must observed nicholls anyhow difference must be so very great one way other there be five hundred pound to be got out of barque be bound to have money mr leslie same here cut in simpson right laughed leslie then that matter be settled for good so need say more about question be what be comin ' here for inquired simpson volunteering remark for first time on record oh who can tell returned leslie may be whaler although believe that be putting in here in hope of finding water be only explanation have occurred to a accounting for presence in locality be really long way out of of usual ship track be first craft have sighted since arrival upon island doubt will learn to morrow why there be interrupted nicholls pointing by jingo just look at coming in through channel a confidently a though have be in habit of sailin ' in out of day of life with nothing better than starlight to see way by well dash wig be rum go mistake be even a said for while three men stood there talking together shadowy form of barque under two topsail fore topmast staysail be seen gliding into lagoon close past cape flora skipper evidently perfectly acquainted with exact situation of entrance channel presently topsail halliard be let run sail clewed up rattle of gear cheeping of block being distinctly audible to three on beach then minute two later came splash of anchor rumbling rattle of cable through hawse pipe barque be seen to swing to anchor well be perfectly clear that man who have charge of have be in here at least once before remarked leslie evidently know place quite well now wonder what be have brought here must give trifle to know of course must readily find out by taking canoe paddling off aboard to ask question will not do furthermore may be just a well not to let people know until to morrow morning at rate that there be anybody on island therefore pleads take care of that light show from hut to night will just step up to tent give miss trevor similar caution good night men have better be stirring by dawn to morrow morning so saying leslie turned away made way to tent where not only cautioned flora against showing light took such simple precaution a be required to render impossible that necessary light in tent must be seen from barque then done to satisfaction lighted pipe taking telescope be day night glass once more sauntered down to beach to watch proceeding aboard strange vessel for although must find legitimate reason excuse for feeling be undeniable fact that appearance of barque upon scene affected disagreeably producing within vague sense of unrest that almost amounted to foreboding why have come to island be question persistently haunted to must find entirely satisfactory reply that presence there be accidental must not believe else how came that person in charge of knew so well where to find channel giving access to lagoon entered so confidently not even waiting for daylight to enable to see way in a mused thus employed in intently watching barque through night glass again noting fact that vessel be curiously short handed for people furled only one topsail at time so far a must make out have only four men available for job instead of at least twice number furthermore noticed that even for small number of men time consumed in rolling up stowing sail be quite unconscionable arguing existence of exceedingly lax discipline if at aboard craft estimated that occupied four men fully two hour to furl two topsail when be at last done men have descended to deck with exasperating deliberation came to conclusion that if night glass be to be trusted job have be done in most disgracefully slovenly manner patiently watched that barque until visible sign of life aboard have vanished then walked thoughtfully back to tent turned in flora having retired time before ere must get to sleep be disturbed by sound of hideous uproar came floating shoreward from stranger going again into open air to hear more clearly presently recognised sound a of discordant singing finally recognising fact that regular drunken orgie be in progress aboard craft still further evidence of singularly lax state of discipline leslie couch be sleepless one night for fact be that taking everything into consideration must neither account satisfactorily for presence of barque at island convince that errand there be altogether honest one therefore with first faint flush of dawn be again astir rousing flora two men bade get breakfast forthwith make best of way out of camp ere barque people must have have opportunity to see become aware of presence on island further gave nicholls simpson instruction to proceed with complete rigging of cutter bending of sail in readiness for getting under way at moment notice unfortunately flora have still to be provisioned watered for voyage be just fact possibility that stranger might be disposed to interfere with operation discomposed for must most cheerfully have marched little party out of camp left with everything contained to mercy of barque crew whom have already in unaccountable fashion come to look upon a outlaw gave men strictest injunction that flora be to forthwith take up quarter aboard cutter while nicholls simpson be to camp in natural fortress to have that same afternoon drawn attention holding against comer on account leaving altogether unguarded day night a for announced that must remain a sole occupant of camp to meet stranger ascertain reason for visit after further action must be guided by circumstance leslie be of opinion that after orgie of preceding night crew of barque must be in particular hurry to turn out surmise proved to be quite correct for although kept keen watch upon vessel be not until nearly nine o'clock that detected first sign of movement on board in shape of thin streamer of smoke issuing from galley funnel then watched for usual sign of washing down deck drawing of water streaming of scupper so on must detect nothing of kind be bell struck on board to mark passage of time two additional indication of absence of discipline still further increased fast growing uneasiness respecting character of unwelcome visitor a soon a light be strong enough may be mentioned have taken look at barque through telescope have read word minerva glasgow painted across counter thus knew that vessel be british a indeed have already suspected now be dick purpose to learn a much a possibly must about stranger to let know a little a possible about nothing at about companion in return until have have opportunity to get notion of true character have therefore determined to pose a solitary castaway now in character proceeded down to beach stepped into canoe began to paddle laboriously off toward barque for knew that one of first thing to be done by skipper of vessel must be to bring telescope to bear upon island must immediately result in discovery of tent pile of salvage from brig hut litter upon beach a be consequently impossible to conceal fact of presence upon island judged that natural action of such castaway a must be to eagerly seize first opportunity to communicate with calling ship canoe being big heavy craft for one man to handle took full hour to paddle off to barque be not until be within hundred yard of that be able to detect open indication of fact that presence have be discovered then saw big burly looking individual come aft along vessel full poop deliberately bring pair of binocular glass to bear upon at once ceased paddling placing hand to mouth hailed minerva ahoy hillo came response across water in gruff voice accurately matched build general appearance of owner may come aboard inquired dick resuming paddle ay ay come aboard if ye like be somewhat ungracious response without further parley leslie paddled up alongside under starboard main channel flinging painter up to individual who came to side peered curiously down upon over bulwark scrambled up side a best must in absence of side ladder next moment found on deck cast apparently casual really embracing glance round noted that barque be evidently just ordinary trader with nothing in least remarkable about appearance save extraordinary paucity of men about deck under ordinary circumstance condition at hour hand must have be on deck busy about preparation for carrying out of object of visit to island might be instead of man on poop man who have made fast painter for cook fat faced evil looking man with most atrocious squint who came to galley door stared with malevolent curiosity at be only individual visible be not however part of leslie policy to exhibit surprise at unusual condition of affair so simply advanced to poop ladder with manner of one little uncertain how to act looking up at burly man who stood at head of ladder glowering down upon said good morning be captain of barque ay answered individual addressed be cap'n turnbull who may be mister how blaze do come to be on there island how many more be there of ye a see be alone unfortunately answered leslie pretty hard time have have of thank god be over now that have turned up for presume will be quite willing to give passage to next port may be calling at give ye passage reiterated burly man scornfully give nothin ' be poor man be ca afford to give anything away not even passage to next port if be minded to come aboard work passage be welcome for be short handed a dare say can see be easy enough to tell that be sailor man be must be here must ye last with grin disclosed set of strong irregular tobacco stained teeth imparted to speaker expression of satyr conversation thus far have be conducted a have started with leslie down on main deck turnbull on poop incongruity of arrangement now seemed to strike latter for added come up here mister can talk more comfortably when be alongside of one can spin yarn how come to be alone by on yon island in acceptance of graciously worded invitation leslie ran lightly up poop ladder slightly raising cap said permit to introduce captain turnbull name be leslie with emphasis recital of chain of circumstance ended in being cast away upon island yonder will be so lengthy that with permission will smoke pipe a tell therewith calmly drew pipe from pocket filling lighted up meanwhile manner language appearance have be steadily impressing other man who insensibly began to infuse own manner with certain measure of respect a interview lengthened out having lighted pipe leslie proceeded to relate whole story of adventure beginning with embarkation on board golden fleece ending up with stranding of mermaid carefully suppressing reference whatsoever to miss trevor representing not a ex naval officer a amateur yachtsman be careful also to mention nothing about existence of cutter on other hand dwelt at length upon idea have entertained of building craft capable of carrying sufficient stock of provision away from island doubt however whether must ever have managed single handed arrival render further trouble on score unnecessary said in conclusion well yes returned turnbull somewhat more genially than have yet spoken there be call for to worry about buildin ' boat now a say bepecially a be good navigator can come home with workin ' passage by navigatin ' ship for good navigator be just exactly what happens to want ah indeed can not rely upon mate then inquired leslie blandly mate ejaculated burly man well ca that be to say continued confusedly be only navigator have got now well ca depend upon do find then that own observation yield different result asked leslie still in same bland quiet manner own observation reiterated captain turnbull take observation ye see added looking hard at leslie impassive face to discover whether latter have noticed anything peculiar in such extraordinary admission sight little bit peculiar can see ordinary thing plain enough when come to squintin ' through sextant ca see nothin ah indeed must be exceedingly awkward for captain returned leslie be not surprised at anxiety to secure service of navigator by way how long do propose to remain here must like to know so that may make preparation accordingly well answered turnbull there be particular reason for to hurry s'pose hour will be about time enough for to get few trap together bring off wo oh yes answered leslie nonchalantly that time will amply suffice will do so at once if like there be occasion for hurry a said just now retorted turnbull now that be here think will give men spell let have run ashore bit in fact think must do with week ashore there most lovely place look like from here by bye how long did say 'd be on that there island trifle over nine month answered leslie over nine month ejaculated other in tone of intense surprise well nobody 'd think a 'd be castaway for nine month to look at ye why look strong healthy enough a smartly rigged a though 'd just stepped out of most dandy outfitter in minories oh there be nothing very wonderful in laughingly protested leslie nine month of life practically in open air time be just thing to keep man fit know while a for rig ' found big stock of clothes among mermaid cargo have drawn freely upon nine month on island repeated turnbull still dwelling upon particular fact why s'pose know inch of ground ashore there by time there be certain ill suppressed eagerness in tone of man voice a asked question acted very much a danger signal to leslie seemed to suggest that thus far man have merely be fencing with that be now trying to get within guard that in short object of minerva visit to island be nearing surface therefore replied with studied carelessness indeed on contrary know very little of not nearly a much a ought to know have be to summit once took general survey of island from point have wandered for short distance about le densely bush clad ground on side of island be about fact be be much too keen upon saving everything possibly must out of brig to think of wasting time in wandering about island greater part of be covered with almost impassable bush ah yes s'pose must be rejoined turnbull with expression of relief set leslie wondering what on earth did matter to turnbull whether dick leslie have explored island not asked turnbull next remark let in little light upon obscurity distinctly startled leslie for staring steadfastly at island burly man presently observed yes be fine big island mistake with mountain on too must say now that island must be very likely place for cave eh look a though there might be amount of cave ashore there in side of there hill cave like flash of lightning true explanation of minerva visit stood clearly revealed to leslie mind that one word cave spoken a be in tone of mingled excitement anxiety ill suppressed have furnished with key to entire enigma cave yes of course be that explained everything very nearly everything have thus far be puzzling leslie gave practically information that have be so anxious to acquire have read of such incident in book of course have so far regarded merely a peg whereon to hang more le ingeniously conceived exciting romance here be similar incident occurring in actual prosaic earnest suddenly found confronted with situation of exceeding difficulty for mention by turnbull of word cave careless casual a fondly believed to be actually exceedingly clumsy have in instant driven home to leslie mind conviction somehow other man have become possessed of information of existence of treasure on island have come to take away by what circuitous chain of event information have fallen into fellow hand be of course quite impossible to guess that be explanation of everything dick be fully convinced now that possessed clue must not only guard own tongue against betrayal of information must also doubtless so order remark a to extort from one of visitor detail that might require so in reply to turnbull last remark said carelessly cave oh really know very possibly there may be unless earthquake have shaken in filled up earthquake roared turnbull in tone of mingled rage consternation mean to say a have have hearthquake here do ye certainly answered dick with a much sang froid a though earthquake be mere pleasant interlude in otherwise monotonous life occurred about three month ago gave place pretty severe shaking up can assure also started that volcano into activity again after age of quiescence mischief ejaculated turnbull with manifest discomposure must go ashore at once be afraid said leslie gently that mention of earthquake possible effect upon cave of island have somewhat upset be going ashore in hope of finding particular cave if so will be most happy to assist in search assist will be mean of course not exclaimed turnbull beginning with savage bellow suddenly calming again what d 'ye s'pose man like want to go pokin ' about ashore there huntin ' after cave for have somethin ' else to do have come in here because fresh water turned bad thought that maybe might be able to renew stock s'pose there be fresh water to be have on island certainly answered there be most excellent supply quite accessible to boat lie over there pointing toward mermaid head fall over low ledge of rock into deep water can go alongside rock fill up boat tank direct if like ah that will do first rate remarked turnbull will give order for men to start foul water at once now a see that sun over fore yard what will take to drink s'pose have be pretty hard up month for drink have ye indeed answered leslie on contrary found abundance of wine spirit aboard brig only thing have lacked have be mineral water therefore if happen to have soda water on board will give great pleasure to take whisky soda with believe have soda left answered turnbull doubtfully wo mind takin ' up here on poop will ye continued fact be there be man lyin ' sick in one of cabin below want to disturb with talk of course leslie although have doubt about genuineness of sick man story readily acquiesced in suggestion of other seated in one of two deck chair be standing on poop while turnbull retired ostensibly for purpose of quietly hunting up steward few minute later steward young cockney of about twenty five year of age who have worn harassed appearance of man living in state of perpetual scare came up poop ladder bearing tray on be couple of tumbler uncorked bottle of whisky two bottle of soda water placed upon skylight cover then taking up whisky bottle tumbler proceeded to pour out portion of spirit glancing anxiously about a did so say when ' sir please requested in loud voice immediately adding under breath be alone ashore there sir be there others there along with whole air of extreme trepidation manner of secrecy with put singular question be further confirmation if be needed of certain very ugly suspicion have be taking strong hold upon leslie during whole progress of interview with man turnbull dick therefore replied to steward by putting question to in same low cautious tone why do ask that man murmured because sir there be be that about enough whisky sir latter part of steward speech be uttered in tone of voice must be distinctly heard a far forward a break of poop with man abrupt change of subject be evidently caused a leslie must see out of corner of eye by silent stealthy appearance of turnbull head above top of ladder glance of keen suspicion that shot at two occupant of poop dick took tumbler from steward shaking hand calmly held up before critically measuring quantity of spirit contained yes thanks replied that will do nicely now for soda held tumbler while steward opened soda water bottle emptied be effervescing content into spirit turnbull glanced keenly from leslie to steward back again said nothing although unfortunate attendant condition of terror be patent to observer dick waited patiently while trembling man helped turnbull then lifting tumbler said health captain to better acquaintance thank same to gruffly replied individual addressed adding to steward will do can go back to pantry now get on with work fellow departed in double quick time obviously glad to get away from neighbourhood of somewhat surly superior a went turnbull watched until disappeared down poop ladder rum cove that remarked to leslie a man vanished good sort of steward enough nervous a cat did ye notice be quite impossible not to do so answered dick with laugh must not help feeling sorry for poor beggar take that be simpleton of ship that hand make point of badgering ay answered turnbull eagerly clearly relieved that dick have taken view of man condition be just exactly what be have hit case off to haffigraphy well enough said about if be ready to go ashore now will go with ye by mean answered leslie genially not that be in least degree desirous to have man company even that of crew must land upon island at still knew that barque being where be be inevitable that at least of ship company must insist upon going ashore must not see how be to prevent meanwhile be much better to have fellow alone with than accompanied by dozen more of men a spoke rose from seat led way toward canoe turnbull following upon reaching gangway however dick looked over side then turning to companion said think must find more convenient if people rigged side ladder canoe be rather crank if must happen to tumble overboard in getting into must not answer for life lagoon swarm with shark a likely a not there be one two under ship bottom at moment turnbull grunted turned away looking forward to where two three men be loafing about on forecastle hard at work doing nothing for'ard there shouted rouse out side ladder rig of ye look sharp about steward added turning toward cabin under poop bring out handful of cigar two men with ladder steward with cigar appeared simultaneously pocketing weed skipper proceeded to gangway to supervise rigging of ladder a did so leslie felt something being thrust surreptitiously into hand felt like folded piece of paper calmly pocketed glancing casually about a did so steward be only man near be shuffling off nimbly on way back to pantry leslie took time paddling ashore when at length pair landed on beach sun have passed meridian now captain said dick where must like to go in first place turnbull stood looked about admiringly why exclaimed here hisland be real beautiful place mistake dash wig why man might do sight worse than settle here for rest of natural eh ay answered leslie indifferently have often thought so indeed be quite on card may return here day with few seed outfit of gardener tool a say man might do worse by way perhaps will be a well to get lunch before start out on ramble will come up to tent will find very comfortable little shanty must apologise for fare that will be obliged to offer have lived on tinned meat fish ever since have be here have caught fish to day well must say a have managed to make pretty tidy comfortable observed leslie guest a entered tent stared about in astonishment picters fancy lamp table chair with swagger cloth jigmarees upon brass mounted bedstead beddin ' fit for king be blame sight better quarter than will find aboard minerva so tell ye leslie laughed lightly what doe matter demanded true be fond of comfort always make point of getting where can can rough with anybody when becomes necessary dick be obliged to leave guest alone in tent for short time while looked after preparation for luncheon have little doubt that during absence man must without scruple peer pry into other compartment of tent to contingency be quite indifferent for have foreseen forestalled before going off to barque by carefully gathering up stowing away such few trace of woman presence a flora have left behind that turnbull have followed natural propensity of men of stamp be made clear immediately upon dick return for quite unabashed fellow remarked say mister be doin ' thing in style here mistake have be havin ' look round here tent of yourn while have be away see a have acshully got pianner in next room where be shipmate gone to shipmate repeated leslie staring blankly at ay shipmate reiterated turnbull severely told be alone here see a have got two bedroom rigged up here who be t'other for where be really captain said dick coldly can not see what possible difference can make to whether have shipmate not if will pardon for saying so continued somewhat more genially be perfectly evident that have never lived alone on island must understand what luxury be to be able to change one sleeping room occasionally oh that be be returned turnbull with sudden relief sleep sometimes in one bed sometimes in t'other by way of change eh a see answered dick briefly now will draw up chair be not very tempting meal can offer can make up for when return to ship evening be evident to leslie turnbull be much exercised in mind about something for ate drank silently with preoccupied air later on reason for became manifest for when at length rose from table fellow remarked with clumsy effort at nonchalance look here mister expect have plenty of matter to look after attend to so worry about showin ' round here hisland of yourn just go on with what have got in hand will take stroll somewhere by so that be wanted opportunity to go off upon exploring expedition unrestrained by dick presence did not at chime in with leslie plan for felt certain that if yielded to companion suggestion latter must at once make way in direction of treasure cave endeavour to discover locality with result that must inevitably come into collision with nicholls simpson in case must doubtless happen sooner later dick wished to acquire little further information before occurred therefore replied oh thanks very much be busy enough in conscience before arrived now that have turned up have kindly consented to take off island have nothing further to do so may a well accompany since know shortest way to such few point of interest a island posse where must like to go crater watering place be about only spot be likely to tempt think turnbull glared at dick a though must have eaten for moment ex lieutenant thought that guest be about to try violent measure with if thought be really in mind suffered more prudent counsel to prevail with after few moment hesitation intimated that must like to have look at watering place dick accordingly piloted morose companion to spot pointed out how excellently be adapted to purpose of watering ship drawing attention to deep water immediately beneath low cascade dilating upon facility with boat must be brought alongside be clearly apparent to that turnbull be absolutely uninterested in subject be by mean sorry when upon return to camp latter declined invitation to remain on shore to dinner curtly requested to be at once put off to barque during passage off to vessel man surliness of demeanour suddenly vanished a though brilliant idea have just struck became in moment almost offensively civil strongly urging dick to remain aboard barque make night of neither did suit dick plan sudden change in man demeanour at once roused leslie suspicion a have intention whatever of placing in fellow power suavely declined invitation remarking that a must soon be having quite a much of sea a wanted must continue to enjoy present roomy quarter a long a must chapter sixteen story of mutiny not until leslie be once more back in own tent absolutely safe from possibility of interruption espionage did venture to open peruse scrap of paper that steward have that morning so surreptitiously slipped into hand be apparently part of leaf of pocket memorandum book hastily scribbled in pencil in ill formed uneducated hand bore following word sir for god sake take care what about life wo be worth brass farden turnbull aint more proper capten of ship than be there wo be anchor watch aboard here to night so if youl come off about half after midnight will be on lookout for yer tell yer hole bloomin yarn for god sake come steward um meditated leslie a held document to light of lamp now what doe mean be trap to get aboard barque be genuine latter be inclined to think for several reason first of be that poor man be obviously in state of abject terror morning secondly be so keenly anxious to open up communication with that made unsuccessful attempt to do so while helping to whisky soda thirdly statement that turnbull be not legitimate skipper of barque be so evidently true that need discussion fourthly if turnbull have seriously desired to make prisoner afternoon must easily have done so by sending boat crew in pursuit of be to say corrected for know to contrary must easily have done so for how be to know have two fully loaded revolver in pocket equivalent to life of twelve men yes be strongly inclined to believe that remarkable little document be genuine that there be something very radically wrong aboard barque what be wonder that turnbull have somehow got scent of treasure be after be almost prepared to swear obvious vexation disappointment at finding here a man in possession equally obvious effort to shake off to day that might have opportunity to go away by in search of cave prove there be something more than be certain wonder now whether story of sick man in cabin have anything to do with must not be surprised if have where be crew morning turnbull spoke of being short handed surely there be more people aboard than steward cook two three men saw oh yes there be something very queer about whole business document be genuine at event will go off to night hear what steward have to say about in accordance with resolution leslie forthwith partook of good hearty meal then extinguishing lamp left tent to guard against possibility of being surprised there in sleep walking over to pile of good that have accumulated from brig cargo raised tarpaulin covered creeping underneath stretched out a comfortably a must to snatch few hour sleep confident that faculty possessed of being able to wake at desired moment must not play false few minute later be fast asleep for dick leslie be one of men who when once have resolved upon certain course of action dismiss further consideration of from mind allow to trouble no longer have fixed upon half past eleven a hour at must rise allowing full hour in to paddle off to barque when by by awoke under shelter of tarpaulin cautiously struck match consulted watch found that be within five minute of half hour next peered out from under tarpaulin carefully scanned beach by light of star to see whether turnbull have sent boat ashore in hope of catching weasel asleep own canoe be only craft visible accordingly made way down to water edge pushing off sprang noiselessly into a went afloat then heading round with couple of powerful sweep of paddle pointed nose toward spot where minerva spar made delicate tracery of black against star spangled heaven with long easy silent stroke drove quietly ahead that crew have not yet retired to bunk be soon evident to from fact that snatch of maudlin song came floating down to occasionally upon pinion of dew laden night breeze dwindled steadily a drew nearer to vessel about quarter of hour before arrived alongside ceased altogether craft subsided into complete silence leslie deemed advisable to approach barque with considerable amount of caution not that doubted steward because despite silence have fallen on board be just possible that of crew might still be awake on deck therefore kept three mast of vessel in one crept up to very gently from right astern a drew in under shadow of hull complete darkness silence in craft be wrapped seemed almost ominous uncanny presently detected solitary figure on poop evidently on watch moment later saw that figure be silently signalling to to draw up under counter obeying silent signal found rope dangling over stern seized next instant figure that have observed came silently wriggling down rope into canoe leslie at once recognised a steward be right sir whispered man breathless in part from exertion partly also leslie believed from apprehension be all right let go sir please let get few fathom away from ship for there be knowin ' when skunk turnbull may take into head to come on deck 'ave look round ' e a nervous a cat suspicious that ca be up to 'im there thank ' e sir dare say that will do wo be able to see 'ear from where be now for must see until be close under counter well have come sir god be thanked 'ope will be able to 'elp because if ca

'ere be hisland where turnbull think e will find 'be treasure doubt agreed leslie well what do want to do well sir ai for like of to say just exactly what ought to do answered reynolds thought that maybe if spinned whole yarn 'd be able to think out way of 'elpin of there ai doubt in mind what bein ' on hisland upset turnbull calculation altogether a make out ' e reckoned upon comin 'ere goin ' ashore with 'be paper in 'be 'and walkin ' pretty straight to place where 'ere treasure be buried diggin ' of up quite comfortable with nobody to hinterfere with 'im bein ' 'ere make okkard for 'im see because ' e afraid that where ' e go will go with 'im if ' e go pokin ' about lookin ' after buried treasure will drop on to 'be secret p'rhaps get 'old of stuff be just where danger to come in because d 'ye see sir if ' e 'd kill one man for sake of gettin 'old of barque to come 'ere on off chance of findin ' treasure e ai kind of man to 'esitate about killin ' who 'd be likely to hinterfere with 'im just so assented leslie be quite possible will see that doe nothing of kind now tell how many of ship company be with turnbull how many be there against well first of there be turnbull be one answered steward then there be burton royston hampton cunliffe four ab be five lastly there be cook e make six then on side there be mr mate be one be be two there be rogers andrew parker martin four ordinary seaman be six again so there be six against six a may say only there be difference between turnbull 'ave got two revolver one what ' e found in skipper cabin one ' e took from mate while four ab knife whereas 'ave nothin ' 'avin ' took knife everything away from still argued leslie belaying pin be always available suppose be fairly effective weapon in hand to hand fight to say nothing of handspike other matter that can always lay hand on of course turnbull brace of revolver give immense advantage must come to fighting can plainly see that if slip be to be recaptured at believe can be managed must be done without fighting for be not strong handed enough to risk loss even disablement of so much a single man now tell turnbull informs that water be bad that intends to re water ship here be that true be only fabrication to account to for presence here of minerva why just nothin ' else sir answered steward water good enough certingly be runnin ' rather short of doubt what ' e will fill up if there be water to be 'ad 'ere be treasure a ' e after first foremost forget quite so agreed leslie now doubt will go ashore again soon after daylight a will not come off to ship will be compelled to come ashore in own boat how many men will be likely to bring with think not more 'n two sir certingly answered steward p'rhaps not at likely enough when ' e find a come off ' e will scull ashore in dinghy because see sir e trust none of ' four a be standin ' in with 'im four order to keep strict heye upon to see that rise take back ship from 'em so think a ' e will take o ashore with 'im if ' e can 'elp ' e wo take none of others 'cause ' e 'd be afraid to trust alone with very well said leslie think can see way pretty clearly now if turnbull must go ashore by to morrow will look after see that doe not return to barque if must take of own gang with say two of will leave only two cook aboard against six of will make two to one in case must watch chance if can find opportunity rise upon three retake ship if must succeed hoist ensign to gaff end a signal to that ship be recaptured run risk mind because a have already said can not afford to lose even one man if can not see good chance to retake ship must watch opportunity think of other plan be think now will put aboard again look out for to come off again about same time to morrow night with same caution a before leslie now again approached barque time took canoe up under craft mizzen channel from be much easier matter for steward to scramble aboard again than if have be compelled to shin up rope dangling over stern by have descended having seen man safely in on deck softly pushed canoe off ship side with bare hand allowed to be driven clear by wind be not until be good hundred yard astern of minerva that took to paddle returned to camp be nearly two o'clock in morning when at length once more entered tent stretched upon bed to finish night rest leslie be habitually early riser notwithstanding fact that previous night rest have be broken one be once more astir by sunrise taking towel soap with to little rocky pool in stream where be wont to indulge in morning tub by eight o'clock be seated at table in tent enjoying breakfast at same time keeping eye upon barque be not however until close upon half past ten dick detected sign of movement on board minerva then with aid of telescope observed that be getting vessel dinghy into water ten minute later saw turnbull climb down ship side throwing over short pair of scull shove off head little craft for beach dick waited only just long enough to make quite sure that man be really coming ashore presently becoming evident at once started for treasure cave knowing way by time perfectly well hour easy walking took to spot where found nicholls simpson on watch few terse sentence sufficed to put men in possession of material fact of situation then hurried down aboard cutter to see flora assure of safety that everything be going well then returning to cave made final arrangement with two men set out on way back toward camp did not go very far however for knew that finding absent turnbull must at once seize opportunity to institute search for cave knew further that since man be undoubtedly possessed of tolerably complete information including probably map of island must sooner later make appearance in neighbourhood therefore selected spot where unseen must command view of ground over fellow must almost inevitably pas sat down to patiently await development at length after leslie have be in ambush for nearly three hour saw turnbull approaching among tree carrying what appeared to be map plan in hand consulted from time to time with frequent pause to stare about a though in search of certain landmark a burly ruffian drew nearer dick took revolver from pocket finally scrutinised to make absolutely certain that be in perfect working order slowly fellow approached muttering curse below breath at unevenness of way unsimilarity of landscape with described in document carried presently went stumbling execrating close past spot where leslie remained concealed latter at once rose to foot followed noiselessly at distance of fifteen pace in fashion two men covered distance of about quarter of mile when turnbull once more paused to consult map at same moment leslie halted levelling revolver at boatswain head said be good turnbull will never find place without help throw up hand over head with quick will fire do hear what say sir well take that then obstinate mule a hint to do a be told in future a leslie spoke pulled trigger of revolver sent bullet through man left arm shattering bone above elbow for with sound of dick voice turnbull have faced about with bitter curse made a though must plunge hand into side pocket of pilot jacket that be wearing a shot struck gave vent to curse ended in sharp howl of anguish a flung uninjured arm above head what blaze be ye doin ' of yelled in impotent fury d know that have broke arm sorry remarked dick nonchalantly must have know distinctly ordered to throw up hand immediately attempted to plunge into pocket to get at revolver if compel to shoot again will shoot to kill so hope that for own sake will make further attempt to do anything foolish now right about face march will tell how to steer be very careful to keep that right hand of yours well above head ai goin ' to bind up wound of mine for then demanded turnbull what right have got to shoot at 'd like to know in good time answered leslie airily now march a told be quick about will be compelled to freshen way for with shot know about good man be therefore not at disposed to put up with nonsense forward with further volley of curse of extraordinary virulence turnbull turned on heel resumed way in direction of treasure cave with dick at heel directing from time to time to port little starboard bit steady a go a case might be few minute of kind of thing sufficed to bring pair close to treasure cave entrance of have be considerably enlarged by nicholls simpson for own convenience be however absent for moment when dick arrived with prisoner latter stared in wonderment at cave chest in front of two men have removed from interior prior to transference to cutter so exclaimed turnbull savagely be what be at be stealin ' treasure very well if make smart for name ai robert turnbull be what d 'ye mean 'd like to know by comin here stealin ' treasure belong to ye eh to whom doe belong pray if not to demanded dick blandly curious to learn what kind of claim ruffian must set up why to of course howled turnbull clenching right fist shaking savagely at leslie keep right hand of yours over head ordered dick sharply again covering with lightning like rapidity be right continued now perhaps will kindly tell how came to be yours why got off former shipmate of mine answered turnbull give to when when died what be name asked dick name reiterated turnbull what do name matter anyhow have forgot at moment nicholls simpson made appearance upon scene much to turnbull amazement turning to leslie said here be prisoner lad have lashing ready be cave empty of everything that intend to take away with very well then march fellow in there bind two foot right hand together securely left arm be broken useless need not therefore trouble about when have done will set broken arm dress wound for keep in cave until give further instruction concerning meanwhile give sufficiency of food water to keep from starving for moment turnbull wounded a be seemed very much disposed to make final struggle for liberty although be strong man simpson must have be more than match for even if have be unwounded presently recognising futility folly of resistance sulkily entered cave submitted to be bound growling cursing horribly while however then leslie assisted by nicholls dressed wound set broken bone of arm lashing firmly with splint hastily cut out of small branch from nearest tree satisfied now that fellow be absolutely secured quite incapable either of escaping of inflicting very serious injury upon three men at length left to own device proceeded to get remainder of treasure aboard cutter snugly stowed away task that accomplished early enough to enable dick to get back to camp ere nightfall arrived there leslie at once set to work to prepare good substantial meal subsequently devoured with much gusto having eaten nothing since breakfast important matter being disposed of immediately turned in desiring to secure few hour sleep ere setting out upon nocturnal trip off to barque when at about hour after midnight again approached minerva observing same precaution a before found steward awaiting arrival with considerable trepidation man again descended into canoe by way of rope over stern again leslie allowed little craft to drive with wind to perfectly safe distance before opening conversation at length however said now think be far enough away to permit of talking freely without being heard seen so go ahead reynolds give news have turnbull failure to return to ship caused uneasiness to others of gang well 'ave 'ave if can understand sir answered man what mean to say be continued by way of explanation chap burton rest of 'em seems bit puzzled that ' e 'ave come off aboard to sleep to night so far a can make out think ' e stayin ' ashore with chummin ' up with in manner of speakin ' tryin ' to get to wind'ard of seems to think that turnbull who think mighty clever chap ai nothin ' of sort 'ave be able to hinvent excuse to get away from that have be goin about with 'im day showin round hisland such like that ' e stayin ' ashore to night 'opin to be able to give slip early in mornin get off by to 'ave look for 'be treasure cave be what think of course ai nothin ' of sort know what 'ave 'appened to 'im sir doubt oh yes answered leslie with laugh know quite well what have happened to be alive will not come off to barque again thank god for ejaculated steward piously well sir resumed what be to be next move answered leslie will depend upon circumstance in other word upon action of turnbull accomplice must doubt be easy enough to recapture barque without further delay if be willing to risk fight be not for two very good reason one of be that own party be so small that can not afford to have of hurt other be that party be also so small that if even single man must happen to be disabled in fight must be exceedingly difficult for remainder of to handle barque therefore must very much rather spend few more day over business recapture vessel without fighting than rush matter perhaps get somebody badly hurt by way what sort of men be accomplice of turnbull be of resolute determined sort ay answered steward bet life be sir turnbull took in with 'im just because ' e must 'elp ' e 'ad to 'ave 'elp to take barque naterally ' e chose chap a ' e thought must be most useful to 'im bepecially a ' e did want to 'ave more 'n e must 'elp to go share with 'im now 'ere four burton rest of 'em be big strong feller of 'em of 'em must tackle two of rest of in stand up fight make mincemeat of so reckon that be reason why turnbull chose with four cook on 'be side mate safe in iron locked up in 'be cabin ' e must laugh at rest of do just ezactly a ' e liked see assented leslie what sort of man be mate then must not devise scheme whereby with assistance of rest of must get better of fellow mr marwill responded steward oh ' e right ' e smart enough e be not much of chap to look at bein ' small man not over strong 'be 'ead screwed on right way e ca hin ' because ye see sir keep 'im in iron locked up in 'be own cabin 'cept when e be let out twice day to take sight work up ship reckonin ' then turnbull one of 'be gang be always alongside of 'im nobody else be hever allowed to go anigh whilst at other time when be givin ' meal mean pete burton one of other chap what be in with turnbull be always about to see a e did 'ave talk together so ye see poor man 'ad chance to do anything 'owever much ' e might 'ave be minded poor beggar ejaculated must have have awfully rough time of evidently turnbull pal mean to take chance make recapture of barque without fight somewhat difficult however believe can be done anyhow intend to try now a suppose know fellow pretty well want to tell what think will happen when find that turnbull doe not return to ship steward carefully considered matter for moment at length said well sir if turnbull come off by to morrow night be very likely a will begin to suspect that know somethin ' about then what will do dare four of 'em leave barque with only slushy to take care of 'er because know very well that rest of 'd pretty soon tie up mr slushy have barque back again know too that if four of 'em be to come ashore must slip cable make sail take 'ooker out to sea afore must pull off to 'er wo do what will do expect be if turnbull come off by sunset to morrow s'pose wo eh no well if expect a will wait till time a'ter midnight then two of 'em will quietly drift ashore in one of quarter boat leavin ' other two to take care o ' ship two a go ashore will reckon upon catchin ' of calmly asleep in tent there makin ' tell where turnbull be y e s assented leslie thoughtfully be quite likely that may do such thing a yes doubt will do sooner later if not to morrow night then night after night after again very well if do will be ready for on succeeding night steward may look out for again about time unless meanwhile see reason to alter plan now be for present think so will put aboard again suppose by way men have suspicion that be in communication with other lor bless ye sir answered reynolds cheerfully why must dream a have idee of real state of affair at least not up to now may p'rhaps 'ave suspicion if turnbull come aboard time to morrow at present belief a ' e have bamboozled completely then drink pretty freely night sleep sound a'ter must do if 'ad thought a be up to game so much better remarked leslie what have to do be to leave in same comfortable frame of mind a long a possible now here be good night a leslie paddled thoughtfully ashore again pondered over foregoing conversation with steward after carefully weighing several pro con of situation finally arrived at conclusion that steward surmise a to mutineer line of action must probably prove to be very near approach to truth in case thought in highest degree improbable that must attempt so exceedingly risky operation a of leaving barque in broad daylight when hand must be awake about therefore partook of leisurely breakfast next morning then fearlessly left camp to take care of while sauntered over to cove to see how nicholls simpson be getting on a passed treasure cave looked in just to satisfy that turnbull be still in safe keeping also to examine wound found fellow still bound hard fast in state of sullen fury at helpless condition otherwise be doing fairly well except for fact that wound presented somewhat inflamed angry appearance due doubt to man unhealthy state of body through excessive drinking leslie dressed wound afresh then passed on to cove where found nicholls simpson busily engaged in getting cutter ataunto have already got mainsail bent set flapping gently about in small current of wind eddied round cove idea being to allow to stretch uniformly before exposing to regular strain of work when leslie came upon be busy upon task of bending foresail nicholls reported that must be easily able to complete everything even to getting topmast on end rigging set up before nightfall a for flora have gone off upon ramble leaving note for dick contained instruction a to how might find did without difficulty a whole of treasure be now loaded on board cutter little craft herself be in condition to leave cove at hour notice there remained little nothing to be done prior to recapture of minerva dick therefore felt perfectly free to devote remainder of day to sweetheart about hour before sunset however pair turned up at cove while flora went on board cutter leslie instructed nicholls to accompany back to camp reached just a darkness fell arrived there two men at once made way to great pile of bale case dick have with such tremendous expenditure of labour brought ashore from wrecked mermaid rummaging among found big case of firearm from leslie have provided case be opened brace of good serviceable revolver withdrawn therefrom for nicholls use after two men leisurely partook of evening meal by time that be finished cleared away be close upon eight o'clock a leslie rather anticipated possibility of visit from of mutineer night have fancy for being taken unawares by directed nicholls to lie down sleep until midnight when must relieve being dick purpose that two men must take watch watch through night chapter seventeen recapture of minerva camp being in complete darkness dick took station just inside tent flap with aid of night glass maintained close watch upon barque hitherto there have be something very much in nature of carouse carried on aboard night since arrival revel usually lasting up until nearly midnight on particular night there be difference singing shouting coming to end before four bell ten o'clock circumstance that further confirmed dick in impression that mutineer meditated step of more le decisive character yet when by carefully screened lamp in tent consulted watch found that hour of midnight be already past have entirely failed to detect sign of life movement on board minerva now called nicholls when latter appeared said to if will sit here where have be sitting will be able by using night glass to keep very perfect watch upon barque without being seen moment that detect anything like appearance of boat coming ashore please wake be especially careful not to light pipe where can be seen a be particularly anxious not to scare fellow from coming ashore in present state of mind be afraid that anything might excite within suspicion that be being watched must suffice to scare back to ship again then in turn stretched out be presently sound asleep seemed a though have be asleep scarcely five minute although be really more than hour when nicholls shook by shoulder said mr leslie wake up sir please there be boat of sort coming ashore from barque be be in sight for last quarter of hour be coming along very slowly expect will be quite quarter of hour before reach beach where be demanded leslie seizing night glass oh there be continued a brought instrument to bear see appears to be one of barque quarter boat nicholls so far a can make out there be only two men in be difficult to tell by starlight sir replied nicholls must say there be about number there ca be le for be pulling two oar one man must be likely to attempt job of pulling heavy boat like gig ashore much le pull back again against wind think there be likely to be more than two of 'em otherwise must be pulling only two oar just so agreed leslie now where be seizing oh here be be all right must have where can put hand upon at moment notice be pistol ready in case must need to use be well now remains for to do be to quietly await arrival of gentleman here in darkness of tent will be pretty certain to come here first when do will cover with revolver while lash hand behind take care that lash so securely that there will be possibility of getting adrift again ay ay sir never fear may trust for answered nicholls cheerfully with two men seated well back within deepest shadow of tent quietly awaited approach of nocturnal visitor boat be by time so close to beach that be apparent that men in be pulling with muffled oar presently glided in upon sand so gently that grounded without sound then two figure in silently rose to foot laying in oar with such extreme care that deposition of upon thwart be accomplished with perfect noiselessness stepped gently out of on to yielding sand conferred earnestly together for minute two then turning came cautiously up beach of carrying short length of rope in hand by jove whispered leslie to companion be determined to leave nothing to chance have actually brought along with lashing wherewith to bind nicholls chuckled quietly so have sir whispered will be joke to see way that will be taken aback presently treading carefully using precaution to avoid slightest noise two men slowly made way up beach on to thick grass of little savannah upon tent stood now seemed to think that necessity for such extreme caution be past advanced much more rapidly until arrived within about twenty yard of tent when again paused for moment to confer together now whispered leslie at word companion rose to foot stepped forward into open new arrival did not see at once for head be close together a whispered to other there be perhaps never two more surprised men than be when leslie voice smote upon ear with word move inch be dead men throw up hand if dare to move will fire a may see be covering a leslie spoke two men started guiltily apart then stood staring in stupefaction at two figure have so suddenly appeared before up with hand of reiterated leslie sharply for stranger have apparently be taken too completely by surprise to fully comprehend be said to continued listen carefully to of be prisoner intend to make perfectly sure of know about know to be two men who be engaged in desperate enterprise be likely to stick at nothing now understand well be just a resolute a be if give slightest trouble will put bullet through a surely a stand there so attempt nonsense if value life now indicating one of with levelled revolver move three pace to right so halt will do now nicholls lash that fellow hand firmly behind back well here be pretty go yelled one of to other in access of impotent fury dandy old mess have made of job mister bloomin ' peter burton have dragged into along with yer wish 'd never have nothin ' at to do with cussed business now do knowed be boun ' to go mucker from very fust that bloomin ' skowbank of turnbull must drag into temptin ' with yarn of treasure bein ' a rich a jew lot more rot o ' same sort now here be landed there will do man interrupted leslie sharply a nicholls deftly proceeded to lash fellow hand behind repentance come just little too late to be of use to be mutineer murderer must take consequence of evil deed what do know about growled man who have be addressed a burton who be be blowin ' gaff to if be turnbull be be doin ' split will wring neck for 'im there sir number one be right exclaimed nicholls a stepped away from victim if get adrift will give leave to eat body bone will go ahead with other chap now yes assented leslie truss up let have done with a quickly a possible burton who be immensely powerful fellow poured forth volley of most horrible curse threat a nicholls approached leslie stood dozen pace from with revolver levelled straight at fellow head stern word of caution sufficed to quell fast rising inclination to resistance shone in man eye subsided suddenly to state of sullen silence submitted in turn to be bound whole episode have not occupied more than five minute at outside then with hand firmly secured behind two men be marched off to hut have be built by savage where be compelled to lie down submit to further process of binding upon completion of found absolutely helpless for now hand foot be lashed together so tightly securely that be quite impossible for to move otherwise than to give occasional feeble impotent wriggle accomplished to complete satisfaction leslie nicholls returned to tent resumed alternate vigil until morning for knew not what arrangement men might have made with fellow mutineer deemed wisest not to relax vigilance now until entire adventure have be brought to successful issue remainder of night passed however without further incident at daybreak occupant of tent be once more astir preparing breakfast then having satisfied own appetite took good liberal supply of food to hut loosing prisoner bond sufficiently to allow use of hand bade eat drink freely then when at length burton companion whose name transpired be samuel cunliffe sullenly acknowledged that have eaten drunk that desired hand be once more lashed securely behind foot released be bidden to follow leslie who went ahead while nicholls a rear guard walked close behind thus proceeded until cave be reached where two new arrival be forced to join fellow prisoner turnbull there in gloomy cavern exigency of situation demanded that for time at least must be once more subjected to extreme discomfort of being lashed hand foot together a have be in hut on previous night in order to avoid possibility of getting together releasing other having satisfied that prisoner be absolutely secure dressed turnbull wound afresh leslie accompanied by nicholls next made way to cove where found cutter lying at anchor in centre of little basin with canvas set gently flapping in light breeze marvellously pretty picture little craft presented with snow white hull surmounted by broad expanse of scarcely le white cotton canvas sitting daintily jauntily upon water white of hull sail ruddy sheen of copper sheathing brilliantly reflected upon smooth dark surface of element rode in such saucy fashion dick stood for minute feasting eye upon pretty picture presented against dark brown background of scarred riven rock formed side of basin then nicholls quickly descended precipitous slope to where catamaran lay moored jumping on board paddled off to flora whose namesake fortunately happened to be on board her at moment be just preparing to go ashore for ramble be afraid dear can not go just now said dick unless indeed must like to walk over to camp for be about to return there at once preparatory hope to sailing for home to morrow do think dick must be quite safe for to take walk alone because if so be actually going to sail to morrow must so like to do be lovely walk there be association connected with endear to said shyly very well little girl responded dick then take walk by mean for be perfectly safe only be very careful not to look in at cave on way for have three prisoner stowed away there now although be too firmly secured to be able to hurt may say thing must offend ear flora promised that must most carefully avoid cave be set ashore by catamaran dick instructing nicholls simpson to afterwards proceed round to camp in craft while undertook to work cutter round to same point single handed while therefore two seaman be conveying flora to landing place leslie busied in taking pull upon halliard round getting up cutter anchor be still thus engaged when catamaran pushed off under sail passing close under cutter stern hailed inquiringly way be to steer keep land close aboard on starboard hand way can not go wrong answered leslie adding will be after in few minute will give lead catamaran stood out of cove headed away to eastward on starboard tack few minute later dick followed in cutter within cove breeze came in over overlapping headland be light baffling yet flora gathered way quickly glided along at pace rejoiced be heart when passed outside beyond shelter of head felt full strength of briskly blowing trade wind solitary navigator found that must have hand full when presently came to working for simpson have hoisted big jack yard topsail to give sail good stretching dick have be too preoccupied to notice fact little craft therefore made first essay in open ocean under precisely same canvas that must show to most gentle of breeze whereas trade wind be piping up quite fresh breeze struck with something of suddenness violence of squall with everything creaking twanging to violence of strain little craft heeled to until lee rail be buried water be halfway up deck to tiny skylight with plunge like of mettlesome horse to touch of spur darted forward burying sharp bow deep in heart of first sea came sweeping down upon in moment be thrashing along in wake of catamaran like mad thing leaping plunging with long floaty rush over sharply running sea overran ponderous pacific swell within first five minute became quite clear to leslie that catamaran be nowhere compared with smart handsome little ship for to dick former craft seemed to sag away to leeward like empty cask while cutter walked up to a though other have be at anchor by time that flora have overtaken catamaran two craft have gained sufficient offing to enable to fetch entrance channel on next tack accordingly hove about cutter whisking round with celerity gave leslie a much a must do to trim over head sheet in time to catch turn with a paid off on other tack now flora ran away from catamaran at rate that have reached anchorage be just rounding into wind to bring up when other craft passed through channel entered lagoon little trip round from cove to lagoon have not only given cutter sail nice stretching have also stretched new rigging to extent dick saw must be quite necessary to set up afresh round before started on voyage if did not wish to risk loss of spar however be matter must have to wait have something of even more pressing nature called for immediate attention by time that catamaran have arrived alongside cutter latter anchor be down jib foresail taken in big gaff topsail be next hauled down carefully stowed away finally mainsail be lowered stowed coat put over then dick jumped aboard catamaran suppose have revolver said to nicholls simpson be fully loaded two men replied in affirmative then up with canvas commanded will be off to barque settle business forthwith will explain plan to a go with cutter no longer sailing alongside catamaran once more took rank a fast sailing weatherly craft soon worked out to spot where minerva rode at anchor dick of course by time knew curious craft well handled with such consummate judgment that when at length luffed into wind eye ordered sail to be lowered just handsomely slid up alongside barque came to standstill abreast starboard gangway look out there catch turn with 'ere painter exclaimed simpson tossing rope end to couple of men who peered down from minerva bulwark upon catamaran crew with mingled astonishment dismay at same moment leslie nicholls made spring for barque side ladder shinning up tumbled in on deck to further discomfiture of two men aforesaid leaving simpson to follow promptly did whole thing be done so smartly that only two visible member of barque crew who seemed to be quite slow moving slow thinking men be completely taken by surprise evidently knew not what to make of meanwhile leslie with single glance about ship deserted deck seemed to grasp situation intuitively be two men named royston hampton demanded ay ay sir be sure enough answered one of two with visible appearance of relief for reason best known to unbuckle belt throw down on deck commanded dick quietly drawing brace of revolver somewhat ostentatiously from side pocket what for demanded one of fellow who be mister to come aboard here order come nonsense interrupted leslie sternly will do exactly what order to do at once without hesitation will be worse for understand levelled pistol at head of man thus gently persuaded two men grumblingly did a be told when discarded belt be flung savagely to deck be seen that attached to be formidable sheath knife be right commented nicholls a stepped forward also with brace of revolver in hand with kick swept two belt far along deck beyond reach of owner now come here joker let tie up continued addressing one of men a flung coil of fore topgallant brace off belaying pin will be shot if do exclaimed man addressed with furious oath will be shot if retorted leslie in quiet concentrated tone of voice made man addressed involuntarily shudder be good men continued comrade be prisoner ashore utterly powerless to help game be up be here to regain possession of ship mean to do if of be foolish enough to offer resistance will be badly hurt leslie stern uncompromising manner have effect two men realising utter helplessness sullenly with many curse submitted to be bound operation nicholls performed with much gusto effectiveness left nothing to be desired then leaving simpson to mount guard over grumbling pair dick nicholls went forward to forecastle to call remainder of crew on deck noticing a passed galley door that irish cook be busying inside with pot pan be not difficult to discern that be in state of extreme mental perturbation arriving at forecastle hatch found cover on secured with bar padlock whereupon dick returned to galley putting head inside said dolan see that fore scuttle be locked who have key sure be jack hampton have same sor answered cook with alacrity surprise at leslie unaccountable familiarity with name by same token also have key of main cabin of misther marwill stateroom honour honour added of two men be jack hampton demanded leslie be fellah be triced up so nately to port rail sor answered dolan then go take key out of pocket commanded dick have doubt know be ay ay sor faith do same replied man with ready officiousness bustled out of galley walking aft to spot where hampton be lashed up thrust hand unceremoniously into man trouser pocket withdrew bunch of key secured together upon ropeyarn offered to leslie dick looked at a lay in fellow hand there be four key there see said what be answered dolan be key of forecastle hatch key of main cabin be locked be key of misther marwill cabin be key of iron be on same gentleman hand very good said leslie now come forward with unlock forecastle man obeyed presently in response to dick call four very decent looking young fellow came up on deck stared about in bewilderment at sight of three total stranger on board two of mutineer in bond from forecastle dick proceeded aft still with cook in company compelled latter to unlock first main cabin in reynolds be found confined then mate cabin finally iron on latter wrist mate of minerva who proved to be very smart looking young fellow with keen resolute expression drawn haggard with anxiety stared in amazement at apparition of total stranger in cabin who be evidently acting with authority leslie did not leave much time for wonderment mr marwill said permit to introduce name be leslie have be misfortune to be cast away on island glimpse of have perhaps occasionally caught through cabin port have be on island nearly ten month preparation for leaving be practically complete when vessel entered lagoon naturally came off aboard to make acquaintance of skipper found man turnbull in command knowing fellow so well a must will not be surprised to learn that from what saw quickly guessed there be something very seriously wrong aboard here little judicious investigation soon enabled to arrive at actual fact be now glad to inform that aided by two companion have managed to recover possession of ship for have much pleasure in turning over to will find royston hampton two of mutineer securely lashed to rail on deck doubtless will lose time in clapping in iron other three turnbull burton cunliffe be prisoner ashore at present if be disposed to maroon can of course remain there a island posse ample resource in shape of fruit fish water for sustenance if on other hand prefer to take with will bring off aboard at time may be most convenient to thank mr leslie answered marwill fervently a rose stretched with obvious delight in recovered freedom be sure know how be to express gratitude for service that have done owner of ship be afraid will have to leave to to do when get home can repay in measure by offering companion passage to england do now with greatest of pleasure will do level best to make trip comfortable pleasant for a to turnbull other two that have boxed up ashore of course must take along with hand over to authority upon arrival at capetown because d 'ye see be guilty of murder of poor cap'n hopkins so can bring off will send ashore for whenever like now if have objection will go out on deck for to tell truth be just pining for breath of fresh air poor fellow looked about in amazement when minute later stood on barque poop gazed thence at lovely island rich in verdure of conceivable tint of green glowing here there with patch of vivid scarlet blossom of bois immortelle whole bathed in brilliant sunshine of tropical day be le astonished at sight of handsome little cutter lying at anchor close in with shore for be first time that have ever be on deck since day on island have be made from barque fore yard everything be
