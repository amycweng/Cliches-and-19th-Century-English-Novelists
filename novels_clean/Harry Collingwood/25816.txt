with airship submarine by harry collingwood be second book about strange vessel flying fish can travel on surface of water below that can rise in air to great height travel to great distance be achieved by fact that vessel be made of novel metal aethereum be lighter than air that power be produced by novel source two book place collingwood among very first author to explore science fiction genre make book very important in history of literature other book about vessel log of flying fish have several character in common with one of deed in particular relation with various african chieftain be continuation of same adventure however there be plenty of new episode in book book date from slightly after victorian era though many of episode have strongly victorian flavour make brilliant audiobook great fun to listen to with airship submarine by harry collingwood chapter one lucky meeting be late afternoon on certain grey dismal day toward latter part of february that two men happened to encounter other after long interval upon step of migrant club one tall well built exceedingly handsome man with blond curly hair beard moustache to match be entering building while other much shorter stouter figure with cast of feature rendered german origin unmistakable be standing upon top step puffing at cigar a leisurely drew on glove preparatory to emergence upon street a two men glanced at other light of mutual recognition leaped into eye in moment right hand of be locked in cordial grip of other ach mine vriendt exclaimed shorter of two a beamed up at other through gold rimmed spectacle how be how be ladyship quite well hope thanks professor yes be a hale hearty a can possibly wish be sorry to say that little daughter by way be aware have daughter ach yes heard of zomebody toldt of vorget who va now led gongradulade upon zirgumstance if be nod doo lade thanks very much professor congratulation upon event be never too late especially when be sincere a know yours to be condolence be more appropriate than congratulation just now for be sorry to say that poor child be far from well indeed lady olivia be exceedingly anxious about so much so that have brought up to town to secure opinion of medical specialist upon case advises complete change of air scene for be what brings to migrant to day where by greatest piece of good luck have found very man professor be most anxious to find good exclaimed professor wanted to vind here be quide at service dear sir reginald whad gan do vor very great deal if will answered baronet rather if have nothing particular on hand just now ought to say for feel sure that if be not otherwise engaged may depend upon falling in with scheme now have happily found of gourse replied professor go midoudt zaying well

reginald elphinstone friend sometimes called behind back of course where be going continued anywhere in particular if so will walk little way with if be not bound upon fulfilment of engagement let go up into smoking room have chat there be not boundt anywhere in bardigular smoking room be quide empty so led go there by mean exclaimed professor a linked arm in of companion together strongly contrasted pair wended way through handsome entrance hall of building up spacious marble staircase to cosiest smoking room in london taller more striking looking of two be sir reginald elphinstone baronet immensely wealthy man with magnificent estate in heart of most picturesque part of devonshire lovely wife most charming lovable little daughter now just five year old baronet have barely passed fortieth year be superb specimen of english manhood standing full six foot two in stocking with fine athletic figure blue eye ordinarily beamed with kindliness good humour must upon occasion flash withering scorn scathing anger upon offender curly golden hair with beard moustache to match that made look like viking got up in style of twentieth century english gentleman companion much shorter stouter of figure be professor heinrich von schalckenberg german by birth cosmopolitan by nature by virtue of own restless disposition must never permit to settle down for very long in one place however attractive be perfect marvel in matter of learning most accomplished linguist indefatigable delver in lesser known field of science wherein be credited with having made discovery of vast importance value if such be case be in hurry to make discovery public property chiefly perhaps because a of more intimate friend suggested be of such nature a rendered capable of disastrous misuse in hand of evil disposed especially enemy of society human race anarchist be that a may be undoubtedly fact that have discovered two hitherto unknown substance property of must render of priceless value whenever must see fit to make known one being unoxidisable metal of extraordinary strength tenacity yet of so little weight that be lightest known solid to have given name of aethereum while other be new power derivable from certain chemically prepared crystal treated in one way yielded electricity in enormous volume while powdered treated with certain acid evolved expansive gas of stupendous potency capable of being advantageously used in place of of known explosive of steam be known to few of more intimate friend of professor of sir reginald that former have designed constructed of wonderful metal marvellous ship appropriately named flying fish capable not only of navigating surface of ocean also of diving to extremest depth more wonderful still of soaring to hitherto unapproachable altitude of earth atmosphere be further known that in extraordinary ship constructed for at expense of sir reginald elphinstone baronet professor two other daring spirit have already accomplished two voyage on first of have actually succeeded in penetrating to north pole while on second have visited hitherto unexplored region of great african continent discovering site ruin of ancient ophir of course in case meeting with many astounding adventure such be two men who unexpectedly met on step of migrant club after interchange of greeting made way together to smoking room of rather exclusive institution whither reader be now invited to follow a enter apartment unobserved note with astonishment that be evidently one of largest room in building reason being that migrant be almost to man ardent devotee of goddess nicotina a seemed probable that smoking room must be most used room in building very wisely determined that must also be one of largest peculiarity notice be that with exception of space over massive elaborately carved black marble mantelpiece be occupied by enormous mirror wall be almost entirely covered with picture in oil water colour crayon photography ay even in pencil most of bearing evidence in execution that be production of amateur although here there eye detects work strong enough to suggest hand eye of veteran professional painter although so much of work be amateurish be nevertheless thoroughly good picture being permitted to be hung upon wall until have be subjected to scrutiny received approval of hanging committee of artistic member looking more closely at picture note that with exception of photograph mostly portray scenery of exceptionally grand otherwise remarkable character illustrate singular incident adventure here for example be water colour sketch of rent collapsed balloon falling to earth from height must be appalling if be to accept a faithfully represented neutral tone dwarfed dimension of several feature of

so on round wall picture in fact being more le truthful delineation of specially thrilling adventure experienced by member of club professor baronet having entered smoking room found empty a be quite usual at hour of day selected two of capacious exceedingly inviting looking armchair be scattered about room drawing up to fire for weather be very bleak chilly ensconced therein settled comfortably for chat well dear professor began sir reginald a carefully selected cigar from handsome capacious case that drew from pocket need scarcely ask how be for appear to be in superb condition where have be what doing since parted be five six year ago rather over six year answered professor in strongly german accented english prided upon being undistinguishable from genuine british accent be not necessary to inflict further upon reader rather over six year how time fly when man be busy yet during six year have done scarcely anything must believe beyond writing of five volume treatise on ancient ophir geographical situation story a revealed in light of certain recent discovery undergoing eighteen month imprisonment in fortress of peter paul in saint petersburg a suspected nihilist two year fruitless exploration of central mexico have done absolutely nothing sir reginald laughed heartily upon word professor be insatiable said why writing of five volume treatise by way have read with keenest enjoyment must of have found ample occupation for six year one must have supposed not content with have experienced for eighteen month manifold misery of russian prison have topped off with two year of wandering in mexico with more thrilling adventure hairbreadth escape than can count will warrant still be not satisfied ah friend answered professor be very well for who have lovely wife sweet little daughter to laugh at be bachelor have wife no daughter domestic tie of sort to beguile restless nature render content to settle down in monotonous placidity of home must always be occupied in exciting pursuit must go mad from very weariness ennui since memorable cruise in flying fish have be unable to find anything exciting adventurous enough to suit taste that cruise have spoilt for everything else be sometimes inclined to wish have never participated in oh must not feel like remonstrated sir reginald why dear sir be backbone life soul of cruise without whole thing must have be dreary failure besides want to join in what exclaimed von schalckenberg springing to foot excitedly while broad german visage fairly beamed with delight what cruise in flying fish dear sir of course will join with greatest possible pleasure upon one condition added more soberly after moment reflection be at present engaged a told little while ago upon elaboration of colonisation scheme for relief of who although perfectly willing to work find unable to obtain employment in consequence of present overcrowded condition of conceivable avocation can see way perfectly clearly up to certain point there find brought to standstill for want of mean for must tell that although colony once fairly launched must be self supporting launching of must be terribly expensive operation therefore want money money equivalent a much a can get there be enormous source of wealth accessible to flying fish to alone if therefore will permit to avail of such opportunity to acquire wealth a may present during progress of cruise will join with utmost pleasure if not must remain where be endeavour to hatch out of brain other method of obtaining mean require need for dear fellow exclaimed sir reginald if will consent to become one of party may make use of flying fish exactly a if be own with one reservation only namely that take to cold climate cruise be projected especially with object of restoring daughter health be informed that pure air genial climate be absolutely necessary for keeping in mind have full permission to map out route if please by mean answered professor must be height of presumption on part wish inclination of concerned must be fully considered in decision of so important question of course will be very happy to be allowed to offer suggestion to afford information may happen to posse in relation to such locality a may be proposed to visit by way how many will be who be other member of party have not yet decided answered sir reginald must naturally prefer to have lethbridge mildmay again if can find induce to join indeed be with object of ascertaining whether must learn news of of of called here to day well said german can tell something about for saw colonel only few day ago here in town met in park be looking very ill in reply to inquiry learned that have be down with typhoid fever have only be up out again about week said that be trying to brace up to go away somewhere for change of air so have doubt that will find more than willing to fall in with proposal may make to a for mildmay met man here only yesterday who have seen few day ago at cowes on board yacht understood have retained in commission through winter also understood that be now about to lay up if so will probably find also disengaged letter addressed to at royal yacht squadron club house will doubt find will write to forthwith said sir reginald by way do happen to know lethbridge address no confessed professor apologetically dare say can discover by inquiring of steward here if doe not know will perhaps be able to obtain by inquiring at army navy of be member proved unnecessary however to seek so far for upon inquiry of steward of migrant be ascertained that colonel lethbridge have dropped in at club evening regularly for last four five day might be expected to put in appearance there again on that evening few hour later sir reginald therefore wrote two letter one to colonel left in hall letter rack one to captain mildmay posted setting forth particular of projected cruise together with information that von schalckenberg have consented to make one of party concluding with cordial invitation to individual addressed to join expedition a guest done invited professor to dine with night make acquaintance of little daughter a well a to afford opportunity for full discussion of detail of projected trip on following day journeyed down with wife child to magnificent devonshire home chudleigh park chapter two final preparation chudleigh park be estate of fourteen hundred acre in extent situate a have already be mentioned in most picturesque part of devon have be acquired by sir reginald elphinstone about six year before just prior to marriage area at time consisting chiefly of moorland of so hilly broken character that must scarcely be cultivated profitably although for sir reginald purpose be everything must possibly be desired having secured land site be chosen on sheltered hillside overlooking long stretch of beautiful valley through fine trout stream picturesquely meandered here under superintendence of eminent architect charming mansion fitted with luxury convenience of modern life be erected entire estate being meanwhile laid out to best advantage by skilled landscape gardener who with aid of army of underling eventually so completely changed aspect of locality that became one of most lovely picturesque little bit of landscape to be found within confines of british isle be about month after date of meeting of sir reginald professor recorded in preceding chapter late in afternoon baronet with wife little daughter descended short flight of broad step gave access to chief entrance of stately mansion built in elizabethan style of architecture began to saunter slowly to fro along spacious terrace graced front of building weather happening to be of delightfully mild genial character occasionally in capricious british climate render early spring most charming period of year from frequent glance cast by trio along valley through splendid carriage drive wound way beside brawling stream one might have guessed that be expecting arrival of visitor indeed shortly afterwards two vehicle appeared round shoulder of hill far down valley a rapidly approached resolved into smart dog cart drawn by tandem team of thoroughbred bay driven by upright soldier like figure in tweed travelling suit with groom occupying back seat equally smart game cart loaded with baggage here come exclaimed sir reginald a turning in walk trio first caught sight of rapidly approaching vehicle at least here come one of corrected that one undoubtedly lethbridge there be mistaking that figure for other than of soldier where be mildmay wonder hope hitch have occurred in arrangement sincerely hope not agreed lady olivia lovely brunette with rather tall superbly moulded figure yet looked petite beside husband lofty stature will be supremely sorry if after captain mildmay find unable to join yes assented baronet anticipate anything quite so unfortunate a worst fear point to nothing more serious than certain amount of delay however will soon know for dare say lethbridge will be able to tell something about few minute later dog cart came rattling up gentle slope of winding drive pulled up at foot of broad flight of stone step led up to terrace groom dropped lightly to ground ran nimbly to leader head tall soldierly looking figure divested of rug covered knee alighting from vehicle made way slowly up step at top of host hostess awaited newcomer be cyril lethbridge late colonel in royal engineer now retired from service have be successful gold seeker in time mighty hunter daring explorer in short adventurer in highest least generally accepted form of term have also be one of quartette of adventurous spirit who formed working crew of flying fish in first two extraordinary cruise be therefore old staunch comrade of sir reginald elphinstone equally staunch though more recent friend of lady elphinstone whose acquaintance have first made six year before under startling extraordinary circumstance be man in very prime of life tall with very fair share of good look although certainly not so handsome man a friend baronet upright a dart when in normal state of health singularly robust of frame now a slowly mounted broad yet easy flight of step there be perceptible languor of movement general gauntness of visage figure told unmistakable tale of very recent illness nevertheless eye be bright voice strong cheery a returned greeting of friend on terrace replied to inquiry a to comfort during long journey from town where be mildmay inquired sir reginald at length a party turned to enter house how be that be not with be with von schalckenberg answered colonel when met last night at migrant to make final arrangement for to day came to conclusion for professor to go alone in search of flying fish must entail upon great deal of unnecessary trouble labour although von schalckenberg must not admit therefore mildmay determined to accompany so arranged to meet at waterloo morning to run down to portsmouth by eleven fifteen be fast train know have doubt that be at moment engaged in getting bearing of flying fish in readiness to descend to a soon a darkness have set in sufficiently to conceal movement from too curious eye if staunch old craft be in perfect condition that von schalckenberg anticipates will probably have with by ten o'clock thereabouts ah exclaimed lady olivia be just point about can not help feeling apprehensive do think colonel that will be quite safe to trust to ship have be lying year neglected uncared for at bottom of english channel colonel shrugged shoulder why not demanded with smile possible harm must happen to so far a can see beyond penetration of certain amount of dampness into interior even that professor will not admit insists that opening in vessel hull be so carefully made accurately fitted a to be absolutely impervious to damp much le to more serious influx of moisture a to machinery good man declares that with precaution that took for preservation when went out of commission ought to remain in perfect working order for at least hundred year well will soon know will not remarked lady meanwhile colonel must come have cup of tea before go to room remember weakness for tea see cup will refresh after journey dinner at chudleigh hall night be very quiet unostentatious function for numerous guest be usually to be found beneath hospitable roof have now gone various way lady olivia have of course at once ceased to issue further invitation a soon a projected expedition have be finally determined upon party therefore consisted merely of sir reginald lady olivia colonel when lady olivia rose from table two men merely dallied over wine long enough to smoke cigar then rejoined in drawing room be then about half past nine o'clock time for sir reginald colonel to set out if wished to witness arrival of flying fish baronet be altogether of too courteous hospitable nature to allow expected friend to arrive at destination make way to hall unwelcomed two men therefore after swallowing coffee sallied forth into park strolled off in direction of spot where have be arranged that ship must come to earth be level open glade ten acre in extent completely surrounded hemmed in by noble forest tree at distance of about mile from house be only part of estate have be fully wooded when came into sir reginald hand tree be consequently full grown thus affording perfect concealment for huge marvellous fabric be expected so shortly to make appearance on spot carriage drive led through sir reginald friend took short cut through quaintly arranged old english garden lay at back of house arrived at glade two friend settled comfortably upon rustic seat chatted animatedly upon prospect of forthcoming adventure a waited appearance of flying fish have to wait very long have scarcely be seated twenty minute when sir reginald who have kept gaze fixed steadily skyward exclaimed ah there be at last companion glancing in direction indicated by baronet be just able to see far up a seemed among star dim misty shape even a looked grew rapidly in bulk in distinctness of form a descended from aloft until became enormous cigar shaped structure of such gigantic dimension that seemed doubtful whether there must be space enough in glade to accommodate appearance however be to certain extent delusive due doubt to semi obscurity of starlit night for when at length came to earth lightly a snowflake be seen that there be abundance of room for moment that have fairly settled down sir reginald colonel rose to foot sauntered toward be still several yard from when suddenly two figure emerged from deep obscurity under flying ship bottom carrying small travelling bag one figure short stout be instantly recognisable a of genial professor von schalckenberg while other taller yet of sturdy build easy swinging carriage bespoke athlete sailor be with equal ease identified a captain edward mildmay rn friend shook hand heartily newcomer handed over bag to george baronet valet who at moment mysteriously appeared upon scene a sir reginald inquired well gentleman how have managed in what condition did find old ship after long submersion at bottom of hurd deep oh answered professor managed well enough reached portsmouth at three o'clock found boat ready for man sparshott who have have care of be really good man thoroughly discreet fellow so at once got on board made way very soberly out of portsmouth harbour not putting on speed until be well clear of observation cut rather too fine however in matter of time not arriving at destination until be nearly dark consequently have difficulty in finding bearing at one moment almost feared that must have to defer search until morning at length just a be seriously thinking of giving up for night lucky cast of lead showed to be immediately over ship so at once donned diving dress went down turned on electric light found within dozen fathom of flying fish after everything be easy opened trap door in bottom without slightest difficulty entered chamber expelled water passed into diving room found absolutely dry then divested of diving suit entered engine room forthwith proceeded to charge generator from reserve stock of crystal have left on board everything be looking exactly a left six year ago there be not sign of damp discoverable anywhere only objectionable thing noticeable be that air in hull smelt decidedly stale offensive however soon have vapour enough generated to start dynamo when switched on light in pilot house lantern a warning to mildmay to get out of way after slowly ejected water from water chamber rose very gently to surface then throwing open door of pilot house so letting fresh air into hull went out on deck to look for mildmay immediately fell heavily to deck found completely covered with thick growth of slippery sea grass ach friend reproach did not think of guard against when sank flying fish to bottom for long rest six year ago be only human see after have not yet acquired gift of thinking of everything be trifle however will soon put right to morrow well found trap door in deck despite sea grass opened with little difficulty raised davit into position dropped tackle into boat mildmay have by time brought alongside in few minute have that boat hoisted up stowed away by time there be vapour enough in generator to move engine so created partial vacuum rising in air to height of about thousand foot after wended way hither finding spot without difficulty thanks to light displayed in tower of house here be next three day be devoted to shipping storing away of enormous quantity of store of kind sir reginald have ordered for voyage brought time up to saturday evening being about pm when george chef who be to have charge of kitchen on board reported that last case have be conveyed on board flying fish stowed away there be of course reason why start must not now have be immediately effected a completion of arrangement have brought so very close to sunday lady olivia expressed wish that departure of expedition must be deferred until following monday in order that might have opportunity to attend one more service at quiet little parish church close at hand wish of course have to be expressed to meet ready acquiescence of other member of party accordingly with one consent appeared at church on sunday morning afternoon being devoted to final visit to inspection of flying fish with twofold object of making assurance doubly sure that nothing in least likely to be wanted during forthcoming expedition have be forgotten to afford lady elphinstone opportunity to satisfy before starting that arrangement for comfort convenience be complete flying fish be still lying concealed in spot where have alighted four night before happened that lady olivia having be too fully occupied to visit ship until now be first time that have beheld wonderful craft for fully six year be also only second time save on one memorable never to be forgotten occasion that have ever obtained exterior view of vessel upon first occasion referred to condition have be such a to impress appearance of ship upon ladyship memory only very vaguely be not to be wondered at therefore that upon emerging from forest path into open glade catching for first time full view of vast proportion of structure ladyship must stop short with exclamation of astonishment at what beheld chapter three flying fish towering high in air almost filling glade from end to end with enormous length be object measuring fewer than six hundred foot long of cylindrical shape sixty foot in diameter at so called midship section tapering away fore aft by series of finely curved line to pointed extremity of bow stern bow portion of structure be considerably longer more sharply pointed than after extremity to be attached by very ingeniously devised universal joint in such manner a to render rudder unnecessary huge propeller having four tremendously broad sickle shaped blade palm of be so cunningly shaped hollowed a to gather in concentrate air water a case might be about bos powerfully project thence in direct line with longitudinal axis of ship to give cigar shaped curvilinear hull perfect stability when resting upon ground be fitted with pair of deep broad bilge keel one on side of ship extending fore aft for just third of length bilge keel contained four grip anchor one at extremity of keel by mean of ship must when necessary be firmly secured to ground a now be in fact also formed chamber for reception of water ballast when such be required immediately over midship section of hull extending one hundred fifty foot in direction fore aft from point placed upon back so to speak of hull be superstructure shaped somewhat like above water portion of double ended thames steamboat with deck thirty foot in width at broadest part protected by open railing in place of usual bulwark in exact centre of deck stood two storey pilot house lower storey of permitted ingres egress between promenade deck interior of ship while upper storey completely surrounded by large circular scuttle window afforded unobstructed view round constituted navigating platform from ship be worked whole of enormous fabric with exception of planking of promenade deck be built of wonderful metal called aethereum discovered by professor von schalckenberg being unpainted shone in sunlight like burnished silver there be only one exception to rule appeared to have forbidden use of paint on exterior of wonderful ship be in case of superstructure supporting promenade deck pilot house portion of hull be painted light delicate blue grey tint be relieved by ornamental scroll work of gold colour at end of ship enclosing name flying fish on bow quarter whole connected by massive gold cable moulding running fore aft along sheer strake of portion of ship painting gilding have be done when ship be built nearly seven year ago have then be coated with transparent protective varnish of professor own concoction have proved so absolutely water tight imperishable that although flying fish have lain submerged at bottom of hurd deep for more than six year paint gilding now looked a fresh clean brilliant a though have be newly applied may be a well to mention here that interior deck bulkhead door staircase machinery furniture of kind even to boat gun firearm weapon of description with ship be liberally provided be like hull constructed of aethereum most striking property of metal be extraordinary lightness toughness hardness strength stubborn resistance to tarnishing oxidising influence there be two mode of ingres to interior of ship one a have already be mentioned from deck by way of pilot house other by way of trap door in bottom of ship behind starboard bilge keel latter be used when be desired to enter leave ship when be resting upon solid ground above under water be mean of entrance party used upon present occasion professor to whose genius be due entire design of wonderful ship undertook at sir reginald request to point out to lady elphinstone few of most remarkable characteristic of structure accordingly when ladyship have exhausted wonder at enormous proportion of flying fish herr von schalckenberg conducted hostess forward into space between starboard bilge keel bottom of ship where there be just sufficient room for tall man to stand upright close to inner face of bilge keel at certain point in tunnel like passage professor came to halt remarked now lady olivia kindly favour with attention although can not distinguish there be trap door here giving ingres to interior of ship a be possible that may at time other wish to make use of when none of be at hand to help must like to show how door be to be opened closed now in first place will observe that there be vertical also horizontal joint in plating meeting just here be only junction of kind in passage way so can not possibly mistake now kindly take notice of vertical horizontal row of rivet head especially of particular rivet be common to row there be nothing to distinguish from others be there if will place finger upon thus push firmly to left thus will see what happens a professor spoke section of polished silver like plating of ship bottom folded gently out until outer edge rested upon ground forming kind of sloping gangway by mean of be easy to enter yawning aperture now appeared in ship bottom supposing however continued professor that be leaving ship wish to close trap door behind all that have to do be to push rivet back into original position mechanism operating door at once responds closing flap thus leaving indication whatever of existence now lady olivia let see whether can open flap thus invited lady elphinstone laid finger upon rivet head gave vigorous push to left upon flap folded out a before von schalckenberg taking ladyship hand led with old fashioned gallantry up gangway others following a well a party must discern in obscurity now found standing in apartment ten foot square by seven foot in height with other perceptible mean of egress from than trap door by have entered upon professor stretching forth arm groping for moment about wall room became suddenly illumined by radiance of electric light set in very thick strong glass globe let into ceiling now became apparent that there be door in bulkhead opposite a entered small room said professor be known a chamber of egress because a be quite obvious be from here that one leaf ship for outer world have also purpose besides mere furnishing of access to trap door a will endeavour to explain to ladyship be of course aware that one of object with flying fish be constructed be to enable crew to explore ocean depth to examine if necessary operate upon ocean bed now in order to leave ship walk out upon sea floor aperture of kind in hull be clearly necessary through may pas aperture see before in shape of trap door will readily understand that with ship sunk to bottom water will pour violently through trap if be opened without observance of proper precaution unless special mean be adopted to prevent such catastrophe water will quickly invade fill entire hull hence room use in actual practice be having donned diving suit in diving room pas into small chamber by mean of door of communication see in partition close door carefully behind turn on tap admits small stream of water into room from outside pressure of water being considerable room quickly fill partition with water tight door effectually prevents water from penetrating farther into hull of ship then throw open trap door walk forth on to sea floor upon return close trap door behind thus turn on air tap immediately stream of densely compressed air rush into chamber expelling water through valve in floor when water be out turn off stream of compressed air open valve allows compressed air to pas into habitable portion of ship quickly reducing air pressure in room to what be in other habitable portion of ship then open door pas into diving room professor then threw open door with profound bow stood aside to allow lady elphinstone to pas through room in party presently found be apartment about twenty foot square one side of be wholly occupied by four cupboard labelled respectively sir reginald elphinstone colonel lethbridge captain mildmay von schalckenberg explained professor be room wherein will equip for submarine ramble throwing open door of one of cupboard disclosing certain article neatly arranged upon hook fastened to wall here be suit of clothing armour that will wear upon such occasion oh yes responded lady olivia remember having heard sir reginald speak of diving armour ' what very handsome suit be a touched thoughtfully opened fold of surcoat of scale armour looked a though made of silver seems queer idea to don armour for purpose of walking about at bottom of sea yet what man of foresight must be professor husband have often told ida story of terrible fight with conger eel first time that party ever sallied forth from flying fish appear to have foreseen provided against possible danger exclaimed von schalckenberg laughingly disclaiming such prescience be not nearly a clever a for instance armour be not provided a protection against attack of savage animal fish for quite different purpose indeed exclaimed ladyship for what purpose then be provided for purpose of protecting wearer against enormous pressure of water to must be subjected when moving about on bed of ocean at great depth below surface answered professor must understand continued that water exerts pressure upon everything immersed in deeper water greater be pressure upon immersed body so rapidly doe pressure increase that diver attired in ordinary diving dress be only able to descend to depth of about fifteen fathom ninety foot there be few case where depth have be exceeded be few far between now have always held opinion that to descend into sea to merely such trifling depth a for purpose of scientific investigation be scarcely worth trouble so when sir reginald be good enough to furnish with mean to materialise a be in ship fancy longing have haunted day night for year determined that must not be fault if did not of completely eclipse previous achievement in diving great difficulty have to contend with be enormous water pressure of have spoken must contrive to encase body in garment must receive successfully resist terrible pressure yet be flexible enough to permit of free movement to wearer problem must be solved diving suit be outcome of effort sustain resist to perfection without permitting to be transmitted to body most severe pressure to have ever exposed while at same time afford complete protection in other respect to wearer a when for example be attacked by conger eel lady olivia thanked professor for explanation murmured additional word two of admiration for wonderful armour whereupon von schalckenberg perceiving perhaps that ladyship interest in what be really one of masterpiece of ingenuity be not after particularly keen opened door opposite one by have entered diving room disclosing small vestibule from sprang spiral staircase made of same beautiful white metal be everywhere to be met with on board marvellous ship leading way round past foot of staircase professor halted before door inscribed with word engine room door threw open a before with profound bow motioned lady elphinstone to enter first emotion of who entered important compartment for first time be invariably one of disappointment for room although full of machinery be small disproportionately so appeared compared with bulk of ship power required to drive at enormous speed have be indisputably attained by flying fish emotion be further increased by contemplation of machinery by mean of high speed have be attained main engine consisting of set of three cylinder compound engine constructed throughout of polished aethereum consequently presenting exceedingly handsome appearance suggested rather idea of exquisite large sized model in silver than anything else set occupying very little more space than of one of larger thames river steamer impression of diminutiveness inadequacy of power merged into one of astonishment nearly approaching incredulity when professor casually mentioned that vapour by engine be driven entered high pressure cylinder at astounding pressure of five thousand pound to square inch that although engine made only fifty revolution per minute main shaft to propeller be attached made by mean of speed multiplying gear fewer than one thousand revolution per minute in air of ordinary atmospheric pressure from engine room professor led way up spiral staircase for considerable distance passing landing here there with door in bulkhead giving access a von schalckenberg explained to several deck of vessel arrived at length at top of spiral staircase party found in spacious vestibule extending whole width of ship lighted on side by large circular port vestibule floor be covered with exception of margin about three foot wide round with magnificent carpet margin of floor beyond edge of carpet being occupied by number of beautiful flowering plant shrub in spacious ornamental pot box from centre of vestibule floor sprang grand staircase magnificent example of sculptured aethereum leading to pilot house promenade deck above immediately opposite foot of staircase forming in fact one side of vestibule be bulkhead of aethereum decorated with series of corinthian pilaster surmounted by noble cornice from sprang coved ceiling of apartment panel formed by pilaster be enriched with elegant moulding of scroll work painted in creamy white picked out with gold two of panel be occupied by massive handsomely mounted door of frosted aethereum panel of be decorated with fanciful scroll work of polished metal imparting very rich handsome effect door professor reminded lady olivia gave admission to dining drawing room behind grand staircase be bulkhead similar to one already described having one door only that in centre instead of two a in case of other bulkhead single door gave access to long corridor on side of be to be found stateroom sleeping apartment bathroom domestic office generally of ship lady elphinstone be tolerably familiar with part of ship already a wished to peep into room husband be to occupy now took lead opening door leading into corridor passed through while men turned in other direction entered dining room passing along corridor lady elphinstone presently reached stateroom be desirous to inspect turning handle of door entered room in now found be apartment about twenty foot square lighted at one end by two very large circular port scuttle let into side of ship affording ample illumination during daytime while hour of darkness be provided for by dozen electric light disposed about cabin mounted on handsome aethereum bracket furnished with opal shade shaped tinted to represent flower bulkhead be of frosted aethereum divided up into panel by fluted corinthian pilaster of same metal supporting massive cornice coved ceiling wall panel being enriched with graceful design in polished aethereum surrounding choice painting in water colour while ceiling be

texture to soften exclude light when desired finding everything here to liking ladyship joined rest of party in dining room intimated that inspection of ship be ended whereupon spiral staircase be descended in few minute little group once more found outside ship wending way back to house chapter four maiden in distress a party passed in through principal entrance of stately building laughing chatting animatedly together upon possibility of forthcoming expedition footman came forward announced that young lady who most urgently desired to see professor von schalckenberg have be waiting for fully hour in library to apartment have be conducted professor looked momentarily surprised disconcerted by intelligence quickly recovering excusing to lady olivia hurried away to library to see who unexpected visitor might be entering apartment von schalckenberg at once found confronted with singularly handsome young woman closely veiled quietly richly attired who throwing back veil stretching forth hand in eager joyous greeting exclaimed in russian at last professor at last have found thank god what stammered professor a gazed in astonishment at lovely visitor holding hand in meanwhile can be possible that be dear little friend feodorovna sziszkinski ach yes must be there can be mistaking that charming face forthwith kissed fair visitor on cheek in true continental fashion welcome dear child welcome thousand time to england continued professor beaming benignantly at visitor through spectacle how be father dear friend colonel ah professor must knew answered girl a tear sprang to eye fear worst for be in bitter trouble about be on account have sought father have foreboding that trouble be in store for only few week ago said to child if anything must happen to be plunged into trouble difficulty seek out dear friend von schalckenberg will help if man can ' of course of course answered professor beaming more benevolently still if be possible upon visitor father be old staunch tried friend doe more than justice in feeling that daughter may absolutely rely upon to do gladly utmost in power for of now sit down little feodorovna tell about girl with sigh of relief renewed hope sank into chair that professor placed for began by asking did ever while in saint petersburg elsewhere meet certain count vasilovich professor often dear much more often indeed than at desired answered professor be bad man feodorovna thorough going scoundrel without single redeeming trait have anything to do with trouble ala yes have everything to do with dear friend answered feodorovna be misfortune to meet last winter at ball at imperial palace from moment began persistently to press odious attention upon dear father saw with utmost alarm unfortunate turn affair have taken warned against count not that warning be necessary for seemed so clearly to divine nature character of man at glance that nothing must have induced to afford slightest encouragement for time count contented with following everywhere making violent love to upon possible occasion at length about two month ago finding that attention be so clearly distasteful to that there be prospect whatever of suit being successful began to threaten vague covert threat at first afterwards so outspoken felt must fly from saint petersburg seek safety in concealment spoke to dear father about distressed a be at prospect of being compelled to part with agreed that only hope of safety lay in flight twenty four hour later be a hoped safe in house of friend at boroviezi on day following arrival at refuge one of father servant named petrovich appeared with information on night of flight from saint petersburg domiciliary visit have be paid by police to house father have be dragged off to fortress prison of peter paul that search be everywhere being made for have not least doubt that be work of count vasilovich feeling to be quite safe where be knowing count power influence at palace whole anxiety be on father account for vasilovich be not only unscrupulous be mercilessly vindictive feared that finding baulked in desire to get into power must wreak vengeance on father oh professor fear proved to be too well founded for five day later petrovich appeared again with information that father have be convicted of high treason be even then being hurried away south to odessa at port be to be placed with large number of other unfortunate on board convict ship for transportation to sakhalien oh friend can not describe to depth of despair at intelligence soon learned be only too true in desperation must have returned to saint petersburg sought out count consented to marry upon condition of saving dear father friend denounced scheme a utter madness must not hear of asserted that count having gone to such extreme must not now be at likely to undo own work even if be possible that if be so imprudent a to enter into negotiation with must soon find mean to get into power at mercy while father having be convicted of high treason whole of property must certainly be confiscated what have always regarded a count chief reason for desiring to marry namely command of wealth must inherit from father must no longer exist argument prevailed with abandoned mad idea of appealing to vasilovich be in despair for dear father until in happy moment remembered word that have spoken to about only short time before dreadful misfortune befell then felt that if must find something might yet be done spoke to friend about approved of proposal to seek when mentioned that must be necessary for to come to england in search of difficulty arose count vasilovich have doubt already anticipated provided against possibility might endeavour to leave russia to make attempt openly must too surely result in falling into power friend be very very kind to be determined must escape at length be fortunate enough to find lady who be about to travel from saint petersburg to london who consented to bring with a maid in way difficulty be overcome yesterday arrived safely in london at once went to address that father have given when spoke of possibility of being able to help must trouble come upon have difficulty in finding place being stranger in london when did so be only to learn that have last be heard of a being here so determined to follow at once taking midnight train from london staying in village only long enough to get lunch of stood sadly in need before driving over here thank god have be fortunate enough to find ah thank god indeed dear child echoed professor for assure be only by combination of most trifling circumstance did not leave here yesterday in case further pursuit of must have be equally useless impossible never mind that now be well that end well a say here in england have found be enough for present now tell be absolutely certain of accuracy of petrovich information a to father being en route for sakhalien oh yes answered feodorovna there be unfortunately room for doubt a to that son of one of under gaoler at peter paul happen to be affianced to petrovich sister be through man petrovich obtained information just so assented professor in case added suppose vasilovich must be certain to posse full perfectly accurate information a to whereabouts ultimate destination of father oh yes answered feodorovna must be sure to know everything see how fact be to help because see dear friend have power to compel to reveal what know have not retorted professor good humouredly ah well will see will see meanwhile patience courage little one think can already see way to bringing of business to satisfactory conclusion now come with let introduce to very dear gentle lady friend of mine later to three men friend who will not only listen to story with most sympathetic interest will also unless be vastly mistaken assist to right effectually wrong have be done to father friend colonel sziszkinski so saying professor conducted young russian friend to lady elphinstone boudoir where having craved permission to enter forthwith introduced protegee to hostess briefly recapitulated story of wrong to have so recently listened lady olivia listened with deep sympathy to story at conclusion said of course dear professor there can be question a to what ought to do if really have power to help friend poor girl father in present terrible situation must go to assistance regardless of everything else must manage a best can without will heartily wish most complete success in arduous undertaking will miss dreadfully absence will be terrible disappointment to ah dear lady will completely spoil if talk like protested professor continued a to leaving contemplate such step indeed be only by remaining with by virtue of assistance of good husband others hope to be of real assistance to friend idea be if consent will in first place go to saint petersburg in flying fish seize count vasilovich know chateau well already have plan whereby can obtain possession of person without one being wiser compel to disclose everything that know respecting colonel then armed with information can easily follow overtake convict ship rescue friend from gaoler give vasilovich in place voila tout seems simple enough so far a limited understanding of such matter will permit to judge have not least doubt that when have laid fact before sir reginald other member of party will one help to utmost extent of ability answered lady olivia meanwhile dear child continued turning to feodorovna since seem to be about to attempt rescue of unhappy father must do favour to become guest on board flying fish during progress of adventure will naturally be anxious to know what be happening can only posse that knowledge by becoming one of party did bring baggage with from london brought small portmanteau so might be prepared for emergency left at village inn answered feodorovna hesitatingly very well said lady olivia then have better send for at once fly brought over be still waiting see so can give driver note to collins landlord informing that be staying here asking to send over baggage forthwith gratefully accepting lady elphinstone invitation young russian lost time in penning suggested note to landlord then a first dinner bell have already rung trio separated to dress maid conducting new guest to room assisting to prepare a far a be possible for impending function when about twenty minute later party re united in drawing room feodorovna introduced to sir reginald colonel lethbridge captain mildmay by lady elphinstone who have made point of being down early to receive created little sensation by refined delicate loveliness perfect yet unaffected manner when be given to understand by lady elphinstone that unexpected guest have tale to unfold must enlist deepest sympathy be impatience to get through ordeal of dinner so that might be free to listen undisturbed to story sir reginald of course took young stranger in to dinner soon contrived by polished courtesy gentle kindliness of manner to win entire confidence gentleman night sat over wine only long enough to enable to smoke single cigarette then hastened to drawing room where listened with breathless interest to story a told by von schalckenberg of colonel sziszkinski wrong when history have come to end be unanimous in conviction that there be one thing to be done namely to carry out professor scheme without moment unnecessary delay especially a von schalckenberg in reply to delicately veiled question by lethbridge declared ready to stake life upon colonel sziszkinski absolute loyalty fidelity to tsar of course continued professor loyalty fidelity be not allowed to count in russia while justice find few worshipper at least among nobility there exists unwritten law among russian noble a class be to stand by other through thick thin under circumstance condition quite irrespective of consideration a to what may be right just hence stubborn tenacity with nihilism maintains grip upon middle lower class if little father ' wish to stamp out terrible scourge of secret deadly conspiracy be bane menace of existence must purge russian noble of present lust of cruelty oppression must render possible for one of subject from highest to lowest to obtain absolute justice when have accomplished herculean task may go where will unarmed unguarded unhurt not until then meanwhile remarked sir reginald until consummation of much to be desired reform wrong must either remain unrighted be righted by only process appears to be possible in holy russia ' namely resort to physical force so dear young lady continued laughingly addressing to feodorovna three respectable responsible englishman to say nothing of amiable friend professor there be about to become abductor pirate on behalf of father since there seems to be help for let very trivial circumstance distress in least mean to deliver father when make up mind to do thing generally do now professor a to detail if understand scheme aright first step must be to kidnap very estimable friend count vasilovich ach call friend be friend of mine exclaimed professor with such indignant energy a to provoke whole party to hearty laughter at worthy man first stared at in amazement then perceiving that have allowed to be drawn joined heartily in laugh against yes continued suddenly becoming grave again must kidnap count for two reason first because be necessary that must obtain fullest most complete information a to colonel sziszkinski whereabouts movement secondly because must not satisfy merely to release friend have be beggared rendered outlaw in own country to will be impossible for ever to return career destroyed by unscrupulous scoundrel vasilovich justice cry aloud for punishment of such wickedness therefore vasilovich must be punished moreover mysterious fate have in store for may possibly exercise salutary influence upon such of fellow scoundrel a happen to be aware of wrong that have wrought upon poor sziszkinski for will make part of business to leave behind statement to effect count vasilovich have be removed ' a punishment for conduct to colonel sziszkinski be all right statement may do good while can not see that be likely to do harm so will prepare conspicuous placard worded to effect will place where be certain that will be found remarked sir reginald cheerfully there be one point however upon must like little enlightenment professor be a to course propose to pursue in order to obtain possession of vasilovich person in awe inspiringly secret fashion anticipate much difficulty a to answered professor when be in saint petersburg year ago vasilovich held post of responsibility at war office be habit to ride into saint petersburg from chateau at pargolovo in morning out again at night arriving home about seven o'clock in time for dinner at eight imagine will find that doe so still chateau stand in park of considerable extent be approached by drive nearly mile half long up vasilovich usually ride at foot pace now at time of year will be quite dark in park at seven o'clock nobody will then be likely to be out about demesne know place well happen to be aware of spot about midway between chateau lodge gate where flying fish can be effectually concealed for moment close to road near will be easy for to secure man convey on board flying ship where will simply put in iron lock up in tank room will be perfectly safe there without power to do slightest harm having got how do purpose to make speak professor demanded mildmay will simply tell what information be that require of if evinces disinclination to speak will add that will be kept without food drink until communicates placidly answered professor supposing that must tell pack of lie suggested lethbridge oh will not do think replied von schalckenberg be cruel unscrupulous absolutely selfish man if have read character aright will also find that be far too much of coward to attempt to deceive what if must persisted colonel in case a soon a make discovery that have deceived will tell that will be kept without food drink until colonel sziszkinski have be found be actually in hand answered professor triumphantly appears to remarked mildmay reflectively that unless count vasilovich keep weather eye lifting there be rather rough time ahead of there be in case observed von schalckenberg will be part of plan to tell so until have obtained from information that require well said sir reginald having secured man compelled to divulge information require of what will be next step will proceed forthwith to odessa ascertain first of whether convict ship have sailed answered professor if have not will make business to see to take such particular notice of name appearance may be able to identify again at sight if a anticipate have sailed will find out if possible date of sailing name rig tonnage other particular will help to recognise when see if have not sailed will be necessary for to lie in wait for either in black sea wherever else may be deemed suitable spot at to effect capture while if have sailed will simply go in pursuit of chapter five beginning of strange voyage just so remarked sir reginald here continued seems to that reach most important point in whole adventure convict ship will of course carry small detachment of troop a guard over convict do think that four be sufficient to capture ship carrying crew of say thirty forty men with probably like number of soldier professor seemed to be rather taken aback at question have not occurred to that there will be difficulty in matter answered what do military friend say well responded colonel task propose to set seems to be at first sight rather tall order remember have thus far have experience of capability of flying fish a fighting ship to tell truth have almost forgotten detail of armament how be worked have not answered mildmay be fitted with torpedo port for'ard for firing what professor called torpedo shell two inch breech loading rifled gun fired through port in dining saloon six maxim gun fired from upper deck to say nothing of small arm such armament be ample for occasion be at likely to arise if professor will only furnish with particular of have spoken a to sailing so on of ship will undertake to find capture presume be fully aware that such capture will be act of piracy y e e replied sir reginald hesitatingly thus far have be influenced by conviction that end justifies mean still if mildmay lethbridge have qualm of conscience nary qualm a cousin yankee must say answered mildmay cheerfully only remember must take whole onus responsibility of act upon own shoulder must show colour unless feel disposed to sport jolly roger ' for occasion only what particularly mean be that must take care not to betray nationality so involve great britain in difficulty with russia so long a contingency be avoided will be ready to become pirate of a deep dye a please will take precaution may deem necessary in respect answered sir reginald in fact thought be quite understood by such precaution must be taken must have especially mentioned matter now professor a to disposal of vasilovich when have caught idea believe be to hand over to authority aboard convict ship in place of colonel sziszkinski will authority accept think yes said professor believe will so long a be able to account satisfactorily at sakhalien for full number of convict placed in charge think will care whether one of declares to be count vasilovich not will simply assign to number colonel sziszkinski now bear will end matter if not must maroon fellow upon spot from will be practically impossible for to escape a be altogether too wicked man to be permitted opportunity to perpetrate further wrong oh will find mean of satisfactorily disposing of fellow never fear rejoined sir reginald now plan of campaign being complete when do start to night be for to say answered professor so far a capture of vasilovich be concerned if arrive within sight of chateau by in time to berth flying fish in park with last of daylight will be quite early enough if weather happens to remain calm a be at present can accomplish run from here to saint petersburg in eight hour while with moderately fresh breeze against can do distance in about nine half hour must not forget that saint petersburg time be two hour five minute fast on greenwich time must make disposition accordingly taking everything into consideration be of opinion that if leave here to morrow morning about seven o'clock will be early enough there be however one other point to consider presume will desire to attract a little attention a possible in event must suggest that start from here must be made say about two hour before daylight to morrow morning will afford time to make long circular sweep in north easterly direction clearing british isle before dawn after that will almost certainly meet with weather will enable to conceal movement by remaining day above lower cloud level mode of procedure will posse further recommendation of being advantageous to daughter health by keeping in dry pure bracing atmosphere such arrangement must mean that must take up quarter on board to night remarked sir reginald how must suit convenience dear inquired of lady olivia quite well answered ladyship everything ida will require be already on board so far a be concerned make difference whether go on board immediately time to morrow only if must decide to accept professor von schalckenberg suggestion must like to know soon a be nearly ida bedtime if be to start early to morrow morning will send nurse on board at once so be presently arranged whole party making way to ship together there then taking possession of quarter wanted few minute of four o'clock next morning when professor von schalckenberg rose from couch wrapping in gorgeous dressing gown made way quietly to one of luxurious bathroom with flying fish be fitted where took matutinal cold tub returning quarter of hour later to cabin fresh vigorous to find that according to order george chief steward have already brought cup of coffee for delectation while dressing punctually at quarter to five professor might have be seen making way on slippered foot into pilot house arrived there turned on electric light of moderate power with assistance of illumination thus furnished peered about a satisfied that everything be in perfect order then laid hand upon crank of large wheel within reach gave wheel three four turn directing gaze meanwhile upon two large dial be attached side by side to wall of pilot house of dial be provided with index hand of began to move almost simultaneously with first movement of large wheel by professor one of dial be simply very sensitive accurate pressure gauge other be instrument for registering weight of ship pressure with bore upon ground index hand of dial be travelling backwards towards zero along respective graduated arc simultaneously with registration by pressure gauge of pressure of six pound indicated air pressure in air chamber of ship other dial registered zero thus indicating that partial exhaustion of air in air chamber have rendered ship so buoyant that be now deprived of weight be upon point of floating upward balloon like in air moment incredible be happening ship have become converted into gigantic metallic balloon professor extinguishing electric light illuminated interior of pilot house peered out through one of circular port in wall of structure to see by starlight that flying fish have already left earth in still air be rising in perfectly horizontal position past top of tree in park good muttered lonely scientist to everything work just a sweetly a did that night six year ago when backed out of building shed on bank of thames started upon first memorable journey reversed great wheel controlling valve admitted vapour drove air out of air chamber of great ship thus creating vacuum there by subsequent almost instant condensation of vapour softly made way out on deck where walking to rail looked forth upon landscape be dimly widening out beneath a flying fish continued to float gently upward be beautifully fine clear starlit night without faintest suspicion of cloud anywhere in soft velvety blue black dome of sky presently when professor eye have grown accustomed to dim mysterious radiance of twinkling constellation be able to see landscape steadily unfolding around like map in rapidly widening circle a great ship steadily attained ever increasing altitude in breathless atmosphere for ten minute scientist remained thoughtfully leaning upon rail watching noble expanse of park beneath dwindle into mere dark insignificant blot upon face of country dotted here there with feebly twinkling light until sleeping water of channel came into view to southward then returned to pilot house turned on electric light once more glanced at barometer registered height of nearly six thousand foot above sea level seemed to satisfy professor for opened valve admitted air into hull leaving open until mercury ceased to fall in tube then drew from pocket paper have obtained from mildmay few hour before carefully studied for few moment instruction written thereon refolding paper began to manipulate certain of lever valve by be surrounded a did so gentle scarcely perceptible thrill stirred gigantic structure bore humming sound low at first rapidly increasing in intensity arose came floating in through pilot house window of professor thereupon closed seizing tiller lone watcher thrust gently over fixing gaze meanwhile upon illuminated compass card of binnacle presently certain point on compass card floated round opposite lubber mark whereupon professor pulled toward small lever upon have laid hand two slender steel arm forthwith slid in through slit in side of compass bowl one on side of slender needle projected up through edge of compass card ingenious piece of mechanism at once caused ship to become self steering then professor gave three four turn to wheel controlled valve admitting vapour to engine throwing valve wide open whereupon humming sound suddenly rose to loud rather high pleasing note a huge propeller whirled round at full speed of one thousand revolution per minute at same moment professor noted exact time by clock formed portion of complicated furniture of pilot house then seating in comfortable deck chair proceeded to make certain calculation upon leaf of notebook drew from pocket at expiration of period of twenty minute professor threw self steering apparatus out of gear for moment altered course trifle to eastward threw self steering apparatus into gear again waited twenty minute when same process be repeated second time so on slight alteration of ship course being effected at interval of twenty minute professor be causing ship to make long circular sweep of have spoken to sir reginald few hour earlier at length a lonely scientist sat there in pilot house plunged in deep thought mechanically performing simple operation necessary to enable to alter course of ship from time to time mirror like disc of scuttle in wall of pilot house gradually underwent subtle change of colour from deepest black through infinite variety of shade of grey to pure rich blue in turn merged into delicate primrose hue while incandescent lamp in dome like roof of structure a gradually lost radiance until became mere white hot thread in growing flood of cold morning light meanwhile moment arrived for further alteration in course of ship a professor rose to foot to effect realised that not only have day broken also sun be about to rise for long spoke like shaft of clear white light be radiating upward into blue from point broad on starboard bow a realised reached forward turned button glowing film of electric lamp overhead dulled into blackness disappeared then stepping to one of scuttle professor looked out through thick disc of plate glass beheld sight of beauty be given only to adventurous few to look upon sea of dense opaque fleecy cloud white a driven snow in high light with irregular surface sixteen hundred foot below broken up into thousand tender delicate pearly shadow that came went momentarily changed tint a flying fish swept over at speed of one hundred twenty mile hour have have exclaimed professor a gazed forth upon wondrous sight good expected a much now be safe from observation so long a cloud bank intervenes between earth when pass away must what be thinking about sun be about to rise must call ladyship little friend feodorovna will be far too splendid sight for to lose so saying worthy man turned hurried down staircase toward what may be termed main principal deck of ship a descended became aware of sound of gay voice male female when reached vestibule found one of door of dining saloon wide open be from apartment that voice proceeded entering found entire party with exception of little ida nurse seated at table warmly attired partaking of coffee hillo professor good morning shouted sir reginald a eye fell upon newcomer be just in nick of time george cup of coffee for herr von schalckenberg so have made start professor must have done very gently for none of be awakened by movement of ship where be now if be a calm now a be when started ought to be over mouth of humber just leaving shore of england behind answered professor can not tell for certain continued because a may have noticed there be dense sea of cloud below through can see nothing object in leaving pilot house be to call lady elphinstone young friend feodorovna to come up see sun rise over cloud must come up at once will be too late where be to go professor out on deck asked lady elphinstone certainly not dear lady answered professor earnestly must witness phenomenon through closed window of pilot house if be to go out on deck must be swept away in moment by hurricane force of wind created by ship a rush through atmosphere if perchance be fortunate enough to escape being blown overboard must be made seriously ill by sudden change from dense air be now breathing to highly rarefied air outside for same reason be also necessary that while ship be in flight port door communicating with exterior atmosphere must be kept tightly closed come sun be rising said a flash of golden light darted in through scuttle must not miss sight with one accord whole party rose followed professor a eagerly led way up double flight of step into upper storey of pilot house in moment two lady be advantageously placed at two contiguous scuttle whence must obtain best possible view of phenomenon while men grouped elsewhere be magnificent spectacle upon party looked out beneath a far a eye must reach on hand stretched vast unbroken sea of cloud heaped together in gigantic mass of most extraordinary shape a though giant hand have strewn boundless plain with great carelessly heaped pile of light soft fleecy snow white cotton wool over eastern edge of sun be just rising into view while brilliant lance like beam darted played over through pile of vapour in glory of prismatic colour beggared description beauty glory of scene consisted indeed solely in shimmering shifting play of conceivable shade tone of richest purest most brilliant colour most charming effect lasted only brief minute two when colour gradually became lost in pervading white of dazzling purity be lovely professor most beautiful sight have ever beheld exclaimed lady elphinstone a presently turned away from ice cold glass of scuttle what did think of dear to feodorovna can only say with dear lady elphinstone that be most beautiful sight have ever beheld answered feodorovna be a wonderful too a be beautiful even greater wonder to be undoubted fact that huge ship suppose must call be actually floating in air at greater altitude than cloud although know to be case from evidence of own sens imagination be scarcely powerful enough to realise circumstance a sober fact be lost in wonder too at magnificence of everything around ship be literally palace everything be so solid substantial that although know to be hundred perhaps thousand of foot above earth have not particle of fear fear exclaimed professor with laugh must not be colonel sziszkinski daughter if be afraid in very truth there be nothing to be afraid of here ship be a safe a ship that ever rode sea for precisely same reason in case of ocean ship will float upon sea so long a water be excluded from hull in same way ship will float in air so long a air be excluded from vacuum chamber same natural law applies in case chapter six chateau vasilovich how long do think have be flying over sea of cloud professor demanded mildmay a party turned to leave pilot house be ashamed to say can not reply to question answered professor fact be continued have be so busily thinking about adventure of to night endeavouring to arrange for possible contingency failed to notice when first encountered cloud why do ask well heard tell sir reginald when came down into dining saloon little while ago according to reckoning ought to be somewhere off mouth of humber now think must be good plan for to dip below cloud bank for minute two just to verify position certainly will do so if wish answered professor with utmost readiness therewith manipulated lever valve turned to lady who be now in act of descending pilot house staircase if care to wait minute two lady said will have opportunity to go out on deck take look round while captain here be making observation have stopped engine so that there will be no danger of being blown overboard be now sinking rapidly so that presently will be low enough to enable to breathe without difficulty even a von schalckenberg spoke became evident that flying fish be descending for now plunged suddenly into very heart of sea of cloud where be in moment enveloped in dense mist through nothing must be seen not even two end of promenade deck for nearly minute airship remained wrapped in fleecy whiteness of cloud stratum then emerged a suddenly a have plunged into at same moment professor manipulated valve intently watching barometer tube meanwhile presently became apparent that descending movement have ceased that flying fish be hanging suspended in mid air about thousand foot below vast cloud veil now obscured heaven now remarked a joined party who be standing at foot of pilot house staircase may venture outside be only three thousand foot above sea level ship be almost motionless permit so saying professor threw open door giving egress to deck whole party passed outside into raw nipping morning air with one consent whole party made straight for rail looked downward past bulging side of ship until gaze rested upon grey sea below sight of proved that professor calculation must not be very far wrong first glance at far spreading sheet of water at be gazing sufficed to show thus far calm of preceding night still continued unbroken for surface be a smooth lustrous a of plate glass save where here there steamer two dwindled to dimension of toy ploughed up ripple on bow swept away astern diverging a went until gradually faded be lost mile away in addition to steamer there be perhaps dozen sailing craft collier fishing smack mostly in sight wrinkling canvas of a rolled gently upon invisible swell with bow pointing round compass afforded further confirmation if such be needed of absolute stillness of atmosphere meanwhile mildmay after single glance over side walked aft to extremity of promenade deck whence levelled pair of powerful binoculars into misty distance for minute two then apparently satisfied closed glass walked forward to where von schalckenberg be chatting to others directing attention to such object a happened to be in sight a mildmay approached professor turned to said well captain have succeeded in identifying position thanks yes answered air be not very clear morning have just managed to make out spurn point mouth of humber in far distance astern have doubt therefore reckoning be absolutely correct be just in single matter of keeping dead reckoning ' that ocean ship have advantage of craft in ocean current flow in fairly well defined course at moderate pretty well known rate be therefore easy matter to make proper allowance for up aloft here speed direction of air current be so uncertain that be impossible to take into one calculation hence becomes necessary to check one reckoning by mean of frequent observation do think that of people in ship down there will see asked feodorovna can see very plainly be only reasonable therefore to suppose that can see equally plainly yet when looked at just now through sir reginald telescope must not detect indication that be seen one must suppose that sight of such enormous object a floating in air must occasion tremendous excitement among beholder doubt must indeed have have proof that such be case whenever happen to be seen replied professor have also have best of reason for believing that polished hull of ours perfectly reflecting a doe hue tint of surrounding atmosphere render difficult if not impossible to distinguish ship when be afloat among cloud nevertheless have reminded that keen eyed individual may by chance discover presence so a be really anxious not to attract attention may a well get above cloud again when have looked fill hint proved sufficient five minute later flying fish be once more above cloud with pilot house door scuttle closed sweeping to northward eastward at full speed at length well on in afternoon professor announced that according to reckoning have reached destination engine be stopped have remained cloudy day after one brief descent early in morning nothing have be seen mildmay after studying cloud attentively be of opinion that breeze have sprung up have be blowing for two three hour circumstance that if opinion proved correct must have important influence upon position be anxious to ascertain how far surmise be verified by fact descent be therefore effected until ship be once more below cloud curtain when be found that instead of being immediately over city of saint petersburg a must have be according to professor reckoning flying fish be floating almost exactly over town of considerable size situate on northern shore of lake of somewhat triangular shape measuring forty five mile long by about twenty mile wide town professor who knew part of russia well at once identified a novgorod nearly hundred mile south of saint petersburg captain mildmay suspicion be thus confirmed set of observation be at once taken revealed fact that flying fish be drifting southward with wind at brisk pace of close upon thirty mile hour however be matter of great consequence since traveller have plenty of time in hand direction speed of wind having be ascertained due allowance be made for engine be once more sent ahead course be altered in trifle over hour flying fish be within sight of tower spire of russian capital engine be then slowed down again until ship be just stemming fresh breeze be now blowing ascent be made until cloud canopy have be once more placed between ship earth thus preventing possibility of premature discovery altitude be maintained until sun have set magnificently beneath cloud horizon when four men entered pilot house professor taking charge a pilot descent to pargolovo be very leisurely commenced chateau of count vasilovich be situate on western side of lake on northern slope of hill stretch away in direction of konnaia at point a nearly a possible eight mile from northern bank of neva a soon a flying fish emerged from stratum of cloud shrouded landscape professor went out on deck with binoculars to look for spot at have decided that great ship be to be brought to earth soon found shouted instruction to mildmay who be tending helm engine twenty minute later descent be quietly safely accomplished flying fish finding very easy berth among tree within hundred yard of road leading from park entrance to chateau within mile of latter be by time quarter to seven russian time professor therefore mildmay who have volunteered to accompany quickly made way down spiral staircase to trap door in bottom of ship let out carefully closing trap behind night be overcast dark inclined to be cold bleak blusterous northerly breeze be blowing off lake roaring through branch of leafless tree look of sky threatened rain yet wide white carriage drive loomed up ghostly through darkness presently when eye of watcher grew accustomed to gloom found that must be easy for to discern mounted figure on road at distance of hundred yard so sheltered under lee of giant elm set patiently to await in silence approach of unsuspecting prey minute sped slowly away until at length seemed to two watcher that must have be in ambush for full hour yet vasilovich other person have put in appearance began to compare note in low voice at length mildmay determined to run risk of striking match for moment to ascertain time did von schalckenberg assisting to observe such precaution a must insure tiny momentary flame against being seen mildmay watch declared hour to be quarter to six british time why make about ten minute to eight russian time murmured captain a blew out vesta do think have be detained professor be possible that be no longer residing here may be away on visit somewhere know true may be believe be be not sufficiently sociable man to render at likely that be visiting either in saint petersburg elsewhere answered professor of course continued man may have be detained a suggest indeed be probably explanation of non appearance may be unwell too unwell to leave chateau be only two alternative explanation can suggest to account for non appearance well what be to be done under circumstance demanded mildmay be use to wait here longer think answered professor think be be not likely to pas here now a have not done so already will go up to castle ascertain whereabouts right returned mildmay will go with be scarcely safe for to go alone fellow may have fear on account beg interrupted von schalckenberg assure will be quite safe for to go alone more safe indeed than be two of to go together because in latter case might assuming that be in castle suspect something while if go alone will suspect nothing very well assented mildmay let be a will will at event accompany to castle stand by outside to lend hand if needful sailor be very masterful men observed professor must have own way suppose be careful that be not seen by anybody a suspicion of russian be easily aroused must then perhaps be very awkward for will go at once yes certainly answered mildmay think have better return to ship for moment acquaint sir reginald with non success thus far what be that propose to do be always well to provide against contingency a far a possible right assented professor let go at once be chilled to bone with so long waiting quarter of hour sufficed pair to return to ship explain state of affair to rest of party make way back to spot at have be so patiently maintaining watch half hour of steady walking took within sight of chateau where mildmay snugly ensconced behind big clump of laurel through bough of be able to maintain close watch upon main entrance of building chateau did not in instance belie designation being in fact massive gloomy looking castellated stone building with battlement turret small window moat drawbridge portcullis lower portion of showed in head of archway gave access to interior of building drawbridge be lowered from coign of vantage mildmay saw professor boldly cross walk up to gate through after brief parley with gate keeper disappeared von schalckenberg inquiry be of very prosaic commonplace nature simply asked whether count vasilovich happened to be at home upon being informed somewhat to surprise that be scribbled word two in russian upon one of card directed gate keeper to send up to count at once gate keeper very civilly invited professor into lodge small room formed in thickness of castle wall ringing bell sent in card by servant who appeared three four minute later interval of ten minute now elapsed during professor warmed at gate keeper fire contriving meanwhile by few skilfully put question to extract information that count horse having fallen lame day in street of saint petersburg vasilovich have returned home by rail have reached castle by way of other gate sufficiently accounted for watcher having missed at length servant who have taken in von schalckenberg card returned with information that count must see professor forthwith pair set out across courtyard entering building by way of heavily studded oaken door servant carefully locked barred behind to momentary dismay of visitor who be scarcely prepared to find observance of so much precaution on part of man whom have come to take prisoner however slipped hand into side pocket of heavily furred overcoat then withdrew again with quiet smile of renewed confidence be essentially man of resource faith in quickly reasserted professor conductor led through long stone vaulted passage dimly lighted at interval by oil lamp flared smoked in draught chased other to fro until at very end paused before door at knocked deferentially inarticulate growl answered from other side whereupon servant flung open door motioned von schalckenberg to enter promptly closed portal behind pushing aside heavy curtain portiere stretched across doorway professor found in large lofty room ceiled wainscoted in oak wall hung with oil picture so completely darkened obscured with smoke grime that be impossible to distinguish what be meant to depict stone floor be carpeted with skin long massive oak dining table ran length of room be lighted during day by three heavily curtained window now by solitary lamp at far end of room stood one of enormous porcelain stove be feature of russian interior balanced at other end by immense sideboard table be undraped save at far end where sat with back to glowing stove burly thick set man attired in undress military uniform appeared to be about forty year of age wore hair cropped short face be partially hidden by heavy unkempt beard moustache have evidently just dined for draped extremity of table be littered with remains of repast be smoking immense pipe while tumbler of steaming vodki stood close to hand upon table individual be count vasilovich be alone made movement to rise at von schalckenberg entrance stared intently at visitor twisting card in hand in nervous impatient way chapter seven professor brings in prisoner have met before think herr professor vasilovich at length remarked card say that have important business with what can do for can do great deal for count answered von schalckenberg composedly first of continued have little thing here wish to show be connoisseur in such thing will interest so saying professor slipped hand into pocket produced pistol made apparently of polished silver really of aethereum held by barrel offered to count remarking there count be simple enough weapon to appearance be not kindly examine see if can discover anything remarkable about sudden look of terrified anxiety leapt into vasilovich eye a professor produced handsome little weapon placid manner of latter a tendered pistol for examination seemed to reassure grasping butt looked at intently be pistol invention of yours wish russian government to adopt demanded a turned weapon about in hand eyeing curiously be a may be answered von schalckenberg at present knowing to be perhaps a good judge a man in russia of such tool merely wish to obtain unbiassed opinion of merit merit demanded vasilovich impatiently what be merit see nothing peculiar about excepting cylinder from barrel project be that magazine be answered professor accommodates twenty cartridge be not most extraordinary thing about can discover method of firing weapon answered vasilovich can not be about to ask a to that be perfectly simple permit remarked professor in easiest most matter of fact tone imaginable so saying took pistol from vasilovich unresisting hand there be still two other peculiarity connected with weapon remarked von schalckenberg namely marvellous rapidity with can be fired fact that be absolutely noiseless when discharged please observe count see two decanter upon table kindly fix eye upon stopper decanter referred to be standing upon table twelve pace distant from von schalckenberg eight foot apart where have be carelessly placed by servant before leaving count to solitary enjoyment of tobacco vodki a professor spoke suddenly raised hand levelled pistol with lightning quickness first at one decanter then at other there be sharp clink clink top of smashed stopper fell upon table simultaneously vasilovich looked astounded stared first at decanter then at von schalckenberg then back again at decanter did break stopper by firing at with pistol at length demanded in tone of mingled apprehension rage certainly answered professor placidly did not see do be rather too quick for will do trick again just watch neck of decanter time stop shouted vasilovich springing from chair in paroxysm of fury how dare scoundrel what do mean by coming here destroying property in insolent way eh reached towards hand bell stood near on table sit down keep hand from bell retorted von schalckenberg sternly levelling pistol quick a light at count head utter sound above whisper move so much a eyelid will riddle worthless brain with bullet little exhibition just now be simply intended to convey to in thoroughly practical manner idea of capability of weapon of mine have fired two shot from there be consequently eighteen left furthermore have weapon of same kind in other pocket fully loaded have therefore thirty eight shot at disposal if please can kill so silently that one will be wiser will do too without moment hesitation if refuse to give information require do understand yes understand answered vasilovich slowly reluctantly a fascinated gaze peered down barrel of pistol with von schalckenberg relentlessly continued to cover what be want want truth a to present whereabouts of colonel sziszkinski know about imprisonment at instigation in fortress of peter paul be there still demanded professor consider before answering continued remember want truth will not trust to statement will verify through other source of information caution to be very careful indeed in what say because if dare to lie to to withhold from smallest scrap of information to deceive in way will simply be pronouncing own death sentence there be need to caution so elaborately retorted count have objection to giving information require give more readily that will not be of slightest use to be friend of sziszkinski presume anxiety to ascertain present whereabouts lead to suppose that may have planned mad scheme to effect rescue if so will perhaps be disappointment to to learn that left odessa afternoon a convict bound to sakhalien on board convict steamer ludwig gadd from ship from official in charge of human power can now deliver have proof of truth of what say demanded von schalckenberg still keeping pistol levelled at count head yes answered vasilovich with ring of triumph in voice received telegram afternoon from odessa informing of departure of ludwig gadd with sziszkinski on board be that telegram still in possession inquired von schalckenberg certainly be answered vasilovich be in breast pocket must like to see yes replied professor must produce if please continued warningly be very careful what be about bear in mind that be covering warn that if detect slightest appearance of haste in movement if produce anything except telegram from pocket will shoot without particle of compunction count keeping wary eye upon von schalckenberg proceeded with much care deliberation to feel in pocket for telegram presently produced in envelope placed upon table before be sure be demanded von schalckenberg quite certain responded vasilovich then have goodness to take out of envelope spread open on table commanded professor without word vasilovich did a be ordered now resumed professor rise from chair turn back to march slowly forward until be against wall march confound exclaimed vasilovich eye gleaming with fury will not give chance rose obedient to von schalckenberg command faced about moved forward to wall professor following until telegram be within reach when stretched out hand took possession of document still watching prisoner out of corner of eye read a follows in russian convict steamer ludwig gadd just sailed for sakhalien with sziszkinski safe on board tchernigov message be dated that same day timed a having be despatched from odessa at four forty thank will do remarked von schalckenberg a thrust paper into pocket now continued want to take walk with in park will pas out through principal entrance of chateau wish to warn again to be extremely careful for assure that life hang by hair if see that there be even possibility of anything going wrong will shoot at once taking chance with servant afterwards so in event of encountering of domestic on way out will instantly order to retire now sir have goodness to lead way a professor spoke laid upon table document setting fact that count vasilovich have be removed a punishment for many crime of have be guilty glitter of deadly hate in vasilovich eye a faced round began to move in obedience to von schalckenberg order warned latter to be on guard professor be not man to be taken unawares in prosecution of such adventure a have now undertaken doubt vasilovich saw for led way so circumspectly a to show plainly that fully appreciated imminent peril of situation fortunately for perhaps one be encountered either in house in courtyard a pair made way toward park whispered reminder from von schalckenberg proved sufficiently effectual to carry safely past gate keeper room once clear of point rest be easy few minute later a pair passed clump of laurel mildmay stepped forward from place of concealment stationed on other side of prisoner remarking cheerfully so have captured man eh professor have trouble with be beginning to feel trifle anxious about thereupon professor proceeded to relate briefly experience at chateau thus beguiling way until curiously assorted trio reached flying fish at vast bulk of vasilovich stared in stupefied amazement captor however afforded scant time for indulgence in surprise conjecture conveying forthwith to tank chamber wherein securely locked taking additional precaution of placing hand foot in fetter attaching thereby to ring bolt thus rendering absolutely impossible for to do slightest mischief having made everything secure hastily changed attire joined rest of party in drawing room preparatory to sitting down to dinner chief topic of conversation at dinner table night have naturally more le direct reference to professor capture of tyrant vasilovich everybody be keenly anxious to learn from von schalckenberg full detail of feat there be nothing for therefore for hero of adventure to describe incident in extenso when relation came to end colonel lethbridge remarked well can say professor be that be exceedingly plucky thing to attempt appear to have carried through with most admirable nerve sangfroid be not afraid that fellow must raise alarm bring retainer about like nest of hornet have done so must have be lost man doubt assented von schalckenberg imperturbably of course have to take risk of doing so succeeded in thoroughly convincing that attempt of kind however successful might be must not help in least because must shoot dead at first indication of such intention long before assistance must possibly arrive a have anticipated regard for own life be sufficient to deter from throwing away for sake of very doubtful posthumous gratification of knowing that have placed mine in jeopardy in word be simply too great coward to risk so much for sake of mere revenge well observed mildmay be a magnificent exhibition of bluff a have ever heard of have be completely successful thus far professor now most difficult part of scheme being accomplished see reason why must not be equally successful in other part in event turning to feodorovna will hope to have pleasure of witnessing reunion with father to morrow oh captain oh sir reginald exclaimed tear starting to eye if can compass will for ever bless pray for springing to foot poor girl retreated precipitately to cabin to conceal emotion next question arises remarked sir reginald discreetly ignoring young lady hurried retreat be at what time ought to start in pursuit of convict ship seemed to address question to professor who shrugged shoulder expressively a replied be for friend mildmay to say will know better than of rest of will be most favourable hour at to overtake thus appealed to mildmay replied oh must say about daylight call half past six to morrow morning will necessitate starting from here at um before can determine must see way wind be at what strength be blowing will have look round on deck after dinner let know accordingly a soon a lady olivia have retired from table mildmay rose from seat went on deck returned in about five minute with information that bitterly keen northerly wind be blowing at strength of about twenty mile hour that remarked be dead fair wind for will enable to progress at rate of one hundred forty mile hour over ground if proceed at full speed will therefore stop moment must work out on paper drew envelope from pocket proceeded to make few rapid calculation upon yes resumed at length a ran over figure second time be right if start at midnight will assuming wind to hold way a be now overtake convict ship about half past six o'clock to morrow morning at point say one hundred sixty five mile south of odessa be practically halfway across black sea time place be suitable think that can do better a be essentially point for sailor to decide other member of party at once fell in with virtual proposal of mildmay be forthwith agreed without further discussion that start must be made at midnight men then rose joined lady in drawing room music room a apartment be indifferently called music room be most noble chamber a to dimension appearance being largest room in ship be situated immediately abaft dining saloon from access to be gained be however much larger apartment than other being like dining saloon full width of ship forty foot in length between fore after bulkhead height being ten foot to lower edge of massive richly moulded cornice from sprang coved panelled ceiling wall be divided up into panel by series of fluted pilaster surmounted by elegantly fancifully moulded capital upon rested above mentioned cornice centrally between pilaster side wall of apartment be pierced with circular port window about eighteen inch in diameter glazed with plate glass of enormous thickness have be specially toughened by process invented by professor to enable to withstand terrific pressure to must be subjected when ship must be submerged to great depth in ocean frame of port consisted of foliated wreath of polished aethereum presenting appearance of burnished silver be exceedingly decorative in effect light rod of aethereum above port carried number of burnished ring from drooped handsome lace curtain must either be looped back allowed to veil window according to fancy of occupant above again be hung number of exquisite

scattered here there about apartment at fore wider end stood close together grand piano chamber organ in superbly modelled aethereum case need scarcely be said of finest quality workmanship obtainable while narrower after end be almost filled by capacious electric stove fireplace with most singularly handsome mantelpiece supported on side by beautifully modelled female figure centre of mantelpiece be occupied by handsome clock having set of silvery chime for quarter deep rich toned gong for hour on side of be number of elegantly shaped vas full of choice hot house flower most striking feature of whole apartment be beautiful coved panelled ceiling with exquisitely moulded interlacing rib choice dainty painting adorned panel magnificent skylight occupied centre skylight may be mentioned be such only in appearance a did not pierce deck derive light from outside be merely fanciful decorative device of professor light emanating from series of electric lamp shaded by coloured glass screen so tinted a to permit by simple manipulation of certain concealed mirror effect of description of light from of unclouded midday sun through gradation of morning afternoon light to of softest dusk of evening even light of full moon apartment presented charmingly cosy comfortable a well a attractive appearance a four men entered electric stove emitting cheerful glow diffusing just right degree of warmth while afternoon effect of brilliant sunlight streamed richly down through magnificent stained glass of skylight in centre of ceiling lady olivia guest young russian girl be sitting together on large divan in close contiguity to handsome music cabinet turning over book sheet of music for feodorovna have consented to sing be now searching hostess stock of music in quest of something with be familiar ach be good exclaimed professor a noted occupation of lady guessed import little feodorovna be about to sing then will have treat for let tell lady olivia that young friend posse voice of angel knowledge how to use properly now what be to be tschaikowski beethoven schubert brahms handel mozart ah here be something will suit voice little one caro mio ben ' by giuseppe giordani quaint delicate old fashioned come will play accompaniment for taking girl hand von schalckenberg who be accomplished a well a enthusiastic musician led to piano at forthwith seated at once proceeded to play with crisp yet delicate touch manifest enjoyment prelude to song then indeed a professor have promised listener have treat for mlle sziszkinski voice be of rare quality rich pure flexible clear a silver bell under perfect control sympathetic peculiarly adapted to render with precisely correct feeling pleading word caro mio ben credimi almen senza di te languisce il cor etcetera tear gathered in fine eye a sang final note of song be almost sob for possessed comparatively rare ability to evolve feeling sentiment of word sang make own thus bringing home to heart of who listened yet laughingly apologised for next moment a turned away from piano upon receiving hearty thanks of little audience for although be true artist be entirely free from morbidity of feeling being in fact perfectly natural light hearted girl gay cheerful disposition be already reasserting now that if might accept assurance of professor new found friend father trouble be nearing end deliverance from persecution be matter of few hour more then professor sang rollicking german student song be followed by lady olivia who sang gounod ave maria accompanied by husband on piano professor on organ then mildmay produced violin so time slipped rapidly on until clock upon mantelpiece struck hour of midnight when good night be said lady retired to respective cabin while four men wended way to pilot house to indulge in final smoke incidentally to raise flying fish into air start upon long flight across russia from north to south chapter eight rescue be matter of few moment to raise flying fish five thousand foot into air start engine head on course for odessa lie practically due south of saint petersburg then there being mountain in way nothing in fact that at height of five thousand foot must possibly interfere with flight little party retired to respective cabin turned in leaving great ship to take care of herself pursue way unwatched mildmay professor undertaking to rise betimes in morning call other two early enough to assist in capture for be what amounted to of convict ship mildmay possessed very useful faculty of being able to awake at prearranged moment in exercise of faculty rose from cot a first faint streak of dawn filtered in through port of berth proceeded forthwith to bathroom growing conscious a went of fact that temperature have become very much milder during last few hour however be only what might be naturally expected since ship have be speeding to southward through night at rate of one hundred twenty mile per hour in addition to such further speed a might have derived from favourable gale have be aiding flight rise of temperature however have not perceptibly communicated to water of bath gallant captain found to be icy cold there be therefore temptation for to linger few brief minute sufficed to complete ablution return to cabin rousing professor a went then dressing with expedition of seaman wended way to pilot house where ten minute later be joined by von schalckenberg who in turn be quickly followed by george bearing on tray two cup of scalding hot coffee small plate of biscuit light of coming day have by time so far increased that occupant of pilot house be enabled to see somewhat of surroundings first discovery made by be that have outrun gale of previous night be now sweeping through atmosphere judging from appearance of few small shred of cloud floated about above must be nearly quite motionless next be that a result of change of weather flying fish be fully one hundred mile from spot where in accordance with calculation of previous night ought at moment to have be according to calculation ought then to have be clear of land well out over black sea whereas land be still beneath ship although so clear be atmosphere gleam of sea must just be detected on extreme verge of southern horizon eighty five mile ahead after be matter of very trifling import must defer capture of ludwig gadd to extent of about hour only mildmay professor agreed be neither here there meanwhile there be just one trifling item of preparation to be attended to having leisurely imbibed morning coffee munched biscuit two stopped engine of flying fish retired from pilot house to attend to treading noiselessly in india rubber soled shoe descended to one of storeroom throwing open door giving access to deck on way there loaded with number of queer looking object constructed of aethereum with wended way to deck arrived here sought out certain spot on deck about midway between pilot house fore end of superstructure quite close to port rail having found at once proceeded to remove three small aethereum disc from deck disclosing three sunk bolt hole so arranged a to form angle of equilateral triangle measuring eighteen inch along side top end of bolt in hole revealed about quarter of inch below level of deck be easily grasped by finger drawn upward by about couple of inch over three bolt base piece be next carefully arranged done nut be put on to bolt end screwed up tight by mean of spanner then upon base piece be rapidly built up component part of what upon completion proved to be maxim gun constructed entirely of aethereum with aethereum shield turret cylindrically shaped in such manner a to protect completely entire person of gunner whole affair being so arranged that gun must be trained in direction by inmate of shield mounting of gun shield placing in position of entire case of cartridge in readiness for firing occupied two men bare quarter of hour at expiration of time returned to pilot house closed door once more sent engine ahead at full speed meanwhile pause have be necessary to enable to execute task in comfort to have enabled to determine fact that atmosphere be practically in state of calm ship having revealed perceptible drift in direction when once have lost way momentum through air after stoppage of engine pair have scarcely settled again comfortably in pilot house when sun rose found sweeping at headlong speed over vast plain intersected by perfect network of stream river dotted here there with town village few of be able to identify by mean of map opened spread out upon table before minute by minute sea gleaming like polished mirror in light of new born day spread ever more broadly before to left of soon indentation of odessa bay with town stretching along southern margin came into view now decided that moment have arrived when remaining male member of party ought to be called professor accordingly retired to perform service presently returned with information that sir reginald colonel lethbridge be already astir taking coffee in dining room few minute later two gentleman made appearance in pilot house with cheery good morning to mildmay professor tell that odessa be in sight remarked sir reginald peering ahead through one of port be that place right ahead on far side of bay with two lake beyond yes answered mildmay be odessa what take to be second lake more distant larger sheet of water be dniester bay estuary of river dniester if will look away there into far distance on right will catch glimpse here there of stream winding through landscape yes of course see quite distinctly returned sir reginald broad sheet of water ahead on port bow take be black sea when do expect to sight convict ship in course of next hour hope to be alongside answered mildmay fortunately for weather be gloriously clear ought therefore to sight at very considerable distance furthermore since know within very few mile precisely where to look for think need not anticipate difficulty in matter of identification once alongside propose to make short work of job even must happen to be in company with other ship for in such event other craft unless indeed must happen to be russian man o ' war will be in least degree likely to interfere with have decided upon plan of operation demanded lethbridge yes answered mildmay propose that a soon a have sighted identified steamer sink to surface of water approach quarry in character of ordinary ship of more le mysterious appearance for by so doing will render own identification more difficult will be necessary that professor must remain here in pilot house to manoeuvre flying fish professor prompted by to do hailing part of business since be only man among who can make thoroughly intelligible in russian language have mounted one of maxim a have doubtless already observed for be improbable that skipper of other craft will concede demand until have convinced of power to enforce will therefore be obliged to request one of two gentleman to take charge of gun while other station in torpedo room for'ard stand by to fire torpedo shell if necessary very well said sir reginald will take maxim lethbridge will doubt attend to torpedo part of business hope added will not be necessary to use one of terrible shell for if be loss of life will be frightful not necessarily said professor mildmay have talked matter over together gallant friend be confident of ability to manoeuvre flying fish so that firing of shell will result in nothing more serious than destruction of convict ship rudder propeller thus completely disabling without imperilling safety very well rather reluctantly assented baronet if can be done well good for pity sake mildmay be very careful what do will responded mildmay be not altogether without hope that may be able to accomplish purpose without necessity to resort to so stringent measure a firing of shell in case promise will only do so after other mean have failed here be clear of land at last must alter course point half to westward to intercept chase be exactly thirty six minute later by clock in pilot house mildmay peering out through one of port hole pointed straight ahead exclaimed there be there can not be mistake about for yonder steamer be exactly where ludwig gadd ought to be there be other craft anywhere in sight other three men forthwith stepped to nearest port must afford view of chase gazed eagerly ahead there immediately over long tapering conical pointed bow of flying fish beheld ten mile distant small faintly denned grey blotch on mirror like surface of sea with trail of black smoke issuing from a though furnace on board have just be freshly stoked will descend take to water at once remarked mildmay condition must not possibly be more favourable for success of plan take that will be glad to get business over a soon a possible suspense brought to end therewith laid hand upon small wheel gave two three turn thus partially opening main air valve admitting thin stream of air into vacuum chamber of flying fish with result that huge craft at once began to settle down toward surface of sea upon few minute later floated buoyantly a soap bubble then main air pump be set to work forcing compressed air into vacuum chamber causing ship to sink very gradually in water while at same time to facilitate operation of sinking water be admitted into certain of ballast chamber in ship bottom until floated at ordinary trim for cruising on surface of sea be to say with whole of immense propeller completely submerged conical pointed bow buried to depth of foot so during operation of submergence engine have be stopped be now sent ahead again at full speed ten minute later singular looking craft ranged up on weather quarter of big black hulled steamer of about three thousand ton register round stern of bore name of ludwig gadd in large yellow painted russian character alone be sufficient to identify beyond question a convict ship of be in search if further evidence have be needed be to be found in pen stout substantially built wooden structure of closely set paling about ten foot high that occupied nearly whole of fore deck except narrow alley way on side of to allow of passage of crew fore aft included great main hatchway cover of have be replaced by stout grating with small aperture in just large enough for man to squeeze through at soldier with loaded rifle stood guard there be not many people visible about convict ship deck for hour be still early business of day have not yet begun although have be british crew must already have be at job of washing deck scouring paint brass work here solitary seaman slouched to fro on topgallant forecastle keeping perfunctory lookout two three others lolled over rail forward staring in stupid open mouthed wonderment at silver shape of flying fish officer of watch paced bridge athwartships with air of great importance pausing for moment time passed compass to glance into bowl murmur word to quicken vigilance of helmsman a flying fish name temporarily masked by tarpaulin carelessly dropped over ranged up on other craft starboard quarter close enough to heave biscuit aboard man paused in strutting march standing at extreme end of bridge gazed with quite visible perturbation at strange apparition seemed to have sprung from nowhere in particular within very few minute presently having meanwhile seemingly made up mind that what beheld be really ship hailed in russian ho ship ahoy port helm sheer off bit will be aboard if be not careful at same time waved hand to own helmsman to starboard helm mildmay be british naval officer man who by training tradition of service have acquired habit of prompt resolution equal promptitude of action in conversion of such resolution into accomplished fact helmsman of ludwig gadd therefore have scarcely begun to revolve steering wheel ere flying fish with speed accurately reduced to of other vessel have sheered still closer while von schalckenberg prompted by companion hailed in russian through one of pilot house port ludwig gadd ahoy be captain on deck no be not bawled back russian officer why must be on deck at unearthly hour of morning if instantly sheer off will give order to men to open fire upon what do want what do mean by sheering up alongside in manner professor rapidly translated communication to mildmay at once again prompted by latter replied be good enough to stop engine at once sir send message to captain that presence be required on bridge have important communication to make to for own sake will do well to say nothing about opening fire upon for a may see for machine gun be already trained to sweep deck while single torpedo must suffice to blow out of water beg to assure that resistance be quite useless be absolutely at mercy will therefore be well advised to yield prompt obedience to request russian stood staring with mingled fury bewilderment for few second then having apparently arrived at conclusion that discretion must perhaps in case prove better part of valour laid hand upon engine room telegraph apparatus tinkling of bell in ship interior be distinctly heard by aboard flying fish presently churning of water about convict ship rudder suddenly ceased showing that engine have be stopped at same moment officer on bridge called sailor to with few brief word undistinguishable to in flying fish pilot house dispatched to interior of vessel be probable that skipper of ludwig gadd have already be awakened by hailing have passed between two craft for in le than five minute emerged from cabin under poop making way forward leisurely ascended to bridge where be at once accosted by officer in charge listened gravely to individual communication glancing with much curiosity meanwhile at strange glittering shape floated quietly close alongside then striding to starboard extremity of narrow structure upon stood hailed in true nautical fashion ship ahoy what ship be be captain of ludwig gadd hailed back professor ignoring previous question ay ay answered skipper waving hand impatiently who be what do want have on board ship certain colonel sziszkinski who be being transported a convict be not so answered professor how do suppose must know yelled back skipper savagely know nothing about convict aboard here if business have to do with of have better see officer who be going out in charge of of course commented mildmay when have be translated to ought to have thought of ask to send for fellow to come up on to bridge be done about quarter of hour later man attired in green military uniform with sword belted to side spur screwed to heel of boot ascended to bridge be promptly engaged in conference by skipper presently latter came to starboard end of bridge accompanied by soldier hailed be captain popovski officer in charge of convict desire to know what be business with tell returned von schalckenberg that have on board prisoner to be exchanged for colonel sziszkinski who have be unjustly condemned russian soldier sailor conferred together for moment then latter hailed have of course proper warrant for exchange answered professor have warrant beyond power to enforce demand yet think must be sufficient since can sink in instant if be foolish enough to prove contumacious be good enough therefore to bring colonel sziszkinski on deck at once send unhurt aboard in exchange for will hand over man who call count vasilovich two russian officer again conferred together for several minute frequently directing glance at flying fish a though searching for confirmatory evidence of power to enforce crew demand at length russian skipper facing about waved hand shouted right be willing to make exchange one prisoner be a good a to so long a can show number contained on list will send colonel to forthwith thereupon faced about gave certain order to subordinate officer who in turn bawled order to boatswain to pipe away one of quarter boat soldier meanwhile descended from bridge went below doubtless to issue own order for release of prisoner minute later russian sailor be seen to go shambling aft aboard convict ship busy upon task of lowering boat presently got afloat took to ludwig gadd gangway at point in proceeding mildmay shouted through speaking tube to lethbridge that torpedo shell must be required must be good enough to bring vasilovich up on deck in readiness to hand fellow over in exchange for colonel lethbridge proved much more prompt in action than people on board convict ship within three minute of receipt by of mildmay communication stood upon deck of flying fish in company of von schalckenberg vasilovich awaiting arrival of boat by mean of exchange of prisoner be to be effected amazement of vasilovich be profound at finding afloat in open sea with convict ship name on bow stern of be easily decipherable by close alongside stared alternately about at steamer that lay gently heaving upon slight swell within biscuit toss of with expression of mingled bewilderment incredulity proved highly diverting to two men between whom stood presently turning to professor gasped why herr professor what doe mean when last night called upon be in own chateau at pargolovo when compelled to enter ship if ship be be stationary on dry land now be afloat upon water of black sea if be to believe eye can not understand doe mean mean count replied von schalckenberg that what deemed impossibility have be accomplished when received that telegram yesterday announcing departure of ludwig gadd from odessa with colonel sziszkinski on board a convict believed that man who have dared to oppose certain nefarious plan of yours have at length be effectually removed from path be at same time undergoing wholesome punishment for temerity instead of be about to change place to go on board ludwig gadd a convict there in island of sakhalien to pay inadequate penalty of countless offence colonel to come here a honoured guest until be able to place daughter finally for ever beyond reach of other tyrant like sziszkinski to change place ejaculated vasilovich that will never be know not who be people who have perpetrated monstrous outrage upon faithful servant personal friend of tsar know ere long will curse day upon planned think that majesty will allow such colossal insolence a yours to go unpunished tell that enough will not degrade by further bandying of word with professor duly translated blustering speech to colonel lethbridge causing latter to smile at sight of vasilovich ground teeth cursed two men roundly in russian be biding time saw that boat from convict ship be about to visit strange craft on board found noted fact that abductor apparently consisted of four men only confidently believed that upon arrival of boat alongside must be necessary for to declare to crew issue to order to insure capture of stranger extraordinary ship out of hand meanwhile convict ship gig with four oarsman coxswain in be hanging on to foot of parent vessel gangway ladder presently file of russian soldier with bayonet fixed be seen to approach gangway escorting between prisoner arrived at gangway one of two soldier descended ladder seated in stern sheet of gig prisoner heavily ironed be next assisted down ship side into boat where seated beside soldier already there second soldier then followed placing on other side of prisoner few minute then elapsed at expiration of officer who have be presented a captain popovski appeared at gangway with much care circumspection lowered gingerly down side ladder into gig where seated square in centre of stern sheet then gave order to coxswain who repeated to boat crew bow oarsman bore boat off from ship side oar blade flashed into water minute later captain popovski be standing on deck of flying fish exchanging most elaborate ceremonious of bow with von schalckenberg lethbridge a small deep set eye flashed fore aft in inquisitive scrutiny of few visible detail of extraordinary ship on board found appeared a though about to speak professor forestalled captain popovski said von schalckenberg in russian have to tender to most profound apology for having thus somewhat unceremoniously interrupted progress of voyage unfortunately information upon have acted came to too late to render other course possible knowing however how unpleasant delay must be to propose to render a brief a may be perhaps therefore will have goodness to give instruction to men to bring colonel sziszkinski up side to here forthwith can then proceed with complete exchange at once captain bowed though expression of feature betrayed disappointment experienced at such extreme promptitude of action on part of stranger in whose company found curiosity have be very keenly aroused by mysterious appearance of flying fish upon scene by peculiar indeed unique model structure of ship by singular blending of politeness with autocratic authority characterised demeanour of crew have hoped that offer of hospitality by stranger must have afforded opportunity to view interior of strange craft thus perhaps have enabled to pick up few scrap of information concerning clearly be to be denied therefore proceeded to head of gangway ladder gave order presently resulted in appearance of colonel sziszkinski accompanied by two armed guard single glance at prisoner sufficed to satisfy von schalckenberg captain popovski be acting in good faith bowed to officer said yes be man want will have goodness captain to direct men to remove fetter put upon man indicating vasilovich stop shouted vasilovich suddenly stepping forward pace from position have hitherto passively occupied between professor lethbridge throwing out arm with authoritative gesture towards captain popovski stop forbid to take slightest notice of what that man say be count vasilovich personal friend of majesty emperor have doubt often heard name be fully aware of power influence posse in name of majesty command to seize ship make prisoner of men whom see here other person whom may find on board there be four unarmed men here to oppose a may see while there be four of three being armed soldier attention paused suddenly for von schalckenberg hand be on collar von schalckenberg pistol barrel be making presence uncomfortably felt a muzzle pressed coldly against scalp just behind left ear ejaculated professor be possible that have so soon forgotten capability of little toy of mine be silent man if wish sinful misspent life to come to sudden violent end give choice will die where stand will go peaceably aboard yonder ship will go sullenly answered vasilovich through clenched teeth good remarked von schalckenberg cheerfully proceed captain popovski if please russian officer who have be watching little scene with kindling eye swiftly changing emotion waved hand to men who at once stolidly proceeded to remove fetter from limb of sziszkinski place upon of savagely scowling count will pay dearly for outrage captain popovski hissed vasilovich a felt cold iron being clamped round wrist only wait until majesty silence exclaimed popovski angrily remember that be prisoner learn to treat with proper respect if give least trouble will have flogged have broken many prouder spirit than yours man doubt not that can break yours also must be necessary now march waved hand imperiously toward gangway through count vasilovich two soldier who have in custody promptly disappeared trust captain that new prisoner be not going to give trouble remarked professor blandly trust not for own sake grimly replied popovski if doe will know how to deal with lingered for moment to afford stranger opportunity to invite below then perceiving that such invitation be to be forthcoming resumed well monsieur presume that exchange have forced upon be now completed may go undoubtedly answered von schalckenberg with much suavity of manner take with captain expression of profound appreciation of extreme courtesy wherewith have acceded to request believe monsieur will never forget will consider a for ever indebted to very deeply regret that exigency of situation render impossible for to invite below if will allow to summon steward on account monsieur answered captain hiding chagrin in grim smile be doubtless a eager a be to proceed have therefore honour to bid very good morning therewith bowing low turned passed through gangway down ladder so into boat few minute later be once more dangling at davit of convict ship while count vasilovich be being inducted into new quarter among fellow convict chapter nine colonel sziszkinski join party meanwhile during progress of foregoing scene colonel sziszkinski so full of amazement at what be transpiring that found difficult to persuade that be not victim of fantastic hallucination stood silent watchful where have first halted upon deck of flying fish have of course upon instant of arrival recognised among stranger who for mysterious reason be thus interfering with affair somewhat remarkable personality of old friend von schalckenberg be also aware from exclamation of professor that latter have recognised colonel have recently in course of prison experience undergone course of hard discipline have speedily impressed upon wisdom of keeping eye wide open mouth close shut until be absolutely sure of detail of situation in might find moreover have observed that although von schalckenberg have unquestionably recognised professor have vouchsafed sign indicative of existence of such sentiment a friendship for so believing that there be doubtless good reason for remained impassive none le profoundly interested spectator of what be happening sooner be captain popovski satellite fairly clear of flying fish than von schalckenberg darted forward seizing colonel by hand while eye beamed ardent friendship through lens of gold rimmed spectacle exclaimed ach mein friend now that prying russian have gone may act speak freely welcome thrice welcome dear boris hearty congratulation on escape from fate to high spirited fellow like must have be far worse than death come let present to friend indicating baronet who seeing that be no longer needed behind maxim came sauntering up be sir reginald elphinstone englishman owner of good ship flying fish have to thank daughter first sir reginald next for deliverance from hold of yonder convict ship be colonel lethbridge late of british army be captain mildmay whose retirement from british navy have deprived country of service of one of most brilliant sailor gentleman continued be very excellent friend colonel sziszkinski one of tsar most faithful zealous officer have majesty known party shook hand round sir reginald in few well chosen word bade newcomer heartily welcome to unique shelter afforded by flying fish for a long time a chose to avail of then baronet led way below saying to guest let conduct down into saloon rather fancy will find quite agreeable little surprise awaiting there agreeable little surprise in shape of colonel daughter be indeed found alone awaiting arrival of newly released convict in music room will imitate delicacy of on board flying fish leave father daughter to exchange greeting confidence in private meanwhile sir reginald having conducted guest below witnessed first rapture of meeting between father daughter returned to deck where found three male companion standing together discussing event of last few hour watching receding convict ship have resumed voyage be by time nearly mile distant well professor said a joined group having happily accomplished rescue of friend what be to be next move have be thinking of answered von schalckenberg in view of fact that expedition have be undertaken for benefit of daughter health must suggest that work way slowly southward be now exactly on meridian of degree east longitude so friend mildmay informs by following meridian southward will cross asia minor hitting coast fifty mile to eastward of black sea entrance to bosporus shave past head of gulf of ismid be easternmost extremity of sea of marmora leave coast again about halfway between island of rhodes gulf of adalia then crossing easternmost extremity of mediterranean sea will strike african coast at alexandria sighting historic bay of aboukir passing over lake mareotis plunging into libyan desert then if please can turn off at point follow course of nile visiting pyramid memphis luxor ruin of ancient thebe rest of interesting place be to be found on border of grand old river advise latter course for egypt of to day simply swarm with tourist imagine that sir reginald be not anxious to attract attention to ship of yours must be practically impossible for to avoid by following up course of nile be quite right professor must avoid attention be to say attention of civilised folk a carefully a possible answered sir reginald besides think have done egypt pretty thoroughly already therefore be in favour of continuing due south into very heart of africa can penetrate into solitude that ordinary traveller dare not attempt to reach will be rather surprised if find amply rewarded by very interesting discovery a be case during last cruise furthermore there be unicorn to be hunted for afresh will never be entirely happy until have secured perfect specimen two of beautiful creature ach doze unicorn exclaimed von schalckenberg throwing out hand excitedly very mention of set longing to be after again yes yes certainly must not return home until have obtained few specimen of so wonderful animal fortunately record of previous voyage enables to know exactly where to search for quite so assented sir reginald think however professor that before proceed further ought to ascertain from friend colonel sziszkinski what be view respecting future of daughter of course hope be scarcely necessary for to say that a friend of yours be most heartily welcome to hospitality of flying fish for a long time a may care to accept be just possible that colonel may have plan that must wish to put into operation without delay in case appears to that greatest kindness on part must be to convey forthwith to scene of new sphere of action ach yes be true agreed von schalckenberg might discus matter with sziszkinski at breakfast table mention of reminds that be hungry while watch withdrawing article mentioned from pocket glancing at tell that breakfast ought now to be ready glanced round horizon be bare save for rapidly receding shape of convict ship continued see reason why with approval of captain mildmay a navigator must not remain where be until after breakfast by time yonder ship will be out of sight there will be one to note next movement there be particular object in moving from here think until point of immediate destination be fixed what say mildmay can remain here perfectly well agreed mildmay a say there be object in moving until will have decided in what direction movement be to be made unless indeed sir reginald have amendment to make to proposition not asserted baronet quite agree with professor ah thank goodness there be breakfast bell early morning air be most wonderful sharpener of appetite come gentleman let go below flying fish be quite capable of taking care of herself for next hour so a four men filed into dining saloon from vestibule be confronted by lady elphinstone little daughter ida who be entering apartment at other end from music saloon where have already made acquaintance of colonel sziszkinski who with daughter followed moment later colonel who since saw last on deck of flying fish have exchanged exceedingly ugly convict garb for suit of clothes sent to cabin by colonel lethbridge who be about same height build a russian be decidedly good looking man still in very prime of life tall well set up a soldier must be with ruddy flaxen hair moustache beard pair of deep blue eye that looked one straight honestly in face must upon occasion flash very lightning of righteous indignation professor must remember time when have be easy matter to bring twinkle of rich humour into same eye for present at event sense of humour have disappeared in face of constant humiliation petty tyranny to have be subjected ever since arrest for rest be educated polished accomplished gentleman with absolutely perfect manner seems to come quite naturally to so many of countryman of own class breakfast a may be supposed be exceptionally cheerful meal morning for feodorovna sziszkinski be exuberantly happy in fact of father marvellous rescue from fate too dreadful for calm contemplation colonel be happier still if be possible for same reason because release have come to absolutely without second warning preparation others be in buoyant spirit at knowledge that have be able to make two very worthy people happy too with trouble beyond what have brought to little pleasant exhilarating excitement conversation consisted for most part in recital by colonel at von schalckenberg request of experience while in prison although touched lightly upon glossed over others still told enough to arouse deep indignation of hearer cause to rejoice further at having be mean of delivering from condition of such acute continuous misery at conclusion of meal entire party adjourned to deck to take look round enjoy deliciously soft balmy air there be nothing in sight therefore particular reason why flying fish must make immediate move sir reginald therefore deftly so arranged matter while mildmay undertook to entertain mlle sziszkinski lethbridge alternately chatted with lady olivia played with ida got lately liberated russian von schalckenberg to join in promenade at other end of deck from occupied by rest of party colonel sziszkinski who have of course already learned from daughter leading particular of circumstance have led up to rescue eagerly seized opportunity to reiterate to baronet most heartfelt thanks for astonishing most unexpected deliverance afforded sir reginald opening for be looking dear colonel said beg that will not say word about for assure that afforded unmixed pleasure to circumvent plan of scoundrel vasilovich deliver from toil have be total stranger to must still have be pleasant task to have done what have done in somewhat unlikely event of fact of case becoming known to happen to be friend of dear professor here to be friend of one be to be friend of of that being case felt bound to help even before have heard particular of story from charming daughter now happened that just before breakfast while be below four adventurer be discussing question of direction in must next head flying fish for must explain to that although have programme of sort be very elastic one subject to alteration at short notice for good sufficient reason eventually decided to settle nothing until have consulted may be that having recovered freedom there be certain thing that must desire to do if so will afford greatest possible pleasure to assist to utmost of ability if on other hand however have a yet definite plan let now say that will give greatest possible satisfaction if daughter will afford pleasure of society during cruise for so much of a may be agreeable to sir reginald exclaimed sziszkinski with emotion a grasped baronet extended hand be completely at loss for word in to express adequately gratitude feel for most kindly generous offer will perhaps better be able to appreciate depth of feeling when explain to that through machination of villain vasilovich daughter be save for kindly hospitality homeless with exception of money jewellery that daughter may possibly happen to have upon person penniless furthermore apart from yourselves have not friend on face of earth to whom can turn for help shelter rather who must dare to risk anger of tsar by affording have at moment plan for know only too well that attempt to secure reversal of sentence return of confiscated property must be worse than useless since must not only end in failure also put for second time in power of tsar therefore accept most kind invitation to join party a frankly a be offered with most hearty thanks doubtless with advantage of few day calm reflection will be able to evolve scheme for future doubt assented sir reginald please be in hurry about for longer can find convenient to remain with better will be pleased if happen to be anything of sportsman think may venture to promise sport quite worth having of rather unique kind eh professor aha agreed professor yes be so unicorn for instance forthwith von schalckenberg plunged animatedly into description of wonderful animal followed by recital of exciting circumstance under have first be seen shortly after three men rejoined rest of party at other end of deck sir reginald remarking good friend have little bit of pleasant news for will be glad to learn that von schalckenberg have between succeeded in inducing colonel sziszkinski to give pleasure of own daughter company during considerable portion if not whole of cruise there be therefore need for alteration of arrangement may proceed to carry out original plan of travelling slowly southward question now be whether will continue journey on surface of sea take to air what say lady travelling upon surface of sea appeared have terror for lady mal de mer never troubled of be in hurry found present condition exceedingly pleasant have doubt that must be equally pleasant to be flying through air so on so on in short be in pliant state of mind predisposed to assent cordially to proposal be therefore agreed to potter along on due southerly course day at speed of about ten knot giving wide berth to craft that might encounter on way take to air after nightfall availing of hour of darkness to accomplish journey across asia minor arrangement be carried out in entirety party spending very enjoyable day on deck although there be little nothing to be seen only two craft of steamer being sighted during day be steering north be hull down so that probably failed to notice presence of flying fish maxim gun being no longer needed be dismounted again stowed away in accordance with recognised rule that ship be always to be kept in condition for mounting into air descending beneath surface of sea at moment notice nightfall found voyager about sixty mile distant from southern shore of black sea at point took to air rising to height of ten thousand foot with light air of wind from southward against increasing speed to thirty five knot asia minor be distinctly hilly country there be very lofty elevation under meridian of thirtieth degree of east longitude along flying fish be then running indeed in immediate vicinity until southern coast be approached where at distance of about forty mile from point at traveller must again pas out over water twenty five mile to left of proper course bei dagh peak rise to height of ten thousand four hundred foot while few mile farther on quite near to track highest peak of susuz dagh range rise still higher by one hundred fifty foot flying fish therefore skimming along at height of ten thousand foot only be liable to dash into of peak if so happened that chanced to encounter air current to deflect to eastward of proper course however be exceedingly unlikely for at height of ten thousand foot above earth be in what be known a calm belt of atmosphere where air current when such exist at be very sluggish danger of collision with of peak above mentioned be therefore so remote a to be hardly worth consideration in case must not arise until early hour of following morning be therefore decided that there be need for maintenance of night watch in pilot house mildmay undertaking to be up in good time to obviate possibility of danger first flash of sunrise next morning found flying fish just passing over border between land sea on southern coast of asia minor with casteloriza island practically beneath susuz range safely astern island of rhodes like pink cloud broad abeam on western horizon soft delicate purple outline broad on port bow mildmay informed be upper portion of mount troados highest peak of mountain range form a be backbone of island of cyprus ship be still maintaining height of ten thousand foot above sea level speed of thirty five knot through air of circumstance rendered necessary for on board to make such observation a desired from interior of ship outside air being too rarefied keen ship speed through too rapid for exposure to to be at agreeable be therefore arranged that a passage across mediterranean be likely to prove uninteresting there must therefore be inducement for of to go out on deck that passage must be accomplished at full speed voyager must then have time to dress take breakfast at leisure be ready to go out on deck to witness arrival on african coast accordingly at quarter to ten o'clock ship time flying fish having be lowered to distance of three thousand foot above sea level speed reduced to about ten knot pilot house door be thrown open everybody passed out on deck where found air dry pleasantly bracing with temperature of about fifty five degree fahrenheit be still over sea african coast be in plain view five mile ahead with tower minaret of city of alexandria broad on starboard bow showing quite distinctly in lens of telescope while at about same distance on port beam aboukir castle must be distinguished with historic bay of aboukir beyond hour later great african continent be beneath be looking down upon ruin of nicopolisisoi line of railway from alexandria to rosetta island dotted lake mareotis thenceforward for rest of day there be little of interest to attract attention of traveller apart from fact that during afternoon caught distant glimpse of pyramid with cairo beyond on far eastern horizon finally at end of very pleasant day progress across desert accomplished at low rate of speed on ida account in order that might not be subjected to too rapid change of temperature in southward progress after enjoying spectacle of superb desert sunset came to earth for night twenty five mile west of lake birket el keroon progressing thus quietly at rate of about hundred mile per day coming to earth at sunset evening fifth day of journey over africa terminated in immediate neighbourhood of patch of rocky outcrop ten mile long by about three mile in width hitherto traveller have observed sign of wild life during exceedingly leisurely progress southward sight of water hole two few patch of scanty herbage dotted here there among rock led to hope that here might at last possibly get chance of shot at game of sort hope became practical certainty when a men of party be promenading deck after dinner enjoying tobacco hoarse coughing roar reached ear from direction of rock roar be answered at interval from other point spirit of party rose high in anticipation of sport for morrow for roar be at once identified a of lion be forthwith arranged that at least portion of next day must be devoted to hunting brute chapter ten extraordinary sight chief topic of conversation at breakfast table on following morning be a might be expected big game shooting then transpired that russian colonel have never faced anything bigger more formidable than bear wolf be consequently much elated at prospect of encountering lordly lion in native wild especially with so effective weapon a magazine rifle firing twenty shot without reloading upon merit of colonel lethbridge expatiated eloquently elation be of kind easily becomes contagious party be in high spirit when at length rose from table proceeded to gun room to select weapon provide with supply of cartridge cartridge must be explained be like almost everything else connected with flying fish of quite unique character totally unlike used in ordinary weapon of sport warfare in be not charged with gunpowder with preparation of singular substance employed for generating motive power of ship engine substance be so tremendously powerful that very minute quantity be be needed to take place of usual powder charge hence possibility of stowing away a many a twenty cartridge in magazine of only ordinary size furthermore cartridge be loaded with several different kind of missile there be for instance cartridge charged with shot of various size from dust shot for killing of humming bird such like up to ordinary buck shot enclosed in case so fragile that friction of passage along rifling of barrel destroyed causing to crumble to dust a emerged from muzzle of weapon leave charge of shot free to do work in same manner a though fired from ordinary shot gun then there be cartridge charged with usual sporting bullet employed for shooting such game a buck antelope cartridge with soft nosed bullet for war purpose shooting of larger game such a giraffe lion tiger leopard like finally cartridge charged with thick heavy steel shell exploded blew to piece upon striking mark thus inflicting so terrible wound a usually to prove instantly fatal last be intended for use in shooting of elephant rhinoceros hippopotamus other animal with exceptionally thick hide for case of exceptional emergency be of course number cartridge with sportsman provided on present occasion weapon having be selected sufficient supply of cartridge slipped into man pocket hunter ascended to deck to take preliminary look round with binoculars upon off chance that might catch glimpse of something must help to decision a to point to to direct step here discovered that lady have preceded lady olivia mlle sziszkinski ida being already there intently searching rock with glass well ida demanded sir reginald how many lion have already seen none at papa answered child in playfully aggrieved tone of voice saw deer standing upon highest rock few minute ago did not stay there long a to lion think be not very likely to see can not see very much of rock from place must like to be able to watch when go out to shoot lion can not move ship to place nearer rock where can see everything of course can little woman answered sir reginald genially while be about added turning to others may a well make complete circuit of entire patch execute reconnaissance in fact may enable to discover trace of quarry so save long toilsome tramp in heat thereupon returned to pilot house to put big ship in motion few second later with gentle almost imperceptible jar flying fish rose from ground to height of about two hundred foot with engine only just turning began to circle slowly round somewhat extensive outcrop while party on deck keenly searched with binoculars several irregularity of surface a swung into view for twenty minute so search proved unsuccessful men be beginning to feel just trifle anxious when lethbridge exclaimed with sigh of relief ah now be getting warm a ida must say do see that small bunch of gazelle drinking at pool yonder where be there also not very far off will friend leo be fancy in moment glass be directed full upon half dozen so of graceful animal be now in full view scarcely quarter of mile distant have hitherto be hidden by huge intervening mass of rock appeared a though lethbridge assumption must probably prove correct for animal betrayed evident sign of uneasiness a though suspicious of danger though unable to determine point from to expect drank hesitatingly taking small sip of water then throwing up head with startled air ear twitching incessantly body braced a though in readiness to bound off like flash at first suspicious sign party who watched with such interest be at first disposed to attribute uneasiness of animal to presence of flying fish be now in full view von schalckenberg who be good deal of naturalist a well a experienced shikari confidently asserted that be not that be something very much nearer be disturbing presently while elder of party be discussing matter intently watching gazelle through binoculars ida cried out oh look mamma look colonel what be great thing like spotted cat be crouching behind long ledge of rock to left of where gazelle be standing be leopard surely must be dear believe be trying to get near enough to gazelle to spring upon one of please please let do shoot somebody quick where be leopard of yours ida show to said lethbridge coming over to child side kneeling down beside there answered ida pointing see oh please be quick there now be standing up looking over see sweetheart answered lethbridge springing to foot reaching for rifle six hundred yard muttered adjusting sight of weapon raising to shoulder head of animal be now in plain view showing dark against brightly illuminated background of rock while rest of body be almost invisible in deep shadow of ledge behind have be stalking prey be only by merest chance that child quick eye have caught sight of yellow spotted form crouching low in deep shadow stealing almost imperceptibly toward gazelle there be faint almost inaudible click a lethbridge pulled trigger of weapon equally faint little wreath of diaphanous vapour leapt from muzzle leopard sprang high into air startling gazelle putting to instant flight ere fell back rolled over lay motionless on rocky platform along have be stealing good shot shouted sir reginald from open window of pilot house through have be watching scene have better drop to earth at once if wish to secure skin vulture have trick of appearing from nowhere in incredibly short time know if leave skinning until come back there may be skin left worth taking quite so must make sure of skin at once if intend to have at certainly must for not only be first trophy cruise belongs to ida by right of first discovery must have answered lethbridge who have quickly developed quite remarkable affection for child flying fish be accordingly brought to earth at once on tolerably level spot quite close to carcase of leopard five men quickly left ship by way of what be known a diving chamber trap door in bottom of craft forthwith proceeded to take skin be found upon examination that ex colonel have made really splendid shot bullet having struck creature fair in centre of back of skull passed out through left eye be still engaged upon work of removing pelt when roar of lion reached ear muffled sound seeming to suggest that animal be at distance possibly a much a two mile from in about minute sound be repeated again about minute later so on sound coming to pretty regularly at half minute interval ach exclaimed professor presently think can guess what be happening now if be quick may be in time to witness somewhat remarkable sight yes said lethbridge think know to what refer professor once saw certainly be a say very curious sight may be allowed to know what curious sight be of two gentleman be speaking inquired russian wait see for boris friend exclaimed von schalckenberg if know what to expect will appreciate sight more when see there a last ligament be severed skin came away from carcase that job be finished let wash hand be off at once may be too late five minute later flying fish be again in air heading at twenty knot speed in direction from sound of roaring appeared to proceed while several vulture have already mysteriously appeared high in air above carcase of leopard be rapidly dropping down toward roaring still continued repetition of coming to very much more distinctly than one have preceded presently a ship swept along little valley among rock swung into view there in very middle of be to be seen singular sight of professor lethbridge have spoken valley be really willow saucer like hollow in rocky outcrop with small pool in middle of ground forming interior of saucer so to speak being quite smooth with projection inequality of kind to form cover for stalking purpose rock surface be here covered with layer of soil supported crop of short rich grass have consequently be selected a abode of herd of thirty gazelle be now drawn up in line close to edge of water hole to professor lethbridge of whom have witnessed similar incident before matter be perfectly clear gazelle have gone down to pool to drink while thus engaged have be approached by magnificent lion lioness have succeeded in getting within about hundred yard of herd ere latter have discovered presence then gazelle have faced round upon formidable foe stood at gaze apparently paralysed into inactivity while lion be evidently quite aware that attempt to make dash at herd must at once put to flight send hopelessly beyond reach so there two group remained about hundred yard apart gazelle motionless lioness also be motionless lying stretched at full length upon ground with head resting upon outstretched fore paw while lord four five yard nearer gazelle have assumed half crouching attitude very similar to of barking dog be still emitting deep throated roar at interval ach be all right be in time now will see what will see exclaimed von schalckenberg a sir reginald stopped engine flying fish slowing down drifted gently into position afforded occupant of deck excellent view of little drama be in progress ship finally came to rest in perfectly still air immediately in rear of lion lioness be apparently altogether too profoundly interested in own proceeding to have become aware of presence of great ship behind while gazelle also in full view of huge glistening silver like craft floated at height of two hundred foot above ground appeared to be too intently occupied in watching ferocious enemy to have attention to spare for anything else a sir reginald emerged from pilot house professor in low toned murmur advised companion to take binoculars note especially behaviour of gazelle did so presently became aware that one animal in particular fine fat buck be exhibiting symptom of very acute distress terror tossing head stamping on ground with foot at roar of lion holding back in attitude almost appeared to suggest idea that be being pushed pulled out of line toward lion yet there be nothing to show that be actually case presently however at roar from lion buck actually advanced few pace out from rank of fellow evidently with utmost reluctance stood shivering palpably in mortal terror take rifle gentleman murmured von schalckenberg must save that poor beast life fire until give word for must like to see little more of really remarkable performance before put end to boris friend have never yet shot lion while rest of have be therefore fairly entitled to privilege of first shot take therefore lion one of will account for lioness remember that rifle will afford twenty shot without reloading if therefore must fail to kill with first shot peg away until do now who be to be responsible for lioness let mildmay take said sir reginald lethbridge have already have shot yours mine professor can come later so be arranged meanwhile lion evidently encouraged by what have already accomplished redoubled effort sending forth roar after roar at one of unfortunate buck shivering in limb with tear streaming down cheek advanced pace two nearer lion at length however sight of animal distress became too painful for lady olivia lowering binoculars exclaimed in low tense accent oh please put end to somebody be cruel of to allow pretty creature to go on suffering such agony of terror simply because sight happens to be of interesting singular nature surely have seen enough have not for answer colonel sziszkinski raised rifle to shoulder taking steady aim pulled trigger there be usual faint click of hammer immediately little spurt of brown dust close to lion fore paw showed that russian have missed lion took notice whatever of fact that bullet have just missed crouched again for emission of roar when click of hammer again sounded immediately followed by loud thud of bullet roar ended in savage snarl a great beast lurched forward on to head with single convulsive extension of body lay quiet still at same instant thud of bullet be heard lioness be seen to twitch head slightly without making further movement a for troop of gazelle sooner be lion down than throwing up head with one accord wheeled sharply round to left dashed off across little plain vanishing minute later through cleft of rock meanwhile mildmay be looking alternately at lioness rifle with puzzled expression must have sworn that hit brute exclaimed yet there lie a coolly comfortably a though nothing have happened even tragic end of lord master seems to have interest for will wake up beauty will know reason why raised rifle again to shoulder need to waste cartridge skipper remarked lethbridge who have be inspecting lioness through binoculars take glass look at head just behind left ear mildmay took glass having used for moment handed back with grunt of satisfaction thanks said felt certain have hit must understand why never moved did move boy answered lethbridge twitched head when bullet struck have time for more for killed on spot just a lay uncommonly neat shot call for sailor mildmay laughed yes said be not half bad for sailor a say colonel sailor claim to be crack rifle shot know leave for soldier when come to shooting with nine point two twelve inch gun believe there be of who must show red coat trick two two mildmay lethbridge have not wholly escaped feeling of professional jealousy even to day lingers in more le modified form between navy army if occasion happened to be peculiarly favourable sometimes exchanged chaffing remark two at other expense sparring be always perfectly good natured absolutely devoid of trace of ill feeling for first of be gentleman in highest sense of term in next place friendship subsisted between be far too thorough whole hearted for ever willingly to wound though ever so slightly susceptibility of other now became necessary again to bring ship to earth in order to secure skin of lion lioness ground being favourable be done quite close to spot where two carcase lay few minute later men be once more busily engaged on task of removing pelt of be exceedingly valuable of kind animal being exceptionally fine specimen in perfect condition lion indeed be unanimously pronounced to be finest that of have ever seen being quite young beast full grown with magnificently thick black mane truly formidable set of perfect teeth claw colonel sziszkinski be in high feather at having be so fortunate a to secure so splendid specimen expressed very keen desire to secure skull a well a skin if possible at von schalckenberg remarked that nothing must be easier provided that sir reginald be willing to remain in neighbourhood of rock for night for there be huge ant nest close at hand be necessary be to place skinned head alongside nest must guarantee that insect must clean skull bare of vestige of flesh by following morning of course sir reginald who be very personification of courtesy readily agreed to flying fish be berthed for night on sand mile two to windward of rock slumber might not be disturbed by quarrelsome cry of vulture over carcase when after breakfast next morning returned to ascertain result of experiment be found to be a professor have said skull be picked so clean of absolutely particle of flesh that must safely be stowed away without least risk of becoming offensive chapter eleven elephant rhinoceros duel skull of lion having be secured flying fish rose into air immediately after breakfast hour be devoted to thorough examination of remaining extent of patch of rock to ascertain whether further specimen of big carnivora have taken up abode upon more be to be found southward journey be therefore resumed at leisurely speed of about fifteen knot noon observation for latitude showing that ship have entered tropic of cancer shortly after eleven o'clock morning remainder of day passed uneventfully a did next with exception that ship having be raised to altitude of two thousand foot above surface of earth in order that traveller might be above out of layer of highly heated air produced by reflection of sun ray from surface of sand again caught sight of nile swam into view on left hand during forenoon of second day near little village of dashi remained in sight thereafter until descended to earth for night twenty five mile west of town of new dongola here be again treated to spectacle of superb desert sunset leisurely mode of progression however be beginning to pall somewhat upon traveller rather upon male portion of be altogether too uneventful for taste moreover appetite for sport have be whetted afresh by experience among rock a sat at dinner night unanimously decided that a climate seemed to agree thoroughly with little ida who be growing better stronger day must waste further time in dawdling must forthwith make best of way to spot where on previous cruise have seen that wonderful animal unicorn almost precisely creature depicted in royal arm of great britain endeavour to secure specimen two accordingly after spending very enjoyable evening in music saloon lady retired to rest about midnight while men producing large scale map of africa carefully laid down upon course measured off distance necessary to carry to point desired to reach ascertained mildmay who usually performed duty of navigator ascended to pilot house injecting sufficient quantity of vapour into air chamber to produce required vacuum caused ship to rise to height of ten thousand foot into calm belt sent engine ahead gradually raising speed to maximum meanwhile heading ship upon proper course then returned below reported to sir reginald what have done hand retired to respective cabin for night quite confident from past experience of ship ability to take care of herself during hour of darkness slept well a be usual with while enjoying delightful untrammelled open air existence eager enthusiasm of scientist explorer caused professor to be astir with first streak of dawn rising quietly made way noiselessly in pyjama slippered foot to pilot house out of window of peered eagerly about flying fish be still sweeping steadily along through air at speed of one hundred twenty mile hour with sharp snout holding steadily to course at have be set overnight beneath nothing be visible save vast sea of impenetrably thick white fog professor consulted watch must be close to spot by time murmured let get down beneath that fog see where be stopped engine opened air valve great ship instantly began to settle quietly down in few minute sank gently into fog bank professor after touching lever two ran nimbly down pilot house stair out on deck that might get clear view of surroundings stepping to guard rail took place of bulwark in flying fish looked eagerly about under for few second there be nothing to be seen huge wreath of dense white steam like mist writhing curling about ship then here there great shapeless phantom form dimly appeared through enshrouding fog professor knew that be in midst of country thickly dotted with extensive clump of bush moment later slight grating jar told that ship have grounded hastening back to pilot house von schalckenberg brought four grip anchor into action thus securing ship to spot on have landed after made way to one of bathroom took bath then returned to cabin dressed shock of ship taking ground light though be sufficed to arouse other sleeper hour later male contingent of party be assembled in dining saloon taking early coffee biscuit by glancing from time to time through saloon window be able to see that fog still hung thick about while lingered chatting over coffee professor suddenly cried out that mist be clearing with one accord emptied cup made for deck yes fog be certainly thinning away under influence of now risen sun in few minute be possible to see with tolerable distinctness not only ground beneath also clump of bush in immediate neighbourhood while other more distant object be momentarily stealing into view a mist wreath thinned away vanished few minute later entire landscape lay clearly revealed before sharp distinct in crystalline purity of early morning light then exclamation of astonishment burst simultaneously from lip of four of five male voyager for a glanced about instantly recognised surroundings discovered that von schalckenberg in blindness of fog have enveloped have brought flying fish to earth within le than hundred yard of identical spot have occupied upon memorable occasion when have first beheld unicorn yes there be little willow lake amid tall bordering reed of have ambushed for purpose of shooting game came down there to drink at night there be streamlet from have replenished supply of fresh water be now in same open grassy bush enveloped space that ship have previously occupied over there to left within stone throw be precise spot upon have rested doubted not that within five minute must find actual hole in soil made by grip anchor six year more ago there two mile away rose low bare hill upon crest of professor have first seen troop of unicorn standing out against background of pale primrose sky a grazed ay there be animal of sort up there now professor rushed below presently reappeared with pair of binoculars in hand hastily levelled at tiny dot ala be only black antelope interesting creature enough from mere sportsman point of view not what wanted hoped to see lowered glass with sigh of resignation said a plainly a word that supposed be too much to hope that must be lucky enough to find instantly what be in search of while stood chatting together lady little ida stepped out on deck joined then there be renewed exclamation of wonder delight at change from desert scenery upon have gazed day before for so many day previously that have begun to tire of slightly air be rapidly becoming heated under ray of sun must be very nearly vertical at noon at mildmay suggestion therefore men of party busied forthwith in spreading awning fore aft that lady might have welcome shade under to sit during day while be still tying last lanyard breakfast gong sounded five minute later entire party be gathered round breakfast table in condition of exuberantly buoyant spirit one felt disposed to linger long over meal that morning within hour everybody be again on deck provided with pair of binoculars while men folk attired in stalking suit of thin tough grey green tweed consisting of norfolk jacket knickerbockers with cap of same material shod with stout boot surmounted by thick leather gaiter reaching to knee a protection against possible snake bite have taken precaution to bring up rifle bandolier with in order that might be ready for emergency first act be to sweep entire visible surface of country with glass nothing more interesting than few bunch of deer antelope be to be seen however be not to be very greatly wondered at for ground be so heavily encumbered with bush comparatively little of be to be seen be perfectly clear that if wished to find game must go look for there be two way of doing one be to sally forth on foot while other much easier way be to rise few hundred foot in air then survey country afresh be necessary to mention latter course for to be promptly decided upon sir reginald at once went to pilot house did what be requisite with result that minute two later flying fish be thousand foot in air drifting very gently to southward before languid northerly breathing of warm wind new position of ship disclosed scene of very different character from upon have just before be gazing for not only have now very much wider horizon be also able to see over beyond great deal of bush in near vicinity thus survey much open space have before be hidden from moreover many sound have before be inaudible to now reached ear sir reginald now emerged from pilot house rejoined companion who while have never ceased to search country with binoculars well gentleman exclaimed have discovered anything worthy of notice there be small herd of elephant feeding in clump of timber yonder answered professor few buck antelope scattered about here there can see sign of unicorn a yet then said sir reginald cheerfully must be content with what can get go for elephant probably will be obliged to go into ambush at night for unicorn must drink presume if so ought to get sooner later by watching among reed of pool what say gentleman do care to try for shot at elephant colonel sziszkinski eagerly expressed willingness to join party lethbridge be altogether too keen sportsman to let slip such opportunity mildmay seemed rather disposed to be lazy that morning linger with lady while soon became evident that professor must not be satisfied with game other than unicorn be therefore speedily arranged that sir reginald lethbridge russian guest must have try for elephant while mildmay von schalckenberg remained on board flying fish clump of timber in elephant have be seen feeding be by time about two mile distant almost directly to windward in midst of wide open space with bush near enough to afford effective cover for hunter within range of rifle must be necessary therefore for animal to be stalked there happened to be large clump of bush about mile directly to leeward of timber extensive enough almost to conceal flying fish behind while affording on deck very clear uninterrupted view of movement of hunter hunted be therefore decided to head ship for von schalckenberg accordingly retired to pilot house to navigate craft to chosen position mildmay joined lady while three sportsman went below to complete final preparation hold ready to issue forth by way of diving chamber a soon a must feel ship take ground at low rate of speed keeping ship dead end on to clump of timber to avoid alarming elephant professor deftly manoeuvred into berth chosen for brought gently to earth on spot afforded on deck clear view over top of bush while concealing practically whole of hull from keen sighted pachyderm few minute later three hunter emerged from underneath ship waved silent adieu to little group who stood on deck watching during first five minute of tramp special precaution be necessary on part of trio for during time be screened from view of quarry by intervening clump of bush upon reaching extremity of be obliged to crouch low sometimes even to go down on knee in long grass to avoid detection elephant be still busily feeding a must easily be seen by occasional violent movement of branch of tree while one of occasionally gave vent to feeling by trumpeting sound of be distinctly audible on deck of flying fish little party of five there gathered be now comfortably ensconced in basket chair from under grateful shadow of awning be able to watch at ease for development with aid of powerful binoculars for quarter of hour nothing interesting happened stalking party be still hidden from sight of others by intervening bush then head shoulder emerged into view by almost imperceptible degree slowly advanced one of from time to time cautiously raising head to assure that be still going in right direction state of thing continued for half hour during stalk appeared to be progressing most satisfactorily with prospect of success for hunter be now within quarter of mile of wood be obvious to onlooker that be already eagerly watching for opportunity to get in shot while still steadily creeping ever closer to unsuspecting quarry quite unexpectedly whole aspect of affair became changed for elephant have for time be silent presently sent forth terrific sound of trumpeting in moment herd of eleven elephant three of be enormous tusker suddenly broke cover stampeded down wind with trunk in air great ear flapping viciously animal giving utterance to shrill scream trumpetings of rage a headed directly for spot where three hunter crouched in long grass moment later be followed by twelfth truly gigantic bull be evidently engaged in furious combat with other smaller animal must be seen persistently charging huge antagonist while latter wheeling hither thither with agility be truly astonishing in so enormous creature seemed making strenuous effort to impale enemy upon tusk to crush by kneeling upon meanwhile remaining eleven elephant pursued headlong flight straight for three sportsman who with marvellous nerve remained hidden until short fifty yard intervened between panic stricken brute then trio rose suddenly to full height raised rifle to shoulder next instant two of three tusker be seen to stumble heavily fall to ground while third pulled up short with leg wide apart stood screaming with fear pain then leg seeming to give way under too sank to ground rolled over on side while remaining eight evidently further startled by sudden inexplicable fall of leader scattered right left be soon lost to view behind many clump of bush be thickly dotted here there mildmay rose to foot fight yonder be becoming interesting professor said think must not be amiss for to move little nearer to scene of action for in case will be necessary to have ship fairly close to three dead elephant to facilitate cutting out of ivory to say nothing about saving friend hot tramp back through long grass what say be about to suggest forestalled answered von schalckenberg let go at once few minute later flying fish having left place of concealment risen into air came to earth again about hundred yard to windward of carcase of three dead elephant mildmay rejoined others on deck to watch combat still raged with unabated fury to observe further movement of little party of hunter who be now cautiously watchfully creeping nearer to combatant scene a now viewed from lofty elevation of ship deck be interesting exciting for drama be enacting at distance of not more than two hundred yard from spectator great bull elephant antagonist be now identified a exceptionally large rhinoceros be so completely occupied with other that approach of flying fish have be quite unnoticed by of continued to circle round charge other making welkin ring with furious squeal grunt trumpetings with a much pertinacity zest a though flying ship hunter have be within hundred mile of there must be doubt that be battle to be fought out to bitter end elephant enormous tusk be already ensanguined with antagonist gore while long gash in left foreleg close to junction with body from blood must be seen to spurt in little intermittent jet testified to skill strength with rhinoceros have used long curving horn yet betrayed slightest disposition to retire from contest wound appeared to goad to greater fury to stimulate to redoubled effort truly amazing activity displayed by ponderous unwieldy creature be perhaps most remarkable feature of whole affair wheeled doubled about other with nimbleness of fighting dog rhinoceros leaping in to deliver stroke then springing aside to avoid thrust of elephant tusk with rapidity rendered difficult to follow movement while elephant countered with quick alertness be evidently very disconcerting to foe at length paused a if by mutual consent facing other at distance of about dozen yard ridiculously inadequate tail of rhinoceros switching in quick angry jerk from side to side while elephant watched keenly with uplifted trunk swiftly flapping ear stood thus for full minute probably recovering wind then rhinoceros with scarcely perceptible movement began to edge stealthily round in apparent endeavour to work into position on enemy broadside elephant however be fully on alert followed adversary movement with corresponding turn of own body keeping rhinoceros still full in front of movement of two animal gradually quickened presently became apparent to onlooker that rhinoceros be slowly lessening distance between enemy then suddenly with furious squeal rhinoceros dashed straight in with lowered head aiming for elephant chest between fore leg thud a two body came together must be distinctly heard by on board flying fish who also saw that rhinoceros have at length got blow home full length of horn being driven into antagonist body elephant uttered piercing shriek of pain a felt wound then lowered head with quick thrusting toss drove one of tusk into groin of rhinoceros with such tremendous force that weapon passed completely through huge body point coming out just above root of tail then with mighty groan crashed to ground dead with writhing body of rhinoceros still impaled upon tusk fight fight to death in very deed be over meanwhile three hunter who have be standing rooted to spot during last few minute of combat too profoundly interested to move rushed forward administered coup de grace to still struggling rhinoceros then lady little ida at professor invitation descended spiral stairway leading down to bottom of ship passed out through diving chamber sauntered over to inspect at close quarter three shot elephant though declined to take nearer view of carcase of combatant mildmay proceeded to look out ax must be required for purpose of cutting out ivory chapter twelve exciting night among reed task of cutting out ivory ponderous horn of rhinoceros occupied five men for remainder of day at end of voyager dined luxuriously upon novel dainty dish of baked elephant foot when spoil have at length be safely stowed away flying fish be removed to respectful distance from huge carcase over there must assuredly be much snarling fighting during impending hour of darkness berthed in midst of dense clump of bush about mile to leeward of small willow lake already mentioned be intention of professor mildmay to lay up for hour two during coming night among rush on margin in hope of securing shot at unicorn failing that anything else worth shooting might happen to present spent quarter of hour preceded in carefully reconnoitring position then retired to cabin to make necessary change into shooting rig before dinner being understood thing that there be obligation upon one to don evening dress if there be good sufficient reason against a in present case although lady made point of doing so meal over after dinner cigar duly smoked sir reginald companion elephant hunter having declared that be too tired to enjoy further sport day professor mildmay bade rest of party good night taking rifle set out for margin of lake a matter of fact ought to have started nearly three hour earlier than did taken up position before for many animal drink almost immediately after sunset before light have entirely gone out of sky hoped to be still in time to get shot hurried on encouraged by sound floated down to from lake telling of animal still there drinking bathing bather be most probably elephant pair decided not to interfere with arguing that after be not ivory hunter object be acquisition of new rare trophy rather than indiscriminate collection of skin horn tusk what not von schalckenberg indeed declared that if must not get unicorn did not want anything progress be slow for although sky be cloudless studded with star beamed with clear mellow radiance brilliancy unknown in more humid atmosphere of temperate zone light that afforded be sufficient only to reveal to two men clump of bush other object close at hand moreover grass be long matted enough to demand expenditure of considerable amount of exertion to force passage through night be close very hot to traverse half mile between ship margin of lake cost therefore nearly twenty minute of toilsome walking at length however professor who a more experienced hunter be leading way murmured ah there be water at last thank goodness now friend must go slow a say be careful where put foot may stumble unawares over something that have desire to meet at quite such close quarter next moment precise thing of have spoken happened foot encountered something bulky firm yielded moved at contact before unfortunate man must utter cry of warning there occurred sudden violent rustling switching of long grass in front of something struck violent blow on shoulder in instant found enveloped in coil of enormous python great head of towered threateningly above a opened wide gaping jaw within foot of face emitted loud sibilant angry hiss hot foetid breath struck full in face in conjunction with overpowering musky smell of body affected with deadly nausea that of be quite sufficient to rob of power of resistance apart from fact that arm be bound to body so tightly by one of immense convolution of serpent body seemed to be nearly a thick a own that be impossible to move by even so little a single inch deadly coil be tightening round too must feel pressure increasing more rapidly than must draw breath into already painfully labouring lung vainly strove to utter cry to companion for help elbow be being forced into rib with such irresistible pressure that momentarily expected to feel hear bone crack beneath while compression of chest be rapidly producing feeling of suffocation when above loud singing in ear caught faint click of mildmay weapon then great threatening head suddenly drooped constricting coil relaxed pressure opened out allowing professor to struggle free of encircling fold huge body writhed convulsively great tail threshing down grass during space of full minute more then writhings gradually subsided finally great reptile lay stretched almost at full length before dead with bullet from mildmay rifle through brain thanks gasped professor a wrung mildmay hand be narrow escape for friend be indebted to for life must hing for even companionship must have be of little avail have not acted so promptly fifteen second in great coil must have finished off altogether thank captain if ever opportunity must occur will do same for of course will old chap know that answered mildmay heartily likely enough opportunity may occur ere long one never know what monster why must measure at least five thirty foot if inch be biggest have ever seen now how do feel must rather go back to ship will go on oh will go on of course answered von schalckenberg be not penny worse for little adventure except feel bruised over expect will be too stiff to move to morrow greater reason why must move to night be not that so friend that of course be for to say laughed mildmay such narrow squeak a have have be enough to try man nerve if must rather go on be man come then said professor let pick step one adventure of kind in single night be enough for man after walking few yard further two men found at edge of dip in lay lake with tall reed fringed margin of water rising dozen yard ahead of surface of lake be just visible in soft sheen of starlight here there at great distance must be descried certain bulky form standing in water from size must only be of elephant while small pattering sound a of falling rain told watcher that great brute be treating to luxury of shower bath elephant be well out from shore standing apparently knee deep in water hence visibility reed be too tall to permit of animal being seen if happened to be drinking at extreme edge of water hunter have made what mildmay characteristically designated bad landfall what desired be to find spot where there be gap in bed of reed through must at least catch glimpse of various beast drinking be in very act of turning to seek spot when von schalckenberg laid hand on mildmay arm whispering excitedly friend look there mildmay glanced in direction indicated saw standing on very crest of bank over have just passed lion that in deceptive starlight appeared to be of enormous proportion be within fifteen foot of be doubtful whether saw for be below within shadow of reed if did not see be quite certain that winded for be gazing straight toward eye shining in darkness like twin moon be slowly sweeping tail from side to side a though asking what strange being be whose scent now greeted nostril for probably first time in life there be time to be lost for even a von schalckenberg whispered to mildmay take beast crouched in preparation for spring mildmay wasted time in argument upon question of hunting etiquette quite understood that professor be offering first shot a trifling recognition of service so lately rendered throwing up rifle to shoulder aimed a well a darkness must permit immediately between inch two above level of eye pulled trigger click of hammer be instantly followed by thud of bullet bulky body hurtled through air knocking mildmay professor right left backward among reed there lay great beast stone dead between just in nick of time murmured professor second must have have one of yes agreed mildmay with zest be not having such bad sport be professor considering that have only just come on ground quite a good a must be expected assented von schalckenberg sport have not be on side friend here have at least have excitement of stalking why surely mean to say that beggar have be stalking ejaculated sailor a surely a that be standing here answered professor be standing exactly in track have undoubtedly be following scent probably crossed on way down here to water be lucky for that did not come up while be engaged with python have done so there must probably have arisen very awkward complication well let get on will have to leave skinning of snake until to morrow morning only hope that jackal will not spoil pelt meanwhile feeling way carefully skirted margin of lake for distance until came to what be seeking namely break in belt of encircling reed be good wide break too nearly hundred yard across a nearly a must guess in uncertain light from down trodden appearance of grass leading to appeared to be favourite drinking place conjecture be confirmed when two hunter have forced way into cover by sight of several vaguely defined form showing at edge of water about fifty yard away settling comfortably in bed of dry reed grass two hunter now concentrated attention upon indistinct stealthily moving object with result that a eye gradually adapted to new condition of light darkness rather became possible for to form sort of opinion a to specie of different animal there congregated together appeared to be chiefly buck of various kind with zebra two none of sportsman thought worth cartridge be therefore permitted to pas to fro unmolested gradually number of animal coming down to drink grew le le until at length more came at spot seemed to be completely deserted then with cessation of coming going vigilance of watcher gradually relaxed thought occurred to mildmay that might a well be getting back to ship made suggestion to von schalckenberg latter pleaded so earnestly for hour two longer urging possibility of visit from unicorn that good natured sailor readily gave way with remark right professor in for penny in for pound mind only suppose fellow must smoke smoke oh answered professor in keen distress at thus being obliged to deny companion solace of pipe do think be not pining for smoke too argued scientist be to do so smell of burning tobacco must scare everything away nothing must come near will fill up with smoke when by by walk back to ship so mildmay settled down a comfortably a must once more never knew when sleep overtook a for professor be quite determined to remain where be until daylight if need be told that unicorn must drink somewhere why not here be a likely place a quite worth watching yes um professor eye closed thought wandered presently too be asleep grey light of dawn be in sky when slumbering pair be startled into instant broad wakefulness by sound of curious barking kind of neigh have heard once in life before recognised in moment by jove gasped professor laying hand upon mildmay arm compressing in vice like grasp unicorn mildmay nodded seizing rifle pair with infinite caution parted veiling reed just sufficiently to afford glimpse in direction from sound have proceeded there within dozen yard of eager gaze fell upon troop of thirty horse well be in appearance like horse one see represented in greek sculpture rather short in body round in barrel with slim elegantly shaped apparently very strong leg carried head high upon thick muscular arching neck stood about fourteen hand high be of beautiful deep cream colour with short black mane black switched tail similar to of gemsbok leg be black from knee downward most remarkable characteristic be that stallion be provided with single straight black sharply pointed horn three foot in length projecting from very centre of forehead two three inch above level of eye be descending slope led down to water be advancing at walk pace being singularly graceful easy leader exceedingly fine handsome animal be yard two in advance of rest with arching neck head carried somewhat low came on peering alertly right left evidently on watch for possible enemy must get pair two pair if can murmured von schalckenberg in low tone rendered hoarse by excitement anxiety take leader stallion will look out for mare aim for just behind shoulder be ready yes breathed mildmay then fire whispered professor a rifle hammer softly clicked thud of bullet be heard leader handsome mare dropped shot through heart troop halted instantly snorting nervously glancing quickly to right left clearly puzzled at sudden unaccountable fall of two of number quick a thought hidden sportsman selected fresh victim ere one must count ten pair of beautiful creature be down be enough unicorn now realised that mysterious deadly influence be at work among throwing up head swerved short round dashed off up slope again over ridge of vanished next moment uttering shrill neigh of alarm two hunter rose to foot shook hand in mutual congratulation at splendid luck ere stepped out from ambush to inspect admire magnificent unique addition to bag animal be superb specimen in perfect condition without blemish coat smooth glossy a satin horn of male long straight tough with point a sharp a of bayonet professor be in perfect ecstasy of delight declared that be supreme moment of life then corrected by saying that moment must arrive when in fulness of time must confront brother fellow of zoological society with skin of pair of unicorn properly prepared set up by ward in confutation of thinly veiled doubt scepticism with certain of have dared to receive former statement of unicorn actually existed that have beheld with own good eye have not scrupled to suggest that possibly might have be mistaken donner und blitzen must still think so when saw skin have have when von schalckenberg next made definite statement must perhaps be le ready to discredit next question be must mildmay be so very obliging a to go back to ship bring to spot where fallen unicorn lay remainder of party especially lady must doubtless like to see just a be ere process of flaying have be begun moreover must need assistance of other men in securing skin to say nothing of of lion possibly python a for von schalckenberg must remain there on guard to protect priceless trophy from depredation injury by vulture wild beast must never leave sight until be safely removed stowed away danger ach what be danger compared with saving of skin in perfect condition besides have rifle abundant supply of cartridge be not afraid very well said mildmay will go away started up slope forthwith leaving professor full in open seated upon body of one of unicorn with pipe in mouth rifle in hand glaring round warily through gold framed spectacle keenly on watch for predatory creature must dare to dispute right of friend to lawful spoil when mildmay reached ship found sir reginald lethbridge sziszkinski already astir taking coffee in dining saloon greeted appearance with shout hillo mildmay exclaimed baronet where have sprung from surely have not be out night yet look a though have luck rather answered mildmay with emphasis yes thanks george to steward will take cup of coffee yes professor have be out night although think really meant to stay so long well where be von schalckenberg then did not come in with interrupted sir reginald answered mildmay left by margin of lake mounting guard over four unicorn unicorn ejaculated lethbridge lucky sailor man surely seriously mean to say that have bagged unicorn four unicorn two male two female one lion python not so bad for one night work be came in sir reginald at professor request to suggest that must move ship over to lake forthwith to give chance to see beast before start to flay also to place under protection of ship so to speak for now that have professor be afraid to take eye off for moment lest something must get at spoil pelt must say so concurred sir reginald right mildmay cut away get bath will take ship over at once whereabouts will find von schalckenberg right at southern end of lake said mildmay ca very well miss look for gap in reed steer for will find there a mildmay retired to cabin to prepare for bath other three men hurried off to pilot house eager to get sight of professor interesting bag a flying fish rose into air occupant of pilot house levelled powerful binoculars upon margin of lake almost immediately lethbridge cried out see there be away to left proudly mounting guard over spoil starboard helm trifle elphinstone so steady a go do see ay said sir reginald see now a again raised glass to eye by jove seems to be busy too surely be using rifle be seems to be observed sziszkinski yes be down on one knee aiming at something have look at lucky man be getting sport surely be lion sprang into air fell back among rush chapter thirteen in heart of great african forest a flying fish settled down quite close to spot where carcase of four unicorn be lying von schalckenberg waved hand shouted to little group on deck ach friend be glad to see unicorn flesh must be especially choice morsel with carnivora in part of country for have be literally beset since mildmay left have have fewer than three lion one leopard whole pack of wild dog disputing with possession of carcase how have dealt with disputant professor laughed lethbridge oh there be one way to deal with took answered professor shot be among rush dog be worst because there be so many of be so persistent drove off at last appear to have have busy time to judge by look of thing exclaimed sir reginald indeed there be abundant evidence of when new arrival came to look more closely for carcase of eight wild dog creature a big a siberian wolf quite a formidable looking be in plain view showing how determinedly have attempted to rush professor while others must be seen partially hidden among reed together with of leopard one of lion well have richly earned breakfast so come aboard have exclaimed lethbridge nothing be likely to interfere with unicorn now that big ship be so close alongside to make quite sure that accident happens will get rifle mount guard up here if like while get bath breakfast so be arranged hour later von schalckenberg entertained other occupant of breakfast table with lively graphic account of adventure of mildmay during night from moment of departure from ship be busy day for five male member of party for of course professor insisted that skin of unicorn must be removed with utmost care observance of precaution against stretching otherwise injuring rather thin delicate hide made task of removal somewhat protracted one when at length be successfully achieved there still remained carcase of four lion one leopard python to be dealt with be consequently well on in afternoon ere somewhat disagreeable task be over men be free to bathe change clothing generally make presentable done flying fish be taken back to former berth on bush encircled area of open ground having be unanimously agreed to spend few day longer in so splendid game country a seemed to be be agreed that after exertion of day be rather too tired to enjoy night watching among reed of lake entire party therefore adjourned to music room for hour two after dinner retired early to cabin to recuperate in readiness for whatever morrow might have in store for for full week party hunted grand game producing district accumulating such pile of lion leopard skin ostrich feather ivory rhinoceros horn other trophy of chase at length sir reginald laughingly protested against further slaughter declaring that unless immediate move be made flying fish must be unable to carry away accumulated cargo reminded companion must doubtless be largely added to ere turned face homeward although sport be good be uneventful there be thrilling adventure hairbreadth escape to record due so mildmay half grumblingly asserted to fact that weapon be so perfect that poor animal have chance to show sport accordingly on morning of certain day great ship once more rose into air in leisurely fashion headed away to southward eastward on way toward ruin of ancient ophir discovered by baronet companion during course of previous voyage of exploration in flying fish proceeding at slow rate of one hundred mile per day with occasional pause where game happened to be sighted that be thought worth while to hunt party arrived on certain evening within sight of vast stretch of forest land extending east west a far a eye must see from moderate elevation of three hundred foot at be travelling von schalckenberg declared be great central african forest discovered by stanley covering area of several thousand square mile of unexplored country home of pygmy gorilla heaven alone knew what other new strange interesting inhabitant offering innumerable possibility to party of determined explorer well said sir reginald be party of determined explorer think may say that if element of personal risk be likely to enter into act of exploration must add to attractiveness of idea must not forget that be not now alone a be upon occasion of last cruise have two woman child with now who be absolutely dependent upon for protection be true that so long a remain shut up in ship little harm can happen to there be also fact that in case of emergency wife know enough to be able to raise ship into air navigate beyond reach of pressing danger be not so sure that in event of such occasion arising must be able to find way back again to starting point after danger have passed a need scarcely point out might prove exceedingly awkward for for especially for who must in such event find stranded without resource with possibility of knowing in direction to look for missing ship decide to do therefore think will be wise to act circumspectly be quite willing to face legitimate danger may be involved in hunting exploring undertaking confess must not be inclined to regard a legitimate such danger a of lady being driven away from given spot lost be perfectly right elphinstone concurred lethbridge gravely presence of lady little ida necessarily imposes certain limitation upon movement be quite easy to imagine dozen more undertaking that might quite justifiably undertake if be alone be not permissible under present circumstance way out of difficulty that have indicated must of course be for one of men who understand working of ship to remain with lady will afford greatest possible pleasure to do so no certainly not by manner of mean old chap struck in mildmay with quite unwonted eagerness if anybody be to remain aboard ship obviously be man to do so for in first place be confoundedly lazy beggar that must be pleasure to to go toiling groping way mile after mile through thick undergrowth of forest like purely upon off chance of stumbling up against something interesting enough to shoot look at while must enjoy nothing better excuse gentleman interposed sir reginald moment reflection think will serve to convince that a host be man who interrupted mildmay that plea wo do at dear fellow be altogether too thin like lethbridge professor to say nothing of colonel sziszkinski must be in element prowling through forest while a for well must not go from choice in case so there be do really mean mildmay demanded sir reginald yes upon honour do assented skipper must confess continued have very strong predilection for clear horizon unimpeded view of sky overhead whether happen to be ashore afloat besides be not a though needed know in case must be very different of course well think have fully made out contention that if be necessary for of to remain aboard be man very well then be settled agreed sir reginald now question that next suggests be be to leave ship here endeavour to penetrate forest from point must take ship into heart of forest use a headquarters from to make short day excursion there be something to be said in favour of plan for example in considering first plan mentioned noticed number of native village a came along two three of be only few mile distant might be possible for to engage number of fellow to serve a bearer to carry impedimenta for cut path through undergrowth so on under such condition must certainly see far more of forest than can possibly hope to do by adopting other plan plan number two on other hand appears to offer better chance to reach heart of forest now what say gentleman plan appeal to more strongly have of alternative to suggest let try second plan if prof unsatisfactory can always fall back upon first said professor so be arranged accordingly on following morning first streak of dawn saw von schalckenberg astir on way to pilot house where first of all manipulated lever controlled grip anchor drawing back thus causing anchor to relinquish hold upon ground then turned sufficient stream of vapour into air chamber to create partial vacuum cause ship to rise in air to height of about two hundred foot above top of most lofty tree finally to set engine going ahead at speed of about fifty mile hour in accordance with arrangement between sir reginald made last thing before turning in on previous night then morning being perfectly calm set course due south returned below to get bath dress for first three hour so of comparatively rapid flight forest be found to be by mean dense tree grew more le in clump with plenty of open space between many of be occupied by native village inhabitant of turned out en masse to gaze in awe at wonderful sight of huge ship rushing through air overhead to greet appearance with weird blood curdling cry beating of great war drum then crossed aruwimi river important tributary of great congo shortly afterward sighting snow crowned summit of ruwenzori glistening in sun here village abruptly ceased forest growth rapidly thickened until with arrival of noon found floating over mass of foliage so dense that be impossible to see anything of ground beneath have by time traversed two hundred fifty mile of forest came to conclusion that be now near enough to heart of for practical purpose therefore slowed ship down to speed of ten knot rose to height of two thousand foot with object of searching for opening in great mass of multi tinted green beneath large enough to receive ship allow to come to earth eventually found ten mile farther south on bank of almost dry stream flowing in westerly direction four mountain peak be then in sight to eastward at estimated distance of between forty fifty mile by time that ship be moored luncheon be on table at conclusion of meal sir reginald elphinstone colonel lethbridge professor colonel sziszkinski took rifle left ship upon what termed preliminary exploration of forest in immediate vicinity very soon discovered that attempt to penetrate forest without aid of ax bush knife must be utterly useless let go in what direction must few yard of laborious struggling through dense undergrowth be certain to bring to spot where thicket became so dense so inextricably tangled that further progress became impossible a last resource therefore tried river here got on very much better water being so low that much of bed be dry by scrambling over boulder great pile of drifted tree trunk tangled scrub be encountered at frequent interval with here there few yard of clear gravel sand upon going be perfectly easy eventually reached open space of twenty acre in extent during rainy season be undoubtedly pool be now merely chaotic agglomeration of rocky outcrop boulder coarse shingle sand in lay half buried further tangled mass of tree trunk branch undergrowth with thread like stream of water twisting hither thither through occasionally widening out into broad willow pool important fact in connection with spot however be that upon careful examination be discovered that several well defined track through forest converged here imprint upon soil of showed that various denizen of forest for many mile round in direction used spot a regular drinking place be obvious at once to that be most favourable spot for ambush that must possibly wish for at length after careful examination of several promising position chose pile of rock near centre of open space against great heap of tangled debris have be piled during flood time a spot where must lie in wait for such game a might come down to drink improved natural advantage of place so far a must in limited time at disposal then hastened back to flying fish to report make preparation for coming night be within hour of sunset when having snatched hasty impromptu meal provided with few sandwich well filled pocket flask a well a liberal supply of cartridge four hunter left flying fish on way to ambush have arranged golden light of evening still gleamed brilliantly upon topmost bough of forest tree down below in river bed twilight be already deepening a quartette made laborious way over many obstacle impeded progress sight of deer two have already made way down to river to drink be reminder to that have time to spare incentive to avoid dawdling on way multitudinous insect life of forest be already awake stirring hum chirp of myriad winged thing causing air fairly to vibrate with softly strident sound to be added rolling chorus of innumerable frog inhabiting marshy low lying patch contiguous to river margin great gorgeously winged dragon fly swept hither thither few belated butterfly of be so large so magnificently marked a to excite professor most enthusiastic admiration fluttered here there in more open space bird of various description of more le brilliant plumage of smaller kind being veritable winged jewel flitted from tree to tree uttering weird startling cry while occasional soft rustling sound in adjoining thicket betrayed movement of larger creature be so nearly dark when four hunter at length reached chosen hiding place that experienced little difficulty in satisfactorily bestowing within when at length have done so there ensued weary wait be exceedingly trying to patience for darkness soon became so profound that although from time to time there came to ear certain slight sound such a sudden swish of bough crackling of withered leaf twig betraying stealthy movement of wild creature must see nothing strain eye a might at length however soft silvery radiance brightening topmost branch of tree encircling proclaimed rising of moon then well advanced toward second quarter a light gradually brightened became aware of certain shadowy form indistinctly seen moving hither thither in deeper shadow of tree whereabouts betrayed by momentary rattle of displaced pebble soft plash of foot in willow pool from drank at length there came moment when perhaps from subtle atmospheric change affecting quality of light suddenly became aware that open space in midst of be ambushed be teeming with animal life forest seemed to be pouring out denizen from quarter of be flocking to spot to quench thirst yonder for example be crowd of buck of dozen more different kind congregated together in one spot more le vigorously hustling other in endeavour to get at most desirable pool while distance away three leopard flattened out upon low overhanging ledge of rock until be scarcely distinguishable lapped water from tiny streamlet trickled past here quite close at hand troop of monkey of various kind size be softly yet fiercely chattering at other a squabbled for best place while others with quick excited gesture ladled up water in palm of hand from drank none of creature however be deemed by lurking hunter a worthy of attention although sziszkinski must fain have have shot at leopard von schalckenberg explained in scarcely audible whisper that everything in sight belonged to well known specie while be avowedly out after only rare specimen leopard therefore be like buck allowed to drink fill retire unmolested now sound of deep grunting snorting accompanied by occasional snap of dried branch gradually separated from became audible above other noise of forest betraying approach of beast scorned concealment presently there emerged into opening huge red buffalo shaggy of hide ferocious of aspect with pair of enormous deep curving horn clattered down narrow shingly boulder strewn bed of river so noisily that monkey fled precipitately with loud shriek of alarm stood fully revealed in small patch of brilliantly white moonlight tossing head sniffing air suspiciously a turned from side to side now boris friend may shoot if will whispered professor eagerly to russian friend that fellow be new to know not head be ach must not understand if explained wait until turn broadside to then aim behind shoulder few breathless moment followed for huge brute persisted in facing little party a drank at length having quenched thirst turned to retreat into forest depth again a did so sziszkinski hammer clicked with low deep moaning sigh great beast sank to earth kicked convulsively for few second be still good ejaculated von schalckenberg be very valuable addition to be silenced by light pressure of sir reginald elphinstone hand upon arm turning saw baronet raise hand point looked in direction indicated in moment frame seemed to stiffen with eagerness a gazed for there standing knee deep in pool two hundred yard away quite alone be animal not unlike giraffe very much smaller with neck although not so long in proportion to body a of giraffe be still very long creature be strongly silhouetted against patch of moon lighted vegetation therefore stood out black against lighter background with indication of marking outline of however be clear cut distinct a professor continued to gaze at became interesting study of growing excitement agitation felt feverishly for binocular glass that have not brought with held breath until must do so no longer letting out suddenly with gasp a suddenly checked glaring through spectacle meanwhile a though must fain hypnotise creature then a bowed head to drink turned to sir reginald whispered huskily shoot friend shoot a love miss for a be sinful man be none other than okapi chapter fourteen lost okapi strange new animal of so much have be heard of late in zoological scientific circle existence of have be so absolutely asserted creature so definitely described by certain traveller of thus far not so much a single bone even fragment of skin have be forthcoming sir reginald instantly recognised supreme importance of securing so pricelessly valuable specimen carefully levelled rifle kneeling on one knee resting elbow on other with nerve a firm steady a steel brought two sight of weapon in one upon spot immediately behind shoulder of creature a nearly a must guess at in awkward light pressed trigger at precise moment small stone under heel slipped jar of movement slight a be communicated to weapon causing sight to swerve slightly out of line expression of intense annoyance escaped lip have missed no a question presented to saw animal throw up head give single bound forward roll over a irrepressible shout of triumph be raised by excited von schalckenberg watcher saw quarry scramble to foot limp off into darkness of forest evidently pretty badly hurt must follow up cried professor eagerly must secure at cost okapi be worth hundred other animal of kind that one can name one be wounded have to follow be certain to find sooner later come friend let lose not moment in pursuing utterly ignoring further idea of concealment forgetting also in excitement of moment imprudence to say least of of attempting to pursue wounded animal through intricacy of dense forest at night communicating excitement to companion by eager exclamation professor led way out of ambush dashing recklessly over rock loose boulder other obstruction in anxiety to arrive quickly at spot where hoped to pick up trail took few minute to find spot at okapi have left water for rock be splashed with blood leaving clear trail toward one of innumerable alley run through forest that debouched upon drinking place have sooner left open entered particular alley along animal have retreated than recognised absolute hopelessness of attempting to follow blood mark without artificial light of sort sir reginald lethbridge indeed with partial return to reasonableness suggested abandonment of chase for night return to flying fish until morning when must come back to spot provided with everything necessary to enable to carry pursuit to successful issue von schalckenberg protested so vehemently against course urging with so much plausibility likelihood that creature must drop exhausted before have run mile that if search for be left until morning that must find of must probably be mangled remains so torn mauled by other animal a to be utterly valueless at others allowed to be persuaded against better judgment so gathering together such dry rush other matter a must be converted into torch lighted with illumination thus obtained proceeded upon quest fresh blood spoor be easily followed for first half mile so at point hope of success be stimulated by sudden scrambling sound at great distance ahead of a though heavy animal have be startled by light of torch noise of approach have hastily betaken to flight encouraged by sound hurried forward presently came upon small puddle of blood form in thick carpet of fern fallen leaf with soil be covered that plainly pointed to fact that wounded animal have here sunk down to rest have only just moved on again last impression be clearly borne out by circumstance even a party bent over spot examining crushed fern be slowly raising again ah ejaculated von schalckenberg a commented upon chase will soon be over will come up with again within next ten minute then will not escape ten minute however became twenty twenty lengthened out to forty still have not overtaken okapi although frequently heard sound at great distance ahead led to believe that be close upon heel have be greatly delayed by constant necessity to pause while renewed torch latterly blood spoor have be steadily growing le distinct appeared that wound have almost ceased to bleed have greatly added to difficulty of pursuit finally blood mark ceased altogether thenceforward must hing press forward along what in uncertain light of torch seemed to be most well defined track finding encouragement for persistency in occasional rustling ahead of at length however also ceased when have be plodding doggedly forward for at least quarter of hour without hearing sound save made by lethbridge called halt look here fellow said want to discourage especially professor think affair have gone quite far enough be bitterly sorry disappointed to be obliged to say think there can be doubt that have lost that okapi whether poor beast have recovered sufficiently to have be enabled to out distance whether on other hand finding hard pressed have made dash ahead then quietly slipped into cover somewhere be not prepared to say be morally convinced that will not see again now if opinion upon matter be same a mine must suggest that turn back forthwith since nothing be to be gained by going farther forward while there be just possibility that may experience difficulty in finding way back out of maze appeared that sir reginald be of same opinion a lethbridge von schalckenberg on other hand be so absolutely certain that be still upon track of okapi that must soon come up with also that there must be difficulty whatever in matter of finding way back that a explained felt quite justified in urging others to continue pursuit pleading at same time folly of giving up now that have come so far done so much result be that sir reginald lethbridge ultimately yielded to professor entreaty baronet with certain amount of inward misgiving lethbridge with resigned shrug of shoulder trail rather what von schalckenberg believed to be trail be accordingly followed for half hour without discovery of further sign of okapi then difficulty arose in connection with torch there be nothing now available for such dry twig branch a must gather from ground adjacent scrub a went while small twig be so exceedingly combustible that be consumed in minute two larger one refused to burn at finally even professor at length very reluctantly came to conclusion that okapi be irretrievably lost that to seek further for must be useless expenditure of time energy with arrival of professor at conclusion admission thereof party at once turned back began to retrace step difficulty with torch increasing a went struggled on for considerable time however von schalckenberg leading way until at length came to small open space in centre of grew enormous mahogany tree with one accord four men came to dead halt regarding other with expression very nearly approaching to consternation have missed way exclaimed sir reginald with decision be certain that never passed that tree on outward journey others be equally convinced of truth of a also of lethbridge terse statement that there be nothing for to try back by way that have come until again hit right path decided that before doing so must endeavour to provide with good supply of torch large quantity of dry twig branch from mahogany tree offering opportunity to do so professor blaming inadequacy of light for mistake in having led into wrong path accordingly spent best part of hour in manner by end of have a many torch of sort a must conveniently carry during period four men have be wandering round round open space in have so unexpectedly found seeking most suitable material for purpose when at length be ready to make fresh start question arose a to precise whereabouts of spot at have entered appeared have own opinion differed from that of others when in order to settle question decided to search for own footprint a guide made disconcerting discovery that imprint be altogether too faint to be traceable by such comparatively inexperienced tracker a furthermore although before entering open space have appeared to that have be following tolerably well defined path run now that came to look for such thing proved impossible to find anything of kind experimental advance of few yard in given direction yielding precisely similar impression final conclusion arrived at be that having once got out of proper track have not be following path at simply making way at haphazard between innumerable patch of underscrub at point sziszkinski interposed with remark offered possible solution of difficulty know not gentleman said whether of took particular notice of appearance of mahogany tree at moment when entered enclosure recollection of be that a first became aware of presence that big lower limb extended almost at right angle to track pointing to left carrying memory back to moment think must have be standing here hereabout placing in position to illustrate remark facing way if be correct that a faced right about pointed must be about point at entered with memory thus jogged other three men presently came to conclusion that russian be right starting afresh upon assumption instituted further still closer search for own spoor eventually finding certain faint indefinite indentation in carpet of withered leaf agreed must be own footprint following faint indication a well a must now pushed forward eagerly for sir reginald have by time become seriously apprehensive that might not get back to flying fish by breakfast time in case knew that left behind on board must quickly become alarmed suffer much distress at non appearance of absentee gratifying assurance that be going right be afforded wanderer about hour after departure from mahogany tree by discovery of charred remains of one of torch have helped to light on way discovery put fresh heart into little party for if have come thus far all right there be reason told why must not keep right soon hit track back to drinking place then found charred brand now quite happy in assurance that be passing back over ground that have already traversed pressed forward light heartedly enough until after lapse of nearly half hour lethbridge again damped ardour by saying look here fellow doe strike that be going little too fast must be nearly hour since passed remains of last torch have not yet seen have of because if have be going wrong again best of thing only lasted about ten minute know be perfectly true inference drawn by ex colonel be so obvious that without pausing to discus matter at once wheeled round proceeded to retrace step although one of felt convinced that be really going back again over precisely same ground that have already traversed that last relic of torch be not again encountered at length having wandered on for hour more in hope of getting back to mahogany tree from to make fresh start alarming conviction forced upon that be lost utterly lost in great illimitable african forest be afraid there be doubt about said lethbridge when little later party have come to halt in perplexity grim truth have found expression in word that being case think best thing can do be to sit down for imagine that be beginning to feel trifle fagged nibble sandwich two washing down with nip from flask a discus situation of course remarked sir reginald when have seated produced refreshment although be rather awkward adventure there be need for to feel alarm apprehension be certain to extricate sooner later think may take for granted that be not likely to starve so long a have cartridge left thing worry be anxiety that friend aboard flying fish will suffer when fail to turn up in decent time yes certainly be worst feature of case agreed lethbridge because of course will know that something have happened to detain will not know what be there be always tendency among woman to imagine worst must not matter so much if possessed mean of communicating with for although must not perhaps direct mildmay how to find must at event keep advised of welfare suppose continued turning with smile to von schalckenberg happen to posse power of telepathy do professor answered professor unhappily remark have suggested to idea of little experiment will attempt when get back to ship if must prove successful may help on subsequent occasion similar to present question be how be to get back to ship well remarked sir reginald appears to that can not do anything more until daylight be lost in forest have not at present slightest notion a to direction ought to take think be indisputable be useless to shut eye to fact may therefore a well stay here a anywhere rest until daylight be now just half past four will therefore not have very long to wait now a to position know that left river by way of south bank since have not again touched must still be somewhere to southward of therefore if when daylight come head northward be certain to strike river before long once there ought not to meet with much difficulty in finding ambush again from of course can easily find way back to ship excellent thoroughly well reasoned out remarked lethbridge quite agree with elphinstone can not do better than remain here until daylight a say then with coming of sunrise will get at point of compass know way to steer in order to hit off river again professor colonel sziszkinski also agreed that sir reginald plan be good one therefore settled comfortably with aid of pipe beguiled time a best must moon have set hour before forest be consequently plunged in darkness so profound that be impossible to see anything beyond immediate surroundings be illuminated for space of four five yard by flickering light of torch silence also be profound for buzzing chirr of insect life of place have long since ceased only occasional crackle of dry leaf twig betrayed fact that great solitude held other denizen than at length however when watch marked hour of seven be became aware of dim ghostly light filtering down upon from above stealthily revealing presence of tree trunk twisted creeper tangled underscrub at gradually widening distance from whereupon charged lighted pipe afresh extinguished torch after allowing few minute longer to enable eye to become accustomed to dim sombre twilight that alone pervaded illimitable forest aisle set out upon course agreed must ultimately lead back to river course be anything straight one for be obliged to wind hither thither between around enormous mass of tangled impenetrable undergrowth there be many occasion when be compelled to go little distance in direction very opposite of wished to follow ere must again hit off practicable path leading northward yet notwithstanding began to feel disappointment recurrence of anxiety when at eleven o'clock in forenoon still seemed a far off a ever from finding river there be nothing for however to press forward a be going did in somewhat noisy fashion for there seemed to to be very especial reason for silence until there suddenly broke upon ear deep hollow drumming sound speedily followed by series of loud fierce roar sound emanated from somewhere close at hand after moment instinctive pause to listen with one accord hastened forward to investigate with result that suddenly found emerging from cramped gloomy environment of forest depth into comparatively open arena roughly circular in shape nearly mile in diameter thickly carpeted with rich lush grass sparsely dotted with tree a wanderer entered space saw about dozen yard away very fine gorilla upreared with back toward fiercely beating chest with huge fist giving vent to succession of savage barking roar exciting cause of exhibition of anger be not at first apparent presently little party of interested witness caught sight of dark object nearly hidden in grass a watched object detail gradually revealed recognised a animal of leopard specie of about same size a ordinary leopard similarly marked save that tint of skin instead of being tawny yellow be rich brown approaching very nearly to chocolate look what animal be that ejaculated professor in husky whisper know be new to new specie gorilla too what splendid specimen von schalckenberg fell suddenly silent constrained thereto by interest in impending drama for be evident that leopard meditated attack upon gorilla great cat be crouching low in grass with ear laid back flat to head savage eye gleaming with hate a watched movement of antagonist tail twitching jerkingly now to side now to that gorilla meanwhile a fully alert a leopard be advancing craftily toward single pace at time with apparent intention of getting within leaping distance then suddenly springing upon foe leopard however appeared to be fully aware of enemy intention also of how to frustrate for remained patiently crouching until gorilla be in very act of pulling together for leap then at psychological moment sprang high into air leaping clear clean over gorilla head landing yard so in rear then before huge creature have time to recover from astonishment at such extraordinary tactic leopard again gathered together for spring be in moment on gorilla back with teeth deeply sunk in back of creature neck while with terrible claw dug tore at gorilla throat so completely be latter taken by surprise that seemed utterly incapable of striking blow in self defence instead simply threw up long hairy tremendously muscular arm staggered backward pace two fell to earth moaning groaning horribly a clasped terribly lacerated throat with hand leopard having meanwhile leaped nimbly aside crouched afresh a enemy fell be evident however that there be more fight left in gorilla creature be beyond doubt mortally injured lay there moaning piteously with blood streaming through finger making attempt to regain foot enemy at length seemed to realise for after remaining crouched watching for three four minute rose to foot began to slink away be promptly stopped laid low by shot from sir reginald rifle while lethbridge cautiously approaching prostrate gorilla sent bullet through skull thus put out of misery now must push on again exclaimed sir reginald know professor whether not wish to have of skin if do must wait until get back to ship then come look for can not spare time to take now cumber with when taken now gentleman be noon there be sun be on meridian consequently due north of certainly doe not cast very long shadow cast enough to show that yonder lie path so forward path happened to lead almost directly through centre of wide open space going being easy quickly traversed plunged again into forest shadow on other side where slow toilsome groping style of progress be resumed for three long hour struggled on weary now beyond power of expression often in grave doubt a to whether be pursuing right direction moment growing more seriously disconcerted at extraordinary circumstance that although during day must have journeyed many more mile than have during previous night still failed to reach river for be aiming at length quite late in afternoon again unexpectedly emerged from forest into open space very similar in size appearance to one in have witnessed combat between gorilla leopard a stood for moment in open blinking dazzled eye in strong unaccustomed sunshine in vain effort to classify several object moving motionless that saw dotted about plain shout reached ear answered by dozen more then became aware of sound of lowing cattle presently a eye adjusted to sudden change in light condition recognised that be on outskirt so to speak of native village that inhabitant whose quick eye have detected presence upon instant of emergence from forest be already mustering with spear shield in unquestionably menacing fashion chapter fifteen forest adventure native savage at remarked lethbridge taking in situation in instant now fellow continued game be to show bold front to get well into open straight away so that none of black friend yonder can slip round under cover of forest take at close quarter in rear chap may be perfectly harmless peaceable confess look be wise thing to be prepared for worst now professor here be opportunity for to come out strong be acquainted with end of african lingo be not better lose time in conveying to intelligence fact that be friend that if be prepared to supply with food drink shakedown for night to pilot to river to morrow will graciously refrain from annihilating will have to do quick old chap for look remarkably a though be about to make uncommonly ugly demonstration against did indeed for even while lethbridge have be speaking black have gathered to extent of three four hundred armed with shield spear supplemented in many case by heavy club with big knotted head thickly studded with formidable spike be now arranging in kind of crescent formation a though to attack surround four white men von schalckenberg walked up to seized small leafy branch projecting low down from trunk of tree close at hand wrenched off then raising above head boldly advanced toward threatening phalanx be already moving forward must stick close to exclaimed lethbridge who by tacit consent have assumed direction of affair in crisis must not allow to be cut off from will never see again german boldly advanced waving aloft symbol of peace shouting in a many of african dialect a must call to mind that be friend assurance however if understood appeared to be quite unconvincing to put mildly attitude of native growing momentarily more hostile menacing a though mere sight of white man stirred worst passion to lowest depth halt cried lethbridge in low tense voice fellow be about to make rush form up in line moment start to run open fire upon keep up if let get within striking distance of be done for whether not sudden halt of quartette conveyed to native mind mistaken impression that white men be afraid whether be that lethbridge intuition have rightly interpreted already fixed determination be impossible to say fact remains that a four white halted in line gigantic savage sprang to front waving shield spear above head shouted few word to others a started to run toward little band will take leader rest of fire into brown cried lethbridge levelling rifle a word left lip click click of rifle hammer sounded leading savage three others stumbled fell prone to earth shield spear flying from nerveless hand ere be fairly down four others rolled over lay motionless followed by yet four until within brief space of twenty second fewer than forty black warrior lay prostrate dead badly wounded have happened merely because four terrible white men have pointed at with long straight shining stick there have be no fire smoke no noise white men have simply pointed at lo forty of best men be down native mind be quick in appreciation of hard logic of fact by time that forty warrior be prostrate have assimilated conviction that inhabitant of village have rashly embarked upon distinctly unhealthy enterprise when undertook seductive pastime of attempting to massacre apparently insignificant little band of white men at point in drama whole shouting yelling crowd suddenly became silent pulled up short a four more of number dropped flung on face to earth grovelling howling loudly for mercy only just in nick of time too so far a white men be concerned for have courage of savage lasted long enough to carry further fifty yard must have arrived within striking distance most distinguished scientist in person of professor heinrich von schalckenberg must have be wiped out three friend with ah ejaculated sir reginald be touch go ' with mistake now professor if can make understand just ask what dickens mean by attacking white men in gratuitous light hearted fashion then explain to that have desire at to do slightest harm if will behave civilly to professor raised hand called in dozen different dialect for silence whereupon one of savage presently rose to foot delivered of few remark in tone of highly injured individual then followed quite lengthy dialogue between professor at conclusion of latter turning to friend explained fellow who call besusa tribe luewi informs so far a can comprehend that attacked because time ago can not make out how long people wearing long beard like ourselves came here stole large number of young men luewi when saw mistook for same thief come back upon man stealing expedition promptly determined to nip in bud quite right of too agreed sir reginald have better explain to professor that be unwise of to jump to conclusion with such lightning like rapidity a have just exhibited also that white men be by mean of slave dealer take be what other fellow be by way did mention that be tired hungry wish to be guided to river not yet answered professor friend besusa be so busy explaining apologising for attack upon have not yet have chance will though at once then ensued long palaver between von schalckenberg savage excessive length being due a former explained to difficulty experienced by principal in understanding other at length however turned to friend explained situation to with result that four white men be ultimately invited to enter village partake of refreshment remain there for night upon understanding that guide to river must be furnished to next morning right agreed sir reginald will go to village sample hospitality a to remaining with for night must confess at like idea friend aboard flying fish will already have suffered several hour of cruel anxiety on account be unwilling to prolong anxiety moment longer than be necessary why will not let have guide forthwith surely river can not be so very far away von schalckenberg tried again without success fellow speaks such barbarous dialect find almost impossible to understand explained professor informs that for reason other be out of question for to go forward to day hm commented sir reginald do think professor that people be to be trusted be there deep scheme to get into power behind reluctance to help to go forward evening know answered professor speaks fairly enough one can never tell treachery so far from being crime almost amount to virtue under certain circumstance with african savage must confess have noticed one two little thing to seemed to bear rather sinister significance what can do can not take besusa by scruff of neck insist upon becoming guide to river can not cut in lethbridge dryly be by mean so sure of idea have just occurred to mildmay will have be on look out for sign of at least from breakfast time to day if know anything of be still looking out will continue to do so until darkness set in perhaps even later now idea be be sorry that did not occur to earlier in day here be four lost men in fine open space with ample room to light four fire at considerable distance apart evening be fine there be wind smoke from fire must rise to considerable height into air now if mildmay must happen to notice four distinct column of smoke rising above tree top of course interrupted von schalckenberg must at once connect with must come in flying fish to investigate will be done at once turning away forthwith entered into energetic conversation with besusa ultimately resulted in savage giving certain instruction to friend who after tremendous amount of palaver interspersed with frequent reference from besusa to professor at length set to work to gather four large pile of branch dry leaf other combustible proceeded to arrange on spot indicated by von schalckenberg a soon a pile be of sufficient size to yield good dense body of smoke be simultaneously ignited by four white men by simple agency of ordinary match to intense astonishment admiration of black then quartette sat down patiently to await event while besusa friend incited thereto by professor continued to pile upon fire further quantity of grass green branch other thing calculated to produce maximum quantity of smoke result be that in few minute four distinct column of brownish grey smoke be going up straight into sky hundred of foot above top of highest tree finally spreading out mingling into one great cloud must be distinctly visible in atmosphere anywhere within distance of twenty mile lethbridge leaned back on elbow contemplated four tall smoke column with expression of very considerable satisfaction ought to prove effective be prepared to bet that will within next quarter of hour remarked what be talk about professor seemed to have difficulty in persuading fellow to build fire thought yes admitted von schalckenberg have fact be that for reason understand besusa be very anxious that must remain in village night since have already discovered that force will not avail with be now trying guile understands perfectly well of thing say to when told that wanted guide to lead to river professed to be unable to understand clearly replied by gabbling what believe to be simply lot of gibberish ending up with statement that will be able to have guide to morrow fact be that rather suspect of entertaining desire to posse of rifle believe to be capable to going to considerable length to get hence extreme anxiety to keep here night therefore when found that there be hope of persuading to let have guide to night informed that be four very great powerful witch doctor a must already have seen that if wished to remain in village night to night must be necessary to light four large fire one for of to propitiate evil spirit so that must not enter village during night destroy of inmate well exclaimed lethbridge will be very greatly surprised disappointed too if in very few minute see evil spirit will considerably astonish ah hurrah there be good old mildmay felt certain that must be on look out so saying sprang to foot waved handkerchief energetically in direction of great conical shape that gleaming flashing like burnished silver in ray of setting sun at moment hove in sight over tree top on north western margin of enclosure three white clad figure be standing in bow of superstructure examining open space through binoculars a lethbridge waved handkerchief waved in return while one smallest be seen to run excitedly aft dart into pilot house savage also saw portentous apparition fled howling with abject terror to shelter of hut while flying fish sweeping gracefully round came to earth within few foot of spot where four white men stood awaiting arrival minute later besusa watching four white men from beneath pile of skin heaped up just within doorway of hut saw walk in under huge mysterious thing have just descended from cloud inexplicably disappear great be rejoicing of left on board flying fish at safe return of truant equally great perhaps be joy of truant at finding re united to companion once more amid familiar surroundings of luxurious travelling home first brief greeting over returned wanderer retired below indulged in luxury of bath after dressed for dinner be while party be gathered round dinner table hour two later that sir reginald related adventure of companion during preceding twenty four hour be shocking bad luck that must have lost that okapi after remarked mildmay with sympathy of true sportsman a sir reginald brought narrative to close however continued be something to have learned that be in okapi region perhaps will be more successful next time be unless sir reginald be anxious to get away from here sir reginald strenuously disavowed such anxiety asserting on contrary be quite willing to remain where be for reasonable length of time to take turn turn about on alternate night to watch at drinking place until have succeeded in securing specimen of so interesting rare animal then inquired in what manner occupant of flying fish have passed day well answered mildmay speaking for lady be not until breakfast time that began to feel in least degree anxious about even then anxiety rather mine be not very acute for a explained to lady might have have exceptionally good sport be anxious to save skin before leaving to return to ship when eleven o'clock arrived with news of felt convinced that something have gone wrong then felt ourselves to be in dilemma for there be only two course open to first to stay where be await return secondly to go in search of by adopting first alternative must be on spot where must naturally expect to find if detention must happen to be merely of ordinary nature if having happened to encounter body of hostile savage must be holding at bay while retiring upon ship may tell that be recognition of such possibility a made feel very reluctant to leave spot where be on other hand however there be equal possibility that might be beset otherwise needing help at spot several mile away therefore compromised matter a best must by simply raising ship three hundred foot in air keeping bright look out in direction day when saw four column of smoke rise up from among tree did take above two second to make up mind that have lighted fire must find alongside following morning witnessed departure of flying fish from open space in be situated village profound be relief of savage friend a from obscurity of interior of hut watched enormous shining mass by by saw quietly rise into air a of own volition go gently driving out of sight over tree top hour later having located other open space in have be witnessed attack upon gorilla by leopard ship quietly descended into hunter refreshed by sound night sleep sallied forth secured skin of animal proved to be quite uninjured by depredation of other animal none of seemed to have approached then flying fish again rose into air wended way back to original berth be while be thus passing from one spot to other that mystery be solved of difficulty four lost men have experienced in endeavour to find river thus make way back to ship for in order to satisfy upon point traveller rose to height of five thousand foot into air from altitude not only got sight of drinking place at adventure may be said to have begun be also enabled to trace course of river thus discovered that about mile to eastward of drinking place river made s like bend eighteen mile across also instead of wandering steadily south a believed have be while in pursuit of wounded okapi must have gradually trended away toward east until have gone mile beyond double bend in river hence failure to find stream again that same night a keen a ever to get okapi four hunter again sallied out for previous ambush determined to make utmost of waxing moon nightly rode sky upon arriving at drinking place found to von schalckenberg intense disgust that carcase of red buffalo have be so mauled torn a to render hide utterly useless have compensation little later for during night secured fewer than five handsome leopard have evidently come down to feast upon flesh be before night be over professor have satisfaction of shooting very fine handsome black white monkey of hitherto unknown specie while lethbridge be made happy by addition to bag of magnificent white rhinoceros creature so rare that many distinguished naturalist have pronounced extinct to keen disappointment okapi made appearance at drinking place night yet persevered lying out night after night resting during day at length on ninth night after adventure in pursuit of original animal patience be splendidly rewarded pair of okapi making appearance at drinking pool very late after other animal have come gone again there be exciting tantalising ten minute while animal stood in full light of moon drank one of being immediately behind other so that be impossible to shoot then male having drunk fill before mate have quite finished wheeled moved yard two a did so hammer of lethbridge professor rifle clicked simultaneously great cheer rang out from ambushed party a two animal dropped lay motionless then four men rose to foot regardless of possibility that might thus be scaring away other desirable specimen scrambled over boulder other obstacle until stood beside prey then having admired to heart content singular creature a lay eager hunter drew knife proceeded to take skin forthwith determined to leave nothing to chance morning chapter sixteen among ruin of ancient ophir next few day be devoted by men of party to arduous somewhat unpleasant task of completing preparation for packing skin have taken then after rather late breakfast on certain morning flying fish again rose into air winging way leisurely hundred foot so above top of forest tree headed to southward eastward morning of second day saw clear of forest sweeping over fine open country sparsely dotted here there with detached clump of bush over roamed immense herd of buck antelope troop of zebra giraffe other animal few elephant ostrich innumerable saw nothing tempting enough to delay so went drifting quietly along day after day coming to earth only at night in order that might miss nothing of multitudinous interesting sight that country have to offer until at length one day at noon mildmay announced that according to reckoning be exactly fifty mile from site of ancient ophir indeed there be reason to doubt statement on contrary voyager have hour earlier imagined that recognised certain spot have be rather more distinctly impressed than others upon memory during former visit for example a flying fish went driving gently along over somewhat rugged well wooded country with numerous stream winding hither thither like silver thread sighted native village distance ahead of sir reginald remarked to lethbridge who be standing beside examining scene at large through binoculars surely lethbridge be identical village from first noticed curious system of voice telegraphy in vogue among people hereabout by mean of sent forward news of arrival on occasion of last visit look not at unlike answered lethbridge with binoculars still at eye anyway will soon see added for somebody have spotted already there come entire population of place turning out to look at yes there go mounted man a hard a nag can lay leg to ground doubtless to shout message will watch ex colonel relapsed into silence for few minute then resumed yes elphinstone be quite right that mounted fellow have just pulled up raised hand to mouth now listen lady olivia do hear anything yes lady olivia heard with singular distinctness sound of high pitched voice shouting certain word of course must not understand syllable of be so slowly clearly articulated that must easily have written down there be man who be uttering remarked lethbridge that little dot on hill two mile away doubt if can make out with naked eye be a much a can manage although know exactly where to look for can see ida mlle sziszkinski oh a turned round made discovery mildmay have emerged from pilot house have by occult process drawn mademoiselle away from rest of party to side lady olivia smiled have ever occurred to colonel said that very pretty little romance be gradually unfolding here in small circle well replied lethbridge with smile lighted up somewhat saturnine feature in marvellous manner must confess that there have be moment when have have suspicion will be by mean sorry if suspicion turn out to be well founded for be exceptionally charming girl a good a be charming feel sure while a for mildmay well be one of very few men whom thoroughly admire esteem yes assented lady olivia must make handsome pair must that answered with laugh be so obvious that need confirmation from what further might have said upon so interesting subject lady olivia be not destined to know for at moment interruption came from sir reginald who exclaimed look yonder lethbridge do see that there be village from troop of native cavalry turned out to dispute passage when last came way will be shot if fellow have not turned out again do see drawn up there on ridge lethbridge turned binoculars in direction indicated by friend presently saw body of mounted warrior armed with bow spear shield drawn up in two division one on side of track over flying fish be heading to pas formation be such a to suggest that actually again intended to oppose passage of ship yes be right see answered lethbridge think lady olivia must be advisable for to retire from deck until have passed fellow be just possible that stray arrow might reach deck here with unfortunate consequence to one of lady can observe everything almost a well from below permit come along little sweetheart to ida let go below watch what happens from cabin window mildmay do see old friend black troop of horseman yonder be taking lady olivia ida below out of harm way so saying conducted charge down into dining saloon placed at one of port thick glass window of closed while mildmay followed with mlle sziszkinski a turned out precaution be needle for presently a ship swept past above between two body of native horseman latter instead of greeting strange visitant with shower of arrow a before straightened on horse at signal from leader raised right arm above head in salute shouted in deep chested unison single word bietu then at signal wheeled right left a one man at break neck gallop dashed along on side of ship forming kind of escort guard of honour a long a must keep pace with sun be within hour of setting when hilly country over flying fish be sweeping gave place to wide stretching level plain grass grown with here there occasional isolated clump of bush small grove of graceful palm irregular patch of tall feathery bamboo acre so of wild plantain further on occasional field of maize sugarcane faint blue level streak on far eastern horizon indicated close proximity to sea while certain shapeless irregularity began to show up against narrow streak of blue insensibly resolved a ship sped onward into vast assemblage of enormous column isolated in group still upreared perpendicular others prostrate broken remains of great temple other building that judging from elaborate splendid carved work of ruined entablature fallen capital crumbling arch massive cornice mutilated statue must long age ago have formed part of city of extraordinary extent magnificence flying fish came to earth on a von schalckenberg asserted identical spot upon have rested on occasion of former visit in very midst of vast ruined city little company of traveller on board spent never to be forgotten hour on deck watching in ecstasy of delight constantly changing magical effect of light shade colour a sun went down in blaze of glory lighting up with departing beam stupendously imposing marvellous remains of ancient ophir a party sat round dinner table that evening sir reginald entertained that portion of who have not then be present with recital of what have occurred on occasion of ship previous visit to interesting spot arrived here said about hour of sunset after dinner spent very enjoyable evening in music room retiring to cabin about midnight suspecting fearing evil of sort when rose next morning went out on deck for turn before breakfast lethbridge very quickly discovered that ship be beset by hundred of savage who be lurking in long grass crouching behind numerous small clump of bush flowering shrub surrounded may possibly have noticed while be watching sunset effect upon ruin evening naturally regarded fact of beleaguerment with perfect equanimity for felt that so long a remained in ship be absolutely safe except perhaps from stray arrow two to danger however attached very little importance having come here with specific object of examining ruin be of course necessary that must establish sort of understanding with native get on friendly term with so after have finished breakfast finding that savage be still ambushed about professor arranged with little programme devised for purpose of duly impressing with tremendous power wonderful attribute then when everything be ready von schalckenberg advanced to gangway in most imposing accent demanded to know who be chief in command of warrior who have assembled to pay homage to four spirit of wind meaning of course mildmay lethbridge professor a suppose know be practically universal linguist by stroke of good luck happened to hit at first shot upon dialect fellow be able to understand so can picture to yourselves amazement at being asked question finding actually confronted with such mysterious terrible being a spirit sprang to foot a one man recognising futility of further attempt at concealment chief named lualamba came forward modestly acknowledged to be leader of band forthwith be invited to come up on deck talk to rope ladder being lowered to ground for accommodation came in manifest fear trembling feeling quickly converted into one of delight by investing with necklace of glass bead mantle consisting of piece of flowered chintz then proceeded to question fellow presently learned from that be emissary of certain m'bongwele in whose territory now be king of fierce cruel jealous disposition a gathered so suspicious of stranger that have issued standing order against admission into country of such under certain gruesome pain penalty be by order that lualamba warrior have come out on previous night for purpose of slaying mysterious monster have be seen flying so fearlessly impudently over sacred territory there be doubt that lualamba be for savage exceedingly shrewd fellow be not very long ere detected in evident desire to lure four spirit of wind into presence perchance power of master m'bongwele who informed must be highly gratified by visit from such celestial being might be sentiment with regard to mere men be not so easily to be have however in accent of grave reproof professor pointed out to lualamba that be inconsistent with dignity to pay visit even to so great potentate a m'bongwele that on contrary be be duty to show appreciation of condescension in entering country by paying visit within next few hour for purpose of rendering homage to finally lualamba might be properly impressed with power took for short excursion into air then sent back humbled frightened profoundly impressed savage to make report to master urge upon very great desirability of paying duty call upon forthwith having at length got rid of lualamba professor made few simple little preparation for subjugation of great m'bongwele hour however passed began to fear that lualamba have failed in somewhat delicate difficult mission wherewith have entrusted at length somewhere about four o'clock in afternoon saw cavalcade of five hundred fully armed magnificently mounted warrior approaching headed by individual riding very fine coal black horse clad in lion skin mantle short petticoat of leopard skin gold crown trimmed with flamingo feather necklace of lion teeth claw with long narrow shield of rhinoceros ' hide on left arm sheaf of light casting spear in hand imposing person rightly judged to be none other than m'bongwele in few minute whole cavalcade charging down upon divided into two wheeling right left reined up stood motionless a so many bronze statue within few yard of ship then m'bongwele fine very stout man rather laboriously dismounted after hesitation came on board now be very necessary for to remember while listening to what be about to tell that man with whom be dealing be crafty unscrupulous savage that have entered territory with certain definite purpose in pursuit of be imperative that must be able to go to fro freely without fear of interference direct indirect from a be only four men while subject numbered several thousand owing most absolute obedience perfectly ready willing to wipe out ' at word from only chance of accomplishing what wanted to do lay in ability to impress man follower with profound conviction that be something more than mere mortal that attempt on part to interfere with must inevitably be followed by consequence of direst description to people at large personally in pursuance of scheme von schalckenberg have a have said made certain arrangement after little desultory talk with m'bongwele proceeded to carry out first impression desired to produce upon king be that of invulnerability to injury with object produced little red rosette offered to attach to portion of own person then allow m'bongwele to shoot arrow at a at target here dark monarch crafty disposition manifested for evidently suspecting that whole thing have be prearranged insisted on fastening rosette to lethbridge breast instead of of professor there be nothing for of course to assent be for ever discredited in eye of king follower lethbridge very good naturedly submitted more readily perhaps since von schalckenberg have insisted a measure of precaution upon donning suit of aethereum chain mail under clothes will guess result m'bongwele shot arrow shaft pierced rosette then fell splintered to deck to confusion of king awe struck surprise of immediate following who be grouped round then aided by little skilful management on mildmay part entire escort be induced to attempt to lift flying fish off ground when have failed one only of number be bidden to do same thing to unmitigated amazement one man not only accomplished task with ease also tossed so high in air that m'bongwele chief included went right out to sea until land be completely lost sight of seemed almost to complete majesty subjugation for sooner found out of sight of land than grovelled abjectly at von schalckenberg foot promised anything everything that asked of if must take back home again professor however have still card up sleeve when at length returned to spot from have started by time be nearly dark played ordered number of m'bongwele warrior to build large fire not very far from ship when be well alight throwing out dense cloud of smoke friend von schalckenberg used smoke a magic lantern screen upon projected two picture first showing m'bongwele warrior at moment when halted ship upon arrival from village earlier on in afternoon photographed by mildmay developed printed during trip out to sea second coloured slide showing review of number of own british troop a may imagine reduced king only temporarily a proved to condition of servile submission went home night humble terrified man later got even with for time at least for while pretending to assist in exploration of ruin by lending number of woman to do such digging a required got old hag to drug coffee one day while be lying insensible have carried up to village matter looked rather bad for for few day eventually contrived to escape how must tell other time then deposed banished putting man named seketulo in place if event have gone well with fellow have doubt will have visit from to morrow morning chapter seventeen evil tidings when after breakfast on following morning party on board flying fish stepped out on deck to enjoy novel scene around take ease under awning while awaiting expected visit from seketulo at once became aware of fact that ship be centre of area of considerable activity for glancing round from commanding height of deck be able with assistance of binoculars to detect form of armed savage stealing hither thither through long grass between numerous clump of bush with plain be thickly overgrown first thought be that seketulo have proved false to trust that have reposed in be repeating folly of predecessor m'bongwele by engaging in attempt to capture ship a continued to watch with curiosity movement of savage idea became dissipated for although savage be everywhere in evidence about in large number there be none in immediate vicinity of ship neighbourhood of indeed appeared to be avoiding with most studious care at watcher arrived at two distinct conclusion first of be that savage be prosecuting feverishly eager anxious search for person person second that while doing so be practising precaution guile of native mind must suggest to escape observation from ship what on earth can fellow be up to remarked sir reginald at length a removed binoculars from eye turned to address other member of party be by chance hunting for think under impression that have left ship be taking morning stroll among ruin be by mean impossible answered lethbridge of one thing at event believe may be certain be that friend seketulo have intention of paying duty call have meant to do so must have be here before now perhaps have not yet be made aware of presence here suggested sziszkinski make mistake about retorted lethbridge saw yesterday afternoon sending forward by mean of system of voice telegraphy news of arrival a be travelling slowly time may take a certain that seketulo if fellow happens to be still alive be informed of fact time before actually reached spot even if admit for moment such improbability a that news failed to reach fellow who be now lurking round be one of painfully aware of presence of ship a can clearly see by trouble that be taking to keep out of sight first thing that must do in case a have suggested must be to dispatch one of number to village with news oh king whether be seketulo somebody else be fully aware of presence here may rest assured of course said sir reginald seketulo may be dead be several year since be here much may happen in even le time than even so man who must be reigning in stead must know about must hasten one must suppose to assure of loyalty to command ay cut in mildmay provided of course that have be loyal if have not can quite conceive that be feeling mightily uncomfortable just now what think elphinstone of idea of taking cruise up to village to see how matter stand there must rather remain here await development hillo whom have here what doe want surely fellow be signalling to trying to attract attention d see elphinstone a mildmay spoke pointed to small magnolia bush within about hundred yard of ship on hither side of close under native warrior be crouching occasionally raising hand a though endeavouring to attract attention of white men who from position occupied be in full view of where be demanded sir reginald searching with glass oh see yes certainly seems to be signalling to do see professor yes answered von schalckenberg see will beckon to come to by mean answered sir reginald will get out rope ladder will have up here on deck went off to get up light rope ladder intended for use upon occasion when be deemed politic to conceal fact that mean of ingres to ship existed by way of trap door leading out of diving chamber while von schalckenberg advanced to guard rail by gangway raising hand above head proceeded to make certain mysterious signal to crouching savage effect of be at once apparent for savage after carefully concealing shield spear in foliage of adjacent bush flung prone be at once lost to sight in long grass minute two later head reappeared for moment at spot much nearer to ship with double object apparently of verifying direction of progress allowing on board flying fish to see that be obeying behest by time that rope ladder have be fixed in position at lower extremity of light openwork metal gangway ladder be permanently fixed to ship side savage be close enough to be spoken to professor called down to to ascend without fear native fine stalwart bronzed figure of savage naked save for usual front rear apron of skin usually worn by needed second bidding instantly sprang at ladder up shinned with agility of monkey drawing up after moment that have reached top then having carefully coiled down upon bottom step of permanent ladder ascended latter to deck stepping in through gangway halted a raised right hand above head in salute with single word bietu von schalckenberg looked man up down for moment taking in such detail of scanty costume a fact that apron be of leopard skin that wore necklace of lion leopard claw round finely modelled neck also that body limb showed scar of several wound came to conclusion that chief of importance stood before speak said professor addressing in dialect that have found effective on occasion of previous visit of party to ophir have somewhat to say to be not so be even so o great spirit answered savage be lobelalatutu chief of great makolo nation four spirit of wind condescended to visit many moon ago be present when king be banished seketulo be made king in stead behold for space of three rain three dry season half of fourth thing went very well with nation people be happy for seketulo ruled wisely well according to precept of four spirit witch doctor be discredited there be torturing a punishment if man transgressed be banished unless transgression be very great then head be struck off in great place before king palace then behold on certain day when chief be gathered together in great place a usual to take king command be m'bongwele who came forth to from palace instead of seketulo m'bongwele spoke saying that have grown weary of remaining in exile that heart yearned for people who be being changed into woman under seketulo mild rule be growing poor because no longer made war upon neighbour took spoil therefore have returned to to restore nation again to former greatness then turned to who be within palace bade bring forth seketulo when be done lo be be body that brought forth heart having be split in twain by m'bongwele broad bladed war spear when seketulo body have be placed in midst have looked upon m'bongwele called aloud commanding of who be in favour of restoration to kingship to stand forth range by side behold more than three fourth of chief stood forth placed beside m'bongwele declaring that makolo be warlike nation whose spear have grown rusty through remaining so long unwashed in blood while be growing ever poorer for lack of neighbour cattle under seketulo peaceful rule that m'bongwele be far better a king than have be seketulo then spake m'buta one of few chief who with have refrained from declaring in m'bongwele favour asking what must happen to nation when four spirit of wind must return find m'bongwele again in power seketulo slain m'bongwele laughed scornfully answered that four spirit be not likely to return for how must find way back having once left country that even if did m'bongwele must again find mean to get into power a have once before done that time must see that did not escape thereupon majority declared for m'bongwele while who be opposed to agreed to bide time await return of spirit recognising futility of resistance at moment indeed must have ended in m'bongwele triumph destruction to purpose did well o lobelalatutu answered von schalckenberg approvingly to engage in hopeless fight be folly now tell pray have m'bongwele in wise profited from lesson gave have reverted to former barbarous method of ruling rule be even a be aforetime answered savage on morrow of day upon be re elected king slew m'buta with own hand saying must have discontented chief under must have slain rest of for interposition of who have gone over to side many of whom be friend also re established witch doctor in former power authority with result that many who paid what deemed insufficient tribute have died long lingering death upon charge that be plotting against king authority for fact that be powerful chief with many friend be certain that even lobelalatutu must also have be sent along dark path ere now now behold life be forfeit for well know m'bongwele too truly suspect intention to come out acquaint great spirit with what have happened for see ye warrior searching hither thither be looking for when next behold face of king will be to hear death sentence unless perchance great spirit must of mercy see fit to preserve life fear not lobelalatutu answered professor have done well to come out tell thing harm will befall abide here with until have dealt with m'bongwele witch doctor will then have naught to fear one thing more tell now have white men visited country since be last here truly have to great misfortune answered lobelalatutu be now eight moon since that party of twelve men two white woman be found by certain of people encamped yonder on shore after great storm how came thither none can say be believed that must have arrived in great floating house remains of be seen at distance from beach lying in great water dashed over furiously fourteen white people who be like unto yourselves o great spirit be dressed in clothing appeared to have shrunk become stained through long soaking in great water be salt be by m'bongwele order brought to village where questioned spoke tongue that none must understand be therefore taken out tormented in one way in so ejaculated von schalckenberg through set teeth there be time when be almost inclined to regret be not savage capable of adopting savage method in dealing with such monster exclamation made aloud to companion in english a preliminary to translation of lobelalatutu story by george professor sympathise with in remark of yours about being savage being capable of adopting savage method when come to punishing such fellow a m'bongwele exclaimed lethbridge when von schalckenberg have come to end mere hanging seems absolutely inadequate yet what can do sense of abstract justice may be so keen that for moment be in full sympathy with old mosaic law of eye for eye tooth for tooth of must deliberately set to work to serve savage a have served others simply must not do suppose be revolt of soul against idea of cruelty infliction of unnecessary suffering make british such successful coloniser win such universal respect among foreigner whether civilised savage yes agreed professor ineradicable disposition to temper justice with mercy have doubtless much to do with although added slyly there be feeling abroad that there have be occasion when have permitted national tendency to run riot carry to quite ridiculous extreme for example oh pray spare professor laughed sir reginald there be need to quote specific instance know kind of thing mean then know legislator a body will do many thing that sane man must ever dream of make ordinary level headed individual gasp with amazement at folly of collective wisdom ' of countryman such folly however always have be suppose will continue to end of time so be not of much use to worry about meanwhile be straying from point be how be to deal with m'bongwele will be justified in assuming responsibility of undertaking to punish probably not answered mildmay if hang savage fact must become known at home venture to prophesy letter will be written to newspaper denouncing a murderer proclaiming that be such people a who by high handed ferocious method get white man into bad odour with gentle savage yet fellow richly deserves punishment if man ever deserved if inflict will certainly escape scot free live on to perpetrate further barbarity say therefore let move up to place bring witch doctor to trial if be proved guilty hang lot of hear hear sailor man speak like book be evident that there be sentimental nonsense about exclaimed lethbridge sentimentalism doe not pay when dealing with noble savage doe not understand indulgence in simply mean encouragement to continue playful practice of roasting people alive so on sharp salutary chastisement doe understand little of judiciously fearlessly meted out often teach wholesome lesson save many life therefore say with let go up to village bring fellow to trial very well agreed sir reginald somewhat reluctantly suppose be really duty to do so let do be rather disagreeable business to be mixed up in same disagreeable undoubtedly assented lethbridge certainly not to be shirked on account can sympathise with in reluctance to do thing old chap merely to depose m'bongwele be one thing to hang crowd of murdering witch doctor be quite be first affair of kind that have be mixed up in with be different in military capacity have on several occasion be obliged to try prisoner condemn to death so too have mildmay will be bound mean doing of unpleasant thing a only mean whereby to put effectual stop to something infinitely more unpleasant at least be how look at yes of course be quite right let go at once get affair over a soon a possible said sir reginald turning away to enter pilot house assume control of ship during proposed movement of to village be now about to move to m'bongwele palace bring to trial for many misdeed explained von schalckenberg to lobelalatutu will remain with until trial be over bietu answered chief saluting in token of submission to will of strange being stood deeply considering for moment then said hesitatingly since great spirit be about to right wrong have suffered at hand of m'bongwele witch doctor may be that must be willing to save life of siswani one of chief who be opposed to reinstatement of m'bongwele like have be marked man from hour when held back from joining who supported m'bongwele be yesterday that witch doctor found cause against punishment be to begin morning at sunrise oh horror be now nearly noon exclaimed professor in horrified accent why did not mention before man what be nature of punishment eyelid be to be cut off be then to be pegged down on ant nest smeared with honey that insect might devour alive be calm answer ah ejaculated professor yes know that punishment have seen inflicted shuddered turned sick at memory do know where place of punishment be demanded professor sharply yes know answered lobelalatutu be that much beyond village on far side pointing to sun described with finger small arc representing apparent travel of luminary across sky during quarter of hour professor turned to pilot house through one of window of baronet be seen looking out with hand on controlling lever waiting conclusion of conference between friend savage quick elphinstone exclaimed make for village at once stop there pas on about mile beyond to spot lobelalatutu will point out to if be quick may be in time to save man life sir reginald needed second bidding with one hand threw back lever controlling grip anchor held ship to ground while with other opened valve admitted vapour into air chamber created vacuum sufficient to raise ship about thousand foot into air from elevation wide extent of country became visible then sent engine ahead at speed of about twenty knot put helm over to turn ship head in direction of distant village now in clear sight from deck meanwhile professor beckoned to mildmay said friend think have better persuade lady to go below for few minute for chance be that will presently behold sight must haunt for ever must happen to see then turned to lobelalatutu said now if can see place of punishment point out to behold be there answered savage pointing may see guard have be stationed round about prisoner indeed a von schalckenberg looked ahead small dark blotch beneath group of thorn tree resolved into body of fifty fully armed warrior grouped in circle round something else that lay stretched out upon ground do see that party of savage ahead elphinstone demanded professor make straight for right see answered sir reginald a spoke lady escorted by mildmay vanished within pilot house on way below moment later flying fish be sweeping over m'bongwele village inhabitant of must be seen scuttling into hut like so many rabbit into hole evidently in state of lively terror at portentous reappearance of well remembered ship of four spirit wending way toward spot where king latest victim have that morning be led forth to undergo torture chapter eighteen end of savage despot a ship passed over village held on way toward place of punishment became evident to watcher on deck that rapid approach be being viewed with great anxiety perturbation by guard who have be ordered by m'bongwele to surround prisoner see that none of friend interfered to shorten period of suffering with kindly spear stroke must be seen pointing at ship excitedly conferring together when at length became quite clear that flying fish be making for precise earth upon stood superstitious fear so completely overmastered other feeling consideration that casting away weapon incontinently took to heel fled howling with terror moment later flying fish came gently to earth upon spot have just vacated a did so professor closely followed by lobelalatutu made dash for gangway ladder down hastily descended dropping rope ladder over side rapidly scrambled down to ground few yard away lay object for be making dozen rapid stride took to prepared a von schalckenberg be for sight met eye yet sickened with deadly nausea a gazed down upon dreadful object that lay stretched out at foot at first glance uninstructed observer must have found somewhat difficult to say precisely what be that be looking upon professor compelling to look closely saw that be naked body of tall finely built savage stretched at full length upon ground upstretched arm outspread leg being firmly secured by many turn of stout thong to four long stake driven so deeply into earth by possible exertion of strength must victim free merely to lie exposed in fashion immovably fixed to earth until death from starvation thirst came to relief of sufferer must one might suppose be considered sufficiently severe punishment to satisfy demand of justice to say nothing of exaction of revenge death be much too easy to be acceptable to man whose lust of cruelty be so insatiable a of m'bongwele monster chief delight be to gloat over suffering of others much of time be very agreeably passed in meditating upon devising scheme of elaborate cruelty for punishment of unhappy individual who be so unfortunate a to offend incur suspicion that be enemy siswani however present victim be not undergoing experimental form of torture of m'bongwele own invention be simply suffering form of death that from protracted exquisitely excruciating character of agony enjoys very wide popularity among african savage consists in eyelid of victim being cut off to expose unprotected eyeball to fierce glare of sun later to other even worse torment after be led out to selected spot where ant nest of suitable size be known to exist arrived there four stout stake be driven deeply into ground at proper distance apart round nest stout raw hide thong be attached to victim wrist ankle whole of naked body be then carefully anointed with honey after be thrown to ground stretched out on back on top of ant nest there immovably bound to four stake then nest be broken under fiercely exasperated little insect be left to work savage will upon unprotected body to be strongly attracted by odour of honey unhappy siswani have thus be exposed for fully five hour when von schalckenberg at length stood beside body be completely hidden beneath swarming mass of ant collective movement of suggested horrible wave like creeping movement to surface of body apart from however occasional writhing of frightfully swollen form limb showed that life feeling still remained be perhaps mouth of sufferer bore most eloquent testimony to extremity of tortured body anguish have be forced wide open by introduction of thick gag of hard wood into strong teeth have bitten until be ground to fragment while lip be drawn back in fearful grin upon awful object lobelalatutu cast single glance then made dart at nearest of spear have be flung away by flying guard with quickly cut thong bound victim secured gag removing latter from sufferer mouth then raising quivering body in arm bent down murmured few word in friend ear there be reply looking closer chief saw enough to convince that unhappy siswani hearing be already completely destroyed lobelalatutu have be reared in school in stoical indifference to suffering whether personal in be esteemed cardinal virtue yet even must not wholly conceal emotion possessed a turned to von schalckenberg drew attention of professor to ghastly injury already inflicted by terrible ant great spirit said be very powerful know for have seen do many wonderful thing can give siswani new eye ear new flesh in place of have disappeared can extract poison from body make whole again even a be when dawn came into morning sky no answered professor sorrowfully can do many wonderful thing a say lobelalatutu can not create man anew can cure many disease can heal many kind of wound power a yet stop short of repairing such frightful injury a utmost that can do be to ease siswani of pain so that may die in peace can not save life demanded chief there be note of keen anguish fierce sorrow in accent a asked question say that answered von schalckenberg may be possible blind deaf dumb a be what will life be worth to even if can preserve true o spirit answered lobelalatutu must be worthless to nay worse must be torment to for memory must remain to to remind constantly of what be a compared with what now be must hing for must be dependent upon others for morsel of food drop of water went to sustain worthless miserable life there be one act of kindness can now avail lobelalatutu will do for even a must pray to do like for be a be ere von schalckenberg must intervene savage with quick movement raised spear held in hand with unerring aim drove deep through heart of friend siswani disfigured body responded to stroke with scarcely perceptible shudder faint sigh escaped distorted lip victim suffering be at end coup de grace stroke of mercy act of friend indeed remarked von schalckenberg a rose to foot turned to meet sir reginald whose exclamation of horror be first intimation of contiguity to other two look at poor mutilated disfigured remnant of what few hour ago be man in prime of life in full enjoyment of perfect health strength consider what future must have be to such man so mutilated even have be possible to retain life in gravely doubt then say whether man friend have not done best that be possible to do yet must friend hampered with sentimentality of civilisation have have moral courage to do like how long do think must have lived for stroke of spear asked sir reginald von schalckenberg shrugged shoulder who can say retorted have be left alone must perhaps have lingered in indescribable agony until sunset when poison in system must have done work must have died on other hand have employed utmost skill be free to give undivided attention to for say month might perhaps have be so far successful a to have prolonged life to extent of two three year during deaf dumb blind utterly helpless movement torture to must have be dependent upon others for necessity of life then said sir reginald if must know that condition have described be best that future held in store for must have put sentimentality in pocket quite so assented professor with nod in opinion act must have be meritorious one well be hour too late to be of use to poor fellow may be that will still be in time to punish murderer murderer of fourteen unhappy white people who died to gratify ferocious instinct of savage despot let be going come added laying hand upon lobelalatutu naked shoulder will need while doing work lie before after have finished can send out men to do what be necessary here with very grim expression of face turned led way to flying fish ten minute later ship came gently to earth in great place before m'bongwele palace village appeared at first sight to be deserted for not soul be to be seen in direction low wail of infant suddenly breaking in upon silence issuing from one of hut betrayed fact that at least one small atom of humanity still lingered about place where so small baby be mother must probably be not far off five white men with rifle in hand a safeguard against possible accident stared about in perplexity what have happened lobelalatutu what have become of people demanded professor be hiding in hut answered chief remember what happened when four spirit last visited be afraid so ejaculated professor well call to lobelalatutu bid come forth have somewhat to say to chief advanced to gangway where must be clearly seen in loud voice called upon man to come forth into open to listen to what four spirit of wind have to say to in reply first one then came creeping reluctantly out of hut until at length great place be full of people standing with eye fixed upon figure of four well remembered spirit fifth who now stood beside low hum of subdued conversation arose from densely massed crowd for minute two presently subsided waited breathlessly for communication to have be summoned to listen von schalckenberg permitted silence to last long enough to become almost oppressive then advanced to gangway waving hand demanded child of makolo how many of number be absent for full minute dead silence followed upon question then man whose dress weapon proclaimed chief strode forward replied be present o most potent spirit save fifty of king guard who went forth morning to execute king sentence upon siswani say so retorted professor where then be m'bongwele how be that see au exclaimed chief king abides in palace come not forth at bidding of stranger doe not retorted von schalckenberg yet will come forth at bidding go now lobelalatutu descend ladder to people take a many men a may be needful bring forth m'bongwele that four spirit may judge punish for crime go fear not for lobelalatutu rather hung back a though somewhat uncertain in regard to matter of safety be under protection man who foolishly dare to raise hand against incurs displeasure will instantly fall dead thus assured lobelalatutu hesitated no longer calling to certain friend of to support boldly descended ladder mildmay took precaution to draw up instantly accompanied by eight ten other chief proceeded to push way through throng toward king palace while confused hum murmur of excited conversation arose from crowd suddenly chief who have replied to von schalckenberg question sprang forward raising right hand with sheaf of spear in grasp above head shouted warrior of makolo what be why stand ye silent before stranger a cattle stand before hungry lion who be that dare come hither to dictate to king once before have be here a though unexpectedly pushed by one behind suddenly fell forward on face dead while von schalckenberg composedly lowered rifle from shoulder have to be done explained to companion meanwhile keeping gaze steadily fixed upon crowd of savage beneath in second two fellow down there must have be divided into two party must have have pitched battle raging at foot with loss of hundred of life evidently fellow be one of king friend can therefore very well be spared quite right professor answered lethbridge forestalled by second two only if have not fired must have done so for saw that fellow meant mischief a chief fell prone before excited crowd of savage became suddenly silent rigid then von schalckenberg waved hand toward motionless figure said in solemn impressive tone so perish who presume to dispute will of four spirit let one touch let lie there a warning to other rebellious nature if such perchance must be among at moment lobelalatutu band reappeared with m'bongwele in midst king heavy feature wore sullen savage expression a be led forward through narrow lane that assembled warrior opened out for passage threw upward single glance of mingled fear defiance at little group of white men a advanced a reached open space intervened between ship thickly massed crowd of people came to halt looked quickly about suddenly demanded in loud harsh tone of voice where be malatambu let stand forth behold lie there dead slain by mighty magic of great spirit answered chief pointing to prostrate body of man who have fallen before professor rifle king threw single keen glance at dead man grunted inarticulately be silent listen m'bongwele said von schalckenberg how be that having banished for former evil deed find here again upon return be unhappy away from people therefore returned answered king sullenly having returned first act be to slay seketulo be not so demanded professor why must not slay retorted makolo need not two king seketulo knew not how to govern therefore slew persisted professor therefore slew assented m'bongwele also slew twelve white men two white woman who be found in distress by people although knew that such act be displeasing to that have forbidden asserted professor nay said m'bongwele slew twelve white men of two woman elder slew younger then slew what matter how died be not king may not do a will in mine own country how died white men demanded von schalckenberg died on ant nest be crucified be nay how can say be long ago have forgotten answered king sullenly be not only people who have died in torment since return many of own people have suffered at word be not so be so answered king be rebellious subject so perished how knew that be rebellious demanded von schalckenberg witch doctor told so be that not enough retorted m'bongwele how knew witch doctor that be rebellious inquired professor found out through magic even a through magic found out that have returned to people answered king be witch doctor present if so let stand forth exclaimed professor for space of two three minute there be direct reply to challenge merely subdued commotion among assembled multitude of warrior then professor growing impatient called to lobelalatutu be witch doctor present lobelalatutu nay great spirit be not present doubtless be to be found in hut answered chief saluting then take men with to hut find witch doctor bind with thong bring forth to judgment commanded von schalckenberg few minute of dead silence now followed at end of there arose among more distant hut outcry sound of commotion presently chief party reappeared leading forth ten old grizzled men of most villainously cunning repulsive appearance whose hand be bound behind be brought to front ranged in line by side of king professor looked at intently for full minute returning look with insolent glare of defiance then said of be chief of witch doctor even m'pusa be chief witch doctor what want ye with white man answered most hideously repulsive looking individual of party sending look of concentrated hatred vindictiveness upward at professor be charged against that have cruelly maliciously incited man m'bongwele who falsely call king ' to condemn many people to suffer death by torture under pretence that be conspiring against knowing while that accusation be false what explanation excuse have to offer for wickedness demanded professor sternly man pondered for moment a though considering what answer must make at length looked up said why must make excuse men be enemy used such power a possessed to destroy be enough said von schalckenberg then addressing great assemblage before continued men of makolo ye have heard question have put to two men answer that have given to question have acknowledged that charge brought against be true have taken many life doomed many to die in lingering torment for mere gratification of own personal enmity love of cruelty out of own mouth be judged condemned have misused power therefore be taken from have wantonly taken life of others therefore be own life forfeit sentence passed upon be that die shameful ignominious death take therefore fasten strong rope about neck hang from great branch of yonder tree until be dead dead word touched m'bongwele stirred a must other word in own other language dead by hand of others how many of unresisting subject have condemned to suffer death death of acute lingering long drawn out seemingly interminable suffering how have laughed with ferocious glee when have succeeded in making of not many only one two occasionally quail at prospect of what lay before have never dreamed of day when must be doomed to suffer ignominy of public execution how must be not king be word not law who must dare to raise hand against idea seemed to preposterous grotesque absurdity until glanced upward saw set stern white face gazing down upon with eye in read truth that doom be fixed immutable inexorable involuntarily shuddered glanced wildly about a though looking for way of escape must own people stand tamely by see king perish at word of mysterious terrible stranger must single one of dare to lay sacrilegious hand upon in obedience to order of stranger with half formed hope that generation of iron discipline unquestioning obedience to king will might yet avail to protect in moment of utmost need glance searched face after face in vain have allowed tyranny to carry so far that at length there be scarce man among present who must say with certainty that own life must not be next demanded to satisfy savage whim of king there be not twenty among hundred who must raise hand to save too late saw full depth of rash headstrong criminal folly to what strait have led suddenly snatching spear from hand of one of astonished unwary guard strove to drive point into own heart owner of spear recovered in flash seizing blade of weapon in bare hand twisted upward with such strength that slender wooden shaft snapped leaving head in hand innocuous shaft in of m'bongwele at same instant half dozen men flung upon king in trice hand be drawn behind securely bound then from somewhere two long thong rope of twisted raw hide be produced quickly knotted round neck of two condemned men in tense breathless silence be led away to fatal tree chapter nineteen king necklace with return of lobelalatutu from gruesome task while body of m'bongwele m'pusa still swung from tree professor turned to friend said having disposed of one king onus now rest upon of appointing question consequently arises what be to govern in somewhat delicate task of choosing suitable man yes agreed sir reginald be somewhat difficult question to answer very much too difficult to answer offhand want man excuse for interrupting old chap broke in lethbridge must like to offer suggestion based upon knowledge of peculiarity of savage mind a acquired in various out of way corner of globe in light of what chief lobelalatutu have told to day be of opinion that made rather serious mistake when on occasion of last visit here appointed seketulo a king without consulting wish of other chief must therefore suggest that instruct chief to hold pow wow to night for purpose of deciding upon submitting to to morrow name of such individual a consider suitable for position what say professor too have have experience with native what do think of plan think excellent in way answered professor heartily so excellent indeed that very strongly support right agreed sir reginald can see possible objection to scheme what do say colonel hillo what have become of mildmay must not very profoundly surprise if must be found that be below doing best to entertain lady observed lethbridge with grin if so there be really need to disturb be sure to agree to anything that may decide upon what think of plan colonel well really have have so little experience in matter of kind feel competent to express opinion since very excellent friend von schalckenberg so thoroughly approves of be certain that must be good one answered sziszkinski very good then be settled will tell fellow down there professor said sir reginald von schalckenberg did so then dismissed people to hut commanding chief lobelalatutu however to ascend to deck again for few minute a have one two further question to put to now remarked professor a chief joined next business take be to discover who be unfortunate white people who died under such barbarous circumstance to amuse m'bongwele set jealous fear at rest certainly agreed sir reginald be manifest duty to do so if can identify of will also be painful duty to make public particular of most miserable fate if possible communicate with relative also to despatch to relative relic that may have left behind ask lobelalatutu if happens to know what became of poor soul belonging von schalckenberg put question learned in reply that may have belonged to unhappy party must undoubtedly be found in king palace of course remarked professor might have guessed a much well be there anything more that wish to ask black friend ask whether portion of wreck still exists if so where be to be found suggested sir reginald professor lobelalatutu conversed together for few minute then former turning to companion said chief tell that wreck have disappeared that can point out to spot where lay think ought to examine undoubtedly agreed sir reginald may perhaps be able to go over take look at to morrow after matter of choice of new king be settled meanwhile there go luncheon bell after lunch might give palace ' overhaul see what can find of interest there so be arranged lobelalatutu then received dismissal in accordance with sir reginald suggestion professor lethbridge colonel sziszkinski quietly left ship same afternoon about three o'clock to institute search in palace for relic of shipwrecked party m'bongwele might have preserved mildmay very willingly agreed to remain on board ship to keep lady company see generally that nothing went amiss with before left ship von schalckenberg handed to of party small box about size of book experience in forest other day when be lost there said suggested to importance of providing mean of communicating with ship with other if need be under similar circumstance outcome of cogitation upon subject be little box be precisely alike opened one held in hand proceeded to explain use of instrument be very simple said let assume that wish to communicate with ship draw box from pocket press firmly upon small black knob thus bell instantly ring in pilot house in one of habitable chamber of ship for have coupled up together in order wherever occupant of ship may be will hear at least one of bell will know that one of be calling incidentally may mention that bell will at same time ring in of instrument listen professor pressed knob of own instrument a did so sound of many bell not very loud still perfectly distinct came to from part of ship also from instrument that man held in hand so said von schalckenberg now when of hears sound of bell in instrument at once withdraws instrument from pocket touch small red knob stop ringing of own particular bell a may ascertain by experiment at same time informs other person by momentary stoppage of bell that one be in touch with then person who desire to communicate proceeds somewhat in fashion releasing pressure on black knob draw out small tube from box insert nozzle into ear say into mouthpiece hillo there be flying fish ' come answer be von schalckenberg thanks want flying fish ' say press black knob again until get reply from ship why what splendid little device exclaimed sir reginald when did invent professor thought out that day when be lost in forest made first experimental instrument next day be wireless telephone be powerful enough believe to permit of intelligible conversation over space of about fifty mile can not speak with certainty on point without subjecting instrument to actual trial be very roughly made a see if answer purpose will serve until can get smaller neater one made precisely utility before beauty eh professor remarked lethbridge not added that be neat handy enough for anything well need never fear being lost again think for must be hard if with little instrument to ring up friend mildmay must not give sort of clue a to direction in to look for now suppose may a well go be few step from ship to palace after be only somewhat larger hut than of rest couple of minute sufficed party to reach found unoccupied for king wife be lodged in adjoining hut from a four white men neared became aware of subdued sound of wailing correctly interpreted a mourning of lady over tragic end of lord master interior of palace consisted of one circular apartment twenty five foot in diameter hung round with magnificent karosses curtain made of skin of various wild animal one of karosses instantly arrested attention from fact that conveyed to information that africa contained at least one other new animal in addition to already discovered by be made of zebra skin there be peculiarity in marking clearly indicated that animal from skin have be taken be of new quite unknown variety peculiarity consisted in fact that head neck foreleg front half of body be of dark brown colour while hinder half of body be striped like of ordinary zebra von schalckenberg be at once plunged into ecstasy of delight at discovery with ruthlessness of true scientist announced determination to despoil palace of particular kaross let opinion of makolo upon act of spoliation be what might also there then secured sir reginald amused consent to proceed eventually in search of living animal if must prove possible to learn from native where be to be found furniture of palace be of most primitive description consisting of very roughly constructed bed low table of equally rough manufacture armchair decorated with rude very elaborate carving there be also chest obviously ordinary sailor sea chest sir reginald opened under belief that here if anywhere must be found such relic of unfortunate white people a might still remain in existence chest proved to be about three part full first article came to hand be king very handsome gold coronet lion skin mantle necklace of what at first sight appeared to be red pebble upon closer inspection however stone be pronounced by professor to be uncut unpolished ruby of exceptional size beauty be ruined by roughness size of perforation there be ninety three of in strung upon thin strip of deerskin have be perfect must have be worth about ten thousand pound professor eye sparkled a held necklace up to light noted fire deep rich colour of stone ah ejaculated here be wealth with vengeance reduced to about tenth part of original value by crass ignorance stupidity of somebody who did not know what irreparable mischief be doing when chipped punched ghastly great hole wonder now where be found somewhere not very far from here will be bound must not have found way into m'bongwele hand must ask lobelalatutu about possibly may be able to tell where came from if so there will be opportunity not only for of to add considerably to stock of precious stone also for to acquire little of wealth so urgently need for purpose mentioned to sir reginald when be good enough to invite to make one of party on cruise right professor remember answered sir reginald cheerily if can learn where stone be found will go there will have full week in to collect a many a can next article in chest upon searcher laid hand consisted of soldier castoff scarlet coat buttonless very much worse for wear old pair of blue trouser decorated on side seam with tarnish blackened gold lace most shockingly battered old cocked hat of recognised with laughter a gift presented by to m'bongwele upon occasion of former visit beneath again found two pair of coarse blue cloth trouser thick pilot cloth coat two blue striped shirt pair of coarse worsted stocking one two other oddment have evidently belonged to one more of ill fated party of white people who have fallen into m'bongwele hand of whose identity searcher be now endeavouring to discover trace clothing bore name not even of maker be there letter document of kind in chest to indicate name nationality of owner be anything of kind to be found anywhere in hut although searcher carefully examined throughout also article that contained only chance therefore remained to be to visit scene of wreck endeavour to find vestige of ship when on morrow of somewhat eventful day male member of flying fish party went on deck to smoke after breakfast pipe found chief assembled in great place below awaiting appearance for purpose of submitting name of of number considered most acceptable for vacant kingship now rather amusing difficulty arose for when von schalckenberg invited chosen chief to ascend to deck of flying fish in order that spirit might determine of must receive position whole of sixteen in number gravely ascended side ladder ranged in line before arbiter of fate when professor demanded of lobelalatutu explanation of somewhat singular proceeding be informed that at conference of preceding evening chief have calmly resolutely voted for somewhat complicated matter brought about situation full of troublous possibility calling for very careful diplomatic handling four spirit therefore having seated in deck chair invited chief to step forward in turn state briefly first ground upon based belief in own fitness for post of king secondly line upon must govern course of conduct must observe generally in event of nomination to man be accorded certain number of good also of bad mark corresponding to nature of reply given by bad mark being deducted from good candidate fitness judged by number of good mark then remaining to thus carefully examined three of chief be eventually found to be equally suitable upon discovery choice of one from among be determined by simple process of odd man out a result of to great satisfaction of judge lobelalatutu proved to be fortunate individual fifteen unsuccessful candidate be naturally somewhat chagrined at failure have seen understood enough of proceeding to satisfy of absolute fairness of test therefore took defeat with good grace made demur when be presently required to swear fealty to new sovereign matter having be satisfactorily arranged body of m'bongwele chief witch doctor be ordered to be cut down interred in open country outside village after new king be crowned by le personage than sir reginald while professor invested with regal mantle of lion skin lethbridge dropped ruby necklace over head ceremony being performed on deck of flying fish in presence of entire populace of village ceremony of coronation having thus be duly performed new king be at once called upon to exercise regal function for first time by fulfilling one of promise that have made being abolition of power of witch doctor functionary be accordingly summoned before bidden to pack up trap quit country forthwith under armed escort assurance being given that if be ill advised enough to return after have be conducted across border must be slain at sight now lobelalatutu said von schalckenberg when matter have be arranged people dismissed there be two thing that require to do for first be to tell if can where m'bongwele obtained stone pointing to necklace of ruby other be to guide to spot where ship of white people be last seen can do with equal ease at same time o spirit answered new king for red stone be found by people on beach in soil of cliff at spot where came upon wrecked white men woman few be found in first place on beach being of pleasing colour shooting forth ruddy light be offered to m'bongwele who so greatly admired that sent finder back to look for more with order to bring enough to make necklace know exact spot demanded professor know exact spot for brother be one of finder told answered lobelalatutu good ejaculated professor brother will go with point out place nay answered king can not do for be dead m'bongwele slew with own hand indeed exclaimed professor why because be brother answered king simply von schalckenberg turned to sir reginald most gracious majesty here tell that can show where wreck lie also where ruby be found said if rest of be quite agreeable appears to that there be very particular reason why must not go there at once seem to have finished business here at event for present right agreed baronet let go will take lobelalatutu with get to point out place then one of can run back here land while others take stroll along beach fill pocket with ruby if can find professor accordingly explained to newly created monarch what be proposed then sir reginald retired to pilot house to assume duty of navigator minute later inhabitant of village have gratification of witnessing flight into air of new king not a prisoner a friend of great spirit who be doubtless taking away with on business of importance connected with welfare of whole makolo nation chapter twenty ruby mine coast line be distant twenty mile from village about a far from ruin of ophir be therefore easily reached within hour from moment of starting king lobelalatutu then have mystifying experience of beholding lady of party accompanied by ida sir reginald lethbridge colonel sziszkinski suddenly unaccountably appear on beach below having left ship in mysterious unknown manner while professor mildmay remained on board with to have position of wreck pointed out to afterwards convey back to village people now lobelalatutu said professor show if can whereabouts wreck lay when last saw king looked out to seaward pointed toward spot about mile from shore where sea be breaking heavily be there said quite close to end of white line on water ah exclaimed mildmay there be evidently reef there fetched up on southern end of will take run out there professor see whether can discover sign of after will run friend here back to bosom of anxious family therewith retired to pilot house ship then rose to height of about five hundred foot into air headed out toward southern extremity of reef over be hovering few minute later while professor mildmay peered down into water below at height above water be quite easy to see down into depth although foam of breaker baffled somewhat have very little difficulty in tracing extent direction of reef for little time however looked in vain for sign of wreck at length mildmay pointing downward at two dark shapeless blotch must just be distinguished one on side of reef remarked that appears to to be be left of professor if so have evidently broken in two gone down one half of inside other half outside reef whether however be right in supposition can only be determined by descending to bottom getting into diving suit very fortunately for water on side of reef appears to be fairly deep so that when be down there on sand will not feel power of surf very much have remained on top of reef doubt whether must have be possible for to have got near quite right friend answered professor man must keep foot among breaker must be helplessly knocked about like ninepin now do wish to see more will be off back to village one moment please said mildmay drawing out pocket book will do harm to take set of cross bearing for identification of spot might be useful in event of off shore wind springing up during be quite possible that sea may cease to break on reef in case must not very easily find wreck unless happened to have bearing of went into pilot house accordingly took bearing having done set engine in motion headed ship back toward village where duly arrived about hour later a professor drew up stowed away accommodation ladder by mean of lobelalatutu have left ship said have just occurred to that present be excellent opportunity for to test wireless telephone by calling up friend on beach entering pilot house went up to instrument be there fixed opening laid finger on one of two small knob that contained little bell formed part of instrument at once started ringing a did similar bell in room of ship so continued for about minute when ceased for about two second then went on again good remarked professor removing finger from button so stopping ringing of bell a drew out small tube inserted be end in one one among friend hears then advanced mouth to mouthpiece spoke into hillo who be be elphinstone came instant clear reply be that flying fish yes answered von schalckenberg be now at village thought excellent opportunity to test telephone appear to answer perfectly for can hear a distinctly a though be at elbow can hear fairly well splendidly quite a well a can hear must say replied sir reginald congratulate professor upon success of latest invention be most useful instrument can easily imagine number of circumstance under might prove of utmost value to idea have just occurred to how must do while be about to ascertain greatest distance at be possible to communicate intelligibly with other excellent answered von schalckenberg will shut ourselves in ascend to height of ten thousand foot into calm belt then proceed at full speed directly away from keep finger on black button of instrument please for guidance when bell cease to sound will know that have lost touch with right came answer instantly bell in ship again started ringing at same moment professor closed door window of pilot house injected strong jet of vapour into air chamber causing ship to rise rapidly into air then sent engine full speed ahead pointed ship sharp snout on compass bearing left party on beach directly astern of for three quarter of hour bell in ship continued to ring at first strongly then gradually with diminishing strength finally when ship have be running continuously at full speed for fifty minute became inaudible professor face meanwhile be picture of ever growing delight if can continue to hear bell for quarter of hour will be quite satisfied have remarked to mildmay a ship first rose into air for by time will be quite fifty mile distant from beach when quarter of hour have elapsed with perceptible diminution in volume of sound growing satisfaction have be faithfully mirrored by steadily expanding smile upon expressive feature finally when at bell ceased to ring exclaimed well who must have believed here have poor silly scientist be hoping that little invention must prove effective for a long distance a fifty mile behold at distance of one hundred twenty mile from friend have only just lost touch with let try back friend turn ship round will then note how far have to run before can speak clearly to other mildmay accordingly put helm hard over when compass showed that ship be once more pointing directly toward spot on beach where remainder of party have be left professor drew out watch carefully noted time almost immediately bell again began to tinkle at first very faintly intermittently rapidly increasing in strength a ship sped back over ground that have traversed few minute earlier by time that have run ten mile on return journey bell be again ringing quite strongly stop commanded von schalckenberg be now one hundred ten mile from friend think ought to be within speaking distance of let try touched red knob of instrument at same time inserted end of tube in ear almost instantly faint quite distinct shout came to hillo von schalckenberg where be now heard sir reginald voice inquire be just one hundred ten mile distant from answered professor can hear distinctly yes quite distinctly although voice doe not sound quite so loud a did came reply sound a though be about hundred foot away still if can hear clearly enough to distinguish what say be good enough will hear more distinctly a shorten distance between by way have met with luck yet in search for ruby yes answered sir reginald during experiment of yours have be lying down on beach turning over pebble within reach have found two rather fine stone look like ruby will be able to say whether be when see will be within hour answered professor for be now about to return to at full speed many thanks friend for giving so much time to experiment need not now trouble further so get to work in earnest see how many more ruby can find by time that arrive be exactly fifty five minute later that flying fish still at height of ten thousand foot above sea level arrived over beach where rest of party be seen wandering slowly hither thither gently settled down in midst well friend what luck so far demanded professor a mildmay emerged from ship diving chamber joined sir reginald lady olivia on beach be for to say answered sir reginald with laugh have found likely looking stone since last spoke to lady olivia here have whole pocketful most of be afraid be rather more than doubtful may be permitted to see asked von schalckenberg holding out hand with smile of course answered lady olivia detaching from belt little leather bag in usually carried handkerchief scent bottle other odds end think that several of be quite good husband declares that be not worth trouble of picking up be quite right so far a one at least be concerned remarked professor a drew forth stone held up to light for moment also a drew forth second looked at threw away ah exclaimed a produced third look more promising examined stone very carefully be about size of plover egg presently said a handed back dear lady permit to congratulate have be fortunate enough to secure exceptionally magnificent stone without doubt be of course somewhat difficult to judge of precise value of gem in rough uncut state must say that have there stone will prove almost unique not only a to size also for perfect colour have more like further investigation proved that lady olivia have be almost if not equal of first a well a three others of somewhat smaller size equal beauty of colour when presently professor proceeded to examine sir reginald find became at once apparent that ruby to be found in particular locality be likely to prove exceptionally valuable from extreme richness of colour exclaimed von schalckenberg enthusiastically be result of few hour search surely there must be ruby mine of almost fabulous richness somewhere close at hand now be time for to acquire little of wealth of be in such urgent need raising hat to lady olivia turned away be presently noticed that instead of examining pebble on beach a rest be doing went straight to foot of low cliff at upper edge of beach scrutinising face very closely foot by foot a passed slowly along when last particularly noticed be seen to be apparently digging into soil of cliff face here there with pocket knife at sound of gong beaten on board flying fish gave notice that afternoon tea be ready for whosoever chose to partake of refreshment two lady little ida three of whom held institution in great respect at once gladly turned step toward ship for be fatigued hot with unwonted exertion felt that cup of tea be precisely what needed for restoration men of party also have by time drifted almost insensibly into habit of joining lady at function thus came to pas that within half hour entire party have gathered beneath awning ensconced in comfortable basket chair be leisurely sipping fragrant cup be said to cheer certainly doe not inebriate while discussed in desultory fashion afternoon experience compared find be to say with exception of von schalckenberg who in usual absent minded way be to be seen about mile distant still prodding poking at cliff face a industriously with a deep absorption a though so important function a afternoon tea be quite unknown to let call beggar up with one of own telephone said lethbridge in response to remark of lady olivia anent professor absorption if will stay there until darkness fall then wonder how dickens got there here ida come call up professor sweetheart will perhaps listen to though be very doubtful whether must to drawing telephone from pocket pressed button while ida with whom ex colonel be great favourite came stood obediently by side a usual everybody else telephone a well a bell in ship at once started ringing now continued lethbridge gravely be fault have to find with otherwise wonderfully clever contrivance of von schalckenberg want to communicate with certain person by mean of own instrument at once attract attention of everybody else who happens to posse one must remember to ask worthy man if can not remedy that defect ah there be a bell ceased for moment to tinkle now then ida put in ear then tell professor through mouthpiece afternoon tea be on child at once did so calling into receiver professor professor can hear oh yes of course can replied professor voice what be matter dear tea be ready proclaimed ida shortly be that so answered professor right little one must like cup of tea very much for be terribly thirsty can not come just now for be very busy so take tea enjoy eh what be so dreadfully busy about professor demanded child be busy at making of fortune answered professor can tell papa that believe have found heart of ruby mine if so there will be ruby enough for to spare will tell more about when turn up for dinner professor duly turned up very hot tired not to say dirty a first star made appearance in eastern sky result of afternoon labour be represented by forty ruby of size fire richness of colour that threw found by rest of party entirely in shade story be very simple explained that fact of ruby being found upon beach have led to conviction that must originally have come from soil of cliff face have accordingly devoted to task of examining bare soil at spot where have crumbled away result said be that have ultimately come upon place where upon careful inspection have found no fewer than three ruby just showing through soil within foot of other have of course straightway dug out in act of doing so have disclosed others ultimate result being unearthing of superb stone that have brought back with opinion explained be that judging from indication already seen there must be found to be very considerable pocket of ruby at great distance in from cliff face that best plan must be for five men to work conjointly with pick shovel finally dividing proceeds between member of party a for lady if chose to amuse by searching beach professor be of opinion that might meet with sufficient success to render fully worth while on following morning accordingly flying fish be moved close up to scene of professor discovery men suitably attired provided with pick shovel bar went to work upon top edge of cliff breaking down shovelling away soil a directed by professor up to lunch time effort have be rewarded by finding of one ruby however von schalckenberg explained be not to be wondered at a must probably take two three day to get down to spot at expected to find pocket same pocket further explained might possibly have be much more quickly reached with much le labour by digging into face of cliff instead of downward however asserted must have exposed to very great risk of almost certain fall of earth have therefore deemed wise to adopt safer method even though involved expenditure of very considerably greater amount of labour afternoon work be rewarded by discovery of two medium sized two small stone of very fine fire colour second day labour resulted in find of five fine eight medium sized stone thus toiler progressed day yielding better return for labour until late in afternoon of fifth day struck pocket so confidently looked for by professor then gem be found in such abundance that be scarcely possible to turn over shovel full of soil without finding one more while be by mean uncommon to turn up a many a dozen at one stroke of shovel extraordinarily prolific yield lasted for fewer than four day during accumulated enormous quantity of gem practically one of be of exceptional value at length although mine be very far from being exhausted even professor declared satisfied while colonel sziszkinski found suddenly relieved of very heavy load of anxiety by acquisition of sufficient number of valuable gem to yield very handsome fortune if discreetly placed upon market that suspect will be difficulty professor will be so anxious to realise that will flood market cause big depreciation in value of ruby remarked lethbridge rather caustically when after last day at mine met again at dinner table von schalckenberg laughed will take chance of friend replied have fear will not flood market lower value of ruby there be plenty of people who be always ready to buy fine stone when get chance be not often have friend in amsterdam whose knowledge of market be second to none in world will put ruby into hand to sell will know how to dispose of without flooding market have better let same man have yours boris friend what do think of doing with yours sir reginald returned sir reginald oh will pick out finest have cut set a suite for lady elphinstone a for rest of well quite know what will do with anyhow promise will not put on market early enough to spoil sale of stone ah exclaimed professor appealing to company at large see what advantage be to be rich man what do propose to do with yours lethbridge oh know answered ex colonel follow elphinstone example think have suite made for young woman pinching ida cheek against time when be old enough to get married perhaps sell rest time other professor glanced inquiringly at mildmay think too will have suite made observed sailor seems rather good idea pretty sure to come in handy sooner later eye turned a though unconsciously in direction of feodorovna sziszkinski to confusion of young lady covert amusement of lady olivia chapter twenty one mildmay adventure with octopus two succeeding day be very fully occupied upon somewhat difficult delicate task of effecting equal division of fabulously rich haul of ruby that have so easily acquired in so short time on third day being sunday everybody took rest a be usual with whenever possible on following monday morning after breakfast flying fish rose into air moving out to sea proceeded to reef upon unknown ship have be wrecked be determined to examine first what be believed to be after part of wreck for if document from content of ship must be identified still existed in decipherable condition must be in one of cabin that must almost certainly be found position of portion of wreck therefore having be found flying fish be sunk a close a possible to settling down upon smooth firm sandy bottom in fourteen fathom of water on seaward side of reef there be four male diving suit in ship lethbridge russian colonel be so very nearly alike in size build that there be doubt that suit of former must fit latter lethbridge therefore offered sziszkinski opportunity to experience sensation of walking about on ocean bed beholding anything of novel character there might be to see offer russian have gladly accepted diving suit have be provided for lady olivia be deemed unadvisable that must make first essay at submarine exploration until others have first be out have thus ascertained what difficulty possible danger be likely to be experienced four men who be going out be to say sir reginald mildmay von schalckenberg sziszkinski accordingly descended to lowermost depth of ship entered diving room leaving lethbridge to entertain two lady little ida by pointing out such object of interest a be to be seen from tightly closed window of saloon going at once to cupboard labelled with colonel lethbridge name professor drew forth diving dress very handsome suit of diving armour contained instructed russian friend how to don first dress then armour sir reginald mildmay meanwhile leisurely assuming own proper suit when at length sziszkinski be completely equipped von schalckenberg quickly donned own suit after quartette left diving room entered what called chamber of egress carefully closing securing door behind water tap be then turned on chamber gradually filled with water flowed in at level of floor steadily rose about four occupant until be over head have reached to ceiling then having first ascertained that everybody felt right quite comfortable professor opened trap door in ship bottom four men walked out over flap found treading sandy floor of ocean upon ship rested be now in tunnel like passage formed by starboard bilge keel ship hull curved out over vast ponderous a overhanging cliff be intensely dark here though at extremity of tunnel must be seen small patch of sombre green light therefore switched on electric lamp be attached one to helmet one to belt of man thus aided be enabled without difficulty to make way out to what mildmay called daylight once there be to say clear of gloom of overshadowing hull of flying fish be able to see with tolerable distinctness even without assistance of lamp depth of water being too great for surface disturbance to reach bottom stir up sand water therefore be clear transparent allowing light of sun already high in heaven to pas through somewhat dimly illuminate ground upon walked with soft greenish blue light water be alive with fish darting restlessly hither thither while be evidently much alarmed at apparition of four gleaming armour clad figure from whom retreated precipitately others be a evidently consumed with curiosity a to what be came swimming about with pertinacity be highly amusing be also very interesting to look upward watch wave ceaselessly chasing other overhead shape formation of wave being clearly indicated by line of rippling light crossed intermingled with other in production of endless succession of most beautiful novel effect wreck be clearly visible at distance of three hundred foot lying at base of reef shot steeply up out of sand reached to within about dozen foot of sea level a four men approached be seen that almost shapeless bulk before be a have be anticipated merely after part of ship remainder doubtless lying on other inshore side of reef that have be sailing ship be evident for hollow steel main mizzen mast with portion of yard standing running gear still attached to be to be seen lying upon steep slope of reef evidently where have fallen when ship struck from circumstance that canvas except close reefed topsail be furled mildmay expressed opinion that have struck during heavy weather doubtless at night for be difficult to understand how ship must have come stem on upon reef during hour of daylight on coast where fog be practically unknown to four curious observer standing down there alongside wreck be perfectly clear that have struck with tremendous force for have pushed half length across obstructing reef have ultimately broken in two just forward of mainmast half of at be now looking have slid down side of reef with such force that stern have buried in sand to extent rendered impossible for to read name port of registry on counter a have hoped to do if therefore desired to ascertain particular concerning must be absolutely necessary for one more of to climb on board institute search of cabin in consequence of peculiar posture of wreck be to say fact that be reared nearly on end on stern appeared likely to prove task of very considerable difficulty not to say danger have be mere ordinary diver attired in well known regulation diving dress must have be unable to communicate with other save by somewhat slow awkward mean of slate piece of chalk professor however with foresight be one of most remarkable characteristic have met difficulty at time when special diving dress for party be in process of manufacture by introduction into helmet of pair of small powerful microphone of own design with result that wearer of dress must hear a distinctly a when be in open air must converse together with perfect facility hence be now able to discus difficulty thus unexpectedly confronted arrange plan of action for minute four men stood together contemplating wreck considering situation generally then mildmay said appears to that only way be for to climb up to skylight open lower down into cabin by mean of rope end plenty of be lying about deck skylight undoubtedly will give access to cuddy from that will probably be able to make way into other cabin be captain cabin that particularly want will probably know better where to look for than of rest of one of however have better come up with a may possibly require assistance right answered sir reginald will go with will go first will have better go first think then can help up said mildmay forthwith laid hold of rope end with difficulty hauled into position above fore end of skylight having firmly established upon proceeded to haul baronet up after then between managed to force open starboard half of skylight cover when swinging leg over ledge of skylight mildmay grasped rope lowered down into interior of cuddy for moment must see nothing for only light penetrating interior came down through skylight be not much therefore switched on electric lamp looked about found standing upon after bulkhead of apartment with foot on door apparently gave access to one of stern cabin stepping aside sufficiently for purpose be in act of stooping to unfasten door when suddenly found enveloped by number of long strong pliant embracing arm violently snatched off foot surprise be so great that for moment must not imagine what have happened to knew only that arm leg be so tightly pinioned that despite utmost exertion found absolutely impossible to move knowledge came to next moment knowledge that be in embrace of enormous octopus a realised fact heard horrid rasping of fierce creature powerful mandible upon helmet sound sent thrill of horror through for thought flashed through mind if brute must pierce helmet will be drowned like rat in trap moment later became reassured a remembered extraordinary strength toughness of aethereum of not only helmet whole suit of armour be composed with revulsion of feeling laughed aloud at amusing character of situation for be amusing to to think of creature disappointment at utter inability to pierce shell get at stay be situation really so very amusing after for now mildmay began to realise that octopus be steadily working way backward upward through big breach in fore bulkhead of cabin carrying with presently found outside cabin altogether in open space at bottom of companion ladder creature did not pause here still working way upward dragged mildmay along wide alley way between ship side casing of companion way until reached bulkhead between space main hold straining of ship have eventually resulted in breaking in two have also rent bulkhead apart leaving aperture ten foot wide through in turn octopus gradually worked way until have passed into what before ship broke in two have be main hold now mildmay be able to understand what have be greatly puzzling how be that creature have come to be inside ship at be evidently through breach in bulkhead that have made way just prior to moment of seizure sailor have caught momentary shuddering glimpse of something in cuddy went far to explain why have made way there that octopus have definite objective now became perfectly clear for still kept untiringly on way forcing passage way that through interstice between confused heap of bale case have formed part of ship cargo until at length after about hour arduous work emerged clear of everything into open water when at once made for cave like aperture in reef into passed still firmly clasping prisoner in embrace of snake like tentacle now mildmay began to realise serious character of extraordinary plight in thus unexpectedly found involved for now flashed upon that in astonishment following upon seizure have failed to raise outcry with object of making friend acquainted with predicament indeed have be so fully occupied in struggling to free from fettering embrace of enemy that have not occurred to to cry out until have become altogether too late to make voice heard now found thrust how deep knew not into submarine cave certainly much too far for voice to reach outside bring to assistance meanwhile octopus still held in so tenacious grip that found absolutely impossible to free hand so get at two bladed electric dagger with a believed must make short work of antagonist indeed time that made slightest attempt to move limb felt tentacle still further strengthen grip upon now that have time to think of became conscious of fact that be feeling pretty completely exhausted by previous struggle extreme violence with have be dragged hither in passage from wrecked ship cuddy to cave be bruised aching in joint of body be furthermore suffering severely from cramp due to constraint upon limb how be to effect escape friend outside must not help for simple reason that did not know whereabouts doubtless be by time beginning to feel uneasy about be perhaps even instituting search for search a be likely to make must not benefit for utmost that must ascertain must be that after entering cuddy have most mysteriously unaccountably disappeared for be well aware that there be absolutely nothing to show way have gone more than that have gone by way must have be absolutely impossible to own unaided effort told be quite useless to look for help from others be to be done must do then began to turn over in mind possibility of situation how long must creature be likely to hold thus prisoner must release when at length realised impossibility of penetrating armour if so how long be likely to be ere release came failing to make meal of thing must undoubtedly be obliged to go forth sooner later to seek for food mildmay have only most elementary knowledge a to habit of octopus have hazy idea that like certain snake creature might only feed at more le long interval in case might be held prisoner for week more be distinctly disquieting reflection while lasted presently occurred to that be by mean probable that let creature habit be what might must retain that vice like grip upon for very lengthened period chance must come when grip relaxed be easy step from conclusion to next be that must do what must to cause grip to relax a quickly a possible have already observed that creature tightened clasp of tentacle about whenever moved struggled obvious corollary from be that more quiescent must remain sooner must opportunity come to wrench arm free use deadly dagger meanwhile on board flying fish lethbridge intent upon making time pas a pleasantly a possible for lady cooped up below deck in saloon conducted to window in dining saloon from wreck reef be clearly visible from must watch movement of four adventurous diver for twenty minute so after quartette have left occupant of saloon have to be content with such interest amusement a be to be obtained by observing movement of numerous fish outside including little thrill of horror when big shark went drifting aimlessly past turned aside for moment to thrust great shovel snout up against tremendously thick especially toughened plate glass window out of be gazing be at once full of apprehension lest monster must remain in neighbourhood attack diver upon appearance on sandy floor below lady elphinstone even begged colonel to go down below warn adventurer of proximity a well a urge to defer excursion lethbridge laughed so heartily at idea of being in danger from mere shark explained to so clearly that shark must have absolutely chance against men equipped a diver be that permitted to be reassured while be discussing matter four diver suddenly appeared forcing way somewhat laboriously through water in direction of wreck saw little party reach great mass stand for few minute evidently in consultation finally saw one of climb up wreck then assist of party to mount beside mildmay elphinstone commented lethbridge a looked over ida shoulder how do know that colonel demanded lady olivia to look precisely alike except of course that professor be much stouter than others be impossible for to conceal identity even by encasing in suit of armour quite true laughed lethbridge worthy von schalckenberg figure be such that one be bound to recognise a far a one can see a to other question well recognised first man a mildmay by action be sailor over a strongly indicated by sailor like motion a professor be by figure take other to be husband because be colonel sziszkinski first appearance under water moreover elphinstone be not man to ask to do anything can do ah there go mildmay down through ship skylight be doubtless going to search cabin for anything can find will help to establish identity will see more of for next half hour so suspect saw sir reginald lean over edge of skylight for moment look down into ship interior then a watched seated composedly upon fore end of skylight upon have be standing with folded arm leaned back against almost vertical deck with stump of mizzenmast quantity of wreckage rested upon just above head overarching in sort of canopy then saw professor friend walking quietly about wreck examining pointing out to other such peculiarity a attracted attention when two men have exhausted interest attached to wreck watcher saw climb somewhat awkwardly up seat beside sir reginald who have two three time peered down into interior of skylight now seemed to be exhibiting sign of uneasiness sir reginald be beginning to grow fidgety at mildmay long stay below fancy remarked lethbridge need not mildmay be sailor navy man at may be trusted to take care of be very thorough in method may depend hillo what phew be octopus will be shot if have ex colonel pulled up short glanced anxiously at face of companion have of seen noticed look of horror strong repugnance upon face of three horror be kind raise from sight of dreadful object not kind be aroused upon witnessing especially dreadful occurrence waited moment to give one of opportunity to speak hoped have not seen have only caught barest momentary glimpse a creature shot suddenly up out of body of wreck before turned that glimpse be enough have seen oh what dreadful creature exclaimed lady olivia turning pale face to lethbridge what be colonel where did come from evidently have not seen be octopus giant squid a people call be very similar to ordinary cuttlefish only of course very much larger so far a must see appeared to spring from hull of wreck if will excuse for moment lady will go to pilot house endeavour to give friend yonder intimation of presence professor will be interested to know that genuine giant squid be within few yard of thus lightly speaking lethbridge sauntered quietly out of saloon closed door carefully behind dashed at break neck speed for pilot house have already made up mind what to do doubtless other fellow must understand be quick witted enough surely to grasp meaning of such action on part thought have reached thus far when arrived in pilot house grasping switch handle of great electric lantern proceeded to switch light on off rapidly act have effect of almost immediately attracting attention of three men who be sitting on skylight of wreck saw look at other a though speaking then von schalckenberg rose to foot raised hand above head to indicate that be attending thereupon lethbridge immediately began to signal in morse code by mean of long short flash message mildmay in danger seized by octopus carried into cave distance above head to message professor at once replied by waving arm in accordance with flag waving system used in british navy army right go to rescue guide to cave lethbridge gave flash indicated comprehension of communication then with switch handle still in hand intently watched through one of pilot house window movement of three saw lower down on to sand immediately begin to climb up rugged side of reef surface of rock be slippery with weed progress be therefore painfully slow at length reached point above clear of wreck von schalckenberg then turned faced pilot house evidently asking for guidance go higher bear to right signalled lethbridge men resumed climb be now making directly for spot at octopus have disappeared few minute later reached ledge with cave immediately in front of professor now again faced round inquiringly lethbridge signalled be spot von schalckenberg threw up arm to indicate that understood then lethbridge saw three men stand confer together for moment then drawing dagger switching on light three plunged into cave vanished leaving solitary watcher in pilot house in state of painful suspense endured for fully ten minute at length however professor one of others reappeared of dragging at long limp tentacle in moment huge body of octopus came into view with remaining two men pushing vigorously from behind a reached edge of ledge professor companion stepped round to assist other two presently great unwieldy body went rolling limply lifelessly down face of reef until lay motionless upon sand then four men made way carefully down after when having reached sand turned bent footstep in direction of flying fish chapter twenty two pirate cruiser when having reached dining room of flying fish mildmay changed out of diving suit into ordinary clothes be found that be so severely bruised strained that professor in capacity of emergency medical adviser to party insisted upon immediate retirement to cabin bed there worthy man subjected to so vigorous massage so generous anointing with certain embrocation of own concocting that two day later genial sailor be again able to be up about meanwhile sir reginald colonel sziszkinski continued examination of wreck unfortunately without satisfactory result for although succeeded in finding captain cabin bringing therefrom from of other cabin considerable number of document be found that owing to long submersion have become so completely sodden that attempt to handle while still wet reduced to pulp when alternative of carefully drying be tried became so exceedingly brittle that simply crumbled to piece while even on fragment that contrived to preserve writing be so nearly obliterated a to be quite undecipherable nevertheless preserved a much a must in hope that expert in such matter at home might be more successful than may here be stated that expert also failed name nationality of ship a well a identity of who perished in at murderous hand of savage m'bongwele remain mystery to day on third day following mildmay adventure with octopus flying fish being once more berthed on beach near spot where party have made amazingly rich haul of ruby hand have adjourned to deck after dinner to enjoy delicious coolness of breeze off sea ida have gone to bed somewhat earlier than usual that evening complaining that be not feeling very well symptom being feverish pulse slightly increased temperature toward alleviation of professor have administered fairly liberal dose of quinine sir reginald lady olivia naturally anxious in everything relating to only child health be discussing matter with von schalckenberg who be endeavouring without usual success to reassure pair who be of opinion that african climate be to blame for daughter indisposition well at length said professor if really think so nothing in world be easier than for to change can ascend into atmosphere to height please thus obtaining desired temperature can in very few hour reach other country that must care to visit be perhaps better than can go out to sea leisurely cruise about in required direction in absolutely pure air hear hear exclaimed mildmay who although chatting with mlle feodorovna have overheard professor word there be sanatorium like old ocean doctor like father neptune believe elphinstone week cruise somewhere away out there to eastward must set little darling up far more effectively than professor drug try man can do harm will bet well let say peck of ruby that will not regret well while declining modest little bet mildmay really feel more than half inclined to act upon suggestion answered sir reginald with laugh there be particular reason why must not fancy beyond fact that professor want to shoot one two of new zebra can easily return here for purpose fact be that be beginning to tire little of shore life think trip out to sea must do good do rest say so far a be concerned will gladly go anywhere do anything for ida sake answered lethbridge thanks old chap know will said sir reginald what say colonel to sziszkinski must like to go with must prefer to remain here until return go in for shooting under aegis of friend lobelalatutu thank very much sir reginald for offering choice answered russian prefer to accompany be quite of own opinion that change will do good like friend monsieur lethbridge will gladly go anywhere do anything for sake of charming little mademoiselle ida mademoiselle asked sir reginald turning to mildmay companion answered oh monsieur edouard sir reginald mean be so happy on board beautiful ship that feel will never want to leave please accept papa answer a mine also be really very much obliged to for so cheerfully readily falling in with wish said sir reginald very well then be settled that go to sea for week two a mood take now next question be where will go certainly ought to have definite objective think doe one desire to go anywhere in particular there be silence for minute two apparently one wished to go anywhere in particular if did be not sufficiently eager to feel called upon to mention fact at length lady olivia looked up have nobody suggestion to make asked with smile then will make one think will be sympathetically received by at least one of dear feodorovna have long have wish to posse really fine set of pearl not kind that one can go into jeweller shop buy know something quite out of common appears to that voyage of ours affords just opportunity for somebody to fish pearl up for from bottom of sea dare say that papa somebody else must be quite willing to do same for dear what do say what do say repeated lovely young russian why simply adore pearl then think reginald that have answer said lady olivia turning to husband right dear answered pearl fishing will suit down to ground if ocean hold pearl enough to satisfy will have now professor mildmay where must go in order to get pearl for of course must go to definite spot to look for ca go grubbing along sea bottom at random until happen to stumble upon bed of pearl oyster know most famous pearl fishing ground be situated in persian gulf off coast of ceylon answered mildmay believe added that in case be government property strictly preserved have doubt there be plenty of oyster bed be beyond reach of ordinary pearl diver be one of that must seek will not be poaching on anybody preserve if do will also stand better chance of securing good specimen before come to definite decision must like to refer to rather interesting manuscript book have in cabin book recovered from sunken wreck of daedalus under circumstance perhaps yet remain in memory observed von schalckenberg addressing sir reginald seem to remember continued having come across passage in relating to bed of pearl oyster of immense value situation of be then unknown to one except writer if will excuse moment will go fetch by mean said sir reginald from what say professor must appear that bed to refer be identical one want to find professor accordingly retreated presently returned with small leather bound much discoloured book in hand forefinger be between page opened book there yes said thought be not mistaken here be passage under heading of pearl in longitude degree minute second east exactly under equator there exists small atoll unnamed believe unknown unless be to native of matador greenwich island be in neighbourhood islet be uninhabited be little more than mere rock about quarter of mile long fifty foot wide over sea make clean breach in heavy weather lagoon be about five mile long three mile wide with good anchorage for ship in pretty uniform depth of ten fathom two mile due west of island there be shoal seven mile long by from two to four mile wide with twenty eight foot of water over shoal be almost entirely covered with pearl oyster yielding of finest most perfect gem have ever seen ' now what think of friend be that good enough for demanded professor quite good enough answered sir reginald now skipper continued turning to mildmay how far off be famous oyster bed how long will take to get there what did say be position of spot professor asked professor restated longitude um observed mildmay figuring upon piece of paper that drew from pocket be goodish step from here to there roughly about seven thousand mile a crow fly a to how long will take to get there can do distance in sixty hour by going aloft into calm belt shutting in going full speed ahead otherwise thanks very much never mind otherwise answered sir reginald be going to be sea trip be going to do at least part of in leisurely fashion say about ten to fifteen knot hour when be tired of at night can go aloft put on speed if wish now come to think of be there reason why must not start at once one appeared have reason to advance against baronet proposal accordingly mildmay forthwith adjourned to consult chart lay off course ten minute later remainder of party who be still sitting on deck awaiting return of absentee became conscious of fact that night breeze have suddenly strengthened when looked about in search of explanation saw sea about three hundred foot beneath land slipping away into gloom of night astern traveller have be at sea week pottering along on surface during day rising three hundred foot into air at night just high enough in fact to take over clear of mast of ship that might happen to encounter during hour of darkness maintaining tolerably uniform speed of ten knot through air not counting acceleration retardation of speed due to varying direction strength of several wind that met with thus have be able to sleep at night with wide open port to great comfort enjoyment manifest improvement of health a be particularly exemplified in case of little ida who be by time a well a even parent must desire hour be eleven o'clock in forenoon six bell mildmay called ship have be running on surface for about hour entire party be sitting out on deck under awning amusing in various way two lady with book on lap to be to be feared be giving scant attention ida father lethbridge russian colonel playing bull be most lovely day sky without cloud water smooth soft refreshing breeze be breathing out from southward ship be steering self steering apparatus having be thrown into action a other craft be in sight horizon be not to remain bare for very long however for just a mildmay rose to foot with idea of going below dull muffled boom of distant gun be heard everybody at once looking round horizon in search of source of so very novel occurrence topmast head smoke of steamer be seen just showing above ocean rim about three point on starboard bow seemed to be in hurry too if dense volume of smoke poured from a yet unseen funnel be to be taken a criterion now what craft will be exclaimed skipper a studied two masthead attentively liner must say by length of between mast probably orient orient pacific ' x z ' boat surely did not fire that gun if did not oho what be there be craft astern of can just make out masthead rising above horizon now did number two fire that gun if so why must get glass promise to be interesting will see more of presently be crossing hawse in diagonal direction edging way game of bull be forthwith abandoned a being of much le interest than advent of two strange ship on scene for singularly enough be first craft that have sighted since leaving african coast everybody at once made dash below for own especial pair of binoculars two strange craft be coming along at great rate rising above horizon very quickly thus by time mildmay returned to deck with glass in hand leading ship be almost straight ahead have risen sufficiently to show chart house above horizon to enable skipper to see that carried wheel house on top of fore end of short awning abaft wheel house yes muttered to be liner undoubtedly x z boat at unless be greatly mistaken two mast mainmast stepped long way aft two funnel amidships pretty close together yes be x z will bet hat on be steaming for be worth can see white feather ' blowing away from top of waste pipe now be racing with other chap be running away from turned binoculars upon sternmost ship be also coming along at great rate gradually lifting above horizon about length of mast two of be now showing a mildmay focussed lens upon ejaculation of astonishment escaped lip man o ' war by lord harry exclaimed yes there be upper signal yard fighting top below clear enough by piper be growing interesting indeed now who what be why be chasing british liner for be chasing beyond doubt well mildmay what do make of inquired sir reginald a at moment stepped out on deck make of answered mildmay that leading ship be x z liner steaming for be worth that second ship be man o ' war second class cruiser must say chasing dickens do returned sir reginald then what doe mean be not something rather unusual be so extremely unusual that be going to ask permission to haul up point two presently that may investigate matter answered mildmay there be only one possible explanation of be war have quite suddenly broken out between england other power yet can scarcely be either for when left home everything be quite quiet political horizon be a clear a ever be dashed if can understand anyhow elphinstone suppose be not going to jog quietly along see british ship bullied by foreigner without having word two to say about be not much answered sir reginald emphatically with flash of eye delighted mildmay know nothing of matter continued how to proceed do so take charge old chap give order will obey to letter promise thousand thanks answered mildmay of course need not tell that to interfere in case of kind with knowledge of fact be somewhat ticklish business same be not going to stop see yonder british ship flying from stranger with kind permission be going to lend hand raised glass to eye again hull of leading ship have by time almost topped horizon be now possible to see something of shape be fairly big craft measuring according to mildmay estimate about eight thousand ton whole shape appearance confirmed in original conviction that be one of x z company boat flew flag at masthead be true mildmay must now see that have hoisted blue ensign on ensign staff under command of rnr man commented a saw right old man there be friend within few mile of whose proximity probably suspect will see that come to harm now let have look at t'other chap second craft be still hull down mast funnel top of ventilator head of ensign staff be visible mildmay noticed that be showing colour fact rendered whole affair more puzzling than ever for there must be possible doubt that be chasing liner for man o ' war openly undisguisedly to chase ship not show colour be unprecedented most certainly not in accordance with recognised rule of warfare meanwhile rest of party have come on deck be intently watching two ship through binoculars a animatedly discussed puzzling situation when do intend to haul up skipper ' asked sir reginald not yet answered mildmay perhaps in about ten minute time unless anything occurs of character must make desirable to do so earlier want to see little more of game first then there have exclaimed lethbridge a flash followed by puff of brilliant white smoke issued from bow of pursuing ship jet of foam leaped up from surface of sea about mile astern of liner dissolved like steam in dazzling sunshine then boom of gun came floating down to ear of watcher four inch by sound of remarked mildmay shotted too clearly fellow be in earnest whoever may be now what dickens be explanation of enigma what be nationality of craft ca tell by build of demanded lethbridge have always understood that sailor have to look at ship to tell nationality at once at least be impression that one gather from general run of sea novel yes answered mildmay refers to old day of wooden ship there be distinctiveness in model of wooden ship be almost infallible index to nationality nowadays ship particularly war ship be built so much alike in shape except in few rather extreme case be practically impossible to identify that fellow yonder for instance might be british dutch german austrian italian japanese for one can tell by merely looking at ah there go gun shot time struck somewhat nearer throwing up three successive jet of water last of appeared to be unpleasantly close to stern of chase fellow be overhauling exclaimed mildmay now elphinstone with permission will shift helm alter course forty five degree to nor'ard so saying entered pilot house moment later watcher saw two distant craft swing back along horizon until leading ship bore two point on flying fish starboard bow if have objection sir reginald must like torpedo shell put into bow tube observed mildmay a emerged from pilot house certainly answered sir reginald will go below put one in at once better let do interposed professor know more about working of than do moreover be not so profoundly interested in affair a seem to be besides will not be gone longer than five minute at utmost sir reginald offering objection worthy man turned away vanished through pilot house door leading ship be by time within about five mile of flying fish steering course must take square across bow of latter two indeed three ship be therefore nearing other fast men fell to debating question whether not flying fish have yet be seen by of stranger craft be in usual surface running trim be to say considerably more than half of polished hull be submerged leaving little to be seen except small superstructure pilot house of be painted delicate blue grey colour must be scarcely visible against horizon astern chance therefore be strongly in favour of invisibility on other hand there be just possibility that keen eye aboard liner anxiously scanning horizon in quest of help might have sighted in case glimpse of white ensign might be comforting therefore went to flag locker drew forth white ensign in virtue of being member of royal yacht squadron sir reginald be entitled to fly ran up to truck of ensign staff whether have be seen not be difficult to say for nothing in particular followed upon exhibition unless discharge of gun from pursuing ship might be taken a reply time shot went home to mark for a observer turned glass upon chase mainmast be seen to totter fall by board cut short off by deck luckily spar did not go over side lay fore aft inboard otherwise rigging might have fouled propeller brought ship to standstill a be continued flight a though nothing have happened matter have gone quite far enough exclaimed mildmay sharply a saw liner mast fall come inside of if please may be under fire in minute two perhaps lady have better go below until affair be settled if will be so kind added with bow to lady olivia a passed in through pilot house door outside be standing when rest have entered followed closing door behind at once ascended to working chamber of pilot house whither sir reginald lethbridge have preceded first act be to increase speed of flying fish to thirty knot a moved lever forward admitting larger flow of vapour to engine cylinder lethbridge who be standing at one of window with binoculars to eye turned said what do think of mildmay what do think of what retorted mildmay stepping to side that answered lethbridge pointing to pursuing ship handing over glass for other to use unknown have just hoisted to masthead black flag with white skull cross bone in centre be not that nonsense exclaimed mildmay surely mean let have look raised glass to eye for moment stared through a though felt that must scarcely credit evidence of own sens then a thrust glass back into friend hand exclaimed jolly roger ' a be living sinner well that take cake mistake yes fellow be undoubtedly genuine up to date twentieth century pirate if have not be for last shot might have be inclined to believe whole affair elaborate joke in very worst taste man doe not shoot fellow mast away a joke chap mean business so do ah shot yes here come be firing at not at badly aimed either a spoke loud rushing sound of shot broke upon ear moment later struck sea about three yard astern of flying fish sending column of white steam like foam spray shooting twenty foot into air almost instantly shot followed judging from sound must have passed close over pilot house roof to be followed few second later by third struck water within fathom of ship sharp nose be just level with water surface owing to speed of ship be sending up fine perpendicular jet of glassy water ten foot high confound fellow impudence exclaimed sir reginald doe rascal think that be going to make prize of fine rich prize must make too did know be not explained mildmay be white ensign that doe like look of probably take for new fangled sort of british gun boat bent upon interfering with little game want to disable be one of pestilently persistent fellow who wo take hint sheer off be a full of obstinacy a be mammoth chased over yonder with jerk of thumb toward north on first trip must be treated a treated that mammoth for if kill will kill if can see here come shot be very close shave time missile passing so close athwart front of pilot house that wind actually came in sudden violent gust in through pilot house window must put stop to at once fellow will do mischief exclaimed mildmay kindly take helm for moment sir reginald if please sir reginald at once stepped to tiller laid hand on where be to steer for asked head for liner in first instance answered mildmay a threw self steering apparatus out of gear then bring ship head very gradually round until be pointing for pirate stern so saying stepped to fore midship window of pilot house laid finger lightly upon firing button controlled discharge of torpedo shell from tube in extremity of ship sharp snout so placed eye that brought jack staff forward in direct line with very small notch in window frame stood thus rigid tense while sir reginald did part of work presently saw jack staff swinging slowly round toward pirate cruiser waited thus until two sight pointed something le than eighth of length ahead of cruiser then pressed button hard a did so something flashed like sudden gleam of sunlight from flying fish stem sheet of water four five yard in length leaped into air from under bow six second later blinding flash started out from side of cruiser midway between stem foremast a flash disappeared lethbridge who be watching ship through binoculars saw great black patch on cruiser side exactly where flash have occurred while be still wondering what must mean became aware that craft be rapidly settling by head before must sufficiently recover from astonishment to utter word cruiser bow sank to level with water stern rose high in air with propeller still spinning round in second dived forward disappeared with black flag still fluttering from main truck chapter twenty three ship of mystery gone gasped lethbridge a turned round stared with startled eye at other occupant of pilot house by george mildmay be splendid shot of yours caught fair tore gap in side a big a church door torpedo shell of yours professor must be truly frightful thing for single one of to be capable of destroying ship like in moment how big must be mildmay oh know something over four thousand ton must say hillo what be matter have stopped exclaimed mildmay a ship way suddenly eased up almost with jerk yes said sir reginald quietly have stopped until can consider what be proper thing to be done next be to go on speak liner be to let go on way without communicating have liner to say about asked mildmay picking up glass from small table upon have laid down bringing to bear upon steamer yes said have stopped look a though wanted to speak see very particular reason why must not go alongside hear what have to say about affair need not tell very much about know except that be yacht flying fish cruising in water for pleasure to test value of new principle in shipbuilding be just possible that may have something of importance to communicate to very well said sir reginald let go alongside then by mean in case said mildmay must recommend that boat be got up from below be not unlikely that skipper may wish to go aboard if so be scarcely worth while to trouble to send one of own boat for a will agreed baronet know what will be correct thing to do under circumstance accordingly engine be once more sent ahead at twenty knot speed while sir reginald took helm headed ship for liner mildmay von schalckenberg stepped out on deck raised deck flap beneath boat be housed swung supporting davit into position one on quarter by time that be done pair have satisfied that boat be right quite ready for lowering flying fish be within easy enough distance of liner to enable in pilot house to read name a mildmay have shrewdly surmised be x z boat name be baroda engine be still motionless have by time quite lost way there be two men in uniform on bridge promenade deck be crowded with passenger many of whom be woman attired mostly in white flimsy muslin there be also several child playing about deck number of seaman be aft busy about fallen mast casting adrift rigging of a flying fish crossed baroda stern ranged up on latter starboard side be seen that gangway ladder have be cast loose lowered looked therefore a though skipper fully expected visit possibly sight of white ensign have caused to imagine that rescuer be a mildmay have remarked short time before in connection with pirate sort of new fangled british gun boat past experience must doubtless have taught that british naval officer have inveterate habit of getting right to bottom of thing whenever encounter anything have least smack of irregularity about hand be now on deck aboard flying fish lady looked up with marked interest at deck of towering liner occupant of looked down upon with unconcealed wonder curiosity a flying fish handled by professor came to halt within fifty yard of liner mildmay accompanied by sir reginald stepped to rail hailed in somewhat unconventional fashion baroda ahoy be flying fish royal yacht squadron belonging to friend here sir reginald elphinstone if will not be unduly detaining must like to pay visit learn from full particular of extraordinary occurrence of morning one of two officer on bridge grey haired good looking man wearing navy cap with badge upon gold lace on sleeve who have stepped over to starboard side on seeing mildmay be about to hail hereupon waved hand replied will be very pleased to see indeed stopped engine in hope that must pay visit before say anything else however let express thanks of passenger officer crew for most timely intervention just now for be afraid that matter must have gone rather badly with now hope that party will give pleasure of company to tiffin will be served in about hour time thanks very much replied sir reginald will be delighted to accept kind invitation will board few minute before tiffin time if will suit meanwhile if be anxious to proceed a doubtless be pray do so will keep company will suit excellently answered captain will stop again later to enable to board what be best speed can do sixteen half comfortably under natural draught make own pace answered sir reginald with laugh dare say can manage to keep up with whereupon there ensued muffled jingling of bell from somewhere down in liner interior propeller began to revolve churning up water into frothy swirl about rudder a gathered way began to forge ahead at same moment professor sent own engine ahead in few minute two ship a dissimilar in outward appearance a be in other respect be sweeping along amicably on parallel course with about quarter of mile of clear water between when question of how many of party must accept invitation to tiffin on board liner came to be discussed appeared that colonel sziszkinski daughter preferred to remain on board flying fish recent escape of colonel from convict ship rendered desirous that identity whereabouts must remain profound secret at least for present professor also expressed preference for quietude of usual surroundings over bustle fussiness that anticipated must ensue upon so unusual occurrence a visit of stranger to mail boat visiting party therefore consisted of lady olivia ida sir reginald mildmay lethbridge most of whom availed of opportunity to scribble hasty letter two to friend at home be about quarter of hour after two bell have pealed out on board baroda that visiting party stepped out on deck from pilot house of flying fish equipped for excursion be evident that officer of watch on liner bridge have received instruction to keep sharp look out for for immediately upon appearance steamer sheered in toward consort until have approached within easy hailing distance when hail came flying fish ahoy be ready to come aboard quite ready answered mildmay with wave of hand right responded figure on bridge a rang down to engine room order to stop engine will come in own boat will send one for thanks very much answered mildmay will use own boat whereupon engine of flying fish also having be stopped mildmay climbed into starboard quarter boat sir reginald then lowered then tackle having be released be hauled up to gangway ladder remainder of party descended into two minute later be alongside baroda seaman be at bottom of accommodation ladder to assist lady out of boat captain of mail boat be waiting at head of ladder to receive guest behind crowd of passenger eager to get nearer glimpse of visitor whose appearance upon scene have be so romantically opportune welcome aboard baroda sir reginald exclaimed skipper in bluff hearty manner offering hand to man whom remembered having heard so named when mildmay have hailed ship hour so before welcome lady gentleman permit to introduce be captain prescott be mr mumford chief officer perhaps will have kindness to introduce to friend ceremony of introduction having be duly performed tiffin bell rang everybody at once filed below into liner grand saloon meanwhile throb of engine betrayed fact that great ship be once more under way saloon be very spacious handsome apartment elaborately decorated with painting on panel between port with double row of column running fore aft a supporter to great stained glass skylight overhead although ship be degree two north of equator place be quite comfortably cool for wind catcher be fitted into of port created pleasant little breeze by mere movement of ship through air be further added to by presence of large handsome lace draped punkah waving to fro above table guest be of course assigned seat to right left of skipper conversation soon became general animated captain of liner started by remarking be very extraordinary looking craft of yours sir reginald small too for cruising so far afield be well be not quite so small a look answered sir reginald greater part of bulk be below water hence be difficult for one to get fair idea of size a matter of fact be six hundred foot long sixty foot extreme diameter hull be cylindrical in shape outside dimension therefore exceed of craft be must say about same tonnage by jove exclaimed skipper have idea that be anything like size noticed when first came alongside that be modelled like cigar remember seeing year ago somewhat similar craft cruising in solent belonged believe to american used to call cigar ship ' fancy be only very partial success at least in matter of speed how doe ship answer in respect seem able to keep pace with fairly well yes said sir reginald with twinkle of amusement in eye oh yes upon occasion dare say must squeeze extra knot so out of to change subject if have objection must very much like to hear full story of adventure of morning well observed skipper after know that there be very much to tell own opinion be that whole affair originated in ill advised publicity be usually given to fact when ship be about to sail with unusually large consignment of gold in safe thus for full week before sailed melbourne paper be daily proclaiming news that be to take home five hundred thousand pound worth of gold people used to come down stare at by hour a though be curiosity like sort of thing at think paper ought not to make public such matter for honest men be not very particularly interested to know how much gold ship be going to sail with such story must be frightful temptation to rogue in day when roguery have become almost science there be knowing what publication of such information may lead to well happened that during particular time there be cruiser belonging to certain power lying at anchor in bay be not going to tell name nationality because may be that suspicion of be unjust anyway be a like craft that destroyed morning by way suppose be not accident aboard a chief officer maintains yes be certain of well a be saying craft be lying there pretty nearly time that talk be going on in paper about enormous consignment of gold that be taking several of people kept coming aboard of at different time under pretence of showing great friendliness for british nation so on well of course be a civil a must be to never suspecting anything know especially a scarcely ever referred to matter of gold except once remember one of asked if statement in newspaper be true like fool answered that be well cruiser be talking about sailed two day before news being that be bound for east coast of africa thought more about until morning when upon turning out be reported to that there be something coming up astern overhauling now if have weakness be in connection with ship be good boat be proud of proud of size proud of appearance proud of speed yes especially proud of speed like to be overhauled passed by anything so sent word to chief engineer to stir up people in stoke hold in spite of that must do craft astern steadily crept up to until be hull up then notwithstanding fact that be differently painted be different in one two minor respect a to rig from craft have be so friendly with at melbourne must help suspecting that be same when began to ask why if really be same craft have turned up in wake instead of pursuing voyage to spot to be bound at once thought of gold in strong room although must help acknowledging to myself that suspicion be ridiculous idea seized hold of that have turned pirate be after gold mumford chief officer laughed in face when whispered notion into ear changed tune when opened fire upon can tell well there know rest of yarn just a well a can tell for by time must have be heaving up over horizon there be not eye aboard of that saw until other fellow opened fire on then must see very much except ensign be enough for for to tell truth thought be british man o war of sort though what must for life of tell for must see mast funnel now gentleman want to ask to be kind enough before leave to sign a witness to truth entry will be obliged to make in official log for story be such confoundedly queer one unless be well vouched for by independent person very much doubt whether owner anybody else for matter will believe sir reginald of course readily undertook to do while skipper be drafting making entry visitor chatted with passenger who insisted upon keeping for afternoon tea visit therefore did not end until nearly six o'clock evening at hour two ship parted company with mutual threefold dip of ensign flying fish be once more brought round with head to eastward four day later ship being then within three hundred mile of western end of strait of sunda weather being stark calm with absolutely cloudless sky craft at time going about ten knot steering a party stepped out on deck after lunch glanced around became aware that during period of absence from deck have raised canvas of large full rigged ship above horizon stranger be then bearing about two point on starboard bow a be first craft have be seen since have dipped ensign to baroda excited enough interest to cause everybody to make instant rush for binoculars within five minute eight pair of very useful instrument have be focussed upon be then hull down to non professional eye there be nothing at unusual in appearance be simply becalmed ship under topsail topgallantsails with course clewed up not furled cloud of minute spot must only be bird hovering round bore significance to one save mildmay even be not sure that knew quite what meant for be by mean unusual for whole flock of gull to hover in wake of ship at sea especially if there happens to be land within reasonable distance for sake of fragment of waste food daily go over ship side after meal whereas under ordinary circumstance hundred gull constitute very respectable flock there appeared to be at least ten time number hovering about stranger be unusual circumstance prompted mildmay to suggest to sir reginald that must edge little nearer to with object of seeking explanation of phenomenon baronet raising objection mildmay stepped into pilot house adjusting helm brought ship straight over bow of flying fish at same time raised speed of latter to eighteen knot under condition be not long ere stranger be near enough to admit of detail being made out with aid of excellent glass of party then became apparent to that canvas set be so old thin weather perished that have become semi transparent brilliant light of afternoon showing through so strongly that mast of rigging behind must be traced through attenuated fabric next thing about craft attracted attention be fact that of running standing rigging have parted be hanging loose swaying gently to almost imperceptible heave of ship on glass sea finally when have arrived within mile of saw that paint be so bleached blistered by sun that be difficult to say what original colour have be while much of have peeled off altogether exposing bare wood in turn have turned blue grey from long exposure to weather not soul be to be seen on board sign of life about save great cloud of bird swept hither thither round boat still hung at davit therefore be to be assumed that crew have not abandoned yet what have become of answer be supplied little later for a flying fish with stopped engine slowly drifted to within about quarter of mile of party of curious gazers suddenly caught whiff of horrible odour told whole story be ship with dead crew professor promptly dashed into pilot house backed ship off to distance at must be safe from infection then men of party held consultation a to what must be done in matter of ghastly tragedy upon have stumbled here be case wherein be desirable for obvious reason that name nationality other particular of ship must be ascertained of course must only be done by boarding be true that name nationality might perhaps be determined by simple expedient of running round reading inscription upon stern be tried with very satisfactory result only letter decipherable being insch en otter m be at once apparent that sir reginald be distinctly averse from idea of boarding ship be not to be wondered at for who be to say of what disease unfortunate crew have died might be plague cholera something equally malignant if so what guarantee be there that boarding party must not bring infection of back to flying fish even when mildmay suggested possibility that life might still be lingering in poor wretch aboard stranger still hesitated questioning prudence of exposing eight healthy person eleven if included ida nurse george chef below to serious risk of infection upon so remote probability a there might possibly be survivor of tragedy still existing yet idea having be mooted must not bring to say word must leave floating charnel house unexplored therefore appealed to von schalckenberg to say whether there be mean by use of disinfectant otherwise whereby examination of ship might be rendered possible upon latter answering in affirmative be ultimately arranged that mildmay must go alone on board learn what must that be to bring nothing away from ship skipper accordingly following professor instruction went below changed into oldest most worthless garment that must find after joined worthy german in latter own cabin there imbibed certain draught otherwise underwent elaborate preparation for projected expedition be guaranteed to render personally immune meanwhile sir reginald lethbridge got out lowered brought to gangway one of boat into mildmay presently stepped pushed off for strange ship be absent full hour more have scarcely reached empty deck of flying fish upon return when who have be watching movement from dining saloon port saw thin wreath of blue smoke go soaring upward between mast from two end of stranger mildmay have carefully set on fire chapter twenty four captain silas barker of amy pelham pausing only long enough to hoist boat to davit adventurous sailor descended to one of bathroom where professor awaited with medicated bath already prepared be to remove from person germ of infection that might perchance have brought with from ship moment that be safely immersed in further seen to be vigorously applying to face hair beard von schalckenberg made rejected clothing into bundle carefully wrapped in cloth saturated with disinfectant carrying up on deck dropped overboard result of somewhat drastic perfectly justifiable precaution be that when mildmay emerged fully clothed from bathroom professor announced to be a clean wholesome a of others of party meanwhile sir reginald having noted mildmay return waited until be safely in bathroom at once proceeded to pilot house starting engine put flying fish again on course thus when at skipper made appearance on deck exhaling powerful odour of disinfectant ship that have visited be on horizon in flame from stem to stern did work pretty effectually said sir reginald to nodding towards blazing ship suppose be proper thing to do eh undoubtedly answered mildmay must not salve see to leave drifting about derelict must only be to expose other ship to very serious danger not necessarily danger of infection peril of disastrous collision there be not slightest doubt in mind that many good ship have gone to bottom taking crew with a result of collision with derelict in dark hour of dirty windy night if derelict be fallen in with under circumstance render salving of impossible certainly ought to be destroyed yet in case of yonder ship by way be linschoten of rotterdam dirk dirkzwager master bound from batavia to amsterdam necessity be rather regrettable one for carried valuable cargo consisting chiefly of coffee indigo tobacco logbook show that sailed for home nearly three month ago be becalmed on fourth day out present position seeming to indicate that have remained becalmed ever since at least logbook make clear that met with wind for seven full week after running into calm about time appears that sickness of virulent deadly kind broke out aboard log doe not specify what be possibly because skipper did not know within twenty four hour hand be down with entry conveying information be last in book rest can only be guessed at must have be pretty bad for there be nineteen corps on board be clear enough evidence that living be too ill to dispose of dead think be need tell will not attempt to describe to what saw aboard for in first place language of mine must do justice to in second place there be good to be done by attempting to harrow feeling in accordance with wish brought nothing in shape of document otherwise away with so having told all that there be to tell will now go below write full account of affair in diary while everything be fresh in memory when party assembled on deck after dinner that evening somebody suggested that a there be now good moon coming on rendering night light beautiful remainder of voyage must be proceeded with on surface of sea by night a well a by day for sake of securing full measure of enjoyment of delightful weather then prevailing be true that method of progression must entail upon men at least four of who understood how to work ship necessity to keep watch be unanimous in declaring that must be hardship at pleasure rather than otherwise if only on account of novelty of thing new arrangement be therefore adopted that same night route chosen be through strait of sunda java sea strait of macassar sea of celebes into pacific route taking past many small island perhaps affording few novel interesting sight speed be under ordinary circumstance to be exceedingly moderate one of fifteen knot java head westernmost of three headland so named be sighted shortly after noon on following day ship entered strait at point about forty mile wide a party sat down to lunch sir reginald have ordered to be served on deck there be several craft in sight native otherwise under steam sail a flying fish drew farther into strait waterway narrowed scene became very animated passed krakatoa gazed with interest amazement at evidence of awful havoc ruin have be wrought by terrific eruption of emerged into open water again in time to witness magnificent sunset behind mountain of radja bassa on island of sumatra took sixty hour to traverse java sea helm being shifted for passage through macassar strait at sunrise on third morning out from strait of sunda balabalongan island be safely passed that same evening ere darkness fell twenty four hour later emerged into open sea of celebes again shifted helm thus far nothing of importance have happened have enjoyed glorious weather found almost constant entertainment in watching various craft fallen in with beautiful picture offered to gaze by island that have passed on evening witnessed entrance into sea of celebes there be indication that change of weather be impending somewhat rapid decline of mercury in tube of barometer be first symptom be quickly followed by dimming of hitherto crystalline blue of sky produced wild fiery smoky sunset suggestive of whole continent ablaze away down there to westward a darkness closed in there be few star to be seen quickly vanished in mistiness gradually obscured heaven moon now near full appeared for short time a shapeless film of hazy light then also vanished north east monsoon have be blowing fresh steadily for last few day died away stagnant air became close suffocatingly hot phew exclaimed sir reginald a party stepped out on deck be hottest night have have trip stark calm what doe mean skipper thought that be now in monsoon region so be a see wind have fallen calm answered mildmay moreover mercury be dropping good deal faster than like thickening up of atmosphere mean bad weather be sure of very bad weather do mean mildmay merely bit of breeze questioned sir reginald something very much worse than bit of breeze imagine be reply indeed must not greatly surprise to find that be in for regular typhoon typhoon ejaculated lethbridge who be standing close by mean something pretty bad doe well about same sort of thing a encountered upon memorable occasion when saved life of lady who be now charming gracious hostess answered mildmay what be be talking about demanded lady olivia who few foot away have happened to catch word hostess mildmay have just be telling dear that appearance point to approach of gale of somewhat similar character to occurred in bay of bengal on certain memorable occasion explained husband oh dear how dreadful exclaimed lady olivia will never forget time with shudder come to even now sometimes in dream will be in danger captain danger in such ship a cried mildmay none of course if feel nervous can go up aloft avoid by simple process of rising above can descend one two hundred foot below surface ride out there oh think must like at least certainly not last be one thing to go down to bottom in fine weather a did when be examining wreck quite to do same when hurricane be blowing of three alternative really think must prefer to remain on surface of sea watch wild commotion if must feel assured that be quite safe certainly may feel assured of lady exclaimed von schalckenberg with ship afloat in open sea may laugh to scorn fiercest gale wind may smite in wildest fury wave sweep from end to end will still go unharmed undeterred on way then let stay on surface risk must love to witness really furious storm with feeling be perfectly safe said lady so be settled when lady olivia retired to cabin night air be still calm only difference perceptible to be that whereas earlier in evening sea have be almost perfectly smooth swinging bedstead be now swaying with very perceptible movement due to fact that heavy westerly swell have arisen be now following ship be not until close upon midnight that very decided change occurred then came shower burst upon ship with true tropical suddenness violence in midst of shower wind came away strong out of westward blowing in fierce sudden gust quickly hardened down to strong rapidly increasing gale when daylight laggingly came upon scene wind be blowing with true hurricane force very high steep sea be running must undoubtedly have be still higher have not wind taken crest of sea torn off sent flying away to leeward in blinding torrent of scud water lashed wall of flying fish pilot house with sound like of continuous crash of hail although ship engine be set for speed of only fifteen knot be going through water at something more than twenty yet despite fact that be being swept from end to end by wildly breaking sea followed movement be so easy comfortable mildmay became quite enthusiastic upon subject shortly before noon sighted passed within quarter of mile big battleship be riding head to wind apparently steaming ahead dead slow at event merely at speed sufficient to give steerage way be making positively frightful weather of diving deeply into sea a met literally burying in perfect smother of whiteness have time to flow off deck ere plunged into next sea strangely enough within hour fell in with passed small gun boat undoubtedly british be rigged a barquentine three topmast be housed be hove to under lee clew of close reefed topsail small storm trysail be being flung about in manner be absolutely appalling to look at at one moment standing almost upright anon thrown down on beam end at extreme angle to onlooker deck seemed to be almost vertical yet with be making better weather of than bigger sister for though spray flew over in heavy cloud seemed to be shipping very little green water still later passed something have appearance of being capsized junk after sighted nothing more on following morning with sunrise gale broke sky cleared wind softened down finally shifted by afternoon north east monsoon be again blowing nothing remained of gale save turbulent sea that have knocked up same evening saw abreast about ten mile to north of island of tagulanda twenty four hour later sighted passed north cape on island of moro swept into great pacific ocean weather have by time again become that voyager must desire sky be of beautifully clear rich blue tint flecked here there with thin fleecy fine weather cloud monsoon swept down upon port bow in cool gush redolent of exhilarating smell of open ocean very life giving tonic long low mound of pacific swell wrinkled with sweep of breeze just sufficed to give life in long easy plunging movement to hull of flying fish at one moment lifting sharp pointed nose twenty foot of fore body clear out of blue sparkling brine anon causing to dive into on coming undulation until be buried nearly midway to superstructure about mid afternoon passed small island lay dozen mile to northward of course about hour before sunset still smaller one be sighted almost directly ahead a usual glass in ship be at once brought to bear upon for despite ever fresh ever changing beauty of sea sky break in monotony of be always welcome even such object a barren rock becomes interesting mildmay do notice anything peculiar about island ahead asked sir reginald when have be peering through binocular for minute so look to very much like wreck of sort upon remarked lethbridge be wreck said wreck of small craft apparently schooner have just be looking at uncommonly awkward spot to be cast away upon said sir reginald why be mere rock by look of yet not quite rock for there be grass on few stunted bush whole place can not be much more than ten acre in extent a live there be people upon can see smoke flicker of fire be right elphinstone there be fire there have just caught sight of said lethbridge well said sir reginald must stop take off although much like idea of admitting stranger to ship so giving show away ' to certain extent of course ca allow consideration of sort to weigh with where question be one of saving life nobody must contrive to sustain life for length of time on little patch of earth why if gale must spring up must be washed off for dead certainty ay be fact that there be disputing agreed mildmay after know elphinstone there be need for to make people acquainted with fact that be on aerial submarine a well a ordinary ship need know very little more about than people of baroda know can trans ship into next craft belonging to civilised nation that fall in with yes of course can assented sir reginald fuel seems to be pretty damp poor chap there be good deal more smoke than fire there to thinking that take be intentional said mildmay have probably seen be making that big smoke to attract attention with permission elphinstone will hoist ensign to let know that have seen will get one of boat ready for lowering right skipper will come lend hand with boat perhaps must be a well to get boat to quarter must a be henceforth going to remain on surface until can say good bye to people mildmay agreed that must in few minute boat be hanging from davit over ship two quarter ensign flying from staff by time ship be within two mile of island interested watcher have caught sight of man standing upon highest point of mere hand breadth of territory waving arm a though still doubtful whether have succeeded in attracting attention there seems to be one man there observed lethbridge a two men joined if so must have have pretty bad time of how long will have be there wonder not very long suspect answered mildmay probably got cast away in gale that have two day ago five minute later engine of flying fish be stopped presently when have sufficiently lost way one of boat be lowered sir reginald mildmay went away in there be beach to speak of on island be so exceedingly small that swell ran right round making beaching of boat difficult dangerous matter castaway however there be one solved difficulty by watching opportunity rushing down into water after retreating wave flinging bundle into boat before on rush of next sea came be elderly man rather tall slim of build somewhat cadaverous of feature with light straw coloured hair goatee beard be fast changing to white appeared to be about fifty year of age be yankee from crown of hatless head to sol of salt stiffened boot thank ' e stranger gasped a scrambled in over bow of boat recovered possession of bundle that have flung in ahead of be right guess can shove off now be alone then demanded sir reginald a sent boat engine astern yes sirree be a much alone a ever want to be silas barker be sole survivor of wreck of fore aft schooner amy pelham of be owner master crew consisted of seven hand besides one of be gone to long home how managed to escape be solemn mystery for when schooner struck be knocked down stunned by first sea broke over knew more until woke up found lyin ' on shore of lonely spot clutchin ' grass with hand water washin ' up round tryin ' to claw off ag'in when did happen mr barker demanded mildmay two day ago answered barker mind admittin ' to gentleman that have be longest two day ever spent seems to good deal nearer like two month to be two day alone ashore in country be nothin ' more than mere pleasant change to be two day alone on bit of earth hardly big enough to build house upon whew want more of 'em did see nothing more of of crew when came to after being washed ashore asked sir reginald nary one of answered barker shark got most likely only wonder did get too say mister what sort of steamer do call of yourn darn ugly button be firedest queer lookin ' packet that ever set eye on what may be doin down in here latitoods be yachting for benefit of little daughter health answered sir reginald briefly a boat ranged up alongside gangway ladder baronet waved not altogether welcome guest to precede to deck where rest of party awaited arrival evenin lady gent remarked barker affably a passed in through gangway gazed about inquisitively fine weather ai after shindy rude boreas kicked up two day ago allow interposed sir reginald who have closely followed castaway in on deck dear to lady olivia be captain silas barker only survivor of wreck of schooner amy pelham be cast away two day ago wife lady elphinstone mlle sziszkinski colonel sziszkinski colonel lethbridge professor von schalckenberg gentleman who be in boat with be captain mildmay je ru salem exclaimed barker a insisted on shaking hand with of person named seems to that at last great ambition of life be bein ' gratified by gettin ' on intimate term with nob quite distinguished comp'ny be sure sir presume be lord elphinstone oh dear answered individual addressed with smile despite be merely sir reginald sir reginald commented barker well guess amount to pretty much same thing where be crew sir reginald see hand about deck need answered sir reginald work ship ourselves so far a need working now if must like to go below mr barker have wash brush up servant will show to cabin if be hard up for linen change of clothes can perhaps fit out amongst well be uncommon handsome of sir reginald be sure answered barker fact be that have got here regarding bundle somewhat doubtfully shift of clothes got out of cabin of schooner morning guess be pretty damp quite so understand returned sir reginald will have suit of mine will probably be able to get into without much difficulty guess will be able to git into turn round come out again remarked barker eyeing host splendid proportion with undisguised admiration same sir if mind will have 'em for will be dry be most awful subject to rheumatism at juncture george appeared in obedience to sir reginald instruction conducted new guest to vacant cabin indicated to whereabouts of bathroom laid out one of sir reginald blue serge suit for together with such other necessary a exigency of condition demanded what extraordinary creature exclaimed lady olivia with laugh a soon a man be safely out of earshot distinctly queer fish commented lethbridge very much so agreed sir reginald yet doubt very worthy fellow in own peculiar way must not surprise if find conversation rather entertaining same will be glad of decent opportunity to trans ship now what about pearl be to take with to island let see what be about give secret away to in fact be afraid that will be obliged to take with observed mildmay unless indeed something come along between now then into can transfer need not give away secret of position of island think yankee be very inquisitive very cute can work traverse will effectually puzzle think how inquired sir reginald simply by steering one course during day when be up about course at night true course for island after have turned in then have better do said sir reginald secret of position of pearl island be von schalckenberg must remember fact that be kindly permitting to share in profit by knowledge ought to make especially careful not to betray knowledge to total stranger who for aught that know to contrary might perhaps return to spot clear oyster off yes concurred professor be so friend what say be very true at same time must remember that poor man have just met with what to be doubt very heavy loss think therefore must contrive to fish up for small parcel of pearl of sufficient value to recoup loss chapter twenty five barker treachery presence of barker in ship working by mildmay of traverse presence seemed to render desirable somewhat prolonged passage of flying fish to von schalckenberg pearl island full week thus elapsed between date upon have taken man on board that upon arrived at destination during nothing be sighted barker made that week lively time indeed for rest of party for what between quaint manner mode of expression interminable string of yarn that spun kept continuously at high water level of hilarity possessed in very high degree faculty of telling story humorously even contrived to infuse certain measure of humour into relation of most recent misfortune finding in touch with thoroughly appreciative audience appeared to throw heart soul into task of entertaining by way of repayment of hospitality when presently began to grow somewhat accustomed to singularity of manner speech sensitiveness to have begun to wear off told other that queer fish a be be not bad sort only quality indeed in still continued to jar upon be phenomenal inquisitiveness appeared not to know meaning of rudeness impertinence sought to pry into everything seemed genuinely surprised puzzled when sir reginald somewhat curtly yet courteously excused from complying with request to be shown over ship have everything explained to yet be almost impossible to feel angry with because appeared to be so overwhelmingly grateful for deliverance from imprisonment upon mere speck of out of way inhospitable islet that be always talking about always striving to give expression to gratitude in way other to extent be case indeed that quickly became embarrassing almost to extent of annoyance to rest of party there be nothing did that did not want to assist in found utmost difficulty in making understand that must really prefer that did not take turn with others at night watch in pilot house quickly realised that must be quite impossible for to preserve from secret of nature of operation at pearl island therefore made virtue of necessity frankly told about matter merely retaining position of island from a might be expected exhibited utmost interest in plan promptly demanded to be made useful in carrying out of operation also a might be expected betrayed diffidence about making suggestion that must be permitted to share in such good fortune a might attend labour atoll be sighted little after ten o'clock in morning by eleven o'clock ship have safely entered lagoon come to anchor a nearly a possible in centre islet a von schalckenberg book have stated be little more than mere rock be of coral formation appeared to be merely volcanic seismic upheaval of one small portion of oval ring of coral formed lagoon looked at broadside on so to speak bore resemblance in appearance to whale asleep on water sand have washed up become lodged among inequality of rock surface deposit of bird have converted into soil poor a looked sufficed to nourish small clump of coconut palm reared from highest point of islet rose thirty foot above surface of ocean shoal upon oyster bed be reputed to exist lay two mile to westward of islet have be sighted from deck of flying fish shortly before arrival in lagoon position being indicated by very distinct discoloration of water ship having be moored two boat be lowered into water party made excursion to islet to view place fill in interval before luncheon islet be so small however so absolutely devoid of interest that hour sufficed party to become perfectly acquainted with be repaid for trouble by discovery of long willow saucer like depression with smooth bottom offered perfectly ideal facility for deposit of oyster while undergoing process of decomposition be preliminary to finding of such pearl a may contain there be doubt that must render island immediate vicinity almost intolerably offensive to olfactory nerve a lagoon be to windward of islet ship be moored mile half away from be believed that occupant must suffer inconvenience from source luncheon over two small net with sufficient length of rope to reach from surface to sea bottom on shoal together with couple of shovel two rope ladder be got out put into boat while mildmay professor arrayed in diving suit armour thus equipped two boat with six men of party set out for shoal sir reginald professor barker going in one boat while mildmay lethbridge sziszkinski went in other passage through reef lay to windward boat therefore be obliged to run two mile to eastward to get outside clear of reef then go either north south for about distance of two half mile to get round to back of reef island ere must shape course for shoal luckily although there be considerable amount of swell burst upon reef with continuous sound of thunder threw up wall of diamond spray twenty foot high into clear sun lit air trade wind be blowing moderate breeze there be consequently not much sea boat therefore made excellent time arrived upon shoal three quarter of hour after leaving ship here again be favoured from fact that shoal lay almost dead to leeward of atoll two mile distant from be therefore in somewhat sheltered water a regard swell sea neither of broke on shoal boat having anchored within few yard of other well in toward centre of shoal rope ladder be dropped over side of net be lowered to bottom of containing one of shovel then mildmay professor descended to bottom where met water be beautifully clear light good be therefore able to see without difficulty single glance sufficed to show that account of shoal in von schalckenberg book be in sense exaggerated one stood upon bed of pearl oyster so thick that sand must not be seen moreover oyster be of unusual size not of course that signified anything because be not always largest oyster yield finest pearl professor glanced about taking in a comprehensive view of surroundings a dense medium in be immersed must permit took up oyster two at haphazard looked at then said to mildmay appears to to be quite useless to attempt anything in way of making selection only thing that can do be to take oyster a come shovel into net until be full then signal to in boat to draw up while doing must keep wary eye for shark not that creature must hurt attired a be in armour there be danger that might be seized carried so far away before must free that might be impossible to find way back to boat if therefore of must appear upon scene must use dagger right quickly surrounding water be however quite clear of everything of menacing character at moment two men therefore got to work spreading mouth of net wide open simply shovelling oyster into until be full when signalled to in boat to haul up process continued for something over hour until boat be about half full time have arrived for to return to island return journey be uneventful except in so far a showed that boat be loaded quite a deeply a be desirable for safe negotiation of part of passage lay to windward of atoll when once be safely inside lagoon proceeded straight to spot already chosen by for purpose discharged cargo into willow basin of rock afternoon haul amounted to thousand of oyster now saw that basin be sufficiently capacious to accommodate at least fortnight catch reckoning upon basis of afternoon work on following day same party again went out making two trip to shoal one in morning one in afternoon thus continuing for fortnight by time saucer like depression in rock be full while about half of entire catch be in sufficiently advanced stage of decomposition to admit of being examined pearl abstracted therefrom a will be supposed be most disgusting intensely disagreeable task return be so unexpectedly rich that revolting character of work be quickly lost sight of in interest with discovery after discovery be made of pearl for size shape purity of colour promised to prove priceless first day work among putrid fish resulted in taking on board at night ordinary ship bucket nearly full of pearl considerable proportion of might be ranked a specially valuable proportion of seed pearl be singularly small toward close of second day work be considered of so little value comparatively a to be not worth time trouble of collecting to attempt to put anything more than merest approximate estimate of value upon catch be of course quite out of question when result of third day labour be added to of first second von schalckenberg who claimed to be something of authority in such matter declared that whole must be worth not far short of one hundred thousand pound if indeed did not exceed that value enthusiasm with men have be working at highly unpleasant task of extracting pearl from loathsome envelopment have so far cooled by end of third day that have be unanimously resolved to take change of occupation on following day by again going out to shoal securing further supply of oyster suggestion emanated from von schalckenberg in first instance made upon plea that change be very highly desirable in interest of health proposal have be eagerly welcomed by hand most of whom have already begun to complain of nausea to exhibit more le marked distaste for food that there really be distinct need for precaution seemed to be borne out next morning by fact that when party mustered for breakfast barker be found to be absentee upon george being dispatched to cabin to awaken upon assumption that have overslept man presently returned with message to effect that absentee be suffering from splitting headache that required breakfast that guessed must spend morning in bed if be same to others whereupon von schalckenberg paid professional visit looked at tongue asked few question sent draught to take sir reginald who now that wife child be with have evinced rather marked tendency toward over anxiety in matter relating to sickness be very particular in inquiry a to invalid condition be with difficulty reassured by professor assertion that there be certainly nothing worse matter with than possibly slight attack of biliousness remaining five men therefore went away in boat after breakfast sir reginald taking precaution to carry telephone along with in order that lady olivia might have mean of communicating with in event of further more serious symptom manifesting in case of sick man arrived at shoal diver mildmay von schalckenberg a before went down got to work be absence be felt when came to hauling up full net weight of proved to be rather too much for one man to handle therefore became necessary to haul up net one at time discharge into same boat when be a full a be thought desirable leave shifting over to other boat loading in same way consequence of be that be late in completing cargo be already considerably past luncheon hour when at length lifted anchor started back toward lagoon nothing have be heard in mean time from lady olivia from circumstance be deduced that patient be at event worse scarcely however have boat got under way when bell of telephone in sir reginald pocket began to ring whipped instrument out with remark hillo what doe mean nothing very serious hope pressed thumb of one hand upon small red knob of instrument with other hand inserted tube of into ear almost instantly heard wife voice calling to reginald reginald be there can hear dear be here can hear quite distinctly answered sir reginald what be matter nothing wrong with barker hope be worse worse echoed lady olivia voice in accent of intense indignation there be nothing matter with wretch except that have stolen flying fish be making off with ejaculated sir reginald in tone of such profound consternation that in other boat heard von schalckenberg sheering in close alongside demanded to know what be wrong sir reginald still listening at telephone held up hand for silence lady olivia be still speaking yes be quite true continued have scarcely be gone hour morning when suddenly presented in music room where feodorovna be sitting called mlle sziszkinski out of room suspecting nothing poor girl at once went few minute later returned alone presenting revolver at head ordered to follow warning at same time that if raised slightest outcry of kind must shoot dead scoundrel consummate blackguard ejaculated sir reginald through set teeth yes dear go on be listening added of course went for there be nothing else to do continued lady olivia looked so fierce so determined in such deadly earnest that felt sure must carry out threat if disobeyed led up to pilot house there found poor little ida whom have believed to be out on deck playing reading bound hand foot with gag in mouth sir reginald drew in breath sharply said nothing moment entered pilot house closed door placing back against pointed to ida saying see ma'be there be child if will look closely at will see have lashed up so tightly that if must speak must tell that be mighty uncomfortable indeed must see that brute be only speaking truth much le than truth in fact for be clear that poor darling be suffering torment oh reggie tried to get to to release that brute raised pistol pointed at saying if offer to touch will blow brain out if want to gain release tell what know about working of ship a soon a be outside reef may release child what must do reggie simply must not stand there see darling suffering so asked what wanted to know said that first thing wished to know be how to raise anchor showed then asked how engine be worked showed that taking care however only to show how worked at lowest speed kept there with until ship have passed through passage in reef then told that might take brat go needed second bidding may be sure snatched up poor little thing took straight down into own cabin where excepting for few moment necessary to release feodorovna from confinement in cabin nurse have be busy ever since chafing poor limb soothing a well a must suffered agony at first be better now have gone to sleep good responded sir reginald be now going to consult with rest a to what be best to be done yet put telephone away may wish to speak with again then sir reginald in a few word a possible repeated lady olivia story to others ending by asking mildmay a experienced seaman what must advise first thing to be done be to heave oyster overboard a quickly a can get rid of next of course be to go full speed ahead in chase of ship will be desperately long chase however for boat can only run twelve knot while ship even at slowest will be going quite ten precisely assented baronet then there be question of how be going to find ship for of course be far out of sight of atoll by time true assented mildmay be thinking about too ask lady olivia what can tell about course course that fellow have be steering better take telephone old chap ask question first hand said sir reginald handing over instrument to skipper mildmay took inserting small tube in ear spoke into mouthpiece be still there lady olivia yes came instant reply what now captain want to tell what can about course that fellow barker be steering did notice yes answered lady olivia fortunately thought of that be steering due east when released so soon a got down into ida cabin took little aneroid with compass at back that hang there set on table so must watch be just eleven o'clock by clock in pilot house when passed out through reef at twelve o'clock altered course to north east by east be course that be steering at present thanks very much that will do excellently please keep eye on compass let know if make further alteration said mildmay when have received lady olivia answer handed back telephone to sir reginald drawing pencil from one pocket watch from other made brief note on one of cuff have of fellow decent sized bit of paper about asked lethbridge drew pocket book from pocket will leaf whole book be of use to asked couple of leaf will do thanks replied a lethbridge tore out two handed to with one of constructed kind of scale then with aid drew diagram on other so far a can make out said with help of rough diagram ship be at moment twenty eight three quarter mile east north east of there thereabouts will therefore run on course for next two hour twenty five minute by mean will cut off few mile then must haul up on same course a herself make dead run after then von schalckenberg spoke up may be permitted to have word two with lady elphinstone asked addressing sir reginald by mean dear fellow answered baronet here be passed over telephone taking instrument professor adjusted for use pressed black knob bell began to ring almost immediately ceased again however whereupon designer of flying fish spoke be there lady asked yes professor came reply be listening where be now madame asked von schalckenberg be still in ida cabin answered ladyship good remarked professor now please listen very attentively to what be about to say tell first be barker still in pilot house yes be steering ship think trying to find out use of lever wheel thing that see there ah exclaimed german in alarm must be stopped quick heaven only know

vigorously resumed work of relieving boat be in of burden of pearl oyster what be professor what be plan demanded sir reginald who be similarly busy in own boat plan replied professor refers to little arrangement that made when designing ship for just contingency a present matter slipped memory believe never showed to of be important that in designing ship a flying fish possible mishap must be foreseen provided against while considering matter occurred to that by mean of treachery otherwise undesirable person might possibly succeed in gaining possession of pilot house when ship in must be practically at mercy of person therefore included in design arrangement whereby simple movement of lever must cause plate to slide out from interstice in wall of pilot house thus completely shut off structure from rest of ship making prisoner of who might happen to be in be have just dir at juncture bell of telephone again began to tinkle without stopping to finish remark professor seized instrument adjusting for use spoke into single word yes have done a directed came lady olivia voice a said must be case man be now shut up in pilot house heard sound made by closing of slide at once

have just cut off flow of vapour at generator in consequence of engine have stopped for one thing for barker may now play a much a plea with lever valve in pilot house without doing mischief answered von schalckenberg two boat be by time off southern extremity of reef with last oyster of cargo gone overboard be therefore running light buoyant over long swell sea with have to contend two minute later mildmay gave word for to shift helm haul up to new course of east north east a did so pulled out watch noted time exactly eight bell four o'clock remarked must drive little hooker through for be worth will have darkness upon before sight ship flung somewhat anxious glance aloft at heavy rather threatening aspect of sky for within last half hour sky have thickened somewhat ragged patch of scud be sweeping swiftly along overhead with dark lowering bank of cloud behind to windward while breeze have freshened very perceptibly sea be increasing boat be already drenching occupant with heavy shower of spray that flung aft a met drove headlong into through head sea boat be magnificent little craft for size mildmay knew that matter might easily become very awkward indeed for even in short space of hour two out there in broad pacific must come on to blow at heavily moreover there be moon now night promised to be dark what if must fail to find ship boat however be doing work splendidly despite wind sea although tendency of weather be undoubtedly to grow worse rather than better change be so gradual at first a to be scarcely perceptible sunset night be wild sunset of smoky scarlet fiery orange in midst of stormy flare of greenish purple cloud when sun disappeared boat still have very nearly hour to run before reaching point at mildmay estimated that ought to shift helm again to get into track of ship taking into consideration retardation of boat by adverse influence upon of wind sea allowed extra ten minute then gave order to haul up to north east by east by time be pitch dark starless blowing strong with very awkward amount of sea running for such small boat to battle with fortunately mildmay professor have with diving dress electric lamp formed part of equipment thus possessed mean of lighting up card of boat compass so ensuring that be steering correct course according to reckoning said mildmay ought now to be on very near track of ship within about five mile of thereabout if be daylight must expect to see by time a be must keep look out for saloon light professor have that can do to keep boat running straight so will have to depend upon other fellow to look out confine yourselves to looking straight ahead keep look out broad on bow a well calculation be only approximate must remember for next ten minute perfect silence reigned in boat for helmsman be intently watching compass while others be straining eye through darkness in hope of catching glimmer of light from flying fish saloon port more than once one of opened lip to cry out that saw only to realise next instant that have be deceived by phosphorescent gleam of head of breaking sea at length however lethbridge broke tense silence with joyous cry of light ho right ahead at same instant that sir reginald cried out see there be straight ahead of good shot skipper yes there be undoubtedly when boat topped sea must just make out four light shining from dining saloon port somewhat farther forward be doubtless light of ida cabin sir reginald seized telephone rang up wife to encourage with news that boat be close at hand ten minute later dashed alongside ship be lying broadside on to wind sea rising falling easily over fast gathering swell scarcely rolling at hull thus afforded capital lee for boat mildmay boat be first to reach foot of gangway ladder up sir reginald sprang at single bound a seemed closely followed by lethbridge take care how go elphinstone called colonel remember that fellow have revolver never fear answered baronet will look after dashing at pilot house door sir reginald flung open to find face to face with barker who be sitting composedly on bottom step of ladder smoking pipe started to foot in horror amazement at sight of sir reginald well darn ugly got further in exclamation for at sight of sir reginald long pent up anger broke loose exclaiming despicable coward ungrateful scoundrel struck out catching man fairly under jaw knocking backward with staggering crash upon metal step of pilot house steady squire steady mumbled man in tone of remonstrance there be call to knock about be there where in nation did call to knock about blackguard thundered furious baronet if be to break bone in body there must be ample excuse for attempted theft of ship be nothing be brutality to wife child at moment inner door of pilot house slid open for lady olivia have be listening expectantly at sound of husband voice have thrown back lever look here continued sir reginald restraining with difficulty a pointed to open door march down there go straight to cabin will do mischief squire there be call for call at mumbled soothingly a sidled out of pilot house keeping wary eye upon sir reginald who followed closely how in nation did find darned ship persisted insatiable curiosity gripping hard a proceeded along corridor toward cabin made sure that if must run out of sight of island then shift helm must be right so must if darned engine have broken down with gesture sir reginald sped through door of cabin that have occupied followed in where be that revolver with threatened wife daughter demanded baronet barker drew out of pocket handed to sir reginald with nearest approach to grin that swollen bleeding feature must permit bluff squire pure bluff remarked a baronet took from nary cartridge in must have raised one to save life answered just same say what air going to do with eh sir reginald dropped revolver into pocket without word passed out of cabin closing locking door behind from there went out on deck again to find remainder of party busy upon hoisting securing of second of two boat helped with work then with brief word two of heartfelt thanks to mildmay others for skill resource by have be enabled to get so cheaply out of such ugly adventure retired below joined wife in ida cabin where mutual confidence be exchanged child be now awake quite lively again apart from poor little chafed swollen wrist ankle seemed little nothing worse for share of adventure satisfied at length of sir reginald retired to cabin discarded saturated clothes took bath proceeded to dress for dinner night over dinner table question be raised of what must be done with prisoner of course said sir reginald must take home with charge with piracy get punished must involve just publicity that for many reason desire to avoid on other hand have very strong feeling that fellow must be punished not so much perhaps for what have actually done a for what apparently be perfectly willing to do what sort of scheme have in mind when plotted to steal ship be very difficult to say for think may take for granted that be absolutely ignorant of diving flying power be clear enough that whatever intention may have be must have indeed did unhesitatingly leave five of to perish on barren rock knew afforded neither food water be brutal indifference to consequence to others of nefarious scheme that to mind call for punishment must rightly serve if be to take back put upon place from rescued suggested sziszkinski must have right to complain if did answered sir reginald must be equivalent to passing death sentence upon for must not exist there longer than few day must not willingly compass fellow death entertain feeling of vindictiveness toward punish however will that pretty severely too if only to deter from engaging so light heartedly in similar enterprise in future think that perhaps case may be fitly met by marooning on suitable spot where can keep alive without too great difficulty from be not likely to effect escape very readily yes agreed mildmay something of sort ought to teach good wholesome lesson there must be plenty of suitable spot not very far from here will have out chart by by see what have to tell when later in evening chart of pacific be produced be found that outlying island of caroline group lay little more than three hundred mile to northward of spot at moment occupied by ship be at once determined to try among for suitable marooning place a sir reginald be quite naturally anxious to get rid of prisoner a speedily a possible von schalckenberg descended to engine room once more turned on vapour flying fish then ascended to neutral belt heading due north proceeded for three hour at full speed at expiration of period engine be stopped came to halt for remainder of night dawn be just tingeing eastern sky with pallor when mildmay opened eye rising from exceedingly comfortable bed walked over to port looked out everything be still wrapped in darkness below upon gazing steadfastly into gloom for few minute believed that must descry certain darker patch here there at great distance ought to be doubtless be island thereupon slid foot into pair of soft slipper betook to pilot house where by manipulation of certain valve lowered ship to within three hundred foot of surface of sea then proceeded outside to deck carefully inspected surroundings from situation dawn be brightening fast object below be beginning to show with distinctness therefore although ship being afloat in air engine at rest felt wind aspect of sea beneath fact that flying fish be perceptibly drifting to southward westward told that brisk north easterly wind be blowing at much lower altitude at ship be now floating surrounding islet there be three of showed to eye at something very nearly approaching correct distance apart in fast growing light something of true character also stood revealed thus solitary observer noted that while two of six mile apart be simply extensive reef of bare coral rock with multitude of narrow intricate channel of water running hither thither through third nine ten mile to southward be atoll of very similar character to of pearl island have so abruptly left on preceding day considerably larger quite extensive grove of coco palm growing upon have appearance of being very suitable spot for purpose that have in mind therefore retired to pilot house re started engine so headed ship that must pas over when presently reached turned head to wind so adjusted speed of engine that must just stem breeze again went out on deck to reconnoitre now saw that island beneath be about two mile long by about mile in breadth well clothed with grass bush two three hundred coco palm that there be rivulet of presumably fresh water bubbling up at one point meandering down to lagoon be spacious one of about ten mile long by seven mile broad with depth of water appeared ample enough to float anything islet be also uninhabited for have clear view of whole of must discover nothing that even remotely resembled hut not even with aid of binoculars so satisfied at length that have found kind of spot that sir reginald have in mind eye mildmay took ship over lagoon allowed to settle gently into placid water let go anchor then very well content with went below took bath dressed for day be out on deck again sauntering fore aft deck taking occasional peep at island through binoculars while waiting for breakfast gong to sound when sir reginald appeared glancing about at surroundings advanced to mildmay side a said good morning skipper glorious morning be where be spot that have brought to be one of carolines without doubt answered mildmay precisely one can not say until have taken observation for can not quite identify with laid down on chart anyhow be outlying island sufficiently far from of usual ship track to give friend barker good wholesome spell of solitary confinement to fix upon memory evil of way before obtains release be amply big enough to support afford sufficiency of exercise need never starve with coconut tree to hand can let have fishing line two suppose to enable to provide with change of diet burning glass with to make fire there be stream of water take to be fresh from can slake thirst if feel disposed to give to sleep in one of small waterproof tent that have down below have never yet have occasion to use fellow ought to be able to make exceedingly comfortable while will have done quite enough for to set conscience at rest vast deal more than deserves if like can take run ashore after breakfast have look at place before definitely decide to land here mildmay suggestion be quite in accord with sir reginald own view on subject when after breakfast whole party landed to inspect place indulge in stroll island be found to be so very much better in way than have appeared to be that baronet felt need have scruple about leaving barker there accordingly after luncheon tent half dozen fishing line good lens to serve a burning glass saw axe few other useful odds end including small supply of food grocery to let marooned man down gently so to speak be put into boat barker be then released from confinement conducted up on deck ordered down side sir reginald mildmay following a boat pushed off headed for beach barker turned to sir reginald said well squire from look of thing in general guess be goin ' to maroon eh well here island look durn sight purtier than spot that took off of wo gainsay be here thing in boat mine what be here tent say well now be downright handsome of squire mistake here be fishin line went on to enumerate various article until have gone through then here stop bit though cried see gun powder shot where share of pearl what fished up other day mildmay stared at man for moment then burst into hearty laugh well exclaimed be cool hand barker if ever there be one coolness however will not avail here thing be that intend to give be precious sight more than deserve right skipper answered fellow be not complainin ' have got bulge on be bottom dog time only thought there be harm in just mentionin ' little matter harm in world agreed mildmay cheerily a boat forefoot slid up on smooth sand of beach will be able to amuse by mentioning good many other little matter from time to time while be here now out go will pas thing out to hour later flying fish passed out to sea through usual gap in reef by time barker have already got tent rigged fire lighted be cooking first meal there must be manner of doubt that else might be man be thoroughly sound philosopher at noon day mildmay ascertained exact latitude having thus in conjunction with usual morning observation for determination of longitude fixed exact position of ship on chart course be laid off for pearl island ship going at full speed rose into calm belt same afternoon settled down again in former berth in pearl island lagoon on following morning four men went ashore resumed disagreeable task of separating pearl from putrid mass of decomposed matter in be imbedded time persevered until have dealt with oyster that have fished up result be so enormously rich harvest of magnificent pearl that everybody be more than satisfied there be general consensus of opinion that under circumstance must be mere waste of time to stay longer at island decision be especially acceptable to sir reginald elphinstone for very soon became evident to that barker daring attempt at piracy have inflicted very severe shock upon lady olivia quickly developed into attack of nervous prostration rendered immediate return home exceedingly desirable more so that ida be also suffering from shock although not to nearly so serious extent a mother whole question be fully discussed by men after dinner on evening of clearing up day of course a might be expected be sooner recognised by rest of party that host be anxious to bring cruise to close than united in urging to take lady olivia home at once put under care of own especial physician even von schalckenberg who have be looking longingly forward to hunt for new zebra carefully refrained from mentioning even so much a word africa with inward sigh over lost might be only deferred opportunity joined persuasion to of others final outcome of discussion be decision to start for home forthwith at top speed decision arrived at chart of world be produced from be determined homeward course from little unknown spot in pacific to sir reginald elphinstone charming devonshire seat chudleigh park then party bade other good night retired to cabin mildmay only lingering behind others long enough to raise ship into neutral belt put engine at full speed ahead fix self steering apparatus on ascertained course flight took over philippine island burma northern india afghanistan north eastern corner of persia southern skirt of caspian sea southern half of black sea across austria hungary northern switzerland north of france english channel be accomplished uneventfully ship coming safely quietly to earth exactly at midnight on third day of journey from pacific after slowing down over channel to avoid unwelcome observation on arrival be such glorious may morning a be to be found at best only in lovely devon when having remained on board for rest of night taken breakfast ere leaving ship whole party walked up to chudleigh hall announced return to astonished staff of servant so unexpected arrival be naturally productive of little confusion in household matter very quickly arranged by evening of same day with assistance of farm waggon belonging to estate spoil valuable of description have be transferred from ship to house when following morning dawned flying fish have disappeared from glade in have be lying a mysteriously a have dropped into only twenty four hour previously professor mildmay have likewise vanished in equally mysterious manner calmly smilingly turned up again by late train same evening to learn gratifying news that lady elphinstone return to safety of beautiful home have already produced most beneficial effect upon health that there be now prospect of early recovery from bad effect of shock that have so recently sustained meanwhile sziszkinskis delighted with beauty of county healthfulness of climate have spent busy day prosecuting inquiry in neighbourhood for suitable residence have already found one very greatly to liking purchase of satisfactorily concluded within week thus end story of very memorable cruise cruise be destined to have far reaching result upon fortune happiness of at least of who participated in a well a to many who never heard word about for worthy professor share of ruby pearl that party brought home with provided with wealth be necessary to enable to initiate great philanthropic enterprise while be undeniable that mildmay spends unconscionable amount of time with sziszkinskis whether visit have anything to do with whispered rumour that mlle feodorovna be about to exchange russian patronymic for english name time perhaps will show
