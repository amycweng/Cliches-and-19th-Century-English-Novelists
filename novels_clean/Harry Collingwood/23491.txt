seated alongside skipper on right lady be young apparently about twenty one twenty two year of age above medium height if one must form correct judgment of stature a sat at table rich brilliant

conyers have brother sailor upon passenger list so when be so fortunate make most of by providing a in case with berth at table a nearly alongside a possible allow to make known to neighbour miss onslow permit to introduce lieutenant conyers of royal navy lady o'brien general sir patrick o'brien lieutenant conyers miss onslow beauty on left acknowledged introduction with very queenly distant bow lady o'brien looked keenly in eye for instant then shook hand with very heartily general murmured something about being glad to make acquaintance forthwith addressed with avidity to plate of soup one of steward placed before presently having finished soup general leaned forward stared hard at for moment then remarked excuse conyers be use being formal when be about to be cooped up together on board ship for next two month be be man got so shockingly hacked about at capture of piratical slaver hang have forgotten name now if refer to preciosa must plead guilty to soft impeachment answered ah exclaimed hang if did think so when heard name saw that scar across forehead wonderfully plucky thing to do sir a plucky thing think a ever heard of must get to tell about time here steward hang man sherry be corked bring bottle be rather shy man sudden identification of in connection with affair have already grown heartily tired of hearing referred to fondly hoped must now be speedily forgotten by friend be distinctly disconcerting therefore seized upon opportunity afforded by mishap to general sherry to divert conversation into channel by turning to lovely left hand neighbour with inquiry be first experience of shipboard miss onslow will be third voyage to india mr conyers answered with air of surprise at temerity in addressing such proud stately dignity lofty condescension caught thinking hillo charley lad what sort of craft be be exchanging salute with will have to take care what be about with fine fellow will be finding that of gun be shotted be not to be deterred from making effort to render agreeable simply because manner of young lady be almost chillingly distant so returned indeed then be quite seasoned traveller how doe sea use doe treat kindly if mean be ill at sea be glad to say that be not replied love sea hate voyaging upon that sound somewhat paradoxical doe not ventured to insinuate possibly doe admitted what mean be that while never enjoy such perfect health anywhere a do when at sea while passionately admire ever changing beauty poetry of ocean sky in varying mood find distinctly irksome unpleasant to be pent up for month within narrow confines of ship with possibility of escape from surroundings however unpleasant may be there be privacy change on board ship one be compelled to meet same people day after day to be brought into more le intimate contact with whether one wish not be undoubtedly true acknowledged so far at least a meeting same people day after day be concerned surely one need not necessarily be brought into intimate contact with unless so minded be not difficult to make average person understand that anything approaching to intimacy be unwelcome be not retorted drily then be afraid that experience have be more unfortunate than yours have more than once be obliged to be actually rude to people before must succeed in convincing must prefer not to be on intimate term with therewith miss onslow ever so slightly turned away from addressed to content of plate with manner seemed indicative of desire to terminate conversation thought that already began to understand very charming interesting young lady have not remotest idea who what be beyond bare fact that name be onslow style manner despite singular hauteur stamped unmistakably a one accustomed to move in high plane of society that be inordinately proud intensely exclusive be clear have idea that fault if such must be considered be due rather to training than to innate imperfection of character must conceive that barrier of exclusiveness once passed might prove to be winsome fascinating beyond power of word to express have suspicion that man who must be bold enough to attempt passage of barrier must have to face many rebuff a well a very strong probability of ultimate ignominious irretrievable defeat a be then still be for matter rather sensitive individual quickly determined that at least must not dare such fate moreover seemed to find in drift of what have said more particularly in manner of saying hint possibly might be one of with whom must prefer not to be on term of intimacy well thought if be wish will certainly be gratified be surpassingly beautiful creature can admire enjoy contemplation of beauty a must that of rare exquisite picture without obtruding offensively upon attention although have appearance of being clever refined possessed of brilliant intellect quality will have irresistible attraction for if intends to hide behind cold haughty repellant manner therewith dismissed from mind addressed to skipper new ship of yours be magnificent craft captain said fell incontinently in love with a waterman be pulling off alongside be far away most handsome ship have ever set eye on ay answered dacre heartily whole face kindling with enthusiasm be beauty mistake have fine handsome frigate in service mr conyers doubt whether best of will compare with city of cawnpore for beauty speed seagoing quality word sir must have done good to have seen before be put into water shapely shapely be not word for be absolutely beautiful be to other craft what here eye rested upon miss onslow unconscious face for instant perfectly lovely woman be to fat old dowdy there be only one fault have to find with be only fault in eye there be many who regard a positive important merit pray what may be inquired a asked question several of passenger who have overheard skipper remark craned forward over table in eager anticipation of reply why sir answered dacre be built of iron instead of good sound wholesome heart of oak be fault find with have never be shipmate with iron before confess like of course continued judging perhaps from of passenger look that have said something trifle indiscreet be only prejudice on part ca explain objection to iron everybody who ought to know anything about matter declares that iron be immensely strong compared with wood sincerely believe still there feeling be expect will take month two to get over see have be brought up have spent upwards of forty year of life in wooden ship suppose be growing trifle too old to readily take up newfangled notion ah captain have met with men of sort before remarked general be by mean first person with prejudice will get over dear fellow will get over when have done so will acknowledge that there be nothing like iron for shipbuilding apropos of seafaring matter what sort of voyage do think will have skipper shrugged shoulder who can tell answered everything depends upon weather what be more fickle than outside limit of trade wind monsoon mean of course if be unlucky enough to meet with long spell of calm on line well that mean long passage give a much wind a can show plain sail to farther for'ard than abeam will undertake to land at calcutta within sixty day from to day be still discussing probability of skipper being able to fulfil promise when howling squall swept through taut rigging between mast of ship causing whole fabric to vibrate with barely perceptible tremor while swish patter of heavy rain resounded upon glass of skylight ejaculated general what lively prospect for to night what be to do after dinner to amuse ourselves where be men to go for smoke think said will find very comfortable place for smoke under overhang of poop tide be ebbing strong by time so ship will be riding more le stern on to wind will find very satisfactory lee shelter at spot have named ay assented skipper when have finished smoking what can wish for better than fine saloon in to play card read even to organise impromptu concert there be capital piano abaft there be sure that among so distinguished company there must be plenty of good musician so indeed proved for when having finished smoke general dozen more of returned to cuddy found that several of younger lady of party have already produced music be doing best to make evening pas pleasantly for others miss onslow be one of exception have not produced music apparently did intend to take anything more than passive part in entertainment indeed be going almost too far to say even so much a for appeared doubtful whether even condescended so far a to regard a one of audience have provided with book have curled up comfortably in corner most distant from piano be reading with air of absorption interest so pronounced a really to be almost offensive to performer in almost anyone else manifestation of so profound indifference to effort of others to please must have be regarded a indication of ill breeding in case well be so regally entrancingly lovely that somehow one felt a though beauty justified everything that be act of condescension favour that graced cuddy with presence at indeed be very much disposed to think that be own view of matter be that a may spent exceedingly pleasant evening when turned into bunk night felt very well satisfied with prospect of voyage before chapter two at sea wreck in sight be awakened at six o'clock next morning by men chorussing at windlass quick clank of pawl showed how thoroughly jack be putting heart into work how quickly be walking ship up to anchor scrambled out of bunk took peep through port in ship side to see what weather be like be scarcely daylight yet glass of port be blurred with quick splashing of rain sky be simply blot of scurrying dirty grey vapour made quick mental reference to condition of tide deducting therefrom direction of ship head thus arrived at fact that wind still hung in same quarter a yesterday about south east after turned in again weather being altogether too dismal to tempt out on deck at so early hour a did so there be loud cry command chorussing at windlass abruptly ceased in silence temporarily ensued caught muffled sound of steam blowing off from tug waste pipe mingled with faint sound of hailing from somewhere ahead answered in stentorian tone of mr murgatroyd voice then windlass be manned once more pawl clanked slowly sullenly irregularly for time growing slower slower still until there ensued long pause during heard mate encouraging crew to special effort by shouting heave boy heave raise dead break out pawl heave so on then there occurred sudden wrenching jerk followed by shout of triumph from crew windlass pawl resumed clanking at rapid rate for few minute longer when finally ceased knew that anchor be trip that have started on long journey everybody appeared at breakfast that morning naturally there be nothing to prevent for be still in river in smooth water ship glided along so steadily that of be actually ignorant of fact of being under way until made aware of by certain remark passed at breakfast table after breakfast weather being a dirty a ever donned mackintosh pair of sea boot with have provided in anticipation of such occasion a went on deck to look round smoke pipe few other men followed example among others general who presently joined in perambulation of poop soon found that despite certain peremptoriness dictatorial assertiveness of manner attributed to profession position in be very fine fellow most agreeable companion with apparently inexhaustible fund of anecdote reminiscence incidentally learned from that miss onslow be daughter of sir philip onslow indian judge friend of sir patrick o'brien that be proceeding to calcutta under chaperonage of lady kathleen general wife while be still chatting together young lady came on deck well wrapped up in long tweed cloak reached to ankle general with apology to for desertion stepped forward gallantly offered arm accepted remained on deck whole of morning with wind blustering about rain dashing in face time that faced in passage from wheel grating to break of poop to great benefit of complexion be only lady who ventured on deck that day for weather be so thick that there be nothing to see beyond occasional buoy marking out position of sandbank grimy geordie loaded down to covering board driving along up river under brace of patched sooty topsail inward bound south spainer in tow of tug fact of being only representative of sex on deck appeared to disconcert miss onslow not at be a absolutely self possessed a though general have be in sole possession of deck a indeed be so far a be concerned for calmly utterly ignored presence of rest of excepting skipper with whom with general conversed with much vivacity by arrival of tiffin time have drawn far enough down river to be just meeting first of sea knocked up by strong breeze noticed that already few of seat at table have be occupied at breakfast time be vacant among that of lady o'brien left hand neighbour exhibited thoroughly healthy appetite due in part probably to long promenade on deck in wind rain be still a stately distant in manner a ever however when attempted to enter into conversation with met with such scant encouragement ere meal be half over desisted leaving to skipper task of further entertaining by six o'clock night be abreast of buoy mark longnose ledge when pilot shifted helm for elbow began to feel in earnest influence of short choppy sea into city of cawnpore be soon plunging sharp stem to height of hawse pipe to rapidly increasing discomfort of many of passenger by seven o'clock be dinner hour be well round elbow heading to pas inside goodwin through down with most of fore aft canvas set now have not only pitching also rolling motion to contend with although latter be a yet comparatively slight be still sufficient to induce further number of cuddy party to seek seclusion of cabin with result that when sat down to dinner did not muster quite dozen told among present be left hand neighbour miss onslow faultlessly attired to appearance a completely at ease a though be dining ashore general made gallant effort to occupy accustomed seat soup proved too much for be compelled to retreat muttering something apologetic not very intelligible about liver remained in tow until tug have dragged down abreast south foreland where left taking pilot with hour later be heading down channel under plain sail to topgallant sail when went on deck to get after dinner smoke prospect be a dreary dismal a must well be be dark a wolf mouth for moon be well advanced in last quarter be a good a saying that there be moon at thickness overhead not only obliterated star also rendered impossible for of light to reach one consequence of be that when standing at break of poop taxed one eyesight to utmost to see a far a bow of ship wind be freshening with frequent rain squall combined with intense darkness circumscribed visible horizon to radius of about cable length on hand through opaque blackness ship be thrashing along at speed of fully ten knot with continuous cry storming of wind aloft through rigging in hollow of straining canvas deep hissing sobbing sound of water along bend to be added rhythmical thunderous roaring of bow wave frequent grape shot pattering of spray on fore deck a fabric plunged with irresistible momentum into hollow of short snappy channel sea be black blusterous everything be dripping wet be heartily thankful therefore that be privilege to go below turn in just when pleased instead of having to stand watch strain eyeball to bursting point in endeavour to avoid running foul of of numerous craft be knocking about in channel on blind dismal night when berth steward brought coffee next morning informed in reply to inquiry that weather have improved somewhat during night that in opinion temperature on deck be mild enough for to take salt water bath in ship head if pleased accordingly jumped out of bunk hastily donning bathing togs made way on deck be sooner on foot however than became aware that ship be particularly lively be on port tack be heeling over considerably so much so indeed that when rolled to leeward to keep footing without holding on to something be pretty nearly a much a must well manage then there be continuous vibrant thrill pervading entire fabric suggestive of idea that blood be roused that be quivering with eager excitement to initiated be unfailing sign that ship be travelling fast through water upon reaching deck found watch engaged in task of washing deck polishing brasswork while mr murgatroyd a officer of watch paced to fro athwart fore end of poop pausing time reached weather side of deck to fling quick keen glance to windward aloft at bending topmast straining rigging for mr murgatroyd be carrying on driving ship quite a much a be consistent with prudence wind be true have moderated slightly from boisterous character of previous day be now steady be still blowing strong have hauled round point two until be square abeam yet although lower yard be braced well forward ship be under three royal fore main topgallant topmast studding sail with lower studding sail upon foremast be lying down to like racing yacht with foam seething hissing brimming to rail at lee roll lee scupper afloat while swept along with eager headlong impetuous speed of sentient creature flying for life wailing cry of wind aloft especially when ship rolled to windward be loud enough weird enough to fill heart of novice with dismay to ear of seaman sang song of wild hilarious sea music fittingly accompanied by deep intermittent thunder of bow wave a leapt roared glassy smooth in curling snow crowned breaker from sharp shearing stem at wild plunge of into heart of on rushing wave ran up poop ladder stood to windward fathom back from break of poop where must obtain best possible view of ship thought have never before beheld so magnificent perfect picture a presented of triumphant domineering strength power of reckless breathless yet untiring speed morning mr conyers shouted murgatroyd halting alongside a stood gazing at pallid blue sky across great mass of cloud be rapidly sweeping to be outpaced by low flying shred tatter of steamy scud opaque muddy green waste of foaming leaping water flying ship swaying broad space of damp darkened canvas tapering buckling spar tautly strained rigging in long arc athwart scurrying cloud a leapt plunged sheared irresistible way onward in midst of wild chaos dizzying swirl hurry of foaming spume what think of for grand morning eh sir be breeze good enough for what be opinion of city of cawnpore now sir be magnificent morning for sailing mr murgatroyd replied magnificent morning must be none worse for occasional glint of sunshine however may come by by a for ship be wonder perfect flyer why must be reeling off thirteen knot at least have hit sir pretty closely be going thirteen half when hove log at four bell have eased up anything since be reply ah said be grand sailing with wind where be be driving rather hard be stretching kink out of new rigging eh well perhaps be admitted mate with short laugh a glanced at slender upper spar be whipping about like fishing rod know mr conyers be obliged to do there be so much opposition nowadays people be in such deuce of hurry always to get to place that be bound to that line owning fastest ship get most patronage there be whole thing in nutshell just so be well enough in way if happen to get dismasted find morning air rather nipping so will get bath go below again will kindly allow one of men to play upon with head pump mr murgatroyd certainly mr conyers with pleasure sir answered mate bosun just tell off man to pump for mr conyers will ye ship be by time so lively be not at surprised to meet meagre muster at breakfast table yet of few present miss onslow be one soaring plunging wild lee roll of ship appeared to affect more than if be sitting at home in own breakfast room be silent a usual rich colour evident relish with partook of food placed before bore witness to fact that silence be due to inclination alone about hour after breakfast young lady made appearance upon poop well wrapped up began to pace to fro with assured footing easy graceful poise of body to movement of deck beneath be to mind at least very poetry of motion skipper happened to be walking together at moment of appearance of course with one accord sprang forward cap in hand proffered support of arm accepted that of skipper with graciousness of manner be to be paralleled only by frigid dignity with declined breeze held strong day for five day following gradually hauling round however heading until with yard braced hard in against lee rigging three royal mizzen topgallant sail stowed went thrashing away to westward against heavy head sea kept deck streaming a far aft a mainmast instead of bowling away across bay under studding sail a have hoped then fell in with light weather for nearly week enabled hand in cuddy to find sea leg good hearty appetite once more ship slowly traversing way to southward meanwhile finally got westerly wind that beginning gently enough to permit of showing skysail to ended in regular north atlantic gale compelled to heave to for forty two hour before blew out gale be at height blowing with almost hurricane fury with terrific sea running about twenty hour after development in cuddy be with about dozen exception seated at breakfast when above howling of wind faintly caught note of hail seemed to proceed from somewhere aloft where away sharply responded voice of chief mate from poop overhead heard reply given noise of ship shriek of gale through rigging resounding shock of sea smote upon weather bow at moment prevented catching word have difficulty however in gathering from mr murgatroyd inquiry that something have drifted within sphere of vision probably vessel hove to like minute two later however mr fletcher third mate presented at cuddy door said addressing to skipper mr murgatroyd respect sir there be partially dismasted barque appears to be in sinking condition with signal of distress flying about eight mile away broad on lee bow mr murgatroyd must be glad to know sir if be wish that must edge down towards yes certainly answered captain dacre request mr murgatroyd to do what be necessary say will be on deck shortly intelligence that real genuine wreck be in sight with probability that crew be in situation of extreme peril sent quite thrill of excitement pulsating through cuddy with result that breakfast be more le hurriedly despatched within few minute skipper miss onslow be remained seated at table rest having hurried on deck to catch earliest possible glimpse of so novel sight a mr murgatroyd message promised a for dacre be far too thoroughly seasoned hand to hurry ship be hastening to assistance of stranger nothing more must be done for present be perfectly evident that miss onslow have intention of descending to so undignified act a of joining in general rush on deck that be not unsympathetic be evidenced by earnestness with turned to skipper inquired do think captain that there be people on wreck people reiterated skipper why yes dear young lady be very much afraid that there be be afraid returned miss onslow why do use that word if there be people there will rescue will not of course if can answered skipper be just point can rescue mr murgatroyd message stated that wreck appears to be in sinking condition now if surmise of mate turn out to be correct question be will remain afloat until gale moderate sea go down sufficiently to admit of boat being lowered if not may turn out to be very bad job for poor soul eh mr conyers may indeed answered for be certain that boat of ours must live for five minute in sea be now running if barometer pointing to very fine instrument that hung facing in skylight be to be believed gale be not going to break just yet oh dear be dreadful girl exclaimed clasping hand tightly together in agitation one must see by whitening of lip horror expressed in widely opened eye that emotion be not simulated be thoroughly real genuine never thought of do understand to mean then captain that even when reach wreck may be impossible to help on board yes answered dacre may understand that miss onslow of course will stand by until gale break if when get alongside find that condition be very critical special effort to rescue will have to be made while doing may be possible must take care not to unduly risk own ship life have be intrusted to charge keeping point in view may prove impossible to do anything to help think there be hope that gale will soon abate demanded see prospect of a yet answered skipper barometer be surest guide sailor have in respect of weather a mr conyers just now remarked ours affords not particle of hope oh how cruel how relentlessly cruel wind sea be exclaimed girl whose pride have hitherto deemed superior to other emotion hope oh captain most fervently hope that will be able to save poor creature who must now be suffering protracted horror of lingering death may trust dear young lady answered skipper heartily whatever may prove possible to do will do for if be to be drowned will be through lack of effort on part to save now if will excuse will leave mr conyers to entertain while go on deck see how thing look girl instantly froze again will not inflict upon mr conyers who be doubtless dying for after breakfast smoke answered with complete return of former hauteur of manner have finished breakfast will join lady o'brien on deck therewith rose from seat despite wild movement of ship made way with perfect steadiness assured footing toward ladder stair led downward to sleeping room on way to cabin queer girl by george exclaimed dacre a disappeared seems quite determined to keep everybody at properly respectful distance especially have offended certainly not so far a be aware answered be pride skipper nothing pride simply deems of far too fine clay to associate with ordinary human pot pan well may be a distant a plea so far a be concerned for thank god be not in love with despite surpassing beauty forthwith seized cap followed captain up companion ladder to poop upon arrival on deck found that be under way once more mr murgatroyd having set fore topmast staysail swung head yard now with mate in weather mizen rigging to con ship through terrific sea be running be jilling along down toward wreck from height of poop now showed on horizon line whenever happened to top surge at same moment entire cuddy party be by time assembled on poop eye be intently fixed upon small misty image at irregular interval reared sharply upon jagged undulating line of horizon believe that telescope opera glass in ship be brought to bear upon after studying carefully through own powerful instrument for about ten minute made out to be small barque of about five hundred ton register with foremast gone at height of about twenty foot from deck main topmast gone just above level of lower mast head mizenmast intact noticed that appeared to be floating very deep in water that most of sea met seemed to be sweeping fore aft believed must detect presence of small group of people huddled up together abaft skylight upon short poop ensign of sort be stopped half way up mizen rigging a signal of distress after while made out to be tricolour johnny crapaud frenchman exclaimed to skipper who be standing near working away at with ship telescope frenchman eh responded skipper can make out colour of ensign from here if so that must be uncommonly good glass of yours mr conyers take test for answered handing instrument took applied to eye other end of tube swaying wildly to rolling plunging of ship ay said presently handing glass back to french be mistake now be rather nuisance for be ashamed to say that know french nearly well enough to communicate with how dickens be to understand one when come to making arrangement well if can find better way will be very pleased to act a interpreter for said knowledge of french language be quite sufficient for thank mr conyers be infinitely obliged to will thankfully avail myself of assistance can give answered skipper sea being rather in favour than otherwise drove down toward wreck at fairly rapid pace despite extremely short sail that be under a approached first thing made out with distinctness be that barque be lying head to wind evidently held in position by wreck of foremast with attached be under bow still connected with hull by standing running rigging be so far satisfactory in acted a sort of floating anchor to unfortunate craft rode prevented falling off into trough of sea must also probably to extent facilitate effort that might be able to make to get alongside to take people off to get alongside ay how be to be done in wild sea aspect of ocean have be awe inspiring enough before forlorn dying barque have drifted within ken now that be there to serve a scale by to measure height of surge to bring home to realising sense of tremendous irresistible power by showing how fearfully savagely flung battered about poor maimed fabric became absolutely terrifying a be to be seen by blanched face quailing cowering figure of crowd on poop who stood watching craft in death throe hitherto violence of sea have be productive in of nothing worse than condition of more le discomfort now that have before eye exemplification of what old ocean must do with man man handiwork if once succeeded in getting upper hand be badly frightened frightened for still more frightened for poor wretch yonder who have be conquered in battle with element be now being done to death by triumphant foe be reproach to that be so for sight upon be gazing be now momentarily growing plainer to view be well calculated to excite feeling of awe terror in heart of bravest there having in mind fact that be looking upon drama might at moment become tragedy involving destruction of nearly quite dozen fellow being even seasoned hand a be found moved to feeling of horrible anxiety a watched wreck through telescope for feeling be growing upon that be going to be too late that be doomed to see little crouching huddling knot of humanity perish miserably without power to help be by time about mile distant from wreck seven eight minute must carry alongside what might not happen in few minute why barque might founder at moment carry hand down with for must by time see that hull be submerged to channel so deadly languid sluggish be movement that almost sea made clean sweep over fore aft rendering main deck untenable poop meagre precarious place of refuge even if continued to float until reached for time afterward how be unfortunate people to be transferred from deck to own one have only to note wild rush of surge height fierceness with broke a swept down upon own ship headlong reeling plunging of a met assault to realise absolute impossibility of lowering boat from without involving frail craft crew in instant destruction how otherwise be poor half drowned wretch to be got at saved something might perhaps be done by mean of hawser if end must by mean be put on board sinking craft here again difficulty be such a to render plan to appearance impracticable yet seemed to offer only imaginable solution of problem for presently a continued to roll stagger down toward doomed barque captain dacre turned to said there be only one way to do job mr conyers be for frenchman to float end of heaving line down to by may be able to send hawser with bosun chair hauling line attached if be not troubling too much perhaps will kindly hail explain intention presently will shave athwart stern a closely a dare with main topsail aback so that may have plenty of time to tell what plan be what want to do very well said will undertake hailing part of business with pleasure have speaking trumpet of course answered skipper here boy to one of apprentice who happened to be standing near jump below fetch speaking trumpet for mr conyers will find from one of deck beam in cabin dacre then took charge of ship in person conning from weather mizen rigging sending murgatroyd for'ard with instruction to clear away towing hawser to fit with traveller bosun chair hauling line block etcetera ready for sending end aboard barque when communication must have be established with at same time boy having brought speaking trumpet on deck handed to stationed in mizen rigging alongside skipper for convenience of communication between chapter three rescue crew of french barque be now drawing close down upon barque steering course that if persisted in must have resulted in striking fair amidships on starboard broadside by attention to helm at proper moment with due allowance for own heavy lee drift be intended to take close enough to sinking craft to enable to speak presently at word from skipper third mate who be acting a captain aide sang out for men to lay aft back main topsail at same moment helm be eased gently up with result that bow fell off just sufficiently to clear barque starboard quarter will never forget sight that unfortunate craft presented at moment foremast jib boom be under bow with attached be hanging tangled mass of raffle by shroud stay leaving about twenty foot of naked jagged splintered stump of lower mast standing above deck main topmast be also gone wreckage of have be cut away have gone adrift leaving only heel in cap ragged end of topmast shroud streaming from rim of top have be very smart looking little vessel in time painted black with false port under bowsprit sported handsomely carved half length figure of crowned woman elaborately painted gilded carried short topgallant forecastle forward full poop aft reaching to within about twenty five foot from mainmast between two structure bulwark have be completely swept away leaving only jagged stump of stanchion here there protruding above covering board be sunk so low in water that channel be buried water be in making way slowly with difficulty through interstice of cargo have at time collected forward be pinning head down to such extent that bow be unable to lift to becend of sea with result sea broke hissing white over topgallant forecastle swept right aft to poop against front of dashed a against vertical face of rock throwing blinding drenching cloud of spray over little group of cowering people who crouched a closely a must huddle behind meagre inadequate shelter of skylight counted fourteen of poor soul in midst of occupying most sheltered spot on whole deck noticed what at first looked like bundle of tarpaulin a swept up on barque starboard quarter saw one of men gently pull corner of tarpaulin aside with one hand while pointed at city of cawnpore with other to amazement head face of woman young woman looked out at with expression of mingled hope despair be dreadful to see good god there be woman among exclaimed dacre must save must save if can look a if will not be given much time to do in suppose want to be taken off will never be mad enough to wish to stick to wreck eh hail mr conyers know what to say barque ahoy hailed in french a with main topsail aback surged wallowed slowly athwart stern of stranger do wish to be taken off at first sound of voice man who have pointed out to woman rose stiffly to foot staggered aft to taffrail with hand to ear shouted back in same language ship be sinking right interrupted for time be precious will endeavour to get end of hawser aboard have light heaving line that can veer down to by mean of float if so get ready will try to pick up on return be now about to stand on take room to wear when will come back endeavour to establish connection between two craft have line ready veered well away to leeward at once replied man wringing hand have line no anything see that have indicating bare poop with frantic gesture have lot of small stuff among gear upon mizenmast retorted although pointed to mast in question man glanced aloft a did so very much doubted whether comprehended meaning for lee drift be so rapid that be by time almost beyond hailing distance fill main topsail shouted skipper what have arranged demanded turning to told stamped on rail with impatience be clear that will not do to trust overmuch to for help will have to do everything mr murgatroyd shouted mate came aft be that hawser nearly ready demanded skipper sir answered mate five minute will do then said skipper next job sir will be to muster light line can lay hand upon range along larboard rail will be weather rail presently when have got ship round station dozen men more along weather rail with coil let stand by to heave a cross barque stern object be to get line aboard a quickly a possible by mean of may send hawser to for appear to be pretty helpless lot aboard there if be to be saved there be very little time to lose ay ay sir responded murgatroyd away went to perform additional duty captain dacre now showed stuff of be made handling ship with most consummate skill judgment wearing round upon port tack moment that must do so with certainty of again fetching barque ranging up under stern a closely a dared approach eight of strongest most skilful seaman in ship be ranged along weather rail a drew up on barque starboard quarter with main topsail once more thrown aback man after man hurled coil of light pliant line with strength in endeavour to get end of aboard barque such be strength of gale line after line fell short checked a effectually in career a though have be dashed against solid wall although after first failure man hauled in line re coiling with utmost rapidity attempted cast be unsuccessful have mortification of feeling at least twenty minute of priceless time have be expended to purpose what made worse be that during twenty minute absolutely nothing have be done by frenchman toward preparation of line to veer down to within three minute of moment when first line have be hove be once more out of hailing distance main yard be again being swung will have try said skipper if fail again will be up with if indeed be not already too late that barque can not possibly live half hour there seemed to be room to regard otherwise than a plain literal statement of incontrovertible fact be agreed that unfortunate craft have settled perceptibly in water since have first sighted at same rate half hour must suffice to annihilate very small margin of buoyancy appeared to be still remaining to even if escaped being earlier sunk out of hand by more than usually heavy sea seemed to have be temporarily lost sight of by little crowd of onlooker clustered closely round on poop in absorbing interest attendant upon endeavour to get line on board barque be only recalled to too in very abrupt startling manner by significance of skipper last remark imminence deadly nature of frenchman peril be brought home to anew now seemed to realise for first time possibility that might be called upon to witness at close quarter appalling spectacle not only of foundering ship also of drowning of people instantly quite little hubbub arose among excited passenger general o'brien dozen other men among pressing about poor dacre with suggestion proposal of most impossible character in midst of heard miss be clear rich voice exclaiming bitterly cruel cruel to think that be so near yet seems impossible to bridge few remaining yard of space that intervene between poor creature safety that enjoy surely can be done if only anyone be clever enough to think of way now lady gentleman remonstrated skipper please consider rude if say that none of know what be talking about there be only two way of getting line aboard wreck one way be to carry other to heave former be impossible with sea be now running latter have already tried once unsuccessfully be now about to try again if of can think of other practicable way will be glad to listen to if not please leave alone let give whole mind to job meanwhile have be watching run of sea at first idly with other feeling than of wonder that vessel in water logged condition of barque must continue to live in for be a high a steep sea a have ever beheld broke incessantly over barque with fury rendered continued existence above water constantly recurring marvel heavy a be however be not so bad a surf everlastingly beat upon sandy shore of west coast a realised fact also remembered that upon more than one occasion have be necessary for to swim through surf to save life surely thought man who have fought way through triple line of west african surf ought to be able to swim twenty thirty fathom in sea idea seemed to come to a inspiration undeterred by thought that individual who must essay feat of swimming from one ship to other must be seriously hampered by being compelled to drag lengthening trail of light rope behind turned to skipper said captain dacre there appears to be one sure way of getting line aboard wreck be for someone to swim with stop moment know that be about to pronounce feat impossible believe can do at event be perfectly willing to make attempt give something light such a pair of signal halliard to drag after let good hand have paying of out so may neither be checked by having paid out too slowly hampered on other hand by having to drag heavy bight after think will be able to manage if succeed bend end of heaving line on to other directly see have got hold will soon get hawser aboard end made fast somewhere skipper looked at fixedly for several second a though mentally measuring ability to execute task have offered to undertake then answered upon word mr conyers scarcely know what to say to extraordinarily plucky proposal if have be landsman must not have entertained idea for moment even a be be by mean sure must be justified in permitting to make attempt be sailor of considerable experience fully understand difficulty danger of service have offered to undertake suppose have hope of being successful must not have volunteered upon word be beginning to think with that course suggest be only one likely to be of service to poor soul yonder so suppose must say yes god be with little crowd round about who have be listening with breathless interest cheered clapped hand at pronouncement of skipper cheer being taken up by crowd of miner gathered in waist general o'brien who be standing at elbow seized hand shook enthusiastically a exclaimed god bless conyers god bless boy man woman among will pray for safety success thanks general answered knowledge have sympathy good wish of will add strength to arm courage to heart issue be in god hand if be will will succeed then turning to skipper said propose that will take ship up a close a possible to wreck precisely a did at first will dive from flying jib boom end will approach wreck more closely than hull will be for to watch so manoeuvre ship by easing up fore topmast staysail sheet in other way that may think best that will be kept fair abreast of dead to leeward of wreck until can get end of hawser aboard made fast after think may trust to difference in rate of drift of two craft to keep hawser taut yes yes answered skipper may trust to to do part mr conyers if can only manage to get end of hawser aboard fast to wreck will attend to other part of job now have better go get ready for swim for be about to wear ship hurried away to cabin shifted into ordinary bathing attire while thus engaged became aware that dacre be wearing ship getting round upon starboard tack once more by time that preparation be completed have made way out on main deck ship be round heading up for wreck again a appeared threading way forward among great burly miner who be clustering thick in waist raised cheer cuddy party again clapped hand of shouting encouraging word two after on forecastle encountered chief mate who held coil of small thin line in hand here be mr conyers exclaimed a joined coil be main signal halliard have unrove for purpose be better than new for have be stretched have have kink taken out of if be not enough here be fore halliard ready for bending on at second notice will pay out for so may depend upon having line properly tended now how will have end will have round waist said give a standing bowline can pas over shoulder under arm so will do be hawser fitted ready for paying out yes answered mate everything be quite ready have left about five fathom of bare end for bending on think ca do much better than take turn with round mizenmast under spider band be exactly what thought of doing said in fact be about only suitable place stood talking with murgatroyd until be once more almost within hail of barque when with bowline at end of line over left shoulder under right arm laid out to flying jib boom end upon took stand steadying by grasping royal stay in left hand motion away out there at far extremity of long spar be tremendous so much so indeed seasoned a be to wild erratic movement of ship in heavy weather sinking soaring flourishings of boom end a vessel plunged staggered down toward wreck made feel distinctly giddy wait be not very long one however in le than five minute found abreast barque starboard quarter within hundred foot of be now a close to wreck a captain dacre dared put so a ship met heavy sea flung high aloft above white water seethed swirled about stern of sinking craft let go hold upon stay poising for instant upon up hove extremity of boom raised hand above head a bent body toward water took off for deep dive conviction being must do far better by swimming under water than on surface a rushed downward heard dacre shout there go god be with then struck water head downward almost perpendicularly only sound heard be hissing of water in ear a blue green light about grew gradually more more dim with body slightly curved back trifle hollowed knew that even while plunging downward be also rushing toward barque presently struck out strongly arm leg a caught sight through water of huge dark body at great distance knew to be swaying hull for be making at length gasping for breath rose to surface found be within twenty foot of barque stern with whole of crew upon foot anxiously watching while man stood at taffrail holding coil of rope in hand instant saw shouted look out monsieur be about to heave right heave shouted in return gasping in midst of wild popple leaped about labouring craft next instant flake of uncoiling end of line hit sharply across face seized tightly sang out haul to starboard mizen chain man flung up hand in reply holding on to rope started at run along deck dragging after be good job have thought of taking turn round one arm in eagerness must have dragged rope out of grasp a be strain brought to bear added to of long length of line trailing behind almost tore arm out of socket moreover be half suffocated by deluge of water came crashing down upon like cataract off deck of wreck time that rolled toward luckily condition of affair be of brief duration presently found in wake of mizen chain in imminent danger of being struck driven under by overhanging channel piece watched opportunity however a barque rolled toward seized lanyard of one of shroud got footing somehow dragged in over rail felt terribly exhausted by brief fierce buffeting have received alongside time be precious city of cawnpore be still square athwart stern of wreck driving away to leeward at terrible rate knew that unless be very smart must still fail to get hawser from so flung up one arm a signal to murgatroyd to pay out cry out to frenchman to come help began to haul upon line have brought aboard with by dint of exhortation so earnest that almost amounted to bullying succeeded in awaking frenchman to sense of urgency of case persuaded to put liveliness into movement by mean quickly hauled in whole of signal halliard to other end of light heaving line be bent also dragged away upon for dear life presently have satisfaction of seeing end of city of cawnpore towing hawser being lighted out over bow be heavy piece of cordage for to handle dragged away at breathlessly at length when have almost begun to despair of getting aboard in time hauled end in over taffrail hand of seizing led to mizenmast round foot of have satisfaction of passing couple of turn securing so far so good most difficult part of task be now accomplished for knew that murgatroyd must attend to work at end of hawser do everything be necessary so turned to frenchman who have assisted aboard said be master of barque monsieur at service monsieur answered bowing with grace of dancing master very good said have lady on board think yes monsieur wife flourished arm toward bundle of tarpaulin still remained huddled up under shelter of skylight will of course have to go first said be there preparation must wish to make before being transferred to other vessel without replying to question man hurried away to heap unwrapping tarpaulin extricated young rather pretty terribly frightened woman from fold a did so saw that held baby in arm what exclaimed a joined little group baby also yes monsieur answered man see wrapped up in tarpaulin to protect a much a possible from cruel sea very wise precaution commented increase difficulty somewhat greatly doubt whether mother child will be able to make passage together madame will scarcely have strength to hold baby safely at same time little one might be washed out of arm lost oh monsieur what will do wailed poor terrified creature have to cross by rope fear there be other way replied gently can never do can never do ejaculated despairingly sea will drag little mimi off will be drowned under circumstance monsieur there seems to be only one thing for said must go first carrying child a soon a be safe will follow with madame be arrangement to liking man intimated that be forthwith commenced preparation necessary to secure for poor little wailing mite of humanity chance of surviving fearful journey fearful journey certainly be even for strong man how much more so then for weak terrified woman helpless child le than year old arrangement be city of cawnpore to wing hawser be now stretched between two vessel one end being made fast to barque mizenmast while other end led in over city of cawnpore bow through warping chock be secured somewhere inboard probably to windlass bitt must have be much more convenient have hawser be made fast to foremast about fifteen twenty foot from deck very heavy intermittent strain be being thrown upon imagined that dacre did not care to run risk of springing so important spar effect of be that city of cawnpore with topsail thrown flat aback be now actually riding by hawser to barque a to sea anchor deeply submerged hull of french craft offering sufficient resistance to drift of city of cawnpore to keep hawser taut except at rather frequent interval when heave of sea flung barque far enough to leeward to temporarily slacken be by mean of hawser at one moment taut a bar at next sagging slack enough to dip into water that frenchman be to be hauled from ship to ours meanwhile work of securing hawser aboard city of cawnpore clearing away of travelling gear have be going briskly forward at moment when frenchman came to understanding saw slung bosun chair hove over city bow come sliding along hawser toward french skipper saw too tenderly taking child from arm of almost swooning wife carefully wrapped in jacket removed for purpose then with assistance securely lashed bundle to body bosun chair have by time arrived at barque taffrail be awaiting first freight so a there be time to lose poor fellow away from wife assisted into chair saw that have good grip with hand waved for murgatroyd to haul away instantly did next turned to lady begged to once more shelter temporarily in tarpaulin object being to spare sight of terrible passage of husband child over through narrow stretch of ravening sea a happened there be need for solicitude cast one glance at swaying dangling figure of husband then with wild wailing shriek flung upon knee with hand clasped over eye truly terrible sight be for woman to contemplate especially with knowledge that must presently be obliged to herself undertake dreadful journey sea be running so high that close to other a be when crest of wave interposed between city of cawnpore latter be hidden half way to height of top headlong fury with wave came sweeping down upon foam capped with arching crest be alone enough to strike terror to stoutest heart that however be not worst of for although murgatroyd might safely be trusted to exercise utmost judgment in manipulation of hauling line there be moment when two craft being upon opposite slope of huge surge with hawser strained taut from one to other luckless individual who might be so unfortunate a to be caught way between two vessel must be momentarily buried thirty foot deep in heart of rushing hill of water about equally exposed to two danger of suffocation of being swept off beyond reach of rescue drowned out of hand double danger overtook unfortunate french skipper baby got through right child escaping suffocation mainly in consequence of careful secure manner in have be enveloped in father coat then came madame turn be impossible to so effectually enwrap a have be case with child did best must with strip of tarpaulin over head shoulder well secured round body with length of main topgallant brace then lashing firmly to own body took place in bosun chair wrapping arm tightly round quaking companion then taking firm grip upon lanyard of chair next instant be whirled off barque taffrail found dangling close over seething white water between two vessel then while be in very act of shouting few encouraging word through tarpaulin to companion heard roaring crash of heavy sea a struck swept over unfortunate barque from stem to stern next instant felt water envelop whirl drag hither with strength that seemed impossible to resist then a suddenly found in air again with great wave crest rushing roaring away from toward ship topmast head only of be visible above foaming ridge of water have just swept past in second two however end of flying jib boom reared high above seething wave crest sharp bow smothered in spray quickly followed then entire hull of ship hung balanced for instant upon top of wave ere bow dipped revealing full length of deck crowded with people one of with face turned in direction few more jerk swing one of seemed imbued with devilish desire to unseat hurl companion to destruction be hauled safely up on to rail of city of cawnpore to accompaniment of triumphant cheer from spectator quickly released before must recover breath to say word bosun chair be swiftly sliding along hawser on way back to barque presently after apparent delay hesitation on part of aboard doomed vessel swung off taffrail on return journey with man seated in swiftly chair traversed about third of distance between two vessel then be overtaken by deeply buried in heart of oncoming sea even a have be for few breathless second chair occupant be lost to view then a ship surmounted wave chair again appeared be empty late occupant have vanished there be cry of dismay a became manifest with one consent everybody craned over rail peered down into leaping water in hope of discovering missing man while few of smarter hand on forecastle sprang for rope end quickly coiled stood by to heave to must reappear never did after watching for full two minute be given up chair be again hauled aboard barque further delay now took place one seeming to have courage to undertake short terrible passage at length however man stepped forward placed in chair journey began passage be accomplished ere be overtaken when like rest of be submerged for few awful second when next saw be just in very act of falling from chair having apparently be dragged out of by fierce sweeping rush of sea shout of horror at fresh disaster of encouragement to man at once arose in midst of seized end of good long coil of line man be holding ready to throw quickly tying bowline therein threw bight over shoulder poised for dive waiting with one foot on topgallant rail to see just exactly what be happening before taking leap unfortunate man sank upon striking water presently man beside sang out there be pointing at same time down at water about thirty foot from bow peering down at length caught sight indistinctly of what looked like human form twisting writhing few foot below surface instantly dived next moment found within arm reach of man whom seized by hair dragged to surface when have to do be to fling arm about body hold on like grim death murgatroyd people at once undertaking rather delicate task of getting safely inboard be soon accomplished meanwhile bosun chair hung stationary midway between two vessel people seeming doubtful of utility of proceeding further there be time to lose if remaining frenchman be to be rescued for be perfectly evident to everybody that barque must not possibly float much longer so shrewdly guessing at source of inaction requested murgatroyd to haul chair aboard being done seated in requested to haul across to barque twice be caught by sea during journey time seemed that emerged at precise moment when must have be impossible to resist drag for even second reached barque safely at once scrambling out of chair proceeded to despatch frenchman in rotation task proving le difficult than have expected voluntary journey to seeming to have inspired with fresh courage at length by dint of lashing weaker men into chair earnestly cautioning strong one to hold on with might succeeded in securing passage of entire remainder of frenchman to city of cawnpore then came task of effecting own retreat of course must have be accomplished by mean of hawser bosun chair must have involved loss of hawser hauling gear attached must have be necessary to cut away thought pity to inflict loss upon ship merely to save discomfort of being hauled through water from one ship to other so a soon a last frenchman be safely aboard city of cawnpore proceeded to cut cast adrift hawser from barque mizenmast few minute later massive rope end flew overboard quickly followed by heaving line in end of have knotted bowline for own accommodation have just thrown bowline over shoulder be watching coil of line go leaping overboard one after other a rescuing ship went drifting rapidly to leeward when perfect mountain of sea came roaring down upon wreck sweeping unbroken in over bow right aft until reached front of poop against broke with terrific violence smashing in entire front of structure a judged by tremendous crashing of timber instantly followed checked for fraction of instant by impact with poop sea piled up in sort of wall then came surging foaming along deck toward saw that must inevitably sweep off foot so to avoid being dashed against poop rail unhesitatingly leapt overboard while still under water felt weight of sea falling upon have jumped overboard to avoid pressure be a of mountain drove downward until light dwindled to sombre green twilight while whirling water seemed to clasp about a with thousand arm flinging dragging hither thither ever downward until must hold breath no longer when with great irresistible gasp lung filled with water darkness silence profound impenetrable shut in thousand quaint fantastic fancy thronged brain knew more chapter four catastrophe next sensation be that of pain burning stabbing racking pain of so excruciating character incontinently groaned aloud then a though in response to groan heard vaguely without immediate comprehension of meaning of word voice say there think will do general be in pain now thank god mean that be coming round there be reason to hope that will pull through thanks for valuable assistance can manage single handed now might make known that mr conyers show sign of returning consciousness have hope of saving fancy intelligence will be not altogether unwelcome to at least one of cuddy party by gad yes think know who mean will make point of telling news in hearing be reply be sure there be nothing else that can do doctor nothing more thank except perhaps that might suggest value of quietness of movement on part of anyone coming below slamming of cabin door anything of sort know answered first voice now recognised a of ship doctor on board city of cawnpore right will see to replied other voice now quite familiar to a of general o'brien gentle click of cabin door latch succeeded opened eye languidly to see scudamore sharp cut feature bending close to mine with earnest intent look in kindly eye well exclaimed heartily a eye met how do feel now in horrible pain answered with involuntary groan what be matter with doctor have happened only that have be drowned that have kept general busy for two mortal hour more practising artificial respiration before must consent to come back to life be then remembered everything began to wonder by what mean have be recovered from profound depth wherein last conscious moment have be spent put question to scudamore answered oh a to that have difficulty there be light heaving line attached by one end to hawser in other end have knotted bowline passed over shoulder under armpit simply hauled aboard by mean of how long did barque live after left asked how long repeated doctor in surprise why not ten second be in very act of foundering stern first when jumped be undoubtedly suction did mischief must have be dragged fathom deep by for line round must probably never have come to surface again what of french people be right demanded yes thanks to be answered scudamore man jumped overboard after be worst case luckily have succeeded in resuscitating before be hauled aboard have saved fifteen human life to day be something to be proud of be not now more talking at present what require be sleep if mind being left alone minute two will go to cabin mix draught will give good long nap from have doubt will awake feeling a well a ever so saying medico softly withdrew quietly closing cabin door behind only to return few minute later with draught of decidedly pungent taste at command tossed off instanter whether be due to potency of draught to exhaustion to combined know not certain be that a sank back upon pillow eye closed almost instantly went drifting off into land of dream when next awoke be well on toward evening for light have grown so dim must only indistinctly discern various object about cabin there seemed to have be abatement of gale for ship be rolling plunging a wildly a ever scuttle be frequently being dimmed by dash of sea against ship side screaming of gale through rigging still rose high above other sound body seemed to be bruised aching over with exception felt little none worse for morning adventure be very comfortable distinctly hungry be lazily endeavouring to make up mind whether must go to trouble of dressing hunting up steward to find something to eat whether must remain where be until somebody came to when problem be solved by opening of cabin door entrance of doctor advanced on tiptoe to side of bunk bent close over peering into face to see whether happened to be awake what be time doctor asked oh so be awake eh responded well how do feel sore aching from head to foot otherwise right excepting be uncommonly hungry answered hungry eh said scudamore let feel pulse laid finger upon wrist for few second then said well there doe seem to be very much matter with now have have good long sound sleep have be in out from time to time just to see that be going on right good dinner will not hurt will have brought to here must rather turn out dress oh will turn out of course exclaimed very well then said doctor will send steward to help to dress will need little assistance with ship cutting wild caper if dawdle too long over toilet will be just in good time for dinner there go first bell added a strident clamour suddenly pealed out from somewhere on deck above left presently berth room steward appeared with shaving water scrambled rather more feebly than have expected out of bunk operation of dressing proved to be considerably more lengthy one than have anticipated for found be decidedly shaky on leg have to sit on sofa take short rest at frequent interval with result that second dinner bell rang before be ready to leave cabin be not very late however arriving in cuddy last be true in time to see immediate predecessor just taking seat a crossed threshold of brilliantly lighted apartment leaning upon arm of steward entire company rose to foot eye be turned upon suddenly general o'brien shouted in great excitement three cheer for gallant friend conyers hip hip hip hurrah three cheer thus unexpectedly called for be enthusiastically given even lady joining in to great confusion a passed aft between two table everybody within reach must need shake hand with say something complimentary until felt so uncomfortable began to wish have remained below noticed that miss onslow be on foot like rest appeared to have risen rather to avoid appearance of singularity than with intention of paying compliment while rest be almost boisterously enthusiastic remained absolutely calm devoid of slightest sign of emotion except cheek lip be colourless slight curl in beautiful upper lip seemed to indicate feeling of contempt for such outburst of enthusiasm steadfastly kept gaze turned away from except for one brief fraction of second a drew near to take place beside then for space of lightning flash glance met if anything so inconceivable a display of emotion on part must be credited a within range of possibility must almost have sworn caught in eye flash of tear little ovation over sat down a at once began talking to skipper about gun mounted a trophy in front of government house calcutta have not opportunity to verify suspicion a seated gave vent to sigh of relief believing that fellow traveller having expressed approval of behaviour of morning affair be now at end scarcely be settled in place when french skipper wife very charming little woman who with husband have be received into cuddy by dacre a guest who have apparently failed to recognise upon entrance learning from neighbour what hubbub be about must need add to confusion by rushing to throwing upon knee a poured forth expression of gratitude with mingled fervour grace found particularly discomposing then husband followed suit thanking with manly earnestness heartiness for what have done further act of homage so publicly performed disconcerted to extent hastened to dismiss embarrassingly grateful pair by assuring that be making altogether too much of what have done be more than other man confident of swimming power must have unhesitatingly undertaken have not happened to have seized initiative be of course very glad have fallen to to be mean of saving life that most earnestly begged to say more about when dinner be over general o'brien joined on deck a be smoking pipe seized opportunity to thank for assistance have rendered in operation of securing resuscitation added a be recovering consciousness doctor make remark to to effect that someone gathered that lady be being referred to seemed to be more than ordinarily concerned in question of recovery understood from reply that perfectly understood to whom scudamore alluded have objection to favouring with name of individual oh so heard that did remarked general well dear boy be not intended for to hear be quite certain scudamore must not have made remark have be aware that be sufficiently recovered to hear understand a to giving lady name well think must be justified in doing so matter stand thus see when scudamore spoke be of opinion that have accidentally discovered entirely unsuspected existence of more than ordinary interest in on part of certain lady since then have come to conclusion that mistook overpowering excitement for more tender feeling hence consider ought to enlighten at if tender feeling exists why be girl own secret for to retain not a plea if have feeling be willing that must know depend upon will discover method of enlightening while if have such feeling must be height of bad taste on part to suggest that possibly have so please ask more about there be good fellow of course at once finally let subject drop somehow must not help thinking about wondering of fellow passenger be referred to for next day two watched to see whether one of exhibited more than ordinary cordiality to be quite unavailing be alike exceedingly cordial friendly except miss onslow who still maintained former attitude of frigid reserve so a be after matter only very slightly interested soon forgot about from time forward for full month more life be absolutely uneventful on board city of cawnpore gale blew out that same night got breeze carried right into north east trade then lost five day on line parallel ere caught south east trade when left be baffled for two day more before getting wind must permit to make easting caught fair wind early one morning in second week of december by noon be blowing over larboard quarter quite a strong a wanted with studding sail abroad on side from royal down other inch of canvas must draw a afternoon waned breeze freshened murgatroyd have by time got preventer backstay rigged fore aft with avowed determination of carrying on making very utmost of so splendid breeze making most of be with vengeance for ship be sweeping along like mist wreath reeling off seventeen knot by log when latter be hove at end of first dog watch when went on deck after dinner night sky have banked up to windward astern of heavy mass of cloud be sweeping rapidly athwart firmament permitting occasional brief hasty glimpse of young moon few misty star be then blowing strong with promise of windy night before seemed to that with so dim uncertain light be scarcely prudent to drive ship at such headlong speed through night indeed ventured to suggest a much to dacre only laughed at be very well for navy men when be cruising to shorten sail at sunset so that people may be reasonably sure of undisturbed night said with of red ensign be different owner expect to pile up profit for only way in can do be by making quick passage of course while doing best to accomplish exercise possible precaution for instance seem to think that be rather reckless in driving ship at speed through night what have to fear have sea room want there be rock shoal in road for to fetch up on if must happen to fall in with other vessel will be going same way a ourselves so will see in ample time to avoid running over in addition to maintain first rate lookout one on bow two in waist officer of watch up here on poop so need have fear of collision take word for mr conyers be bit a safe aboard here sir a if be under pennant after of course there be nothing more to be said especially a be well aware that in mentioning matter at to skipper have committed almost unpardonable breach of nautical etiquette notwithstanding strong breeze night be quite warm for be not very far south of tropic of capricorn moreover be close upon midsummer of southern hemisphere consequently when two bell of first watch struck good many of passenger be on deck most of listening to miner who be congregated on main deck singing a for be right aft on wheel grating smoking staring skyward at racing cloud mass a swept scurrying athwart face of moon suddenly loud yell of dismay warning arose from topgallant forecastle only word caught being under bow next instant with shock shot off grating on to poop ship be brought up standing not stopped dead a though have run into cliff rather a horse stop when pulled up thrown on haunch then a lay on back half stunned by shock of fall still gazing skyward saw three mast bow forward bending like fishing rod when with dreadful rending crash entire complicated mechanism of sail spar rigging went by board lay fore aft along deck there be moment pause of utter silence broken only by hissing splash rush of water alongside moaning of wind over sea then arose most terrific hubbub to have ever be doomed to listen shriek groan curse from injured by fall of buried under wreckage from aloft cry of be sinking be sinking god help people calling other name voice of captain dacre mr murgatroyd shouting order then in moment there arose among miner cry of boat boat let launch boat instantly followed by rush of whole crowd of on to poop where a many a must swarmed into two quarter boat hanging at davit two boat must not hold much more than quarter of number moment that be discovered there arose sanguinary fight for possession of two frail craft who be crowded out drawing knife attacking other party then murgatroyd suddenly appeared on poop with brace of revolver in hand levelled at fighting surging mob come out of boat cowardly blackguard come out say stand by to obey order d 'ye hear there what say there with red head be talking to come out of boat by god will shoot wo then take that pistol flashed a spoke will soon see who be master here next instant brave fellow be down on deck stabbed in dozen place from behind life kicked trampled out of by fighting panic stricken crowd of miner who be now simply beside with terror practically a irresponsible a so many wild beast at juncture skipper with dozen seaman to support arrived upon scene from forward where have apparently rushed at first alarm to investigate condition of ship pressing way into heart of howling struggling mob endeavoured to bring to sens by assuring that there be boat enough for that only chance of being saved lay in allowing sailor access to tackle so that boat might be properly launched before poor fellow must get further too went down disappeared amid shout of life be a good a yours have got boat mean to keep so on in height of confusion someone cut bow tackle of larboard quarter boat with result that bow suddenly dropped into water while stern still hung suspended from davit man of crowd who have scrambled into be instantly precipitated into water while be going on upon poop entire crowd of cuddy passenger appeared to be huddled together about companion utterly helpless bewildered while party of seaman be working desperately down on main deck to get four boat off gallows must not see that anyone be doing anything to clear away long boat be probably because have be destroyed by fall of mainmast appeared to have crashed right down on top of a for did nothing for simple reason that there be nothing to be done ship be sinking fast so fast indeed that must probably plunge head first to bottom in le than five minute taking into consideration state of absolute panic prevailed inextricable raffle of wreckage cumbered filled deck must leave time in to construct even rudest kind of raft there seemed to be nothing for for hand to go down with ship thanks to terror stricken selfishness of 'tween deck passenger who be too ignorant to do anything useful too obstinate distrustful to allow anyone else to do anything for myself have made up mind not to give in die so long a must do anything to help be good swimmer when ship went down must look out for piece of wreckage cling to until be picked up by passing ship perished of hunger thirst suddenly a be standing close to binnacle watching frantic mob of fighting miner woman emerged from after companion close beside glanced round for moment in terror at conflict be raging about boat then stepping quickly to side laid hand upon arm must see gleam glitter of gem upon in dim starlight said in voice at once recognised a of miss onslow oh mr conyers what doe mean have happened be ship sinking for pity sake tell miss onslow said summon courage to aid beg for will need have worst possible news to tell ship be sinking fast will probably go down in two three minute think doubtful in extreme whether one of will survive to tell tale o god gasped father be only child will kill well if must be so god will be done not word about outcry of natural fear at near approach of king of terror be of father heart breaking sorrow that must feel at loss that thought at dread moment a idea presented to world of admiration for such marvellous courage unselfishness leapt into being within turning to grasped hand still unconsciously rested upon arm said miss onslow have hope to offer if be willing to trust to will do utmost to save at worst will be worse off than be now will trust said simply will do tell there be time to lose for must tell by feel of ship that course be run so taking companion by hand led right aft to wheel grating mounted then peered over stern at black water merciful heaven how near be looked a though one must lean over rail dabble one hand in be clear there be wreckage anything else so far a must see to hurt must leap lifebuoy be hanging over taffrail suspended by stout lanyard buoy hurriedly cut adrift passing over miss onslow shoulder up under armpit then having thus equipped assisted to mount rail at once sprang up beside taking hand in mine a did so now be ready asked quite answered a steadily a though have be about to assist to step ashore instead of urging to leap overboard in middle of south atlantic on dark windy night with scarcely hope that must survive to see next morning then jump said at word leapt together chapter five city of cawnpore quarter boat height of poop rail from surface of water have by time grown so insignificant by reason of depth to hull of ship have become immersed that upon striking water only descended about foot below surface ere rising again while companion be so effectually supported by lifebuoy that remained quite dry above shoulder water be not at cold indeed be of quite pleasant temperature so anticipated discomfort on account either for companion now that be actually overboard first anxiety be to place a great distance a possible between ourselves sinking ship so that might perchance escape being dragged down by when must founder therefore at once thrust left arm through one of becket of lifebuoy struck out with strength away from ship swimming athwart sea so that might not break in face towing companion after contrived to place distance of about hundred fathom between ship before disappeared be very considerably more than have dared to hope for when jumped overboard although did not carry quite clear of vortex created by sinking ship carried so far away that be only dragged back somewhat toward centre without being taken under swam for ten minute then deeming that be so far distant a to be free from danger of injury by rising of floating wreckage under seemed advisable to heave to husband strength little since must not tell to what extent might be taxed in immediate future a to companion be put to exertion whatever lifebuoy supporting perfectly when inquired a to welfare informed that felt quite a comfortable a much at ease a must be reasonably expected under circumstance allowed quarter of hour a nearly a must guess to elapse after disappearance of ship then believing that wreckage be likely to float up from to surface must already have done so thought might safely return to scene of catastrophe since be upon existence of certain amount of floating wreckage built such slight hope a entertained of ultimate preservation knew pretty exactly bearing of spot where ship have gone down having taken by moon thus guided struck out over way that have recently travelled towing miss onslow after a swam must not help feeling of surprise at height of sea seemed mountainous now that be down upon surface although from deck of ship have appeared nothing at extraordinary have be swimming five minute so when a floated up on breast of wave saw in dim moonlight what looked like quantity of loose floating wreckage at very great distance away slightly to windward toward made best of way ultimately arriving in midst of quantity of loose jagged splintered planking tangled up with raffle of spar sail rigging be rather dangerous stuff to venture among a of loose plank be lancing about in wash of sea with considerable violence blow from jagged end must have inflicted more le serious injury even have not killed outright at length found little clear space among wreckage into towed companion presently found close alongside one of mast with after rim of top riding dry on to at once climbed hauling miss onslow after lashing securely to top by mean of end of rope cut from among raffle here be reasonably safe comfortable for be upon raft of buoyant material must probably float for month while there be so much of that effectually broke sea prevented from washing over be terrible situation for delicately nurtured girl a who have so unexpectedly be thrown under protecting care throughout night never uttered single word must be construed into complaint did evince slightest fear on contrary exhibited calm steadfast courage filled with admiration although question that put to from time to time rendered perfectly clear that very fully realised desperate nature of predicament time during night must probably be about wind dropped to light breeze sea began to go down until by daylight there be only very gentle air blowing with very little sea long heavy swell cloud went drifting away out of sight leaving sky clear there be generally very promising prospect that coming day must be fine moment that be light enough to see scrambled up on wreckage took long look round in hope of descrying sail horizon be bare then a light grew stronger proceeded to minutely inspect mass of wreckage have afforded shelter throughout night with view of ascertaining capability a refuge for more le lengthy period until in fact be either taken off by passing ship perished of starvation there seemed to be great deal of much more than must satisfactorily account for a dawn spread brightened object grew increasingly distinct everything became intelligible even to cause of catastrophe have so suddenly terribly hurled from situation of safety comfort into one of direst peril uncertainty for found that while companion be clinging to wreckage of ill fated city of cawnpore mainmast whole of have somehow come adrift from hull be surrounded by tangled up with large quantity of planking woodwork of recognised a having belonged to own ship while remainder resolved into shattered hull of large timber laden wooden ship have be cut nearly half through by tremendous impact of own vessel upon when struck so destroyed in darkness of preceding night minute inspection of wreck enabled to clearly understand exactly what have happened stranger have be dismasted for spar be still attached to hull have at same time subsequently become water logged to extent a to submerge hull nearly to level of deck crew have abandoned have be left washing about scarcely visible yet truly formidable death trap for own good ship to blunder upon to destruction force of blow have turned stranger nearly bottom up so must not even make guess at nationality worse still have robbed of possible chance of slightly bettering condition by taking up quarter aboard in addition to mass that hapless companion have taken refuge upon there be few small quantity of detached wreckage floating here there within radius of about quarter of mile among by by noticed something looked so much like capsized boat that a there seemed to be shark about determined to swim out examine mentioned resolution to miss onslow who made demur to being left alone for time merely remarking with somewhat wan smile if must by good fortune prove to be boat please in elation sail away forgetting that have left behind assured that might absolutely depend upon never forgetting that have undertaken to save therewith plunged into warm sea swimming long steady stroke did not take very long to reach object for be aiming proved a have conjectured to be ship boat swamped floating keel up not only so when got alongside be delighted to find that be one of city of cawnpore quarter boat doubt one that miner have cut partially adrift ere ship went down especial significance importance of discovery arising from fact that poor dacre have made point of having item of boat equipment stowed within properly secured so that unless something very untoward have happened be reasonable to hope must find craft thus furnished sure enough appeared to be so when at length managed to right for a rolled over caught sight of oar mast sail latter neatly encased in canvas coat securely lashed to thwart without waiting to further investigate got hold of by stern hanging on by one hand proceeded to scoop water out of with other be long job considerably more than hour being spent in removing comparatively small quantity of water necessary to enable to get into once in made much better progress using two hand to throw water out until having got rid of sufficient to enable to move about without again filling boat managed to find baler when made short work of baling dry done took stock of prize found that have come into possession of twenty eight foot gig in perfectly sound undamaged condition equipped with four sixteen foot ash oar mast sail rowlock bottom board stretcher rudder yoke baler boat hook priceless treasure under circumstance two breaker of fresh water securely lashed to bottom board to serve a ballast with prize a might not be possible with thankful heart cast adrift oar shipped pair standing up fisherman fashion with face toward bow paddled boat to pile of wreckage whereon have left miss onslow sea have by time gone down to such extent have difficulty in putting boat alongside wreckage taking young lady on board shoving clear again without damaging boat in least clothes be by time quite dry of companion nearly so be therefore comparatively speaking comfortable excepting that be sensible of possession of most healthy hearty appetite have mean of satisfying casual remark by miss onslow upon unpleasant feature of adventure set thinking with result that before leaving mass of wreckage for good secured signal halliard to serve a fishing line together with fair supply of other small cordage main royal cut away from wreckage to serve a sort of tent to shelter companion from dew at night time small spike nail two with considerable labour cut out of planking of derelict have brought disaster upon last secured with rather hazy idea that might be possible for to file down convert into fish hook with aid of small file formed one of implement in pocket knife thus provided shipped boat rudder yoke stepped mast set sail shoved off intention being to shape course a nearly a must hit off for cape town in hope that ere long might be fallen in with picked up by craft bound thither boat however have scarcely begun to gather way when espied at very great distance what took to be floating hencoop realising that if conjecture happened to be correct coop must probably be found to contain drowned poultry that in desperate situation must serve for food headed boat for surmise again proved to be well founded object turned out to be coop contained seventeen dead fowl whole of secured in gaining possession of poultry found necessary to break away two three of slat bar formed front of coop thus discovering that be secured to body of coop by long thin wire nail out of soon satisfied must make very promising fish hook by merely bending into requisite shape secured about dozen of nail then made sail with fair wind upon approximately due east course although wind be light boat slipped through water at very satisfactory pace in hour time have run wreckage completely out of sight during progress of foregoing operation companion have be very quiet looking on with air of interest at everything did occasionally volunteering assistance where seemed to think might possibly be able to make useful otherwise saying little now however that have once more settled down into condition of comparative inactivity began to question a to whereabouts what be intention so on of question replied to a accurately a must then after meditating for several minute said what do think be chance of escape mr conyers do consider that be favourable enough to justify in taking so very much trouble ah answered if have asked that question last night when jumped overboard together from sinking ship must probably have found difficulty in answering at once hopefully truthfully for a matter of fact may now tell really have hope that in acting a did be merely obeying that instinct urge to fight for life so long a have fight left in now that have come into possession of fine well equipped boat can honestly say that consider chance of ultimate escape be excellent of course everything depends upon weather if gale be to spring up boat must probably be swamped capsized by heavy sea must quickly rise although even under such adverse condition a of gale must bring sailorly training knowledge to bear on task of preserving boat a long a possible if providence will only favour with fine weather for say week have scarcely shadow of doubt that within time will be fallen in with picked up by craft of sort for must understand that be right in track of ship bound round cape vessel be now so many in number that making rough guess must be inclined to say that average of at least one vessel per day must pas within few mile of spot of course may happen that several day will pas without single craft of kind coming along to maintain average be equally likely that three four may pas in course of dozen hour so see chance of being rescued be fairly good yes objected suppose be unfortunately to happen that several day say seven eight be to elapse without seeing sail that afterwards such ship a might see be to pas at long distance that although must be perfectly visible to must be quite invisible to what then in case said there must be one course open to must simply be obliged to keep sailing on until ship approached near enough to see taking care of ourselves meanwhile omitting opportunity to procure such mean of supporting life a ocean have to offer reminds that food drink have passed lip since dinner last night know be hungry because said so time ago a for be famishing food at disposal be not particularly inviting simply raw chicken cold water be at least fresh think ought to make most of while be in condition miss onslow appetite be not however a yet quite keen enough to admit of partaking of raw fowl drank little water out of baler only utensil possessed a returned baler to remarked must not allow squeamishness to be bar to satisfaction of own appetite if feel hungry enough to eat raw flesh have be told that sailor be so often reduced to desperate strait that eventually become reconciled to idea of eating almost anything be consequently a rule much le fastidious than such pampered mortal a moreover must not forget that be of last importance that strength must be maintained for own sake for mine a well if be not too presumptuous of to say such thing therefore please make meal if can although fully realise how absolutely dependent upon be must like to understand mean to be mere helpless burden to if can be avoided be perhaps not physically strong enough to be of much assistance to in case where skill rather than great bodily strength be required hope will unhesitatingly make use of for instance be hungry can not make even such slight preparation of food a be possible because be steering boat again will soon need rest will be unable to take unless be able to steer boat in stead therefore please teach forthwith how to manage boat so may be able to relieve ' a think sailor call from time to time a may prove necessary be girl who while on board ship have hedged in kept at arm length by barrier of such chill haughty reserve a have at time approached very nearly to insolence of course eagerly accepted offer for foresaw that time must very soon arrive when assistance must be indispensable at once proceeded to initiate into art of steering unfortunately be running dead before wind at time be most difficult point of sailing for novice to master yet new pupil seemed to grasp idea at once without effort quarter of hour later be watching run of sea checking tendency of boat to round to almost a knowingly cleverly a though have be sailing boat lifetime moment found must be trusted alone took up position on midship thwart selecting best looking fowl from stock proceeded to pluck draw afterwards giving good wash in salt water alongside done cut off leg having skinned sliced off small piece of flesh with many misgiving placed in mouth began dubiously to masticate idea of devouring raw flesh seemed to to be exceedingly repulsive disgusting be that nothing realising full truth of miss onslow remark upon importance of maintaining strength persevered presently when have conquered in measure natural repugnance excited by idea of such food found that really after be very much matter of sentiment so far a flavour be concerned there be nothing at objectionable taste be of course novel peculiar thought possible that one might accustom to without much difficulty yet just at first little sufficed when have despatched one leg considered that have made particularly hearty meal felt so much better for strove to induce miss onslow to try morsel gently reiterated refusal however while expressing satisfaction have be able to eat then noticing that eye looked heavy that movement be languid arranged royal a sort of couch in stern sheet for suggested that must lie down endeavour to secure rest to suggestion acceded in few minute completely worn out with unaccustomed excitement fatigue exposure through have so recently passed be sleeping by side a placidly a infant sun be sinking into bank of smoky looking cloud stretched along horizon on starboard quarter when companion awoke greatly refreshed by slumber a confessed ravenously hungry also be beginning to feel anew pang of hunger so surrendering yoke line to miss onslow took advantage of what remained of fast waning daylight to prepare further portion of raw fowl to serve taking care to render appearance of flesh a little repulsive a possible by time that preparation have purposely somewhat protracted be complete darkness have so far closed down upon that be scarcely possible to see what be eating thus aided by dint of much persuasion accentuated by reminder that habitually ate oyster raw succeeded in inducing poor girl to so far lay aside prejudice a just to taste food offered that accomplished have further trouble with for hunger be by time so sharp that food of sort became palatable succeeded in making fairly good meal meanwhile bank of cloud at sunset have be hovering on verge of western horizon have be stealthily creeping zenith ward at same time spreading out north south with look in seemed to portend more wind so a measure of precaution went to work upon conclusion of meal shortened sail by taking down couple of reef in mainsail single reef in little stay foresail boat carried done rearranged royal in stern sheet a bed for companion urging to turn in at once get a much rest a must be exceedingly fortunate that have taken precaution to reef canvas of small hooker for about hour so after sunset very shortly indeed after completion of preparation wind freshened up with quite touch of spite in driving along at speed of fully eight knot tugging at mast a though intent on dragging out of boat altogether sea moreover began to rise break by midnight be in bath of perspiration induced by anxiety effort to keep boat ahead of square end on to comber condition of excessive painful anxiety by way be quite new a well a decidedly unpleasant experience for be deeply mortified annoyed at discovery of influence upon first took severely to task about then proceeded to seek for cause of trouble be at first disposed to attribute to nerve shock induced by occurrence of preceding twenty four hour further analysis of feeling convinced that nerve be still to be depended upon a implicitly a ever that real source of distress lay at foot asleep wrapped up in sail yes there must be doubt about be on companion account be nervous anxious feared being capsized swamped simply because of greatly increased danger discomfort must in case accrue to at length probably about two o'clock in morning breezed up so fiercely knocked up such sea dared not run boat longer so watching chance put helm down hove to on larboard tack with boat head to northward anxiously awaited coming of daylight soon after miss onslow awoke seemed considerably alarmed at change in weather wild movement of boat managed to reassure then observing that have lashed port yoke line be no longer doing anything suggested that must change place must get little sleep after assurance a to utter absence of danger found somewhat difficult to make understand without alarming that be still a urgently necessary a ever for to watch boat at dawn came filtering slowly through murky rather angry looking sky a darkness gradually melted away from off face of weltering water made out canvas of large ship eight mile off to leeward have passed about hour earlier probably not more than three mile away have there only be daylight must doubtless have succeeded in attracting attention a be there be hope of such thing now be sailing away from instead of toward sailor seldom look astern attention be mostly directed to what lie ahead even have be otherwise be too late now to think of making seen be too far off chasing be quite out of question for be bowling along under topgallant studding sail making utmost of fair wind while dared show more than double reefed canvas fortunately miss onslow be sleeping again did not see stranger have run out of sight beyond horizon by time that companion next awoke so did not mention circumstance appearance of vessel however be cheering encouraging inasmuch a tended to show be still in track of shipping a day wore slowly on wind steadily freshened until be blowing single reefed topsail breeze brought with corresponding increase in height run of sea at length became so dangerous that dared longer keep boat under sail be constrained to douse canvas use with mast oar a floating anchor for boat riding to at full scope of rather long painter be much more easy comfortable advantage be discounted to great extent by fact that during day two other vessel passed at too great distance to allow of attracting attention low down in water a be with mean of signalling to yet not so far off that might have be seen have there be pair of sharp eye aboard while if have be possible for to carry sail might have easily intercepted of be cruelly bitter disappointment to to see two craft go sliding along horizon while wore out with unavailing effort to attract attention companion bore disappointment bravely even chid gently when sank down exhausted into bottom of boat with bitter curse upon blindness of crew a second of two ship vanished beyond rim of horizon reminded more than once of word have spoken to earlier in day to effect that although might miss dozen ship through passing at too great distance to allow of being seen seventh must be sure to come booming right down upon only difficulty must be to avoid being run down by later on when darkness have once more closed down upon shutting out everything towering swooping phosphorescent crest of threatening sea caught softly silently secretly cry sight of distress aroused sudden furious anger in that caused to again still more savagely execrate blind lookout kept aboard vessel have day passed then began to wonder bitterly how many poor soul weak helpless delicate woman child famine stricken men have perished miserably after drifting about ocean for day be veritable eternity of suffering yet might have be rescued have officer of watch aboard passing ship bestowed trifle more interest attention upon small distant indistinctly seen object that for instant caught gaze too hastily assumed to be slanting pinion of wandering sea bird leaping crest of distant wave rode thus through night well on toward noon next day when weather moderated sufficiently to permit to make sail once more a day wore on wind gradually hauled round until be dead on end for nightfall found heading to southward with wind out at about east south east state of thing prevailed for next four day during further vessel be sighted although be possible that may have passed during night at distance a to be invisible in darkness during time be put to great strait for want of food suffered torture of slow starvation for drowned poultry soon putrefied became so offensive that have to heave overboard tried to supply deficiency by fishing only succeeded in capturing one small shark about eighteen inch long be fortunately hooked in mouth in such way that must not cut through line with teeth during time watched steered boat through night miss onslow relieving during hour of daylight in order might secure few hour of much needed rest be far too anxious a well a in too much suffering to sleep utmost must achieve be to doze fitfully for few minute at time during imagination conjured up most tormenting dream from usually awoke with violent start terrified cry then must spring upon thwart search horizon eagerly feverishly for sight of sail following up with renewed attempt to catch fish two will never forget courage fortitude exhibited by miss onslow during trying period never uttered single word of complaint impatience although be impossible for to conceal fact that suffered acutely whenever found unusually silent a thought giving way to dejection always have ready word two of encouragement thus matter wearily painfully progressed with until six day seven night have dragged slow length away full week have elapsed since sinking of city of cawnpore be still working way to southward against amount of wind sea be quite a much a boat must look at miss onslow be at foot wrapped up in sail moaning in troubled sleep hour being about one o'clock in morning be of course always on lookout for ship night day time have now arrived when began to see craft have existence save in disordered imagination be therefore surprised elated when suddenly became aware of vague indefinite shadow of deeper darkness faintly doubtfully showing against horizon broad on weather bow simply regarded a phantom thought more about yet kept gaze fixed upon nevertheless since have nothing better to occupy attention presently peculiarity of vision not shared by others have seen forced upon notice inasmuch a while other phantom ship have seen have exhibited propensity to rush over surface of ocean at lightning speed to appear in dozen quarter more in a many second one obstinately persisted in maintaining precise position in have at first discovered presently dawned upon that have peculiarity namely that of opacity sufficiently dense to temporarily blot out low lying star that movement of boat happened to bring into line with full significance of peculiarity at length became suggestive began to dawn upon that possibly craft out yonder might not after be phantom might be vessel destined to afford rescue salvation vessel for have along be looking eventual appearance of have so frequently so confidently predicted to miss onslow chapter six derelict mere possibility that rescue might actually be at hand acted a tonic upon imparting renewed life hope clearing away more than half delirious fancy have clouded bemuddled brain thus enabling once more to think act rationally pulled resolutely together collected wandering wit peered long anxiously at shadowy shape have a be crystallised out of surrounding darkness then looked away from toward other point of horizon to see whether repeated elsewhere be peculiar to one definite spot longer have doubt that there be certain tangible something must only be ship must quickly determine upon step necessary to intercept first thing be to ascertain in what direction be steering when first discovered be dead to windward since then have drawn aft trifle being now about two point before weather beam must not have overtaken because in case must have passed so close a to have run over boat must not have failed to see fact that have slowly imperceptibly grown up out of darkness argued that be not sailing away from must be sailing toward because in case must have grown in size distinctness much more rapidly than have done strangely enough did seem to be crossing course in direction slight change in bearing being accounted for by progress of boat possibly might be hove to although be difficult to imagine why must be so unless have lost man overboard if be case must be showing light a guide to boat ought not to be very far away why so deadly silent must not understand a idea flitted through mind came to conclusion that correct thing to do be to close with a quickly a possible by making short tack toward so put down helm hove boat round upon starboard tack bringing vague black shadow about two point on weather bow flapping of sail while boat be in stay awoke companion who sat up in weak husky voice asked what be matter nothing answered at least nothing of alarming nature fact be that fancy can see something away out there on weather bow have tacked boat for purpose of investigating object more closely whereabout be object of speak asked pointed out to almost immediately saw do imagine to be ship mr conyers inquired not what else can be said added must not be too sanguine of help rescue just yet there be one two point in connection with object that make doubtful a to being ship be quickly demanded told that one be apparent immobility of object other being fact that light be being displayed explained that two together seemed incompatible with supposition that object ahead be ship repeating to indeed argument have flitted through own mind only few minute before yet with fathom that boat advanced shadow grew more palpable expanded approximated more closely to appearance of vessel hove to under bare pole at length after several anxious minute of alternating hope doubt there arrived moment when doubt became no longer possible for shadow have finally resolved into silhouette of brig under bare pole even thin line of mast by way looked stumpy a though topgallant mast be gone be perceptible to practised eye without pausing to puzzle out possible reason for singular condition of vessel hastily resigned yoke line to miss onslow springing upon mast thwart proceeded to hail brig at full power of lung delight at once more seeing vessel so close at hand being coupled with deadly anxiety lest must suddenly make sail get away from to hailing there came reply be light shown other indication vouchsafed cry have be heard even though continued until boat be actually crossing stern of stranger at distance of barely fifty fathom there be only one inference to be drawn from strange silence namely that brig be derelict surmise be borne out by fact that boat appeared to be gone yet must not detect sign that anything be wrong with be not sitting particularly deep in water so far a must judge in darkness did spar appear to be damaged except that a have already mentioned topgallant mast seemed to have be carried away there appeared therefore to be reason why must not venture alongside accordingly a soon a have stood on far enough to fetch on next tack hove boat round brig happening to lie broadside on to sea ran alongside to leeward dousing sail a came up abreast stranger lee quarter a shot up alongside found that vessel be certainly deeper in water than have at first imagined to be yet not deeper than might be accounted for by carrying heavy cargo covering board seemed to be about eighteen inch above water therefore have difficulty in clambering in over bulwark from gunwale of boat of course taking care to carry end of boat painter on board with making securely fast to cleat in bulwark glanced fore aft to see whether must discover indication of presence of human being on board deck appeared to be deserted gleam of light showed forward aft sound broke silence save wash of water along bend choking gurgle of scupper monotonous jerk jerk of spanker boom at sheet with roll of ship under circumstance considered that companion might safely venture aboard accordingly assisted up side in on deck afterwards dropping boat astern carefully securing by painter done conducted miss onslow aft to cabin companion be fitted with seat locker on side begged to be seated for short time while investigated further forthwith plunged below arrived at foot of companion ladder found confronted by bulkhead running athwart ship in presently found handle of door turning found a have expected in cabin be of course pitch dark pane of skylight just dimly showing overhead with merest suggestion of certain faintly gleaming something hanging from beam swinging with roll of ship presently identified a extinguished cabin lamp groping cautiously with hand presently encountered table uncovered working round next came to locker upholstered in horsehair a gathered from touch while be groping about on locker hand suddenly encountered what seemed to be tablecloth with few knife fork broken crockery few other matter entangled in fold whole suggesting idea that cabin have be scene of furious struggle during table laid for meal have be swept of everything upon leaving quite undisturbed in belief that when must see just how lay might obtain clue to mystery at present connected with ship continued research with result made out cabin to occupy extreme after end of vessel with possibly small sail room something of kind abaft that took up whole width of part of hull be to say there be stateroom between ship side a be sometimes case continuing to grope way round cabin presently arrived once more at bulkhead wherein on starboard side found door giving access to stateroom a soon discovered by finding bunk with bedding still in apparently quite ready for occupant did not take long to arrive at conclusion be in skipper stateroom for found underneath bunk be chest of drawer while in one corner be wash basin etcetera in other what seemed to be small bookcase having progressed thus far have hope of soon finding that of be in search namely box of match being sailor well acquainted with sailor way knew exactly where must be most likely place to find what wanted clambering up on bunk felt for shelf that knew ought to be at head of yes there be a felt along be disappointed to find that there be nothing on be there not have not examined entire length of when too hastily jumped to conclusion that be empty a hand travelled over into far corner suddenly encountered quite little store of thing heaped together clasp knife pipe piece of stick tobacco few other odd article among be box about half full of match proved to be rather damp have to strike full half dozen more before succeeded in persuading one to ignite while thus employed be struck for first time by coincidence between condition of affair on skipper shelf that in cabin loose article have in case found way right over to starboard a far a must go what did point to why obviously at time brig have heeled so heavily to starboard movable thing have fetched away by run gone over to side have never be replaced gathered from that brig have be suddenly hove over upon beam end that crew seized with panic doubt under impression that be capsizing have made rush for boat abandoned being a likely a not blown so far to leeward by squall hove brig over lost sight of altogether imagined that have foundered by by when squall have blown out brig with perhaps canvas blown away have simply righted again have be drifting about ever since how long ago that might have happened must not at moment guess thought that possibly with return of daylight might be able to discover indication enough to furnish with clue while thinking thus have succeeded in finding lighting small lamp hung in gimbal from fore bulkhead by illumination saw that stateroom be nice clean cosy little apartment such a miss onslow might occupy without discomfort waiting only to light cabin lamp globe of be smashed in on starboard side a though have be dashed violently against deck above hurried up ladder invited young lady to descend led straight to skipper stateroom urged to lie down while proceeded to search for food declined to take rest until have partaken of good meal so established comfortably on sofa locker proceeded forthwith in search of pantry found a have expected in corresponding position on opposite side of ship to cabin already designated in own mind a miss onslow in be several tin of preserved meat soup bottle of pickle vinegar jar of salt bottle of pepper cask about three quarter full of potato part of string of onion barrel nearly full of fine cabin biscuit bread a be called at sea small canister of tea of coffee jar of brown sugar in fact very fair assortment of such commodity a be usually to be found in ordinary ship pantry observed by way that such article a be labelled bore name of american manufacturer deduced from that fact impression that brig be yankee impression be subsequently confirmed took biscuit out of barrel broke in two handed one piece to miss onslow nibbling at other while further prosecuted research did because biscuit be hard dry starving a be there be not much likelihood of eating so much of a to prove injurious moreover must have effect of taking sharp edge off hunger enabling to eat cautiously in moderation of more appetising food intended to place upon table a quickly a possible next task be to explore galley found to be very nicely fitted up with what appeared to be excellent cooking stove generous supply of implement whole of have like article in cabin found way right over to starboard side moreover top of stove be rusted in such way a to suggest that water from copper have be capsized over everything in short tending to confirm original impression that brig have be on beam end looked into copper found empty then went to scuttle butt also be so nearly empty that did not care to use small remainder of water in there be more cask on deck so concluded that ship stock of water be kept below most probably in tank thought of latter reminded that have seen small copper pump in steward pantry so returned there to get then with in one hand lantern in other searched about on deck until have found small screw plug fitted into tank pipe presently have at disposal bucket of sweet fresh water poured into copper then lighted galley fire finding plenty of coal for immediate want in locker proceeded to prepare couple of tin of preserved soup have found in pantry then while be cooking returned to cabin to lay table found that miss onslow have forestalled having cleared away wreck off starboard locker restored tablecloth to proper position rearranged such portion of table equipage a have not be smashed in capsizal poor girl looked dreadfully white thin weary noticed that during absence have found time to take off hat to roughly rearrange hair eye looked red a though have be cry so with view of toning up little went to work rummaging in sofa locker presently found few bottle of port wine neck of one of promptly knocked off insisted upon taking glass there then obeyed with sweet submissiveness be in extraordinary contrast with demeanour aboard city of cawnpore flash of old spirit returned when have swallowed wine a handing glass said there have done a bade now insist upon taking also for look positively ghastly so ill that unless take great care of will break down altogether took wine then hurried away back to galley where remained until soup be ready of made moderate meal then without attempting to clear table gently conducted companion to skipper stateroom closed door upon flung just a be upon sofa locker of main cabin where instantly fell into sleep be absolute oblivion be awakened next morning by beam of brilliant sunshine flashing intermittently athwart closed eyelid to lazy roll of ship springing to foot peering out through nearest port saw that wind have died away to flat calm that water be oil smooth with very little swell running felt greatly refreshed by sleep brief though have be for be first spell of really sound slumber that precarious situation anxiety attendant upon have permitted to take since loss of city of cawnpore prompted thereto by hilarity resulting from rest cessation of anxiety started whistling softly a gazed out through port moment later miss be cabin door opened for space of inch young lady thus addressed through chink good morning mr conyers be glad to hear whistling show that rest have done good thank yes answered be feeling quite old self again morning be able to get rest yes indeed be reply be so tired that scarcely remember lying down have not be awake more than five minute what lovely morning be wonder whether might venture to trouble to get little water to wash in there be none in here certainly said will fetch bucketful at once place at door after intend to have bath on deck bath exclaimed in tone of unmistakable anxiety surely mean that be going to bathe in sea oh please mr conyers beg be far too dangerous for be sure there must be shark here think exceedingly probable therefore will not risk going overboard answered bath will be taken on fore deck in wash deck tub if can find one thank returned while be so engaged will lay table for breakfast still feel most atrociously hungry answered be glad to hear now that be once more in possession of provision then hurried off up on deck to procure water asked for after went forward found wash deck tub filled from over side treated to salt water bath refreshment of be like renewal of life to then having dressed lighted galley fire filled put on kettle have wash in fresh water made way aft to cabin where found miss onslow looking wonderfully fresh bright after night rest busily engaged in arranging cabin table for breakfast then came question what be to have have strong fancy for rasher of bacon delicacy seemed also to commend to companion therefore looked about for lazarette hatch discovered underneath mat at foot of companion ladder be soon overhauling content of storehouse craft proved to be abundantly stocked with excellent provision among discovered open cask nearly full of smoked ham one of at once appropriated hour later found indian judge daughter seated before most appetising breakfast a ate talked talked of what be now to do companion seemed to be under impression that discovery of derelict brig must in way alter arrangement have difficulty in demonstrating to that object making of way to civilised port from must make fresh start for calcutta still remained same only difference being whereas on previous day have possessed only open boat be starving now have vessel under foot that if staunch must prove far safer more comfortable than boat while also possessed food in abundance a pointed out to there be certain price to pay for advantage namely greatly increased labour of handling brig a compared with boat thought advisable to make young lady understand at once must from time to time require assistance presently discovered that there be need for to dwell upon point quickly informed that have already planned for performance of what might be called domestic part of work such a preparation of meal so on while also expressed perfect readiness to steer when required in other way assist so far a must here must not avoid being impressed afresh with extraordinary change that misfortune have wrought in girl for whereas while on board city of cawnpore have maintained demeanour of haughty repellent reserve be almost insolent now exhibited gentle submissiveness amiability of manner with quiet steadfast courage under circumstance of peculiar terrible hardship privation for gently nurtured woman conjoined with exceptional beauty of face form exercised fascination upon so potent that frequently found exceedingly difficult to maintain that equable coolness strict friendliness of behaviour demanded by exigency of peculiar situation of however be merely parenthetical breakfast over busy day awaited have used eye to good purpose even while taking morning tub have observed among other thing that brig canvas be not furled have simply be blown clear clean out of boltropes when accident befell have be under course single reefed topsail spanker fore topmast staysail jib for there boltropes still be with small fluttering rag of canvas still adhering to here there there be difficulty whatever in arriving at correct conclusion a to what have happened aspect of ship told story a plainly a own crew must have related thing have happened after nightfall that part of story be made clear by litter have be shot off cabin table showed that skipper one of mate have be at supper at time single reefed topsail indicated that have previously be blowing strong took that night have settled down so dark cloudy that officer of watch have failed to note approach of squall until too late topsail halliard have be let go fore aft when squall swooped down upon before be possible to do anything further brig have be hove down upon beam end panic have seized crew have made mad rush for boat under conviction that vessel be capsizing have be swamped have be driven out of sight to leeward before brig have righted again there be doubt that squall have be of exceptional violence for not only be sail blown away topgallant mast be gone at cap not only broken off actually torn away rigging held having parted must be strange indeed if vessel having passed through ordeal a must not show sign of having be more le strained be quite prepared to find that have considerable amount of water in anticipation be so far confirmed that upon sounding well found close upon three half foot of water in hold be bad enough still be hardly a bad a have expected now next thing to find out be whether be still leaking whether what contained have drained into during time when lay down on beam end must be done by patiently waiting few hour then sounding well again must be done equally effectively by pumping hooker dry then seeing whether more water drained into be vitally necessary to restore to normal condition of buoyancy a speedily a might be in view of possible recurrence of bad weather same contingency rendered almost if not quite a necessary to bend set sufficient amount of canvas to put ship under control first question to be settled be must first undertake considered matter for minute two came to conclusion that pumping out of three half foot of water must leave hand in such blistered raw condition that must be practically useless for such work a bending sail so determined to undertake latter job first especially a there be of course chance that weather might continue fine after springing up of breeze in event if brig be under canvas must be making headway during operation of pumping out be under impression on preceding night have detected presence of what might prove to be sail locker abaft after bulkhead of cabin so now descended with object of further investigating surmise proved well founded for when opened door in bulkhead there lay whole pile of sail before sail neatly stopped many of apparently quite new have come to conclusion must bend fore topmast staysail first after great deal of laborious work in turning over various bundle of canvas came to what be searching for not until have previously encountered new fore main topsail managed with considerable difficulty to drag on deck bending of staysail be very serious matter simply meant letting go halliard dragging upon downhaul cutting boltrope away from hank passing new seizing hoisting sail foot by foot until have got seizing finished bending sheet afresh there be to bend topsail single handed be much more difficult job decided to bend main topsail first by time have completed task day be done be growing so dark must scarcely see to finish off properly nevertheless be very well content with day work for now have canvas enough on brig to place under command whenever breeze might choose to come meanwhile miss onslow have be no le busy than in way have started by making complete mistress of brig resource looked at from housekeeper point of view in course of process have discovered what have already suspected have not found time to verify that outside cabin alongside companion ladder be stateroom that judging from appearance content have belonged to mate cabin have overhauled making inventory of content handed to have then tidied up made ready for occupation moreover have taken possession of galley have prepared good substantial appetising dinner in style that if not quite equal to of professional cook betrayed at least aptitude be a creditable a be opportune have also found time to do something have not remotest idea what to dress have gone considerable way toward renovating appearance obliterating disfigurement caused by action of sea water upon while in other way have spruced up appearance to extent excited fervent carefully concealed admiration at sunset night be still stark calm sky have fine clear settled aspect combined with slight disposition to rise on part of brig barometer led to anticipate that calm be destined to endure for few hour longer for be devoutly thankful for have be toiling like slave day fully exposed to scorching ray of cloudless sun be fatigued to verge of exhaustion be great comfort therefore to feel must not be called upon to look after ship night might safely indulge in few hour sleep might do so with greater confidence routed out tarpaulin from below with rigged up tent on wheel grating a shelter from heavy dew bringing up bed from mate bunk turning in on deck arrangement ensured that in event of breeze springing up during night must instantly become aware of be ready to promptly take such measure a might appear necessary chapter seven pick up shipwrecked crew night passed without incident of sort when awoke at dawn there be still sign of wind for be thankful for while be naturally anxious to be making progress be vitally necessary to get more sail upon brig little spell of calm weather happened most opportunely for purpose bath early breakfast went to work once more bending setting of fore topsail being first job finished about noon considered that have done very well when at dusk have added to spread of canvas standing jib spanker be whim of miss onslow that midday meal must be tiffin dinner being reserved until work of day be over when a young lady sagely remarked must spare time to do due justice to meal thus happened upon day in question that be quite dark when at length having washed polished up after labour of day took place at table in brig little cabin be then still flat calm have scarcely finished meal when little draught of air came down through open skylight cool refreshing at same moment sound of faint rustling of canvas reached ear at once sprang up on deck found that light air from about east south east have sprung up taking aback giving brig sternway pressure of water upon rudder have forced helm hard down however causing brig to box off have nothing to do therefore to trim sail steady helm at proper moment when vessel gathered headway began to move quietly through water on southerly course close hauled on larboard tack be now obliged to take wheel be not long before made discovery under sail now set brig be practically steering by time have be at wheel hour have contrived to hit off so accurately exact amount of weather helm required to keep craft going full by be able to lash wheel attend to other matter there be still plenty awaiting attention among other immediate demand upon energy there be boat to be secured thus far have be hanging on astern by painter be far too valuable possession to be longer neglected now that breeze have sprung up determined to secure forthwith while be still possible to do so brig carried pair of davit on quarter so hauled boat up on starboard side made fast slipped down into hooked on tackle then climbing inboard once more hauled hand taut then going forward brought aft snatch block have previously be using led fall one after other through to winch with miss onslow hanging on to rope to prevent slipping on barrel of winch managed to hoist boat secure weather continued fine wind light through night ship speed being barely three knot once more turned in on wheel grating slept soundly ship steering so perfectly that found quite unnecessary to interfere with wheel when awoke at sunrise be still stealing along a steadily a ever sky looked so beautifully fine clear when went below to breakfast in response to miss onslow summons that came upon quite a shock to discover a did by casual glance that mercury be falling not much just enough to indicate that breeze be going to freshen now have objection to wind freshening within certain limit up to point say where brig must just comfortably carry canvas be now set be in hurry to arrive somewhere within limit above named must have heartily welcomed increase of wind mischief be that when once strength of wind began to increase there be knowing how far might go might go on increasing to strength of whole gale in case must become necessary for to shorten sail unless chose to accept alternative of letting canvas blow away even in so small vessel a brig to shorten sail be serious matter when there happened to be only one person to undertake work yet if came on to blow must have to be done since must never do to let sail blow away so long be to say a must be saved by hard work there be however time enough to think about there be still more serious matter demanding attention namely getting rid of water in hold to task accordingly addressed immediately after breakfast first taking precaution to most carefully sound well result of preliminary operation be so far reassuring found depth of just three foot six inch of water merest trifle more than rod have showed forty eight hour before thus demonstrating that hull be once more practically a tight a bottle thus encouraged got to work at pump working steadily systematically exerting strength to best advantage sparing hand a far a possible by enwrapping handle first in canvas then in strip of blanket taken from one of forecastle bunk be terribly back breaking work steady toil at pump when midday arrived knocked off to get meridian altitude of sun wherefrom to compute latitude be pretty well exhausted have reward in discovery have reduced depth of water in hold by nearly eight inch thus showing that after quantity of water be not nearly so formidable a have at first seemed existing indeed only in more le inconsiderable space not occupied by cargo after tiffin again went to work toiled steadily on until sunset by time have reduced depth by further six inch at same time fatiguing to point of exhaustion through day of toil have be maintaining most anxious watch upon weather without detecting disquieting sign whatever be true that wind strengthened somewhat sufficiently in fact to bring brig speed up to close upon five knot be reverse of alarming especially a sky remained clear when at length sat down to dinner that evening found that mercury still manifested disposition to sink apart however from behaviour on part of barometer omen be so reassuring that when miss onslow bade goodnight retired to cabin unhesitatingly settled again upon wheel grating for night soon fell into deep sleep of healthy fatigue be awakened time during night have idea of hour by loud rustling of canvas upon starting to foot found that wind have strengthened so considerably that slight amount of weather helm afforded by lashed wheel have at length proved insufficient with result that brig have shot into wind throwing topsail aback fore aft canvas shiver instinctively sprang to wheel put well over just in time to pay vessel off again be fully hour before have again hit off exact position of wheel with sufficient nicety to allow of being again lashed brig once more left to take care of herself during operation have be anxiously scanning sky beyond few small scattered fleece of cloud here there remained a clear a have be at sunset having at length adjusted wheel to satisfaction came to conclusion might safely leave matter a be until morning secure little more rest while opportunity remained to therefore resumed recumbent position upon wheel grating be soon once more asleep time however slept le soundly than before curious instinct of watchfulness even in slumber be so quickly developed in sailor others who be constantly exposed to danger be now fully aroused although slept sens faculty be so far on alert that when somewhat later wind suddenly breezed up in spiteful squall heard moan of before reached brig be broad awake on foot in time to put helm up keep broad away before wind came away strong enough to make anxious for topmast for few minute a yard be braced sharp up while brig be running away dead before wind struck sail very obliquely spar be thus relieved of great deal of strain must otherwise have come upon of course there be more sleep for night for when at squall have blown out left behind strong northerly breeze that very soon knocked up sea heavy enough to make ardently wish for daylight opportunity to shorten sail when dawn at length appeared grew more anxious than ever for new day showed a long ragged gash of fierce copper yellow light glaring through gap in otherwise unbroken expanse of dirty grey cloud struck here there with dash of dull crimson colour air be unnaturally clear head of surge showing up against wild yellow of eastern horizon jet black a sharp clean cut a brimmed to brig rail aspect of sky meant wind in plenty before long realised that unless must contrive to shorten sail in double quick time task must pas beyond power canvas must have to remain set until must blow away at length miss onslow made appearance on deck bright fresh rosy from night sleep cry of dismay broke from lip a took in state of affair at single comprehensive glance oh mr conyers exclaimed how long have be like be in danger only in so far that stand to lose of sail unless can contrive to get clewed up before come on to blow harder answered have be waiting for to come on deck relieve at wheel continued in order may get about job at once why did not call demanded a stepped up on wheel grating beside took spoke from hand oh said have not be bad enough to justify in disturbing thus far nevertheless be very glad to have help now a believe there be time to lose kindly keep a now be dead before wind will get about work of shortening sail without further delay so saying hurried away forward letting go trysail outhaul main topsail halliard on way passing next to fore topsail halliard also let run then squared yard hauled in brailed up furled trysail next took reef tackle one after other to winch heaving a taut a must get after jumped aloft passed reef earring tied knittles be now tolerably safe brig being under close reefed topsail so hove to while took breakfast after hauled down stowed jib got brig away before wind again with miss onslow at wheel resumed pumping operation toiled through day reducing amount of water in hold to depth of eighteen inch only then hove to brig on port tack for night of being by time so completely exhausted that rest be even more important to than food although took care that must not be obliged to go without latter about two hour after sunset wind freshened up still more by midnight be blowing so heavily so mountainous sea be running that dared not longer leave brig to herself became necessary to constantly tend helm although craft be hove to in consequence have alternative to pas latter half of night also at wheel exposed to pelting rain quickly drenched to skin be now blowing whole gale from northward so continued for next thirty hour during nearly whole of time remained at wheel wet cold nearly crazy at last for want of rest indeed for attention almost amounting to devotion of companion believe must never have weathered that terrible time of fatigue exposure end to came at last however gale broke wind softened down somewhat at length sea went down sufficiently to permit of wheel being once more lashed when leaving brig in miss onslow charge with strict injunction be at once to be called in event of change for worse in weather went below rolled into mate bunk instantly lost consciousness for ensuing ten hour be somewhere about midnight when awoke yet when turned out found miss onslow still up not only so with hot thoroughly appetising meal ready for sat down partook of together when have finished went on deck have look round found that weather have greatly improved during long sleep so turned in again until morning when next went on deck weather have cleared wind have dwindled to five knot breeze hauling out from eastward again at same time sea have gone down to such extent a to be scarcely perceptible therefore shook out reef once more made sail upon ship task kept busy right up to noon weather being fine be able to secure meridian altitude of sun thus ascertain latitude of brig with resulting discovery that be already to southward of cape parallel be disconcerting in extreme more so from fact that easterly wind be forcing still farther to southward there be help for must hing keep on a be hope for shift of wind fact of being so far to southward accounted too for circumstance that be not falling in with other vessel hitherto have be so fully employed that have found no time to search for ship paper do more than ascertain bare fact that be of american nationality that be named governor smeaton that hailed from portland maine now that weather have come fine once more determined to devote few hour to work of overhauling vessel discovering what must about so went to work instituted thoroughly systematic search beginning in skipper cabin having of course first obtained miss onslow permission there stowed carefully away in lock up desk after hesitation decided to break open found ship paper intact enclosed in small tin case from learned first that late master be named josiah hobson second that be bound on trading voyage to pacific with cargo of notion then in drawer also in skipper cabin carefully stowed away under clothes found log book chart of atlantic ocean with brig course up to certain point pricked off upon from two document learned that brig have sailed on such such date from new york with what in way of weather progress so on have befallen up to date five week later whereon entry have be made in log book up to noon remark respecting weather at hour gave indication of warning of catastrophe must have occurred only few hour later last entry in log book enabled to determine that brig have be drifting about derelict for nearly three week when two ocean waif fell in with took possession of notion of cargo consisted seemed according to manifest to comprise more le of nearly everything must possibly captivate savage fancy in addition to multitudinous article there be somewhere in ship few bale of good mostly linen fine muslin silk ready made clothing consigned to firm in valparaiso believed must be of utmost value to miss onslow if must find under circumstance felt must unhesitatingly appropriate to use therefore determined that next task must be to search for bale being composed of rather valuable good destined moreover to be discharged at brig first port of call thought must probably be found on top of rest of cargo near to one of hatch next day proved even finer than predecessor wind holding in same direction of perhaps shade le strength than on day before while sea have gone down until water be smooth a surface of pond excepting for low swell scarcely ever quite disappears in mid ocean be ideal day for taking off hatch therefore determined to commence examination of cargo at once beginning with main hatch to knock out wedge remove batten roll back tarpaulin be not difficult job when have got thus far removal of couple of hatch be soon effected luck be with day for sooner have got hatch off than eye fell upon bale bearing mark according to testimony of vessel manifest showed to be one of of be in search be too large be too tightly wedged in among others to admit of moving unaided with assistance of strop on mainstay watch tackle soon broke out triumphantly landed on deck manifest gave content a ready made clothing men woman be exactly what miss onslow at least needed more than anything else so opened forthwith then called young lady to overhaul content select what must while gave spell at wheel in ten minute came aft with arm full of neatly folded white material disappeared below then came on deck again have further search time carried off load of coloured fabric after remained invisible for nearly three quarter of hour finally reappeared clad in entirely new rig out from top to toe very sweet charming looked although regret being unable to inform female reader of detail of costume then have inning after considerable amount of rummaging succeeded in finding couple of suit of light tweed thought must fit together with generous supply of underclothing done more pressing need in matter of clothing met returned despoiled bale to place in hatchway replaced hatch battened everything securely down once more remainder of day devoted to task of pumping ship dry two succeeding day be quite devoid of incident weather held fine wind so light that brig made barely three knot in hour on taut bowline there be nothing particular to do for small air of wind continued to blow hung obstinately at east be still driving slowly south vessel steering under circumstance a be daily growing increasingly anxious to fall in with sail of sort must take off convey to civilised port even lend few hand to help in carrying brig to cape town spent pretty nearly whole of day in main topmast crosstrees from whence must obtain most extended view possible perhaps be thus able to intercept craft must otherwise slip past unseen on third day after raid upon cargo be aloft a usual hour being about ten be while miss onslow be busy in out of galley ship be creeping along at speed of about two half knot when slowly carefully sweeping horizon afresh with telescope after rather long spell of meditation upon how adventure be likely to end small hazy looking ill defined object swam into field of instrument object be about one point before weather beam be so far away that rarefaction of air imparted to wavering indistinctness of aspect rendered quite unrecognisable fact however that be visible at in slightly hazy atmosphere led to estimate distance from brig a about ten mile while from apparent size might be boat raft piece of floating wreckage might be determined to examine since must be nothing out of way must merely involve labour of getting ship round upon other tack so continued to watch until have drifted to couple of point abaft beam occurred just two half hour after have first sighted thus confirming estimate a to distance when put helm hard down lashed then tended brace a brig sluggishly came up into wind a sluggishly paid off on starboard tack when brig be fairly round helm steadied found that object bore full point on lee bow that must probably fetch with ease be now distant about ten half mile so there be plenty of time for to go below get tiffin ere closing be within about two hour of sunset when at length came up with object long ere then have with assistance of telescope made out to be large boat apparently ship longboat unrigged drifting idly before wind yet trim sitting low a be on water showed that be not empty at length when be within two mile of suddenly observed movement of sort aboard couple of oar be laid out with difficulty thought be at wheel when occurred for have discovered time earlier in afternoon that although with wheel lashed brig must be made to steer fairly well upon wind be just trifle too erratic in course to hit off fetch such comparatively small object a be now aiming for consequently have be steering through afternoon at once called miss onslow to relieve while ran ensign star stripe up to peak a encouragement to occupant of boat intimation that have be seen be tedious work snail like closing with boat be rendered more so by fact that in after vainly attempting for five minute to use oar have given up effort be once more invisible in bottom of boat while oar left to take care of have gradually slid through rowlock gone adrift simple circumstance apparently so trivial be to very significant pointing a considered did to condition of such absolute exhaustion on part of stranger even loss of oar have become matter of indifference to who must tell what eternity of suffering men have endured ere being brought into condition be quite likely that lonely drifting boat have be scene of ghastly tragedy who must tell what sight of horror might be passively awaiting between gunwale of craft once more resigned wheel to miss onslow hand with strict injunction to not to leave attempt to get peep at interior of boat on account then went forward to prepare rope end to drop into a drew up alongside conned brig in such manner a to bring boat alongside under lee fore chain then when proper moment have arrived let go weather main brace swung topsail aback intention be to have jumped into boat with rope end a came alongside taking turn anywhere for moment a with main topsail aback crept slowly down upon poor forlorn looking waif gaunt unkempt scarecrow suddenly upreared in stern sheet uttering queer gibbering sound while scrambled forward into eye of boat with movement somehow be equally suggestive of very opposite quality of agility exhaustion held out lean talon like hand for rope be waiting to heave a drifted alongside boat hove rope end man caught collapsing rather than stooping with made fast to ring bolt in stem then uprearing once more stiffly a though fighting against deadly lethargy made staggering spring for brig rail missed must have fallen headlong backward into boat have not caught by collar heaven what skeleton man be be fully a tall a myself have appearance of having once be big brawny hercules of fellow so wasted be now that with scarcely effort with one hand lifted in over bulwark deposited on deck where again limply doubled up sank in heap groaning kept eye fixed upon face stiffly opening jaw pointed to black shrivelled tongue at once recognising condition ran aft taking tumbler from pantry quickly mixed about wineglassful of weak brandy water with sped back to will never forget horrible expression of mad wolfish craving leapt into unfortunate creature bloodshot eye a approached bent over glared at tumbler howled like wild beast then suddenly snatched at hand a held liquid to lip clung so tightly to that before must withdraw tumbler have drained of drop of content even then must not release continued to pull suck at empty tumbler for several second at length however let go groaning more more time mixed considerable quantity of weak grog in jug took on deck with remembering that there be others in boat alongside who be also probably perishing of thirst administered further small quantity of mixture to patient be marvellous to see effect of upon strength seemed to return to a though by magic a sat up on deck muttered thickly more drink more drink for love of god 'd sell soul for tumbler of stuff powerful though fellow adjuration be refused request considering that after evidently long abstention must do more harm than good perhaps kill even to let drink too freely at first so putting jug tumbler out of sight reach turned attention to longboat alongside be fine big powerful boat evidently from appearance have belonged to large ship now that have time to look at attentively saw that mast sail be in laid fore aft thwart together with six long oar sweep bore deeply cut in transom word black prince liverpool there be six water breaker in bottom huddled up in sort of attitude eloquent of extremest suffering there lay stretched upon doubled over thwart in bottom of boat no le than fifteen men whether living dead be difficult for moment to say at event be evident that there be time to be lost for if men be not actually dead life be hanging by thread so recovering possession of jug of weak grog tumbler slid down into boat taking a came wetted lip of with little of liquid of be able to swallow at once while others have teeth so tightly clenched that be impossible to get jaw apart eventually not to dwell at unnecessary length upon scene so fraught with lingering long drawn out suffering contrived to restore one of to consciousness to get aboard brig where spent several hour in attending to with miss onslow assistance administering food drink in small quantity until strength have so far returned to that there be longer danger of perishing when got below into forecastle left to rest undisturbed next day be so far recovered a to be able to move about even to climb on deck out of forecastle unaided on second day seven of reported fit for such light duty a taking trick at wheel so on among first to recover be cook steward who at once assumed proper duty much to satisfaction for necessary a have hitherto be for to avail of miss onslow assistance went sorely against grain for to see day after day performing such mean duty a of cooking be great relief to when be able to inform henceforward must be relieved of such work unexpected acquisition of sixteen men constituting a did really strong crew for such small craft a brig relieved of very heavy load of anxiety for now felt that with tight seaworthy vessel under foot crew must enable to handle take care of in weather there be reason why companion must not speedily reach cape town end of trouble there be one thing remaining to occasion uneasiness be fact that chronometer have run down stopped during time that brig have be drifting about derelict consequently have mean of ascertaining longitude most awkward predicament to be in especially when approaching coast a though fate be satisfied with what have already inflicted upon have now relented so completely a to be eager to hasten deliverance happened that on very day when new crew reported a fit for duty fell in with homeward bound china clipper from skipper of whom obtained longitude be thus enabled to start chronometer again information thus afforded showed that be within two hundred forty mile of south african capital little more than twenty four hour run if wind must chop round come fair for chapter eight crew take possession of brig process of nursing rescued men back to health strength have afforded opportunity to learn story briefly be to effect that ship black prince of liverpool have sailed from melbourne for home on date that have gone well with until such date when ship be discovered to be on fire in fore hold effort have then be made to subdue flame ineffectually fire continuing to spread until three hour after discovery of outbreak flame burst through deck when became apparent that ship be doomed boat be ordered out according to narrative of men ship have be abandoned in perfectly orderly manner passenger going away in cutter gig in charge of captain three mate while remaining portion of crew for whom room must not be found in boat be told off to longboat have remained by ship until burned to water edge sank then made sail in company steering north west course then on fourth day westerly gale have sprung up boat have become separated be supposed to have occurred about fortnight before have fallen in with admitted that be by mean sure a to period for on twelfth day after abandoning ship provision have become exhausted have be subjected to horror of starvation during latter portion of have lost account of time having heard story became necessary to tell own did in considerable detail winding up by informing that brig having be found derelict salvage money upon must amount to something very considerable that while by right whole of might be claimed by miss onslow must willingly divide equally among hand instead of offering ordinary wage for assistance in taking vessel into port be rather disappointed to observe that generous offer a considered evoked show of enthusiasm gratitude on part of crew accepted quite a matter of course a more than due although be fully aware that between miss onslow have already taken care of sailed brig for several day barring such untoward circumstance a heavy gale of wind must no doubt have eventually taken into table bay said nothing however knowing from past experience forecastle jack be not overmuch given to feeling of gratitude perhaps in too many case poor fellow have little nothing to be grateful for proceeded with business of vessel by appointing peter o'gorman late boatswain john price late carpenter of black prince to position of chief second mate respectively done two men named at once picked watch port watch assumed duty starboard watch went below everybody apparently settled forthwith into proper place while ceremony of picking watch be proceeding availed myself of opportunity thus afforded to take stock of new associate a whole after making allowance for effect of hardship suffering that have so recently passed through be compelled to confess to myself that be by mean prepossessing lot one o'gorman price not excepted wore sullen hang dog ruffianly expression of countenance mark very lowest class of british seaman scum refuse of vocation still have not far to go consoled with reflection that must probably prove good enough to serve purpose on following morning immediately after breakfast secured set of observation of sun for longitude miss onslow noting chronometer time for immediately afterwards descended to cabin to work out while on deck engaged with sextant have noticed that movement be being watched with extraordinary interest by hand on deck when upon return to cabin proceeded to make calculation afterwards prick off brig position on chart must not help observing that steward who be busying in out of pantry at time betrayed a keen interest in doings a of people on deck miss onslow be also watching when have finished be about to roll up chart asked if have found out ship position whereupon pointed out to at same time casually mentioning fact that be still one hundred eighty mile from table bay a said saw steward leave pantry go on deck thought nothing of at time believing that have done so in ordinary course of duty little later on have reason to believe that errand be to inform shipmate a to position of brig having put away chart waited few minute for miss onslow who have announced intention of going on deck made way up companion ladder took few turn fore aft weather side of deck together from wheel grating to wake of main rigging companion be in high spirit at favourable turn seemed to have occurred in affair be chatting with in animated tone a to what must be best to do upon arrival in cape town when o'gorman who have be forward among crew came slouching aft along deck in true shell back fashion with rather abrupt salutation of morning misther mornin ' miss unceremoniously joined well o'gorman what be said for have met spoken to several time already on same morning imagined that now have matter of ship business to discus

shifted weight uneasily from leg to leg two three time glanced uncomfortably from miss onslow face to mine removed large quid of tobacco from cheek carefully deposited in cap betrayed many other symptom of extreme awkwardness perturbation of mind for full minute more without discovering way of saying what have to say so uncouthly ridiculous exhibition did make of presently detected tremor of repressed laughter in pressure of companion hand upon arm second two later young lady risibility so far mastered that felt constrained to bury face in pocket handkerchief under pretence of being troubled with sudden fit of coughing o'gorman however be not to be so easily deceived at once observed convulsion recognised for what be circumstance that have excited mirth of girl seemed to sting into action for suddenly straightened up with vindictive glare at miss onslow exclaimed ah so ye be laughin at eh all right beauty laugh away laugh other side ov y ' r purty face afore long o'gorman

appealing to group of seaman standing behind irishman be true be possible that really contemplate repaying lady for what have done for with such barbarous ingratitude men shuffled uneasily looked at

mutineer in probability have be killed by in self defence a be anger bitterly humiliating conviction of utter helplessness so nearly overcame be seized with attack of giddiness caused everything upon eye rested to become blurred indistinct to whirl hither thither in most distracting fashion while seemed to lose control of tongue so that when essayed to speak found impossible to utter single intelligible word moreover must have be on very verge of becoming unconscious from violence of agitation for have precisely same feeling that one experience when dreaming sensation of vagueness unreality a to what be transpiring so that when miss onslow spoke voice sounded faint far away word although heard distinctly conveyed special significance to comprehension mr conyers will acquaint with decision in due time when have have leisure for reflection said in haughtily scornful tone of hers remembered so well then felt yielded to pressure of guiding hand presently found groping way with assistance down companion ladder into cabin guided to one of sofa locker upon mechanically seated then saw go to swinging rack pour out good stiff modicum of brandy brought held to lip swallowed draught after few second sens returned to almost a though be recovering from swoon miss onslow assisting recovery by seating beside fanning with pocket handkerchief gazing anxiously in face while there be better now exclaimed encouragingly a continued to regard oh mr conyers continued be so very sorry to see thus be not surprised after hardship anxiety hard work that have be called upon to endure since wreck of unfortunate city of cawnpore what have so bravely borne have be more than sufficient to undermine health of strongest man now when hoped that few hour more must bring to end of trouble come cruel shock disappointment of wretch base ingratitude to complete what hardship anxiety suffering have begun cheer up be not yet lost by mean deliverance be merely deferred until will have carried out wish of men therefore since have alternative let accept inevitable with good grace do what require a speedily a may be so bring unfortunate adventure to end continued after barely perceptible pause have anxiety on account o'gorman accomplice will not molest if will conform to wish if must will be prepared for fore warned be fore armed ' may imagine how deeply ashamed of of late weakness felt a listened to heroic word of delicately nurtured girl who have known nothing either of danger privation hardship until frightful experience of three have come to with wreck of ship be to have conveyed to father arm yet terrible a situation be uttered word of repining courage be immeasurably superior to mine sympathy be for there be apprehension on own behalf now at moment when new dreadful trouble have come upon top of that have previously undergone when brightest hope be dashed to ground be who found needful to encourage instead of having to comfort encourage must permit to suffer humiliation of having proved le strong than at first word of apology self condemnation uttered silenced by laying whole blame upon anxiety fatigue to have be of late exposed when at length have salved wound inflicted upon self esteem by recent loss of self control set about task of coaxing to yield with at least apparent good grace to demand of men seeing that be completely in power must do otherwise in order that might secure such full measure of good treatment from a might be disposed to accord to so convincingly did argue that despite reluctance to acknowledge conquered at length gave in being influenced chiefly thereto not by miss onslow argument by galling conviction that in way only must hope to save from violence with scoundrel have almost openly threatened in event of non compliance matter settled went on deck where found entire crew congregated about binnacle awaiting watched approach in silence a thought with ill concealed anxiety until be within two pace of group when halted regarding steadfastly by time have completely recovered command of temper self possession a noted anxious look began to realise after fellow be by mean so independent of that must be likely to wantonly provoke resolved to bring point well home to with view of driving most advantageous bargain possible well men said have considered proposal have come to conclusion will accede to upon certain condition will set forth in due course first of must like to know what must have done supposing have not happened to have be navigator rest of men looked at o'gorman replied oh 'd just have have to join have gone overboard yes said what then how must have managed without anyone to have navigated ship for must have have to have ' done best must replied price nonchalantly to what part of pacific be bound asked to oiland in latichood began o'gorman to island interrupted do think must ever have succeeded in finding island without assistance of navigator do think must ever have reached pacific at by what mean must ascertain whereabouts avoid danger demanded there be long silence price at length broke by replying oh 'd have managed somehow yes said must have managed somehow for few day week a case might be at end of time must either have run ship ashore lost must have found yourselves hopelessly out of reckoning with knowledge of where be how to steer in order to reach destination nobody attempted to reply to hand evidently realising truth of what have said pondering upon at length however when silence have grown embarrassing o'gorman broke by asking in much more civil tone than have yet chosen to adopt with well misther allowin ' to be thrue what of nothing except before propounding condition upon be willing to agree to proposal wished to make perfectly clear to that can do absolutely nothing without help said have chosen to adopt very domineering offensive tone with under evident impression that young lady be completely at mercy so be willingly admit not to extent that seem to suppose because if will reflect for moment will see that dare not murder even ill treat young lady here be in south atlantic not man among posse knowledge enough to take brig from where now float to port hence be a much at mercy a be at yours can do absolutely nothing without therefore if require assistance must agree to term very well sorr answered o'gorman let hear what

must do to talk to why must look at old tarry breech like much le talk to garn go ahead sir will look awfter chip keep in order never fear hope will for own sake retorted significantly leaving to interpret meaning a chose next condition continued be that cabin stateroom be to be left to exclusive use of lady steward only being allowed access to next condition be that man will have more than two gill of rum per day half to be served out at midday remainder at four bell of first dog watch in event of bad weather other especial circumstance allowance may be increased at discretion by so much a may consider necessary last condition be that when business be concluded lady be to be allowed to take boat with sufficient stock of provision water to quit ship within sight of suitable harbour to be chosen by dead silence followed bold announcement on part be at length broken by o'gorman who looking round upon motley crowd of follower demanded well bhoys have heard what gintleman say have anny of ye annything to say agin yes have answered irrepressible price care ropeyarn whether be allowed to speak to gal not think o'gorman seein ' that be to be mate of here hooker ought to

enough for who have lived in fo ' kbeles life very well then let agree to gent term have done with d 'ye s ' y soon appeared that entire party be willing price however consenting under protest so retired to cabin drew up term in writing together with acknowledgment on part of crew that have taken ship from by force be acting a navigator under compulsion entire party more le reluctantly signed affixed mark to miss onslow acting a witness to signature of men done with bitter chagrin profound misgiving a to issue of adventure gave order to wear ship bore up on course pointed brig jib boom straight for far distant cape of storm chapter nine sight strange sail having secured possession of brig succeeded in coercing to become navigator to island in pacific locality of have a yet kept secret upon errand nature of have not seen fit to divulge to crew at once went industriously to work under o'gorman to put vessel ataunto once more by routing out sending aloft spare topgallant mast yard bending new sail overhauling making good rigging in short repairing damage of description with such goodwill did work in ten day from date of seizure of brig everything have be done that be possible to do so far a outward appearance of craft be concerned there be nothing to show that anything have ever be wrong with meanwhile during progress of renovating process steward have made business to give lazarette thorough stock taking overhaul of result of be kept ignorant gathered that examination be not altogether satisfactory for when be over steward have made report to o'gorman latter came to anxiously demanded to know what distance then be from horn be on afternoon of third day after seizure of brig upon carefully measuring off distance from position at noon on day found that amounted to three thousand seven hundred odd mile distance seemed to be staggerer to fellow when in reply to further question informed that might reckon upon brig taking nearly quite month to cover made attempt to conceal dismay that something be radically wrong at once became apparent for there be long conclave in forecastle object of presumably be to determine how to meet emergency shrewdly suspected that emergency arose out of unexpected discovery that brig stock of provision water be insufficient to carry to destination fervently hoped that conjecture might prove correct a in case must be compelled to touch somewhere to renew stock felt that if in case failed to secure arrest of whole party for piracy must richly deserve to remain tool exposed to countless vacillating dangerous humour of gang of ruffian who have deliberately thrown off restraint of law order in speculating thus be reckoning without host be crediting o'gorman satellite with scruple that did not posse have not yet fully gauged villainy of be capable thus far ever since have borne up for horn have be favoured with fair wind plenty of on second day after occurrence of above event wind began to fail by sunset night have dwindled away until brig have barely steerage way while surface of ocean presented that streaky oily appearance be usually precursor of flat calm meanwhile during afternoon sail have hove in sight in north western board steering south east when sun went down in clear haze of ruddy gold sail of stranger reddened by last beam of luminary glowed against clear opal tint of north western sky at distance of eight mile broad on starboard bow stranger be barque rigged vessel of three hundred fifty ton so quite ordinary everyday looking craft with nothing whatever of alarming character in aspect yet have not long be in sight when became quite apparent that o'gorman crew be greatly exercised at appearance be at first disposed to imagine that emotion arose from circumstance of being fully aware that in seizing brig a have done have committed act of piracy that now feared detection attendant unpleasant consequence by sunset have found occasion to alter opinion for have by then become evident that o'gorman be manoeuvring not to avoid to close with stranger in such manner a to avoid arousing suspicion a to design sooner did intention of o'gorman become apparent than began to ask what must be motive for such course only satisfactory reply must find to question be that wished to ascertain whether skipper have provision to spare if so to endeavour to treat with for purchase have by time seen enough of o'gorman to recognise that be quite acute enough to discern advantage safety transaction must afford over alternative of being compelled to touch at port have little doubt that surmise a to intention must prove correct at event determination to speak barque be evident began to cast about for mean whereby encounter might be utilised to advantage of miss onslow there be two three way in might possibly be benefited by incident if only must contrive to establish private communication with skipper of stranger in first place if barque happened to be british of however have doubt might make skipper acquainted with circumstance relating to brig seizure appeal to to compel irishman gang by force if necessary to surrender miss onslow if must prove impossible might perhaps be able to secure miss onslow transfer to stranger when safety having be assured must matter comparatively little what happened to myself in event of scheme failing might possibly succeed in privately arranging with skipper to acquaint authority with predicament request to take necessary step to effect rescue one of plan might perhaps succeed in putting into effect provided that irishman must prove careless neglectful enough to permit of communicating with skipper of barque must be so very much doubted yet must try if a anticipated must find impossible to obtain private speech with skipper of barque might still be able to surreptitiously convey to letter must serve purpose quite a well meditating thus made way below to brig snug little cabin with intention of forthwith inditing epistle there found miss onslow seated upon one of locker ostensibly engaged in reading with beautiful eye fixed upon gently swaying lamp hung in skylight with dreamy absent look in showed thought to be far away do happen to know whether steward be in pantry miss onslow asked with glance in direction of apartment named a entered cabin be not there went on deck nearly hour ago replied do want anything mr conyers nothing more at present than few minute privacy freedom from espionage answered listen miss onslow continued have be engaged for last two hour in quietly observing manoeuvre of o'gorman have come to conclusion that intends to close with speak barque have be in sight afternoon now proceeding may may not be to advantage if can succeed in effecting communication with skipper may be possible for to accomplish one of three thing first may with assistance of barque crew be enabled to effect escape from people altogether if must prove impracticable may possibly be enabled to secure transfer to barque if attempt also must fail surely ought to be able with help of barque people to communicate with authority ashore claim from rescue from present precarious exceedingly unpleasant situation y e e companion assented meditatively then after slight pause asked have ever thought of what end of adventure be likely to be so far a two be concerned supposing that must fail to effect escape from o'gorman companion certainly matter be never absent from thought answered be bound upon what can not help thinking fool errand to island in pacific upon o'gorman party expect to find certain treasure treasure either will will not find in case anticipate so far a be concerned adventure will end in being landed somewhere at sufficient distance from town to permit of o'gorman getting clear away with brig before must have time to give alarm secure capture that of course be assuming that carry out men wish without giving trouble commented miss onslow continued what do imagine be likely to be result effect upon if cause trouble anxiety by endeavouring to escape have made perfectly evident to that can not dispense with service do really think worth while to irritate provoke by attempting to escape true be exceedingly unpleasant people to be brought into such close constant contact with there seems to be great harm in provided that be allowed to have own way ah exclaimed evidently know of what ship crew may become capable when once have committed so serious crime a piracy for be what have done in taking brig from be not what men be now what may become in future of be thinking especially so far a be concerned recognise possibility in future may make brig scene of hourly peril to of nature shudder to think of be safety that be concerned about assured must face rest with equanimity thank be exceedingly good kind of to think so much for so little for answered companion spoke with face turned away from so be unable to read expression voice have intonation must have given much to have be able to translate be merely imagination asked be there really recurrent shade of former hauteur of manner mingled with just faintest suggestion of irony impatience fact be be at moment a far from being able to comprehend lovely inscrutable woman a when met for first time in saloon of city of cawnpore mood be a changeable a weather there be occasion when manner toward be almost a warm genial sympathetic a even lover must require while there be others when appeared animated by set purpose to impress upon conviction that remarkable adventure together invested with claim upon beyond of merest ordinary gratitude a for if have not already allowed fact to leak out may a well here make clean breast of confess loved with ardent passion of man heart be capable be resolutely determined to win love in return up to moment of be now speaking seemed to have made so little headway often doubted whether have made at have however come at length to recognise that rebuff occasionally met with followed speech action of mine of young lady did not wholly approve so soon found to be in present instance remained silent for perhaps minute after speaking word recounting of have extorted from above explanation then continued with much greater cordiality believe mr conyers be sincerely grateful to for perfectly evident anxiety on account be obliged to confess regard situation a nearly so desperate a seem to do think that of will have anything to fear from o'gorman companion if will reconcile to performance of task that have imposed upon do really fear be what may happen if wilfully exasperate by making attempt to thwart plan by depriving of assistance without must remind again can hing help to carry through undertaking never mind whether not be fool errand have confidence that will treat with utmost consideration after own rough fashion seriously provoke ask be likely to be consequence to of course if can so contrive that can be rescued by ship in sight will be more delighted than can say a to attempting to get transferred to alone will think strange unaccountable perhaps feel so very much more safe here with to protect than must on board strange ship alone that if be to remain here must very much rather remain with word calculated to send blood of ardent lover throbbing through vein like quicksilver be not yet excited not one atom of jubilation in for be uttered in tone of such coldness indifference felt a certain a must be of anything that be wholly of herself not at of that speaker be thinking very well answered steeling to adoption of equally cold manner of speech think understand wish in matter will endeavour to carry out if stranger yonder can be induced to take out of hand of ruffian well good if not be to take other step bowed acquiescence turned to book once more with manner indicating that discussion be at end accepting hint retired at once to cabin to prepare letter addressed to skipper of stranger to be conveyed to if opportunity must permit although have yielded seeming acquiescence to miss onslow misguided wish to share captivity must be continued aboard brig must not be supposed have intention of lending to so terribly dangerous mistaken proceeding be perfectly clear to that high spirited girl have in unaccountable way completely missed point of remark utterly failed to comprehend frightfully precarious perilous character of position aboard brig moreover mere presence there served o'gorman a lever menace powerful enough to constrain irresistibly to most abject submission to will so long a remained where be in power of ruffian must do absolutely nothing for fear of what might inflict upon by way of revenge with removed from power placed in safety might possibly be able to bring one of wretch into grip of law that have so audaciously defied so when began to pen letter to unknown skipper be careful after briefly describing peculiar situation to appeal to a powerfully a must to effect rescue of girl by mean at command regardless of what might become of having at length finished letter folded up into suitably small compact form placed by in one of pocket in readiness to transfer at first favourable opportunity to individual for whom be intended then filling pipe made way leisurely up on deck to take look round see in what direction matter be trending be magnificently fine brilliant moon lit night with only few small scattered shred of light fleecy cloud floating overhead soft warm air breathing out from north east so gently that scarcely stirred oil smooth surface of ocean indeed only touched here there in faint evanescent cat paw barely sufficed to give brig steerage way with squared yard possible inch of canvas spread a for barque be now about point on starboard bow not more than mile distant be evidently not under command a have swung round head to wind lay there in bright moonlight swaying with almost imperceptible swing over long low hummock of glassy swell with canvas gleaming softly spectrally under showering moonbeam hand o'gorman included except man at wheel be on forecastle head intently watching talking eagerly together so have good opportunity to take leisurely survey of draw conclusion a to nationality went to companion secured night glass took good look at with result concluded to be of french italian nationality rather awkward unexpected development for having foolishly taken for granted that must prove to be british written letter in english accordingly yet perhaps if surmise must prove to be correct might be afforded better opportunity to make effective appeal for assistance than if craft be british for gravely doubted whether o'gorman of people spoke french italian if be case must probably require to act a interpreter for thus afford just opportunity a desired on other hand must not feel that appeal for help made to french italian crew be much le likely to meet with favourable response than if made to crew of briton reflection passed through mind a stood peering through tube at becalmed barque did not need very prolonged scrutiny to enable to learn be possible of at distance presently replaced glass in becket proceeded to saunter fore aft deck from wake of main rigging to wheel grating smoking meditatively while by time have smoked pipe out have neared barque to within le than mile be momentarily expecting to hear o'gorman give order to round to lower away boat wondering meanwhile how on earth must possibly contrive to get letter conveyed to skipper when irishman came shambling aft placing at side inquired well misther have finished shmoke yes answered curtly why do ask question pray because replied will have to ask to just step down below stay there for rest of night to step down below stay there repeated indignantly what do mean man surely be not to be sent to bunk like child whether wish to go not bedad be thin so make more bone about retorted with quickly rising anger good fellow be preposterous began thoroughly exasperated at such treatment keenly anxious not to lose even most slender chance of communicating with stranger fellow must permit argument quick temper caught fire instantly at merest suggestion of remonstrance on part cut short by exclaiming furiously howly sailor phwhat be use av ' talkin ' about ye have got to go below be there be about will ye go p'aceably will have to call of hand aft to make ye go again did feel that terrible overpowering sensation of murderous anger grip at heart a have already done once before in altercation with brutal ruffian blood again mounted to head like fire reckless of consequence be in very act of pulling together for spring at throat when felt small hand touch of thrilled even at moment laid upon arm miss onslow voice pitched in most seductive tone said will please come with at once at once mr conyers have something of utmost importance to say to with effort caused to turn sick giddy mastered impulse urged to strike enemy dead there then mute with intensity of feeling permitted companion to lead away descended companion ladder in silence upon reaching cabin miss onslow a upon former occasion led to one of sofa locker upon seated gently drawing down beside then looking anxiously into face said mr conyers must almost find in heart to be angry with why oh why will persist in laying open to such insult from great coarse brute by condescending to argue with be use of doing so surely must realise by time that be quite powerless in hand of men that can not control influence in way then why attempt to do only result be that be insulted at once become positively mad with anger under influence of will day unless be very careful do something that will be exceedingly sorry for for instance what must have happened have not fortunately chanced to have gone on deck moment heard that irish ruffian in conversation be right perfectly right answered make feel very heartily ashamed of myself for lamentable want of self control of will take especial care henceforward there will be repetition of course can see clearly enough now how positively suicidal must have be for to have yielded to impulse animated at moment when so fortunately came upon scene suicidal for myself ruinously disastrous for circumstance will assure amply suffice a effectual check upon for future be two against sixteen common sense tell that with such odds against violence be out of question must depend upon craft diplomacy to secure end oh be so glad to find taking reasonable view of most unfortunate situation exclaimed companion eye sparkling with pleasure of course continued can easily understand how terribly exasperating must be to naval officer who have always hitherto be accustomed to most implicit obedience on part of crew to find defied insulted by wretch be not at surprised that under such circumstance find provocation unendurable be sure be right in believing a say that must fight by diplomatic mean rather than by resort to brute force feel sure that latter must be terrible mistake on part will not attempt to deny on two occasion when seemed about to resort to such mean have be most horribly frightened yes exclaimed with profound contrition can quite understand that must be so very humbly beg pardon for having so terrified have be contemptibly weak at very moment when most needed to be strong have further fear have effectually cured of weakness now may a well tell be important matter upon so urgently desired to speak to for moment companion gazed at with most bewitching expression of perplexity in glorious eye then face lighted up with smile of amusement broke into musical laugh what exclaimed do not yet understand only wanted to say to what have just said rather wanted to get away from irishman before impetuous temper have time to precipitate disaster see said well be interrupted by sound of hailing seemed to proceed not from own forecastle from spot little way ahead of at once concluded that source must be strange barque existence of have entirely forgotten in interest of discussion between miss onslow listened for reply from o'gorman there be none presently hailing be repeated time from much nearer point immediately followed by excited shouting jabbering in believed must distinguish word two of french sprang to foot be about to rush up on deck when miss onslow checked movement by laying hand upon arm saying please oblige by staying here if be to go on deck that wretch must only insult again so why lay open to such treatment since can do absolutely nothing must school to allow men to have own way since persuasion force be of avail with true answered be instinctive for sailor especially officer to rush on deck when hears outcry a that a shouting jabbering became momentarily nearer more excited at instant o'gorman voice shouted order to stand by immediately followed by command to helmsman to hard starboard presently there occurred gentle shock showing that brig have collided with something apparently on rounding of starboard bow accompanied by most outrageous clamour in s c r e other french expletive plentifully abounded now take turn anywhere can a often a can shouted o'gorman then follow if offer resistance knock down heave overboard why good heaven have run barque aboard be taking exclaimed astonished shocked beyond expression a dawned upon that wretch be committing further act of piracy made a though to spring to foot in instant miss onslow have seized hand in hers gripping so firmly must not break away from without exercising certain measure of violence if be said can do anything to prevent answered will tell can do if will suffer to go on deck can see whether hand have boarded barque if have there appears to be slightest possibility of being able to effect escape will cut brig adrift make off with do really think feat possible demanded companion with sparkling eye scarcely know answered if breeze have freshened at within last few minute might be done not otherwise because in latter event must lower barque boat overhaul in very few minute at event be quite worth while to ascertain whether there be chance of success let go on deck see exclaimed miss onslow feature at once aglow with excitement a sprang to foot agreed cried overjoyed to find young lady so unexpectedly yielding approval to rather desperate plan will go on deck first ascertain precise state of affair if find that there be sufficiently fair prospect of success to justify in attempt will call to through skylight a soon a need help companion regarded somewhat doubtfully for moment then reseated saying very well think can trust now please be very careful attempt anything unless feel certain of success meanwhile uproar have prevailed for few minute prior to following upon contact between two craft have suddenly ceased a emerged from companion way saw that even supposing there have ever be prospect of plan proving successful there have not wind having died away to merest breathing be now too late for two vessel hull prevented from grinding together by several cork fender hung between be so securely lashed together that must have cost several minute hard work to cut adrift moreover o'gorman followed by dozen of gang be just in act of scrambling inboard again from stranger irishman saw upon instant of emerging from companion immediately shouted here misther conyers ye be just man want do spake frinch yes answered believing that saw opportunity why becase replied chap aboard barque seem to be able to undershtand worrud say to thim bedad be in same fix with regar rd to thim so want interpreter maybe will be able to act same for very well said what do want to do whoy will take kindly of ye if will just be so obligin ' a to shtep aboard barque say what want ye to say answered fellow mind added warningly ye attimpt to say annything else by piper will be worse for ye for young woman down below can undershtand frinch like native so will know everything that say begorra oirish brogue of make difficult for thim froggies to undershtand when shpake to thim right answered perfectly easy in mind can stand alongside hear everything pass so saying without further ado leapt upon brig bulwark from thence to of barque so down upon deck closely followed by o'gorman chapter ten plunder french barque a foot touched barque deck flung lightning glance about to gather a much information a possible not knowing at moment such knowledge might be of priceless value to craft be somewhat bigger than have at first set down to be being of fully four hundred maybe four hundred fifty ton measurement looking for'ard to swell of bow saw that must evidently be of motherly build accorded well with fact that have lost steerage way long before such have be case with brig deck be in very dirty untidy condition looking a though have not be washed down even swept for at least week be lumbered up with quite unusual number of spar boom yet be evidently passenger ship for cabin under full poop be brilliantly lighted up through open door caught glimpse of several men woman so attired a to at once proclaim status on board moreover quarter deck be also occupied by group of men woman evidently passenger with two three sailorly looking men among over whom party of o'gorman people be mounting guard remainder being stationed on guard over fore scuttle down presumed barque crew have be driven attention be almost instantly attracted toward little party on quarter deck especially toward grey haired man in uniform whom imagined might be skipper advanced toward party with bow said in french wish to speak to captain of vessel may ask if happens to be among old gentleman in uniform at once advanced pace acknowledging salute by raising gold laced cap answered be demand to know monsieur by what right crew of ruffian have dared to run aboard in outrageous fashion driving crew below stationing guard athwart deck frightening passenger very nearly out of sens be pirate what monsieur answered there be nothing to be gained by attempting to deceive will therefore at once say that fear will find that have fallen into hand of pirate big man beside be captain while young lady aboard brig have misfortune to be prisoner will probably not be afforded opportunity to explain to unfortunate situation of young lady a soon a became aware of intention of men to board prepared letter will explain everything be unfortunately written in english be sure will prove obstacle to letter will presently endeavour to pas unobserved to one of if will kindly act in accordance with request set forth therein will very greatly oblige two most unhappy people monsieur said frenchman will gladly do anything in power to help a to effecting rescue glanced expressively at o'gorman companion shrugged shoulder in way very clearly indicated helplessness here o'gorman cut in well what have ould chap got to say for himsilf demanded why answered heard what said want to know what mean by boarding ship in outrageous fashion driving crew below ask what be name of ship where be from where bound to ordered irishman put question skipper answered be marie renaud of from marseille for bourbon with general cargo translated turning to o'gorman slightly away from group of frenchman to do so while be speaking hand touched mine held clenched behind back with letter folded small within while voice murmured in ear letter monsieur opened finger felt missive gently abstracted thank god for opportunity thought fervently a o'gorman said ask if have plenty of provision water aboard at once saw villain game be going to replenish brig store by plundering barque thus rendering unnecessary to touch at port so while translating question to french skipper took upon to very tersely mention suspicion to recommend adoption of precautionary measure might suggest bulk of store be stowed in after hold answered french skipper there be about enough in lazarette to carry to cape town if can be persuaded to be satisfied with what be there only will come to great harm hear said turning to o'gorman again quite certain by time of inability to understand single word of french be very short of provision having only sufficient in lazarette to carry to cape town be that demanded irishman thin be jabers be sorry for thim for there be good manny mile bechuxt here cape town be afraid will be mortial hungry before get there for be goin ' to help mesilf to everything ateable that barque carry so ye may tell skipper bad ce to for mismanagin ' shpalpeen whoy did lay in store enough to carry to ind of v'yage ye may tell too to start hand to get store on deck in hurry own lad will have enough to do in lookin ' everybody seein ' that none of frenchies thries to play anny trick wid translated gist of remark to french captain at same time gave hint to exhibit proper amount of righteous indignation over robbery did to perfection wringing hand rumpling hair pacing deck with air of madman while poured out anathema enough upon o'gorman gang to sink entire party to nethermost depth of perdition meanwhile french crew under supervision of mate with price watching operation to see that clean sweep be made of lazarette went to work to pas store on deck in le than hour everything that lazarette have contained be safely transferred to brig stowed away while operation be in progress o'gorman made tour of various cabin compelling unfortunate passenger to turn out trunk before appropriating whole of cash jewellery weapon ammunition together with a much of clothing a happened to take fancy a executed self imposed task with considerable deliberation passenger whose turn be still to come have plenty of time to meditate upon coming despoilment one of individual who have so kindly relieved of letter took into head to do good turn withdrawing quietly to cabin presently reappeared with mahogany case to unostentatiously directed attention immediately afterwards laying carelessly down in dark corner of cabin then came stood close beside murmured in ear brace of duelling pistol with full supply of ammunition monsieur since apparently must go must rather that must fall into monsieur hand if possible may perhaps find useful time in future thousand thanks monsieur returned in whisper must ever meet again will endeavour to repay kindness with interest then watching opportunity possessed of case of pistol made way on deck with thanks to bustle of trans shipping store managed to slip on board brig with convey undetected to own cabin having done spoke reassuring word two to miss onslow who have retired to own cabin lighted pipe sauntered up on deck again with most careless demeanour imaginable be long past midnight by time that o'gorman have finished rifling barque by time have secured provision out of unfortunate craft lazarette have taken four brass nine pounder gun two dozen stand of musket same number of cutlass boarding pike together with considerable quantity of ammunition have emptied one of barque water tank have robbed in addition of two best boat fine twenty seven foot gig with whole equipment then weather still being stark calm compelled frenchman to hoist out remaining two boat to tow brig clear of about mile distant from barque before moment arrived however french skipper contrived to get hurried word with monsieur said content of letter have be communicated to permit to say that mademoiselle onslow have heartiest sympathy commiseration of myself passenger in most unpleasant situation monsieur fear can not possibly help in way must doubtless be most acceptable to namely by receiving on board ship scoundrel who hold in power must never permit even be possible for mademoiselle to slip aboard unperceived secrete yourselves absence must be quickly discovered must be guessed what have become of pirate must assuredly give chase recapture for barque fine ship though be certainly be trifle slow who know what vengeance wretch might wreck upon for having presumed to abet in attempt to escape will perceive be sure that duty to passenger forbids exposing to such risk will now call at cape town to replace what villain have taken from may rest assured will not only report act of piracy have be perpetrated upon will also make known unfortunate situation of mademoiselle so that countryman may be enabled to take such step a may see fit to effect rescue be a much a must reasonably hope thanked skipper heartily for undertaking even so much a in early hour of morning gentle little air from northward gradually strengthened to nice working breeze sprang up when went on deck at seven bell marie renaud be out of sight be alone once more on tumbling waste of water from time forward nothing of importance occurred until arrived in longitude of horn passage of notorious headland being accomplished in gloriously fine weather for wonder with gale of wind from eastward blowing over taffrail to showed rag that must set upon hooker actual passage occurred in early morning about six o'clock according to dead reckoning upon working out sight have secured after breakfast for determination of longitude found that be thirty mile to westward of far enough south to permit of shifting helm for mysterious island to be supposed to be bound accordingly having verified figure pricked off brig position on chart made way up on deck informed o'gorman of state of affair so be actually now in moighty pacific eh exclaimed in high elation bedad that good news annyhow will cilibrate occasion by takin ' exthry tot o ' grog round dhrinkin ' shuccess to v'yage sthop minute ye want to know where ye be to shape coorse for now by power misther will tell ye same in brace of shake let go get paper out o ' chist will soon make ye a wise a mesilf fellow hurried away for'ard dived below into forecastle from soon emerged again bearing in hand oblong envelope from carefully withdrew paper folded lengthwise opening read latichood two forty eight forty south longitood one hundred forty four ten ten west approach island from west stand towards with summit of hill bearin ' south east half south lead through passage in barrier reef then haul up to south quarter west for mouth of bight be enough there be call to read rest to ye concluded abruptly a please answered have desire to know anything more of matter than what be absolutely necessary to enable to navigate brig to spot afterwards to make civilised port in shortest possible time will however have look at chart ascertain particular island to figure of yours refer might a well bring chart up on deck let see 'd loike to see just where be bound to how long will take to git there remarked o'gorman accordingly went below secured chart together with pencil pair of divider parallel ruler took whole on deck then spreading chart open pricked off latitude longitude given by o'gorman to astonishment found that spot be located in open water be very much afraid that information be faulty o'gorman said pointing to spot do see that there be island shown in latitude longitude nearest land to be marquesas group hiau nearest of be three hundred sixty mile distant from spot o'gorman stared blankly at chart for full minute more glared suspiciously at for nearly a long looked at paper again to assure that have made mistake finally rapped out string of oath in consternation then nipped profanity short off a comforting reflection occurred to ah exclaimed with sigh of relief oiland a oi be talkin ' about be unbeknownst so av coorse wo be drawed on chart be right misther navigate brig to place will find oiland there safe enough supposing that suggested supposing that information happens to be incorrect what then ay wo be snarled back will be correct will find oiland where oi told ye if why bedad will be worse for gal for will cruise for until find if have to cruise until judgment day like flyin dutchman right said if island be where say be will find for never fear if be not well then will not be found be there be about oi tell ye will be found must be found shouted o'gorman goaded to fury at suggestion that perhaps after dire disappointment lay in store for if oiland be there be somewhere thereabouts widin few mile more le have got to find afore hooker turn nose towards home now hope that be plain enough for ye smiting chart mighty blow with clenched fist turned on heel walked forward need scarcely be said that after dogmatic statement a found anxiety greatly increased for by time knew irishman well enough to be fully aware that mule must be more obstinate than that having once made up mind that island existed must never abandon search until have found something might pas for be determined that must search prove unsuccessful must at once bear up for marquesas let take choice from among whole group indeed for moment felt tempted to shape a straight course a must for centre of group without troubling to hunt for o'gorman particular island at a gravely doubted whether really have existence outside man own imagination on other hand information be drawn from document while stained discoloured with age have appearance from casual inspection of of being genuine if so island might possibly exist although uncharted moreover o'gorman have not seized brig become pirate merely to satisfy idle curiosity a to accuracy of document have produced be going there for certain definite purpose to search for something probably if so nothing short of arrival at particular island must satisfy so having laid off course upon chart gave to helmsman called hand aft to trim sail of passage into solitude of pacific have nothing to relate save miss onslow demeanour toward became if possible more perplexing tantalising than ever to convey clear accurate idea of varying mood must be necessary to relate in tolerably minute detail particular of daily intercourse throughout voyage course of procedure must not only expand story far beyond proper limit must also entirely alter character must therefore content with merely stating that believe may without exaggeration assert never found upon two occasion to behave in precisely similar manner appeared to regulate treatment of by behaviour of men have long ago abandoned that almost insolent hauteur of manner that distinguished at outset of acquaintance if weather be fine wind fair men upon best behaviour a sometimes happened in short if thing be going well with in other respect invariably kept at arm length by certain indefinable none le unmistakable coolness indifference distance of manner just sufficiently pronounced to suggest desire to be left to herself in proportion a difficulty anxiety vexation arose so did manner warm to until there be time when became almost caressingly tender so that a passion for grew sometimes felt almost tempted to feign anxiety distress did not exist for mere delight of finding manner warming to take credit to myself always resisted temptation fighting against a thing to yield to must be mean unmanly on part in strange contradictory condition of alternate peace rendered insipid by miss onslow coolness anxiety converted into happiness unspeakable by warmth tenderness of sympathy carried brig toward spot indicated in o'gorman document at noon on certain day observation showed that have arrived within sixty mile of weather be then brilliantly fine with gentle breeze out from about west north west wafted brig along over low long mound of pacific swell at rate of about five knot consequently if island happened to be in position assigned to ought to reach about midnight o'gorman desire to be made acquainted with exact position daily have be growing ever since have shifted helm after rounding horn beginning a condition of languid curiosity have strengthened into state of feverish restlessness anxiety on day in question a soon a have conveyed to customary information found vent in order that man must go aloft maintain lookout from topgallant yard until island must be sighted remainder of crew being set to work during afternoon to rouse out bend cable to attend to various other matter incidental to approach of vessel to port also have spare spar overhauled suitable one selected for purpose of erecting tent in conjunction with brig old sail from of inferred that stay at island must happen to find must be somewhat protracted one a to probability of finding place be exceedingly doubtful for although be well aware that hitherto unknown island be still occasionally being discovered in pacific be equally well aware that new island be almost invariably low of insignificant dimension being in fact merely coral reef have be gradually lifted above surface of ocean whereas o'gorman document contained mention of hill presence of hill argued probable existence of age consequently corresponding likelihood of comparatively early discovery at two bell in second dog watch night doubt be put end to by sudden startling cry from lookout on fore topgallant yard of land ho right ahead be on deck at time far from expecting to hear such cry indeed so incredulous be still that quite concluded man have allowed imagination to run away with be mistaking shoulder of low lying cloud for distant land so hailed with topgallant yard there be quite sure that what see be land not hummock of cloud yes sir shouted back be quite sure of have be watchin growin ' for last quarter of hour more have changed shape least bit time only growed leastest bit bigger clearer meanwhile o'gorman have sprung into rigging be by time clawing way over rim of top minute be on topgallant yard alongside other man peering ahead into fast gathering dusk under sharp of hand stared at for good five minute then shouting down be right mate be land mistake swung on to backstay came down on deck by way of sooner reached deck than plunged into forecastle from presently emerged again bearing in hand packet presently recognised a precious document came straight aft to with said now misther want ye to get bit of paper write down direction oi will read out to ye oi be right in deep wather wid plenty of say room to come go upon whin come to navigatin ' narrow channel kapin ' clear of rock takin ' vessel to anchorage bedad be nowhere so will be obliged to ask ye to write down instruction oi have got here then ye will take command of brig until be safe at anchor very well said be instruction very long two three dozen word will cover lot answered irishman right said fire away drawing pencil paper from pocket prepared to copy down whatever might read to approach island from west began o'gorman stand towards wid summit of hill bearin ' south east half south lead through passage in barrier reef then haul up to south quarter west for mouth of bight at bottom of bay stand boldly in until ye come abreast of big rock at mouth of bight when clew up furl everything follow bight until ye reach lagoon when ye may anchor annywhere not closer than dozen fadoms of oiland gem oh bedad be matther intoirely hastily concluded direction seem explicit enough said a mention be made of danger to be avoided suppose there be none same will need daylight for job of taking brig to berth mentioned so will stand on until four bell in first watch then heave to for remainder of night at daylight will fill away again work round to west side of island when if water happens to be clear will perhaps be able to see bottom from aloft thus safely pilot vessel to anchorage will con from fore topmast crosstrees at four bell ten o'clock night island showed through clear darkness upon horizon a irregularly shaped pyramid with peak nearly in centre of rising to height estimated at about six seven hundred foot island be at time ten mile distant measured from end to end a then looked at took to be about four mile across hove brig to tried cast first with hand lead then with deep sea lead got bottom at be by mean surprised a have already heard that many of island in pacific especially of coral formation rise sheer from very bottom of sea at daybreak next morning be called by steward dressing went on deck to find that weather be a have be all through preceding day namely light breeze from westward with cloudless sky of crystalline clearness overhead long low sluggish swell undulating athwart gently ruffled surface of ocean island now bore about four point on weather quarter sixteen mile distant so filled main topsail got way upon ship hauled up to full by when be found that must just handsomely fetch clear of most leeward point of land viewed by early daylight island presented most attractive appearance rising against background of sky a picture painted in infinite variety of delicate purple tone of shadow through with aid of glass must be made out several declivity gorge precipice ravine went to make up contour of country be thickly wooded everywhere seemingly from water edge to within eighty foot so of summit latter rising naked into clear air attractive a looked under soft subdued light of early dawn in delicate monochrome of distance absence of direct sunlight looked even more beautiful when after sunrise a approached more closely countless subtle variation of tint in foliage from in brightest sunlight to in deepest richest purple shadow became manifest so powerful impression did make upon men overheard freely discussing desirability of making lengthened sojourn there yes said when o'gorman carried away by enthusiasm at beauty of place hinted at possibility be very well sound very attractive just now have yet occurred to that yonder island may be peopled by race of savage who if give opportunity will gladly make barbecue of hand phew begorra oi nivver thought of that ejaculated in sudden dismay oi be obliged to ye for hint misther will load gun musket make ready generally for blagguards if have impidence to be there forthwith shambled away for'ard unceremoniously cutting into holiday plan that men be busily concocting instructing to load gun arm in readiness for emergency might arise a stood in toward land kept bright lookout for smoke for hut peeping from among tree for canoe hauled up on beach other indication of presence of human life on island must see nothing at however be not very greatly surprised for although be on lee side of island surf be breaking so heavily all along shore a to render impracticable for canoe if island happened to be inhabited inhabitant must probably be found located on weather side according to o'gorman document be protected from surf by barrier reef with passage through a stood on became apparent that island be nearer five than four mile long a have estimated to be on previous night that general trend be from north east to south west that if surveyed laid down upon chart must present somewhat flat irregular crescent like plan barrier reef sprang from north east extremity of island sweeping seaward on arc of circle on north western side uniting again with island at south western extremity forming lagoon of same length a island about three quarter of mile wide at widest point barrier reef in fact constituted magnificent natural breakwater upon surf eternally broke in loud sullen roar of everlasting thunder while inside water be smooth a mill pond shoaling very gradually from reef to shore of island consisted of narrow beach of dazzling white sand bordered by fringe of thousand of cocoa nut palm long plume like branch of swayed gently in soft warm morning breeze be on side of island concluded that if anywhere trace of inhabitant must be found scanned shore carefully anxiously through ship glass in search of such nothing of kind be to be seen at length closed telescope with clash relieved to believe that anxiety there might be awaiting in immediate future trouble with hostile native be not to be one of chapter eleven island standing on a be going ratched past island until be left couple of mile astern of when tacked ship brought land on lee beam then steering full by hour sailing sufficed to bring summit of hill to required compass bearing of south east half south whereupon bore dead away for leaving o'gorman in charge of deck sprang into fore rigging mounted to crosstrees from commanding elevation intended to con brig to anchorage miss onslow be on deck by time drinking in with eager flashing eye beauty brilliant colour of picture presented by emerald island in setting of sapphire sea a sprang into rigging noticed that gaze followed when swung out to clamber over rim of top performance to eye of landsman appears distinctly hazardous suddenly clasped hand upon breast a though in terror for safety action be trifling enough perhaps yet be disposed to regard a not quite insignificant since have often stood by side a have watched with evidently stronger emotion than amusement others perform same feat upon reaching perch found that be still in deep water sign of bottom being visible through depth of exquisitely beautiful clear crystalline blue ahead at very fringe of breaker be dashing into diamond pearl white spray upon stubborn rampart of barrier reef there be change of colour that told of shoaling depth qualm of anxiety swept over a pictured to myself what must probably happen if sweeping in before wind a be must plunge into belt of seething white water find that there be not depth enough to float for few minute be full of anxiety presently a slid nearer nearer still to reef detected opening narrow passage barely wide enough apparently for boat to traverse of unbroken water merely flecked here there with froth of boil on hand be running a straight for a though have be in sight for hour a be following direction given in o'gorman paper fact seemed to point to accurate knowledge of place on part of author of direction assumption fervently hoped must be confirmed in particular a bore rapidly down upon reef passage through gradually assumed true proportion of width saw that there be ample room to allow of passage not only of brig of couple of line of battle ship abreast island have appearance of being simply topmost ridge of mountain rising with tolerably even continuous slope from bottom of sea barrier reef be merely excrescence wall of coral built on to one side of founded at depth of ten fathom below surface of ocean a lead presently told basin thus formed have during course of age become partially filled with sand forming beautifully smooth even white floor gradually sloping upward toward surface from reef to shore of island be quite plain to a drove in through break in long sweeping circle of foam once in still water be able from perch to see sandy bottom a clearly a though have be bare of water tiny fish fragment of weed passed within hundred foot of being perfectly visible once fairly through opening in reef into basin hauled up to south quarter west course brought jib boom pointing to what then have appearance of mouth of insignificant stream a slid athwart basin opening assumed appearance of increasingly greater importance until when within mile of saw that be really comparatively narrow entrance of fairly spacious little bay loch penetrating for distance into land soon afterwards big rock mentioned in o'gorman document separated from background of bush tree with have hitherto be merged proclaimed a obelisk like monolith of basalt rearing apex to height of ninety foot above water level when fairly abreast of canvas be clewed up brig slid into loch with way that have on loch channel wound gradually round for length of about cable then widened into nearly circular lagoon about mile in diameter in very centre of stood small islet thickly overgrown with tree dense jungle keeping islet on starboard beam at distance of twenty fathom slowly circled round until be immediately between outlet to larger lagoon when let go anchor in four fathom amid exultant cheer of men who thus found triumphantly at destination that actually have found identical island referred to in o'gorman paper there must be shadow of doubt since landmark mentioned agreed perfectly strongest emotion be one of surprise that island of such dimension must thus far have escaped notice of hydrographers hand now went to breakfast when men again turned to upon conclusion of meal first act be to swarm aloft unbend whole of canvas from royal down proceeding seemed to confirm previous surmise that intended sojourn upon island to be of duration task occupied entire morning when knocked off at eight bell for dinner brig spar stay be entirely denuded of canvas irishman have little difficulty in persuading satellite to go to work again after dinner there being very evident tendency on part of hand to take matter easily now after long spell at sea eventually got out from shadow of bulwark upon foot again when boat be lowered entire stock of brig sail new old struck into spare boom launched overboard towed ashore remainder of day be spent in erecting tent upon small open patch of grass upon mainland if may so call happened to be immediately abreast brig miss onslow be thus left alone together on board nobody seeming to take of into consideration in making of arrangement there be argument in favour of against arrangement for instance cabin aboard brig be unpleasantly hot stuffy in parallel that have now reached have doubt that must have found sleeping ashore in nice airy tent very much more comfortable on other hand if be to be allowed to occupy brig must at least be by risk of nocturnal intrusion must be very much le be therefore disposed to consider on whole matter be more satisfactory a be yet went against grain with that must be so completely ignored comfort convenience so completely neglected by crowd of graceless unmannerly lout be casting about for mean whereby must compel at least reasonable measure of consideration from when fortune unexpectedly intervened to help happened in wise after conveying ashore sail spar erecting tent men came off to brig again took ashore chest belonging generally together with abundant supply of food still more abundant supply of liquor with natural result that regular drunken orgy occurred that night of character a to compel gratitude that miss onslow be not occupant of portion of camp a be deemed only prudent to maintain watch until riot ashore have ceased rioter have safely subsided into drunken slumber companion have to prepare evening meal for ourselves night must have gone supperless to cabin in like manner also have to prepare own breakfast next morning simple meal be over considerable time before there be stir sign of movement in camp on shore at length cook appeared still apparently in semi drunken condition by by saw men sitting down to breakfast occupied unconscionably long time over meal when be over most of party lit pipe staggered away back into sheltering shade of tent again there be two three exception one of whom be o'gorman who after lighting pipe strolled down to water edge with paper in hand that looked very much like paper from have quoted instruction for making island appeared to be studying most intently with dubious air even a watched rapidly changed into one of steadily increasing perplexity at length with gesture of savage impatience folded up paper slipped into breast pocket went off to tent from presently emerged again followed by two very sick sorry unwilling looking member of gang trio tumbled into one of boat shoved off headed directly for brig miss onslow be on deck with a soon a saw that little party intended boarding brig directed attention to condition requested to retire out of sight to cabin did very submissively somewhat to surprise distance from shore to brig be short in few minute boat be alongside o'gorman on deck two companion electing to spare fatigue of dragging up brig side stretching out upon thwart instead with cap drawn over face in position almost immediately fell asleep be evident from o'gorman embarrassed manner a approached that have something to say proposition to make without exactly knowing how best to set about seemed to that have unexpectedly found in way at serious disadvantage be anxious above thing to prevent discovering predicament then be civil have learned to accept a unerring indication that wished to inveigle into consciously unconsciously rendering service top o ' mornin ' to ye misther began hope that lady slept well last night in quiet snug little harbour havin ' brig to yourselves too ay retorted having to prepare own supper last night breakfast morning a for quiet place be quiet enough be drunken blackguard occupying make row oh yes slept well enough thank after crowd ashore have guzzled into state of drunken insensibility begorra thin exclaimed in affected surprise did shpalpeens keep ye awake whoy oi 'd have thought 'd have heard sorra sound out here be not goin ' to happen again be just bit of jollification threated to upon strength of foindin ' oiland right there will be more of barrin ' maybe bit of spree when work done here be ready to sail for home again a to breakfast bedad oi forgot intoirely oi will send shteward off wid ordhers that be to hin ' just wait upon ye lady make thing comfortable for ye what mischief doe want to do for wondered must be something of especial moment must never be so extraordinarily civil obliging merely answered thanks be part of agreement will remember that be to be properly looked after waited upon while be upon subject there be matter must like to mention be exceedingly close stuffy below in climate must therefore like to have awning something of kind rigged up abaft here so that may be able to arrange sleeping place on deck for miss onslow while be lying here awning be exclaimed o'gorman with effusion begorra ye will have same welcome a flower of spring ay oi will send ye off topsail to throw over spanker boom so make ye two illigant stateroom one on side deck certainly must be very extraordinary service that wish to render thought answered very well a soon a people be sober enough to behave send off with canvas lashing will tell want done oi will do same answered o'gorman now continued suppose lady 'd loike run ashore must ye yes certainly answered not to day will wait until everybody have have time to get completely sober again choose that lady must be subjected to annoyance of encountering perhaps being insulted by half drunken lout will not require boat suppose so have better send off smallest one with pair of oar that may have mean of going to from ship shore at own pleasure independently of people be too much for fiery temper of irishman genial obliging a have striven to be have be clearly apparent to that be growing increasingly restive under lengthening list of demand now cool requisition of boat be last straw broke camel back in other word exhausted irishman slender stock of patience looked at with blazing eye for moment then rapped out boat be thin divil boat will let ye have if ye want boat go ashore build one for yoursilf go to divil get awning canvas lashing cook too begorra for sorra one of anny of thim will ye get from be fool to promise ye annything wanted help thought oi 'd get by humourin ' ye now be jabers oi will make ye help whither ye like not divil thing will do for ye in return what be want to do for asked quietly determined to keep temper might happen curious to know what service must possibly be that have caused fellow to constrain so far in endeavour to conciliate want ye to do understand will have to do whither plaises not answered there be spot somewhere on bit of oiland indicating small islet opposite brig be moored that want to find whin first read paper that speaks of seemed simplest thing in worruld to come here put fut on now that oi be here have seen place by sowl ca see understand how oi be to go about more can anny of rest of so long short of be misther that will have to find place for do instruction direct to do demanded instruction be repeated o'gorman oh begorra be simple enough say here paused fumbled in breast pocket

angle of sixty foive degree to west'ard dig there ' well rest have got nothing to do with um said musingly be not surprised to learn that none of men can understand such direction a be not at sure that understand at same time there be hint enough to put on right track now o'gorman continued throwing impressiveness must muster into manner want to listen to mark well what say for be in downright earnest mistake gather from whole drift of adventure that object in coming here be to hunt for certain buried treasure hiding place of be indicated on paper in hand now have brought to spot be exceedingly probable may be able to help to find treasure if be still where be originally hidden while be absolutely certain that will never find without help when be done can help to convey booty successfully home now understand want reward either in shape of share of treasure otherwise for affording assistance tell plainly will have respectful treatment perfect freedom for myself for lady together with one of little comfort convenience for have asked stop have not finished yet continued a saw that be about to bluster have be labouring under delusion along miss onslow presence among

men must dare to molest miss onslow in way show slightest incivility from moment will cease to help do anything for mean that even must succeed in obtaining treasure that be after will never be able to take home enjoy now think over what have said let know decision a soon a have made up mind ever again attempt to coerce by uttering threat of violence to lady for will not do chief stipulation be that will be a absolutely secure from insult injury among a though be under protection of father roof mean that will be so will send whole lot of to devil even if have to accompany to defy whole gang in so uncompromising manner be undoubtedly bold game to play proved to be right thing to do for a stared irishman unshrinkingly in eye saw gaze wavering under mine presently scowling expression relaxed into smile a exclaimed begorra misther conyers ye be brave man intoirely to brazen thing out in stoyle one against sixteen of be that know right well that ye have got pull of by raison of eddicashin so suppose may a well let ye have own way make more bone about want be help to find threasure get safely home if ye will give that ye may have own way in ivery thing else will make real differ to very well said be now speaking like reasonable sensible man be bargain between that will afford fullest possible assistance to carry out scheme so far a may be lawful upon term condition have stipulated now if will let have paper in order may study a whole will perhaps be able to gather writer full meaning thus enable to find exact spot of be in search meanwhile have better go ashore again give immediate attention to few little matter mentioned just now before lost temper fellow hesitated moment gazing doubtfully still somewhat distrustfully at then with sigh handed over paper to keeping then without word turned away went down over side into boat be forthwith pulled ashore a boat shoved off from brig side opened paper glanced at content complete document read a follows latitude degree minute second south longitude degree minute second west approach island from north west stand toward with summit of hill bearing south east by half south lead through passage in barrier reef then haul up to south by quarter west for mouth of bight at bottom of bay stand boldly in until abreast of big rock at mouth of bight when clew up furl everything follow bight until reach lagoon when anchor anywhere not closer than within dozen fathom of island gem be buried in earth at spot may thus be identified draw line from one black rock to other on line project to summit of peak making angle of sixty five degree to westward dig there gem will be found at depth of three foot below surface write that treasure may not be lost must die ere find opportunity to secure john withicombe document be written in calligraphy of evidently educated man now that have in complete form in hand began to regard whole matter in very different light from what have hitherto done up to now have be disposed to regard adventure a one be more than likely to prove wild goose chase a noted evidence of intelligence education that document revealed on part of writer suddenly dawned upon that after there might be something in who be john withicombe how did become acquainted with existence of treasure did hide did discover whereabouts by accident where did treasure come from be still puzzling over question when be startled out of reverie by light step beside turning beheld miss onslow regarding with eye so brilliant must almost fancy be gemmed with tear so exclaimed playfully have be fighting wordy battle with irish wretch time having kept temper under control have emerged victorious from conflict oh mr conyers continued voice suddenly changing to tone of deep earnestness can not express to how profoundly sorry be that must thus continually be harassed worried on account oh yes heard everything be in cabin skylight be open so must not help hearing what passed know that men be taking advantage of presence to coerce terrorise by mean of threat of violence toward can not help feeling how dreadfully be hampered embarrassed by having to look after protect have never wavered faltered for one instant have forgotten about have thought wholly only of think only right must know how greatly appreciate goodness how how grateful be for that have done be still doing for there undoubtedly be tear in eye a concluded certain wild delirious hope have half formed a noted enthusiasm with have begun speech died out again a faltered hesitated finally concluded in a sober impassive conventional tone a though have be thanking for procuring cab for on rainy night hastened to assure that be quite mistaken in supposing that presence aboard brig be embarrassment to that on contrary be only pleasant feature of whole adventure so far a be concerned then fearing lest gracious mood must tempt to say more than must be willing to listen to hastily turned conversation toward o'gorman document placed in hand asking to read tell what thought of read carefully through once then handed back to with remark think be perfectly genuine everything appears to point in direction have doubt that gem will be found in spot indicated be now inclined to opinion said how be spot indicated to be found writer will observe mention two black rock furnishes clue whatever a to whereabouts where be to look for rock how be to identify that particular passage answered be admit decidedly obscure yet think context furnishes clue to elucidation read thus anchor anywhere not closer than within dozen fathom of island take to mean small island islet opposite island be evidently most prominent object in writer mind when penned word immediately following have just quoted therefore conclude that be somewhere in small island most suitable hiding place think will admit that treasure lie concealed be there also think that two black rock must be searched for a to how rock be to be identified writer speaks of in manner a to suggest that there be possibility of mistaking therefore infer that there be two rock two only that can possibly be associated with instruction given in paper yes said quite see line of reasoning believe be right at event suggestion be so reasonable that be quite worth following be upon line will advise o'gorman to go to work ah by jove look there believe fellow actually mean to stick to bargain at last here come men with sail so on have asked for to night hope will be able to rest in comparative coolness out here on deck with awning other proper shelter from dew boat with dozen hand in be soon alongside by midday have not only awning spread over whole of after deck from taffrail to mainmast also spacious canvas sleeping tent under divided into two compartment so arranged that companion might enjoy most absolute privacy steward also came off resumed possession of usual quarter a be one of quietest most respectable men of party be a good cook a doctor seemed genuinely anxious to do best for soon appeared a though be about to be favoured with spell of peace quietness meanwhile o'gorman religiously refrained from obtruding upon until have dismissed boat crew upon completion of labour when came aboard ostensibly to ascertain whether everything have be done to satisfaction actually a soon discovered to claim assistance have undertaken to afford of course be more than ready to give now have obtained from what wanted being feverishly anxious to bring entire adventure to conclusion a speedily a possible in order might be free to convey miss onslow in safety honour to father arm so threw heartily into spirit of search accompanying o'gorman search party to islet actively participating in hunt for two black rock after persevering for more than three hour became evident that little spot be so completely overgrown with tangled impenetrable jungle one course be open to that of clearing ground by cutting down destroying network of creeper choked up space between tree trunk proved to be lengthy arduous undertaking being necessary to cut undergrowth away in block a be then drag detached mass to water edge tumble overboard after four day of work at end of there be very little result to show for labour found evidence of islet having at previous period be cleared by mean of fire worker having encountered several charred blackened tree stump so determined to adopt similar course vegetation being dry in excellent condition for such experiment accordingly undergrowth be attacked with knife ax on weather side of island detached mass instead of being hove overboard be allowed to remain thoroughly dry in sun then when accumulation of dry brushwood seemed sufficient for purpose be set alight in hour entire island be blazing mass there being just wind enough to fan flame cause to spread in two hour operation be complete once verdant beautiful spot having be converted into ugly patch of flat fire blackened soil fifty acre in extent with two conspicuous outcrop of black rock protruding from ash debris of conflagration there be very little doubt in mind that two outcrop of rock rendered visible by destruction of vegetation upon islet be referred to by john withicombe said a much to o'gorman whose impatience to test truth of conviction be such that must have have go to work with rod sextant same afternoon when attempted to land upon islet found that although ash be black on surface be still dull glowing red in heart of so hot that be not yet to be stood upon leaving out of question veil of acrid suffocating blue smoke still wreathed curled from out enforced detention however be by mean wasted time for now that surface of island be bare must see what have to work upon must also see that several long slender ranging pole must be necessary obtaining preparation of kept hand busy for remainder of day immediately after breakfast next morning got out sextant hand of landing upon islet went to work with will first of all made way to one of mass of rock climbed up on mass have well defined peak came to conclusion that instruction to draw line from one black rock to other must mean that straight line must be drawn ranged from one of well defined peak to other so temporarily removed telescope from sextant levelling upon extreme peak highest point of rock occupied brought to bear upon corresponding peak of other rock then sent man along with instruction to start from other rock walk toward halting whenever raised hand sticking rod perpendicularly in ground met with great deal more difficulty than have anticipated in securing satisfactory execution of apparently simple operation by keeping telescope levelled from one peak bearing upon other making man hold rod truly vertical at length succeeded in ranging out perfectly straight line from one rock to other then setting limb of sextant to angle of sixty five degree stationing at certain point in line be easily able to do by mean of rod at length found exact point required marked by driving stake into ground there said to o'gorman be point if interpretation of instruction given in paper be correct one at depth of yard thereabouts below surface ought to find treasure if find at precise spot must recommend to try little to right left in line with pole that a see have left standing chapter twelve finding treasure o'gorman entire train of satellite being now upon islet ready to dig until have reached buried treasure thought opportunity good one to afford miss onslow run ashore so taking possession of boat that o'gorman have graciously intimated might use same craft have done such good service ere fell in with governor smeaton paddled alongside brig suggested to young lady that must devote remainder of day to exploration of island proper to companion acceded with alacrity evident delight so packing small basket with everything required for substantial luncheon stepped boat mast set canvas got under way working out through loch into big lagoon formed by barrier reef then coasting alongshore until reached promising looking landing place here ran boat up on beach secured stepping ashore decided to lunch before proceeding farther since be by time drawing well on toward midday then having made hearty meal plunged into jungle with idea of reaching summit of hill if must hit upon practicable path viewed from sea island have appearance of being a completely thickly overgrown with jungle a have be islet where o'gorman gang be hunting for treasure upon entering forest found that be not so that by keeping eye about might manage with very little difficulty to work way through comparatively open space occurred at frequent interval have not proceeded very far when be fortunate enough to fall athwart tiny stream with just merest trickle of water in now be evidently in rainy season roaring raging torrent bed of stream be full of small boulder served very well a stepping stone a knew must not go astray if followed course of stream a knew moreover that by so doing must be constantly rising a further must thus avoid being impeded by necessity to wind way through jungle decided to adopt course with happy result that in about hour time found close to summit above line of vegetation there still remained about hundred foot of climbing to be done however ere must attain summit climbing have to be accomplished on slope of sixty degree composed of fine loose scoria gave way slid downward a soon a stepped upon did not like to be beaten however soon found that without pole to assist must never make progress so contented with walk round peak now felt convinced be crater of quiescent if not extinct volcano leisurely survey of magnificent panorama lay spread out beneath by simple process of walking round peak obtained view of entire island with lagoon barrier reef so clear pure be atmosphere that must not only see also identify member of working party be still digging vigorously even a watched there arose sudden commotion excited rushing together among second two later sound of voice reached although be perfectly evident that speaker be powerfully excited be too far distant from to distinguish what be said presently work be resumed for about ten minute at expiration of several men leaped down into excavation minute two later saw not very bulky object lifted out of hole laid on surface of ground amid frantic cheer of entire party treasure exclaimed have found by jove have not be very long about either well be sincerely glad thankful for now may hope soon to be homeward bound at least bound to spot from will be possible for to secure passage to calcutta spoke with enthusiasm companion did not respond remained silent gazing dreamily into far distance when looked at awaiting answering remark saw that be quite pale that be biting under lip in fruitless endeavour to stay quivering that there be undoubtedly tear in eye averted face quickly be confident that be not mistaken a to indication of emotion presently spoke be glad said that find cause for rejoicing in discovery that wretch appear to have just made at first sight must almost seem a though trouble must now be nearly over can not forget that men have be guilty of two very serious offence first in seizing brig from compelling to navigate to lonely spot next in act of piracy in connection with marie renaud fear oh fear terribly that by by when be nearing end of journey will take desperate step to effectually prevent ever bearing witness against have ever thought of a possible danger to may be exposed well yes said must confess that contingency have suggested to will require help to get booty home landed will make business to discus matter with o'gorman in such manner a to convince that can not do without meanwhile must see if can not forestall possible action on part by devising plan will enable to effect escape in one of boat when within easy distance of land do think thing possible demanded in much more animated tone than have shortly before used why yes answered be to say must make possible must endeavour to devise definite scheme to be carried out at very first favourable opportunity must then devote energy to so arranging matter when moment arrives everything will be in readiness discussed topic at length with very definite result however finally a appeared to be exercising distinctly depressing effect upon miss onslow spirit changed subject made way down to boat again so aboard brig a entered inner lagoon found that hand have knocked off work have crossed to camp presently o'gorman made appearance at entrance of one of tent beckoning to approach waved hand in assent made a though to put miss onslow aboard brig first whereupon o'gorman hailed that wanted to land look at have be found so put bold face upon ran boat in upon beach from walked together up to o'gorman tent a entered first thing met gaze be rusty earth grimed iron chest measuring about two foot square by perhaps sixteen inch deep on side of sat man with brace of cocked pistol in belt evidently on guard chest have be fastened by two heavy padlock of distinctly antiquated design have be smashed lid prised open not without inflicting damage to hinge noticed almost at once o'gorman companion wore decidedly perplexed slightly chagrined air reason therefor soon became apparent so said in congratulatory tone soon found treasure then hope prof to be worth trouble have taken to secure begorra thin be mesilf 'd be glad to be able to say yi ' to answered irishman be puzzled ca make out continued be what have found giving chest kick betrayed certain amount of temper beyant gallon so of pearl there be nothin ' in pebble 'd like ye to say whether think pebble be worth annything not so saying o'gorman raised heavy lid of chest disclosing interior subdivided into four compartment by thin hardwood partition running diagonally from corner to corner one compartment be packed a full a must hold of pearl nearly of if one might judge by top layer be of very fair size while few scattered here there be exceptionally fine exquisite satiny sheen seemed to indicate that be of first water miss onslow must not suppress cry of admiration delight a gazed upon tribute to beauty consequent value seemed to afford considerable satisfaction to finder may touch asked of o'gorman oh yes answered suppose there be harm in y ' r touchin if ye want to plunged hand down into heart of compartment turning over pearl bringing others to surface appeared that be of pretty much same quality value why said here be respectable fortune for of in pearl alone even if pebble turn out to be valueless be scarcely likely to be case must not have be so carefully stowed away in chest now for example continued turning to contiguous compartment more than half full of crystal looked like splintered fragment of rather dull glass be uncut diamond yes a felt two three of between finger thumb there be doubt about have true soapy feel be diamond taken in bulk of very great value here again a turned to next compartment about a full a containing diamond be ruby unless be very greatly mistaken while a to turning to last compartment be emerald there be beauty among too apparently a fished up one two remarkably fine one why o'gorman exclaimed be rich men mother son of there be sixteen handsome fortune in chest fortune big enough to set up a gentry to ruin in double quick time according to use that make of wealth begorra sorr be plisintest thing iver heard ye say exclaimed irishman in high glee at verdict a to value of pebble while beaming countenance of twain on guard betrayed that delight be fully a great a of leader there be further sound of revelry ashore night intermingled more than once with other sound suggestive of altercation quarrel just at sunrise while be taking matutinal swim round ship saw hand march out in somewhat formal order along glade upon camp be pitched disappear across sand spit formed one side of loch entrance ten minute later while be towelling on fore deck in seclusion afforded by position of galley be startled by what sounded like distant volley of pistol shot about hour afterwards saw crowd returning to camp by way that have gone a watched shambling along over somewhat uneven ground be struck by something rather unusual in appearance presently discovered what be there seemed to be not quite so many of by time have slipped into clothes party have arrived pretty nearly abreast of brig be close enough to enable not only to count to identify be now only fourteen in number two absent one be men whom have seen guarding treasure on previous night somehow absence of two men instantly became associated in mind with volley of pistol shot have heard while overboard began to wonder gloomily whether unearthed treasure have already brought tragedy in train be full of idea a sat down to breakfast a miss onslow did not make remark inquiry concerning pistol volley concluded that have not heard be careful to say nothing to about suspicion o'gorman companion remained in seclusion of tent morning not one of excepting cook showing until after dinner then irishman two hand appeared presently jumped into boat headed for brig went to gangway to receive so that might be out of ear shot of miss onslow who be sitting in after end of sleeping tent reading even before boat got alongside must see by sober face of in that something serious be matter o'gorman boarded brig alone leaving two companion in boat alongside led for'ard not until have reached fore deck did of open mouth then irishman turning to with very serious face said misther conyers want ' r help again son very well said will be pleased to help in way possible what be that wish to do wish to divide up threasure aiqually into fourteen part to give to aich man own share so that may take care of for a thing be now wid gims lumped together in iron chist timptation opporchunity to shteal be too great have already lost two of number through lost two of number good heaven o'gorman what do mean demanded thought instantly reverting to suspicious proceeding of morning why explained o'gorman be loike ye see whin dug up chist yesterday got over here must none of be satisfied until 'd broke open found out what contained then a must fasten up again decided to mount guard over two men at time so that nobody must rob others by sneakin ' away helpin ' unbeknownst whin first two guard be relieved last night cook took into head that ought to be searched whin be done by power found that aich of 'em have helped to handful of stone have 'em stowed away in pocket thried there thin found guilty sintenced to be shot be done morning so exclaimed in horror be first result of so called good fortune be theft two of number slain man do know that fourteen of have committed murder murder be sorra bit exclaimed irishman indignantly thried two of 'em found guilty in regular proper ordher said have authority legal right to try men sentence to death execute may consider will find that law will regard a wilful murder law ejaculated o'gorman with contemptuous sniff oh begorra will take chance of want more execution misther conyers so will ye help to make fair division of prize that aich man may have own not be tempted to shteal from be making request on own account on behalf of rest a well demanded perhaps others may be unwilling to trust to fairness oh will answered o'gorman proposal be mine iverybody agreed to very well then said be willing to undertake job will do best to make division equitable one so saying went aft explained to miss onslow be going ashore for hour two with o'gorman to afford benefit of advice in certain matter dived below to cabin for sheet of writing paper rolled up put in pocket then returning to deck descended side entered boat on reaching shore o'gorman led at once to largest tent where found entire remainder of party seated in circle on ground with chest of treasure trove in centre have evidently so little faith in other that have deemed necessary to individually watch chest in own interest incident must have be amusing for terrible element of tragedy have be imparted to by proceeding of morning first act on entering tent be to provide from little stock of writing paper fourteen piece of exactly equal size shape numbered from one to fourteen afterwards folding piece identically so that number written upon be concealed became impossible to distinguish one piece from paper put on ground in one of men cap mixing shuffling together next called for square of canvas brought boat lug sail caused to be spread flat smooth upon ground then have chest lifted on to middle of sail seating beside then starting with pearl picked out fourteen of practically equal value laid singly well apart on canvas before explaining intention a did so then to similarly added fourteen more so on until heap contained same number of pearl be a nearly a must judge of same value there be five pearl left over reserved a possible make weight so to speak in further division of gem then proceeded with diamond in same way following on with ruby finishing off with emerald until entire treasure be subdivided into fourteen part of practically equal value done inquired whether be of opinion that division have be evenly made upon receiving reply to effect that supposed so gave ticket in sailor cap vigorous final shaking up then passed cap round in succession requesting man to take one paper then when have be drawn requested to open paper look at number written thereon finally man who held number one be allowed first choice from fourteen heap number two second choice so on until only one heap be left fell to man holding ticket number fourteen be interesting to note difference in behaviour of men in choosing heap hung fire seemed quite unable to make up mind for a much a ten minute quarter of hour must probably have be longer for impatient remonstrance of fellow while others simply laid cap alongside nearest heap swept latter into former with a little emotion a though have be purchasing penn'orth of gooseberry at street barrow process of subdivision of treasure have run away with considerable amount of time with result that when returned to brig usual hour of supper a evening meal be generally termed at sea be long past what be of far greater consequence found that during prolonged absence miss onslow have worked into perfect fever of apprehension a to safety be not at surprising when one came to reflect upon what situation must have be alone among ruffian have anything perchance happened to quickly recovered spirit when informed a to how have be occupied be great relief to to discover a did in course of evening by mean of sundry subtle question remark that poor girl entertained suspicion of morning tragedy such being case resolved to keep news from a long a possible with view thereto strenuously impressed upon steward that be not under circumstance to make most distant reference to during fortnight now ensued weather remaining gloriously fine took miss onslow away in boat daily together explored island until have become perfectly acquainted with inch of knew exactly where to find many beauty spot on first two three day of excursion frequently encountered member of o'gorman gang wandering about island in more le apparently aimless fashion most of carrying canvas bundle in hand invariably endeavoured unsuccessfully to conceal from view at first be at loss to understand what meant on third day happened that on emerging from jungle path that have made for came upon kneeling man busily engaged in digging hole with stick at foot of tree so intent be upon occupation that did not hear until be close upon then sprang to foot faced with expression of mingled consternation defiance changed to one of confusion a recognised be young cockney whom have already have occasion to mention once twice have gradually impressed a being about most harmless well meaning of whole gang hillo harry exclaimed what be after seeking for more treasure why sir answered fingering peak of cap a met miss onslow gaze hesitated few second considering then proceeded fact be mr conyers be thinkin ' of hidin little whack well said in case be exceedingly sorry that disturbed for now fear that will have to hunt for hiding place what for sir demanded why because lady have discovered secret see oh that be blowed exclaimed young fellow make matter ai afraid of lidy stealin ' stuff be hidin ' from of queried from whom then be hiding why from rest of 'em of course be hidin ' stuff from one tell other so be doin same see said be unable to trust other well be pity one must have thought that there be not man among who must not have felt abundantly satisfied with what have secured maybe be maybe ai answered fellow anyhow when see rest distrustin ' one think be time for to distrust so spent day yesterday huntin ' for good spot comed along way thought must do better than stow stuff at foot of big tree well said if be must choose other place how be to know one of men distrust be not even now watching guessing occupation from place of concealment among bush choose spot that can easily find again somewhere in heart of bush bury there where nobody can see what be about thank'ee sir will think know good place not far off said fellow therewith giving sea scrape with foot turned away left a for resumed walk be very careful not to turn round otherwise behave in such manner a to lead man to suppose desired to watch during period to be now referring o'gorman men did work whatever after have succeeded in satisfactorily concealing own share of treasure spent time in strolling aimlessly sometimes alone sometimes in party of two three together about island hunting for fruit climbing cocoa nut tree to get at nut then think be about sixteenth day after unearthing of treasure without previous warning notice to saw striking tent ashore immediately after breakfast by noon everything have be brought off to brig again men have once more taken up quarter in forecastle remainder of day be devoted to task of rebending canvas be not until noon of next day that brig be again in condition to go to sea afternoon greater part of following day be devoted to task of replenishing brig stock of fresh water collecting abundant supply of fruit presumably recovering possession of hidden treasure after breakfast next morning crew went leisurely to work to get under way took until noon to work way out to sea a soon a be fairly clear of barrier reef everybody went to dinner chapter thirteen learn disturbing news weather have be fine with moderate breeze from about west north west during entire period of sojourn at island left under like condition course for horn be south easterly one brought wind nicely over starboard quarter breeze be of just right strength to enable to show whole of starboard flight of studding sail to to handsomely reel off eleven knot per hour by log under circumstance be not long in running island out of sight with disappearance below horizon hoped that trouble except of course such a might arise from bad weather be at end a for men sojourn on island have done good be in splendid health a might be expected of men in condition who have so easily become wealthy in high spirit seemed anxious to get home be one upon best behaviour being apparently desirous of conciliating to utmost possible extent now that own end have be served although deemed sound diplomacy to allow to believe that endeavour in direction be meeting with perfect success must not forget that in prosecution of own selfish plan have shown to be callously criminal utterly indifferent to hardship suffering mental bodily that be inflicting upon young delicately nurtured sensitive woman to say nothing of what have caused to endure determined that if lay in power to scheme out result must one pay penalty of crime apparently favourable condition of affair to have just referred continued for fully week after departure from island then received rude awakening happened thus weather be still gloriously fine wind have drawn more out from southward until be square upon starboard beam with decided increase in strength have caused to take in studding sail except fore topmast boom of be braced well forward be close upon sunset harry cockney be at wheel sky away to westward about setting sun wore decidedly smoky windy look with corresponding wildness hardness glare of colour seemed to threaten blusterous night so much so indeed that pausing in solitary perambulation of deck halted near binnacle to study a did so helmsman with eye on weather leach of main topgallant sail said look at take notice of sir because want skowbanks for'ard to see talkin ' to have got somethin very partic'lar a must like to s y if can only find chaunce well fire away then lad said time like present be looking to see whether be going to have breeze to night fellow remained silent for full minute chewing vigorously at plug of tobacco in cheek then said still gazing intently aloft long short of be sir two swine o'gorman price have be s'yin that after business with french barque shootin ' of karl fritz wo never do to let young lidy ever get ashore again so miss onslow foreboding have come true then knew too much be doubt to be sacrificed in cold blood to ensure safety of piratical gang fore warned be fore armed moreover there be man harry clearly disposed to be friendly to why must take risk of acquainting with terrible news a realised fresh anxiety watchfulness that information must entail upon faltered for moment under feeling of overwhelming despair be gone instantly within next second two have pulled together fighting instinct have leapt up alert eager be once more ready to do battle against whole ruffianly mob of for life honour of girl now loved beyond other earthly thing do men say to asked stepping up on grating hand in pocket balancing jauntily to heave roll of plunging hull a continued to gaze contemplatively at windy sky away on starboard quarter why answered harry be use denyin ' that be of same mind a t'other two s'ys that know enough to hang hand of that 'd be certain sure to do too if be only to give yer chaunce what be opinion upon matter man demanded well said think a p'rhaps be right so far a go hold with murder said a thought might be able to plan out way of makin ' ourselves safe without doin ' hurt to young lidy must listen to be for makin ' theirselves safe a call what be scheme asked why accordin ' to present way of thinking intends to ast to make brazilian coast somewhere about twenty mile so from big port be goin ' to tell a when have made land brig be to be scuttled hand lidy included be to take to boat land givin out to be shipwrecked crew at last minute when be ready for leaving lidy be to be seized lashed hand foot locked up below to go down with brig very pretty diabolical cold blooded scheme commented one must have be very likely to prove successful have not warned be infinitely obliged to man may rest assured will not forget good turn have done in making acquainted with plan will endeavour to frustrate of course may depend upon to help why a to sir answered fellow everything will depend upon what make up mind to do wo have nothin ' to do wi ' murderin ' of be certain on t'other hand mean to mix up with job mean havin ' throat cut if thing happen to turn out right just so said see position exactly will think matter over see if can not devise practicable scheme to get to windward of scoundrel will then have talk with meanwhile kindly keep ear open appear to fall in with plan of others let know if alteration be made will find greatly to advantage to do so thank'ee sir will answered man a wheeled round directed long scrutinising glance at canvas stepped off grating squinted into binnacle finally resumed perambulation of deck now here be nice plot to face countermine plot be only to be defeated by subtlety strategy for at most there be three of told against thirteen ruthless treacherous men be not to be forgotten that dependence be to be placed upon man harry scruple apparently drew line at cold blooded murder on hither side of consideration for own safety might tempt to conceivable length in short needed very little consideration to demonstrate that if be to secure active co operation must make perfectly clear to that must be distinctly to interest to give then there be miss onslow be woman of delicate refined nature of magnificent courage certainly clever resourceful thus far capable perhaps of affording valuable suggestion by mean to be involved so tangibly in scheme against men a to expose to vengeful fury in event of failure question whether must mention latest development to at be one of long anxious mental debate with on one hand be intensely desirous to spare poor girl further terror anxiety while on other felt doubtful whether in matter so vitally interested ought not to afford opportunity of bringing keen clever woman wit to bear upon problem have now thrust upon spent anxious sleepless night revolving countless scheme in head abandoning one after other a impracticable else too dependent upon chance whole of next day succeeding night be similarly spent by when sprang feverishly from bunk haggard hollow eyed with sleeplessness worry on second morning after conversation with man harry have come to resolution that be duty to inform miss onslow how matter stood with to afford opportunity to assist with suggestion might occur to opportunity occurred shortly after breakfast have taken sight for brig longitude worked out laid down result upon chart be abstractedly gazing at latter a lay spread out before upon cabin table anxiously seeking inspiration from study of coast island harbour delineated in miniature upon white paper when young lady stepped out of cabin first assuring that steward be not within hearing came to side laying hand upon shoulder said want to tell be matter there be something very seriously wrong know for be watching day yesterday be impossible for to avoid noticing that while when in presence of men did best to wear unconcerned manner moment that deemed free from observation sank into mood of gloomy abstraction reverie meaning of be not to be mistaken morning look absolutely ill with worry forehead be seamed with wrinkle of care anxiety positively be turning grey about temple a spoke last word finger lightly a seemed to caressingly touched on temple be first time that have ever done thing touch thrilled through a with electric shock moving to extent that lost self control forthwith behaved with recklessness of madman seized hand threw arm about waist drawing to kissed on lip be own fault exclaimed wildly must not have touched so tenderly caressingly love tell love beyond power of speech to describe have be upon point of telling so over over again have be deterred by knowledge that unless can return love have never given reason to suppose be case confession on part must necessarily render situation infinitely more embarrassing than be now hitherto have contrived to remain master of myself when touched temple just now poor fellow interrupted astounding by nestling in embrace with flaming cheek looking up at with smiling eye that shone like star a arm stole up twined about neck be indeed so bad a with knew of course that loved symptom be quite unmistakable scarcely dreamed of passion being so violent a appears to be well never mind charlie dear very startling unexpected vehement declaration will not produce effect seem to have feared because see so happens that return love how must possibly be otherwise tone changing from tenderness to pride what woman whose heart be free must possibly fail to love man whose devotion be what yours be have be to yes dearest love with whole heart be proud to think that despite waywardness shortcoming have contrived to discover in something worth loving be not what have be worrying so terribly last few day tell what be have right to know now yes assented certainly have be terrible news florence scarcely know in what word to communicate to yet be assured of sweet that with new courage that have just imparted to will overcome peril loom ahead of deadly though be therewith related to sweetheart have passed between harry at same time directing attention to fact that grisly peril be still long way ahead of that be far cry from where be to horn that even after have rounded that wild headland practically whole stretch of eastern coast of south america must have to be traversed before time must be ripe for villain to carry out devilish scheme of murder destruction then strove to comfort by directing attention to chance of escape might befall ship must be certain to encounter with possibility of being able to surreptitiously communicate with one more of craving assistance of determination a last resource to cast away ship take chance of being able to escape in one of boat during confusion rather than tamely navigate to spot must be selected by fiend for deed of destruction a told her of fate have be planned for saw blanch to lip eye grow wide glassy with horror presently colour returned mouth set in firm resolute line when at length ceased to speak said poor charlie wonder that look worn worried take courage dear can not believe that god will permit wretch to murder in cold blood will surely inspire with idea will enable to defeat prevent act of such atrocious wickedness have sure conviction that in own good time will be accorded happy deliverance out of trouble that will by by enjoy satisfaction of happily reuniting to dear father receiving usual reward accorded to conquering prince in fairy tale god grant dearest exclaimed fervently a kissed now said must go on deck suppose endeavour to appear a though have not care in world for if fellow notice that be looking gloomy preoccupied will at once

for that only man on deck be helmsman from condition of who came staggering aft from time to time at stroke of bell to relieve wheel more than suspected that drinking bout be under way in forecastle such condition of affair be amply sufficient at time to create within sense of profound uneasiness much more so at especial time for be then in part of ocean notorious for sudden savage gale thick

surrender to resort to such measure a where then be must have be sheer madness idea sooner occurred to than be dismissed a impracticable although impracticable just then might not be so later on when must have arrived in le perilous latitude there then resolved to do everything that in lay to facilitate coup on first suitable occasion meanwhile be little short of madness for men to drink to excess under then prevailing condition of weather situation determined to remonstrate with o'gorman for permitting such perilous indulgence so went aft took wheel directing man whom relieved to ask to come aft a wished to speak to fellow slouched away forward lurching slipping along wet deck disappeared down fore scuttle deemed not improbable that must avail of opportunity to help to drink that might

of yelling to cook who kept close a limpet to shelter of galley with weather door fast shut to run to forecastle summon someone to relieve when became aware of din of excited shout yell arising from fore scuttle momentarily grew in intensity until disturbance be violent enough to suggest that pandemonium have broken adrift in small forecastle cook from position in galley heard row much more distinctly than did forsaking pot pan rushed forward where stood gaping down through scuttle in attitude expressive of combined interest consternation shouted to to let know what meant attention be so completely absorbed by what be happening below that have ear for while a for have hand quite full with brig dared not release grasp of wheel for single instant lest must broach to get deck swept

five minute so later o'gorman appeared on deck ghastly white with cheek laid open in gash extended very nearly from left ear to corresponding corner of mouth blood be trickling down upon collar of jacket staining whole of left breast of garment hand cuff be smeared with blood be at once evident to that there have be serious scrimmage in forecastle conjecture be at once confirmed by fellow who

in willingness to forgive help continued will remain here darling be end of ship can do better than stick to may be necessary to be done forward can will do secured medicine chest luckily happened to be fairly big one for vessel of brig size carried forward to fore scuttle where one of seaman relieved of passed below dozen so of gang be now on deck looking very crestfallen subdued to extent indeed that actually knuckled forehead to a appeared among did not waste time however by attempting to bring home to evil of way descended at once into dark grimy evil smelling hole where until few minute ago fourteen men have lived in such comfort harmony a go to make pleasant existence of forecastle jack heaven what filthy place be how woefully changed for worse since have last entered be before have received present tenant be bad enough even then be infinitely worse now be triangular shaped apartment apex of triangle being eye of vessel be barely six foot high from deck to under side of beam deck wall beam roof be of one uniform tint of greasy black result of coating of dirt so thick that must actually be scraped off with knife with one fingernail be fitted round with double row of bunk in addition to number of hammock swung from beam place be unlighted save by mean of scuttle by kettle shaped slush lamp that swung flaring emitting long streamer of fat black smoke from centre beam deck be encumbered with sea chest of original occupant have be taken possession of by o'gorman gang be littered with tin plate pannikin fragment of food empty broken bottle while atmosphere be foul with foetid odour prominent among be of bilge water cockroach three of bunk in lower tier be occupied two of occupant lying quiet still while third moved restlessly at interval emitting low moan while four men evidently hurt reclined upon deck with back propped up against sea chest a for o'gorman stood close by swaying lamp holding dirty bloodstained rag to gashed cheek a eye rolled gloomily sullenly about dark stifling hole gave attention first to figure in bunk beginning with still silent one one first approached happened to be man named tom be lying on right side with white face toward light eye partly closed showing nothing white fearful gash about four inch long in left side of throat from blood seemed to have be pouring a from pump judging from appearance of clothes bunk be merely oozing now seized hand felt for pulse there be none tore open saturated shirt laid hand upon breast there seemed to be occasional slight flutter of heart if so be so exceedingly faint a to render matter extremely doubtful be clear that unfortunate man have bled be bleeding to death be far beyond such poor inefficient help a must afford left therefore turned to next bunk now saw be occupied by body of carpenter lay stretched out on back just a have be tossed in might have be asleep for ghastly pallor of face tell tale purple stain upon breast of waistcoat shirt be dead beyond doubt so turned to next man who proved to be gigantic dutchman named dirk van zyl author of trouble man presently discovered have received no fewer than nine wound four of from extent situation considered desperate groaned cried screamed in most bloodcurdling fashion when began to examine begging that might be left alone to die in peace washed wound one by one bound stitched up a best must job occupying fully three quarter of hour when at length left seemed somewhat easier next man claiming attention be irishman named mike whose left hand have be struck by dutchman knife savage blow exactly on joint of wrist that member be nearly severed must hing with injury a bind up tightly place hand forearm in splint sling leaving nature to work out rest of cure if must there be three other men who have received rather serious hurt for whom did best finally stitched up o'gorman face for completed fairly stiff morning surgical work then having again examined man tom found to be quite dead carefully cleansed from trace of ghastly labour went aft reaching cabin just in time for dinner while taking after dinner smoke that afternoon carefully considered situation a have now become altered by fatal fracas in forecastle having desire to be deemed better man than really be may a well confess at once that while be profoundly shocked by what have occurred be quite impossible for to regret indeed to have done so must have be unnatural for apart altogether from hardship anxiety that men have already so callously inflicted upon woman who be infinitely dearer than life to must not forget that have planned agreed together in cold blood to deliberately destroy sweetheart not one of except harry so far a information went possessing even small modicum of humanity must have prompted to demur at decision to urge adoption of le fatally stringent course therefore felt little pity for of victim while so far a ultimate escape of miss onslow be concerned prospect of result be distinctly improved by loss on part of enemy of two killed six wounded of whom three of latter be unfit for duty reduced number of o'gorman gang to nine effectives deducting cook steward working party of seven told who must have to be divided into two watch a reflected carefully upon matter looking at in bearing seemed that moment be opportune for to endeavour to secure something more than intermittent shadowy authority have thus far be permitted to exercise accordingly when next visited forecastle for purpose of taking look at patient be near end of second dog watch that evening bluntly directed o'gorman attention to fact that be now short handed suggested must take command of one of watch considered question for few minute be suffering altogether too acutely from smart of gashed cheek to be able to reflect very deeply upon subject at length yielded rather sulky surly assent to proposal more readily perhaps since have one now left whom must trust to take price place be careful to select for command watch of man harry be member since by so doing must be on deck at same time must thus have excellent opportunity of conversing with during darkness of night watch without attracting observation arousing suspicion same night a soon a be fairly dark body of price seaman tom unshrouded simply prepared for burial by attachment to foot of iron bar apiece heavy enough to sink be unceremoniously launched over side without slightest symptom of emotion in half hour share of gem be distributed more le evenly among survivor man dirk excepted on third day after tragedy have just described momentary glimpse of sun during forenoon enabled to confirm dead reckoning to satisfactorily establish fact that be actually few mile to eastward of dreaded horn although with le southing than must have wished southerly wind have prevailed for time having gradually gone round to eastward so far that at length became questionable whether must succeed in weathering land so passing into atlantic to make matter worse wind continued not only to work round also to increase in strength to extent at brig instead of heading east have broken off to due north while have become necessary to snug down to close reefed topsail fore topmast staysail thick weather moreover added element of anxiety since have only succeeded in gaining one solitary sight of sun for nearly week that not when be on meridian hence be quite unable to determine exact latitude next morning shortly after daylight when by reckoning have still forty odd mile of sea room land be made ahead five mile distant upon standing in little closer be at length enabled to identify a headland of cape horn whereupon immediately wore round stretched away to southward on larboard tack for one being intensely thankful that have made notorious cape during daylight for happy chance brig must in probability have gone ashore adventure must have there then come to premature end although fortune have so far favoured that be enabled for present to avoid disaster be disappointing to discover that lee drift have be so excessive a to have caused to lose ground while slow steady downward tendency of mercury seemed to indicate so far from being justified in expecting immediate improvement in weather there be too good reason to fear that change from bad to worse be imminent needed few hour further experience to prove how well founded be apprehension for a day wore on aspect of sky to windward grew increasingly menacing hue of thick canopy of vapour becoming hourly darker more louring while shredded cloud packed ever closer together in larger mass of wilder more threatening form colour wind strengthened until be blowing full gale while already heavy sea gathered weight so fast that by eight bell in afternoon watch have in opinion become perilous to continue sailing brig accordingly proposed to o'gorman that must stow topsail heave to under storm staysail now experience of first day two after fight in forecastle have led to hope that tragedy of occurrence have frightened sobered men so thoroughly that there must be no more trouble with so far at least a drink be concerned therein gave credit for higher standard of feeling than possessed such sobering influence a incident have exercised upon fellow have quickly evaporated on particular day to be now referring demon of drink have once more brought under influence with just enough effect to render one reckless defiant utterly unmanageable consequently proposal to shorten sail heave to be met with scornful jeer point blank refusal to do work whatsoever worst of be that have held on with canvas so long that whole available strength in ship be now needed to successfully handle attempt to do anything unaided with assistance of only one two men being worse than useless there be nothing for therefore to let two double reefed topsail stand a be blow away not a fate might decide there be one comfort only one to be found in condition of affair have endeavoured to indicate be that brig heavily pressed a be by canvas be ratching fast through water on course be not only carrying off land also somewhat to eastward so that with moderating of gale even slight shift of wind might hope to pas clear into atlantic after amount of comfort to be derived from reflection be small fleeting in face of steadily increasing strength of gale rapidly growing height steepness of sea even a be man harry who happened to be at wheel at moment now have in mind found strength skill taxed to utmost to humour brig along through wild sea perspiration streaming from pore of a stood there fully exposed to keen nipping fury of blast be perfectly evident that unless something be speedily done disaster must quickly overtake something be presently done for although representation suggestion have be met rejected with scorn derision argument of most convincing character be soon brought to bear upon contumacious one in shape of green sea came right in over bow half filling forecastle frightening occupant out of wit while carried away thirty foot of bulwark on port side deluge of water poured down through fore scuttle be sufficient in volume to actually wash several of men out of bunk instant that inpour ceased hand with one accord sprang for opening fighting together like savage beast in anxiety to reach deck although unlucky sea have inflicted upon poor little over driven brig rather serious amount of damage have produced at least one good result have completely sobered hand brought to realising sense of necessity to take immediate step for prevention of further mischief a fellow gained deck saw great gap in bulwark observed height steepness generally dangerous character of sea something very like panic seized came rushing aft with loud excited outcry demanding to know what have happened meanwhile have sprung to wheel to assistance of helmsman who be quite clear be nearly exhausted by tremendous continued effort to control movement of brig never mind what have happened answered what be done be done can not be helped what have now to do be to get down last reef in topsail take in fore topmast staysail when will heave to let go fore main topsail halliard man reef tackle then away aloft hand of before worse happens fellow by time quite sober fully alive to peril of situation needed second bidding sprang about deck with eager impetuous haste of men fighting for life in le time than must have believed possible have bowsed out reef tackle be in fore rigging on way aloft to complete operation of reefing fore topsail o'gorman set good example by taking weather yardarm passing earring hand be busily engaged in knotting point when mountainous sea came swooping savagely down upon with upreared hissing crest saw that must inevitably break aboard uttered loud yell of warning to hand aloft who raised answering shout of dismay a gazed in horror at oncoming liquid hill crest of must have be very nearly a high a of abandoning task sprang for rigging by exercise of superhuman agility actually contrived to reach top rest remained upon yard to gaze apparently paralysed with terror poor little brig seemed to shudder like sentient thing a great wall of water crashed down upon burying to foremast then saw whole mast buckle like fishing rod when strong heavy fish begin to fight for life there be crash of timber a topmast snapped short off at cap next instant away went whole of top hamper over side flinging far into raging sea four unfortunate who have remained clinging to yardarm a for sea swept right aft filling deck to rail smashing to splinter boat be stowed on main hatch carrying away entire bulwark on side a far aft a main rigging by time that deck be clear of water be free to think of other matter than own individual safety four men who have be flung overboard one of whom be o'gorman have disappeared for ever have made discovery that have lost bowsprit main topgallant mast a well a fore topmast that have more than four foot of water in hold mind with night close upon loss of head sail of course at once rendered brig unmanageable thus apart from effect of further damage sustained situation immediately became one of extremest peril circumstance coupled with tragic disappearance of leader from midst completely cowed subdued survivor to extent indeed of impelling to come aft implore to take full command of brig needle to say made difficulty about acceding to request for prompt measure be imperative if vessel be to be saved with florence own life so without pausing to read men moral lesson upon evil of intemperance forthwith issued order for goose winged foresail to be set by mean be at length enabled to get brig before wind thus escape immediate peril of being swamped achieved wreck of fore topmast bowsprit be cut away canvas be furled brig be once more brought to wind hove to under bare pole then although men be inclined to grumble insisted upon going to pump relieving brig of at least portion of water in hold for there be time when water having accumulated forward poor little craft became pinned down by head to so dangerous extent that must have be absolutely suicidal to have left in condition fellow toiled on until past two bell in middle watch by time have reduced depth of water in hold to two foot then knocked off utterly exhausted to go below turn in while undertook to keep deck watch ship for remainder of night chapter fifteen escape rescue brig a lay hove to rode comparatively easy dry requiring attention therefore have to do be to maintain sharp lookout be ready to show light betimes in event of craft heaving in sight steering such course a must be likely to bring foul of while self imposed duty be thus light one demanding only alertness on part situation condition of brig be such a to cause profound anxiety be in degree lessened by loss of four men who have gone overboard with wreck of fore topmast have ship be sound last circumstance must have caused regret for simple reason that loss reduced number of enemy by four loss casualty due to fracas in forecastle resulted in reduction of number of effective crew to six of whom cook steward be two who must be relied upon for little nothing more than mere pulling hauling while of remaining four two be still suffering from wound sufficiently severe to partially disable reduction with brig practically wreck be serious one moreover glass remained very low there be indication of speedy abatement of gale even ground for hope that have seen worst of on contrary sky looked wilder than ever while gust of wind frequently swept down upon be certainly growing more savage a minute dragged slow length away at length after what seemed like eternity of watching lagging dawn came slowly oozing out of scowling east revealing sky of portentous gloom of deep slatey purple tint blotched with shred of flying dirty white vapour sea be positively appalling in height steepness fury with ran yet heavy a be sea swiftly a great liquid hill came swooping down upon battered brig little craft rode fairly well if trifle languidly latter characteristic attributed to quantity of water still present in hull after studying behaviour by daylight for full half hour came to conclusion that sooner that water must be pumped out of better so watching opportunity rushed for'ard along unprotected deck over water washed heavily at time called hand to turn out pump ship dry after great deal of grumbling much show of disinclination at length succeeded in getting on deck persuading to man pump pumped steadily until be time to knock off for breakfast when sounded well found depth of twenty one inch breakfast that morning be rather comfortless meal for cook terrified lest galley must be washed overboard together have not furnished very appetising spread while wild movement of vessel harsh dismal creaking of timber frequent heavy washing of water along deck roar of gale combining together to create concert of doleful sound rendered cabin distinctly unpleasant place of sojourn therefore made long tarrying at table merely remaining below long enough to snatch hasty meal to say few word of comfort encouragement to sweetheart then hurried on deck again to see how matter be faring there scene met gaze a emerged from companion be depressing discouraging in extreme sky looked darker more threatening than ever wind be freshening rapidly sweeping along in savage gust smote seething wave crest tore into blinding stinging shower of salt spray so thickened atmosphere a to completely veil hide everything beyond distance of mile sea mountainous a have be all through night have grown in steepness height have acquired still more formidable menacing run during short time have be below while fact be unquestionable that brig be labouring more heavily sea washing in steadily increasing volume athwart that portion of deck that lay unprotected through loss of bulwark appeared to that must do better ride easier if showed small spread of canvas just sufficient to steady vessel to cause to turn up good bold side to sea to place under command of helm accordingly dodged way to fore scuttle sang out for hand to come on deck to make sail came at length four of moving with slow exasperating deliberation that merchant seaman assumes when considers that be being put upon at length by dint of sheer persistence induced to overhaul sail locker with result that found main staysail new made of good stout canvas evidently intended for storm sail still working with same deliberation show of indifference finally consented to bend set result be at once apparent brig began to move through water taking sea very much easier a be humoured at with helm while increased height of weather side that turned up have effect of considerably lessening amount of water washing over deck rendering task of getting fore aft comparatively safe be still not satisfied great a be improvement effected by setting of staysail brig yet seemed to labour more heavily than be to be reasonably accounted for even by fact that have water in hold then occurred to to sound well afresh ascertain whether amount of water be increasing accordingly fetched rod carefully dried watching until brig be for instant on even keel lowered down pump barrel upon withdrawing startling discovery be made that since men have last be at pump depth of water in hold have increased by three inch water be draining into hull somewhere that too in sufficient quantity to keep busy directed attention of men to condition of pump rod with deep bitter curse levelled at weather brig at everything in short except indifference of shipmate that have brought to pas went to work afresh at pump while made way to forecastle a be daily wont attended to injury of two wounded men dirk mike who be confined to bunk with brig leaping plunging so desperately task be by mean easy one upon occasion occupied so long that ere have quite finished other men came below still cursing grumbling to get dinner inquired whether have succeeded in reducing quantity of water in hold at be informed with further curse that have only reduced by about two inch that be willing to be eternally condemned if ever laid hand upon pump brake again about six bell in afternoon watch while be at wheel man harry came aft sounded well shouting to twenty six inch went for'ard again with result that quarter of hour so later came aft once more continued pumping for nearly two hour with what effect however must not say for none of condescended to inform did of offer to relieve at wheel be not at surprised at a doubtless considered that what have done at pump be quite a much a must be expected of be not forgotten however for florence making use of fire have caused to be lighted in cabin stove prepared for most substantial appetising meal consisting of toasted rasher of ham cabin bread carefully cleared of weevil tea actually brought on deck to standing by tending wheel in cleverest fashion while hurriedly devoured food not satisfied with doing for dear girl knowing have be on deck previous night actually proposed remaining at wheel in midst of elemental fury long enough to enable to snatch few hour sleep what think of shipmate for devotion on part of sweetheart that of course be going altogether beyond utmost must possibly consent to thanking heartily for generous solicitude sent below with strict injunction to turn in early secure good night rest for although be careful not to hint a much to even in most distant fashion did not at like way that matter be going with leak men aversion to labour of pumping taken together made up bad lookout foresaw unless change for better in one respect other soon took place must speedily come to being obliged to take to boat throughout whole of wet wild cheerless night stood at wheel tending ship helping through sea be not until dawn be abroad that anyone came to relieve when cockney harry made appearance staggering dodging way aft along flooded deck mornin ' sir remarked a took over wheel from look dead wore out do surely ai be at here muckin ' wheel whole blessed night have ye sir certainly have said seeing that brig have to be looked after of men saw fit to relieve well admitted fellow be howlin shime mistike fact be that be dead tired with sweatin ' at infernal pump meant to have ' come along took spell at water grindin ' in w'itin ' for swine to go to sleep went to sleep never woke up agine until five minute ago quite so said drily if really intended to have relieved why have waited until rest be asleep well ye see sir be way answered man when went below lawst night after knockin off pumping hand of be on growl 'cause of heavy work 'd have to do sam up said that best thing must do 'd be to tike to boat a soon a gale broke let blessed old hooker go to bottom rather than have to keep on pumpin ' of everlastin'ly until fetched port rest of 'em agreed with then dirk ups asts what be to be done with lidy nobody else seemin ' to have hawnser ready say that supposes will have to come with dirk say wo never do for to land along of know enough to hang of for one mean to take risk t'others agreed with at last 't be settled that if leak take up when gale break be to take to boat leavin lidy aboard to go down with brig thought 'd wait hear if anybody have anything else to say about afore comin ' aft to relieve be while be w'itin ' dropped asleep thank harry for affording very important item of information said be good sort of fellow may depend upon will not forget service have done so that scoundrel dirk must leave lady to drown must after have done for very well now harry miss onslow will be left aboard here to drown may take oath of that be clear to now that must be war to death between forecastle cabin will take measure accordingly question be side cabin forecastle do intend to be on if choose to join will do what can for if elect to throw in lot with murderer for'ard will still bear in mind so far a can consistently with lady own safety thank'ee sir answered fellow if might make so bold sir what do intend to do said can only tell in event of coming over on side very well sir returned will think over while be tikin ' rest let know when come on deck agine therewith went below flinging into bunk at once fell into profound dreamless sleep that lasted until be awakened by discordant clank of pump about four bell in forenoon watch when found miss onslow patiently awaiting in cabin with hot meal ready for delectation be apparent to immediately upon awaking that gale have broken when went on deck found that sky have cleared to windward showing here there fast widening patch of blue sky while wind have already dropped to strength of strong breeze sea however showed little diminution of height although be no longer so steep be now breaking dangerously brig be rolling a furiously more sluggishly than ever clear water gushed from pump told tale that there be mistaking noticed that five men be now working at pump cook steward being two of hand be growling together cursing loud deep a toiled at brake well lad said approaching be news from pump be there hope of getting to suck suck exclaimed one of in tone of ineffable disgust will never suck more in world there be up'ards o ' three foot o ' water in hooker now be gainin ' on at rate o ' two inch hour while pump at be bound to bottom be only hope will keep afloat long enough to let get boat afloat without smashin ' of 'em to smithereens alongside whereabouts be nearest land mister how fur off be ask after have taken sight at noon look a though will be able to get sun to day will tell said then finding men sulky quite tired of listening to curse went aft relieved wheel remaining there until about quarter of hour to midday when sky having cleared sang out for somebody to relieve while shot sun be harry who came at call a took over wheel remarked just loud enough for to hear staring away to windward a spoke have made up mind sir be with lidy ai agoin ' to have more truck with other chap be better than murderer have mide up mind to leave lidy aboard there be movin ' of 'em from that right lad said will find before many hour be over head that have made wise choice can read fellow intimated that must then said will write out such instruction a will be necessary for to give must find opportunity to read over unobserved by rest must also obey to letter for upon obedience will depend success failure of scheme with left went below for sextant upon working out result of meridian observation found that be close upon one hundred forty mile from staten island bore north by east quarter east of distance might be traversed in le than forty eight hour by properly equipped boat in fine weather what if must come on to blow again be contingency did not care to contemplate there be one point in favour mercury be rising slowly steadily please god if be able to leave brig in good time might succeed in reaching shelter of sort before setting in again of bad weather in case be contingency have to be faced since be perfectly clear by time that brig have be so severely battered strained during late gale that nothing must do must avail to keep afloat much longer having pricked off brig position on chart proceeded to write out instruction to man harry may perhaps be thought that in committing instruction to paper be doing imprudent thing be in fact furnishing irrefutable evidence of intention must man choose to play false show paper to companion have faith in fellow there be honest look in eye fact that have of own free will warned of other men intention be point in favour last not least believed that have wit enough to see that must be better serving own interest by attaching to than by throwing in lot with others consequently must have interest in playing false therefore unhesitatingly handed instruction at first opportunity left to carry out with a little delay a possible upon returning to deck after working out sight found that men have knocked off pumping be hanging about deck a though waiting for something instead of going below to dinner presently found out what be in wind man known a sam stepping forward to inquire whereabout observation placed ship told then said if steer nothe ' by east quarter east steady be bound to fetch here staten hiland be certainly said hope that will make time day after to morrow day a'ter to morrer ejaculated man do ye mean with here brig said mean with boat brig must never fetch in present disabled condition except with fair wind even if must keep afloat so long for moment believe grim smile of satisfaction fellow strove to conceal flickered for moment over rugged sullen feature then turned away without word slouched forward followed by companion a for went aft took wheel from man who be tending a soon a have disappeared lashed set about certain preparation felt be now high time to make did not occupy long upon completion went below where cook steward having be busy at pump morning florence be awaiting with good appetising dinner prepared by while be discussing meal together steward having gone forward with others told companion that supreme moment be at hand when must be necessary for to make bold dash for life warned to prepare for by putting slender stock of clothing together in parcel to be ready to act with at moment notice a soon a boat be in water received intelligence very quietly although lost colour became marble white to lip for perhaps minute while explained plan courage never faltered when have finished put hand in mine with simple remark very well charlie dear have only to tell what wish to do will find obedient in particular meanwhile wind have be blowing strong breeze at breakfast time have be dropping steadily through day until toward close of afternoon have softened down to strength of royal breeze with corresponding diminution in height of sea yet be evident that must not be possible to safely lower boat for hour to come that men be eager to be off be also perfectly evident for instead of manning pump again after dinner have spent entire afternoon hanging about deck inspecting overhauling boat getting provision water other necessary together cook

others taking into head to go on deck have look round anxious to get a much rest a possible flung down upon one of sofa locker nerve be just then rather too tautly strung sens too keenly on alert to admit of anything like sound sleep simply dozed hearing harry movement on deck until grey light of dawn began to ooze down through skylight when went to berth soused head in basin of cold water have good refreshing wash then went on deck to look round people forward appearing on deck at precise moment when emerged from companion seemed to be rather disconcerted at seeing feigned not to have noticed devoting immediate attention to weather be quite fine now with nice little royal breeze from about due east sea have gone down wonderfully during night there be very little more than heavy swell to contend with while even looked great deal more formidable than really be a for brig be much more buoyant than have expected to find gave fully six hour longer to live quite long enough to enable wretch who meditated destruction to repair launch boat that have wilfully damaged while job must occupy long enough to enable to gain good start get clear away from cook went to galley lighted fire quite in ordinary way set about preparing breakfast while rest going to city of cawnpore gig looked into talking together in low tone then cast off gripe tackle fall lowered until gunwale be just level with rail when began to pas into stow keg of water provision other matter that intended taking with by extreme care that man bestowed upon storage of own particular bundle of dunnage felt tolerably certain that respective parcel of gem be concealed therein seeing thus employed slipped down below gave miss onslow call then returned to deck with own bundle together with chronometer sextant of in easy off hand manner placed in stern sheet a did so man sam looked up exclaimed savagely here what be instantly interrupted by one of mate who murmured few word in ear what be matter demanded with great affectation of innocence surely there be room in boat for few thing belonging to lady oh ay growled surlily there be room enough if there ai will make room so lady will have plenty o clothes for trip eh mate others responded with sinister laugh at grim humour of joke without taking notice looked on at work with just amount of interest might be reasonably expected to take until steward called to say that breakfast be ready then with glance of intelligence at harry to responded turned away went below breakfast be very good one just substantial appetising kind one must wish to sit down to upon occasion did ample justice to at length at what judged to be right moment signed to miss onslow to go on deck then rose to foot a though to follow instead of springing up companion ladder turned to steward seized by throat flung violently to deck shock stunned before recovered consciousness have got lashed arm leg together like trussed fowl with gag in mouth have already prepared for purpose making sure that be quite secure must not possibly release cry out dashed up companion ladder drew over slide securing door with wedge harry be sitting on windlass barrel taking breakfast al fresco acting a lookout generally while others breakfasted below directly saw throw up hand a signal to slid off windlass crept softly to fore scuttle swiftly closed hatch securing by thrusting wooden pin through staple there be immediate outcry from below quickly followed by savage bang upon underside of hatch taking notice of manifestation fellow rushed aft at once assisted to place miss onslow in gig then springing to tackle fall lowered boat smartly short remaining distance to water springing into unhooked tackle shoved clear of brig then still working for life stepped mast set sail headed boat to northward be much too quick for have scarcely placed cable length between brig when heard crash aboard next instant saw fellow rising out of forecastle rushing aft of course at once caught sight of promptly blazed away with pistol at none of bullet came anywhere near then began to shout imprecation at prayer to to return remained equally deaf to in few minute boat slipping nimbly along through water be out of hearing of congratulating ourselves other upon good luck in having succeeded in so neatly effecting escape without being obliged to fight for possession of boat headed north with intention of making staten island if possible have scarcely be under way two hour when harry who be forward keeping lookout sighted sail dead to windward heading way at once
