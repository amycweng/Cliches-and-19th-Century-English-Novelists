play depending on how do cruise of esmeralda by harry collingwood chapter one story of buried treasure of reader who happen to be well acquainted with weymouth will also be assuredly acquainted with certain lane known a buxton lane branching off to right from high road at rodwell connecting that suburb with picturesque little village of wyke make assertion with most perfect confidence because buxton lane happens to afford one of most charming walk in charming neighbourhood one can well be sojourner for length of time in weymouth without discovering fact for through inquiry by mean of personal exploration of who have enjoyed saunter through lane there will doubtless be who can remember substantial stone built house standing back distance of about hundred yard so from roadway environed by quaint old fashioned garden entire demesne being situate on crest of rise just before wyke be reached commanding unparalleled view of roadstead of portland with open channel a far a saint alban head to left while on right west bay notorious for shipwreck stretch from bill of portland far away westward into misty distance toward lyme beer seaton ay even beyond down to berry head past torquay headland having be distinctly seen from wyke nap on clear day so be said though can not remember that ever saw from standpoint house to refer be be for believe no longer exists known a spaniard be built by ancestor hubert saint leger with portion of proceeds of spanish prize that having so harried worried that at length became separated from main body of great armada drove into weymouth bay there under eye of admiring fellow townsman fought in good ship golden rose until be fain to strike colour surrender to craft of considerably le than half size spaniard have continued in possession of saint leger family from time of building down to date of story under roof be born to roof have returned from australian voyage day two previous to event about to be related to find dear mother in direst of trouble father like rest of male saint leger for a many generation a must trace back have be seaman have died abroad leaving mother moderate provision a must enable with care to end day in peace comfort beneath old roof tree be lonely life for poor soul for be only child being saint leger took naturally to sea a profession must do so be indeed so completely foregone conclusion be especially educated for at greenwich upon leaving have be bound apprentice to father under have faithfully served time have risen to position of second mate when death claimed passed away in arm commending mother to tenderest care with last breath since terrible time have made several voyage to eastern possession now when story open be chief mate of fine clipper ship with hope of promotion to rank of captain when suitable vacancy must occur voyage have just concluded have be singularly fortunate one for for on homeward passage when short distance to eastward of cape have fallen in with derelict homeward bound from moluccas philippine with cargo of almost fabulous value on board having taken possession of have be placed in command with crew of four hand with instruction to take into table bay there to raise crew to full complement having done so to afterwards navigate to destination have successfully accomplished arriving home only nine day after own ship claim for salvage have be duly made calculated that when settling day arrived own share must fall very little short of three thousand pound if indeed did not fully reach that figure have stated that when upon termination of australian voyage completion of duty a chief mate returned to ancestral home for purpose of spending brief holiday with mother prior to departure upon yet journey to antipode have found in dire trouble trouble be natural may say inevitable result of father mistaken idea that be a good man of business a be seaman acting under impression have relied entirely upon own unaided judgment in investment of saving anxious only to secure a generous provision a possible for mother have be tempted to put hard earned money into certain project offering in inception too alluring promise of continuous prosperity generous dividend have failed to withstand test of time altered condition of trade with result that after paying handsome percentage for more le lengthened period have suddenly collapsed like pricked balloon leaving poor mother penniless of course everything have be done be possible to save something though might be ever so little from wreck there have be nothing to save penny be gone when reached home found poor soul literally at wit end to maintain supply of ordinary necessary of life appearance upon scene of course necessitated raking up of whole miserable story once more when have be told everything saw at once that nothing more must be done that poor mother must simply have to put up with loss a best might then arose question of what be best to be done under altered circumstance first conclusion at arrived be obvious one that must be quite impossible for mother to maintain such establishment a spaniard upon income of ten pound per month a chief mate therefore suggested that must let upon lease if suitable tenant must be found that must retire with altered fortune into obscurity of small cottage to however must in wise consent be while be discussing matter in bearing casting about for acceptable alternative that mother let fall remark little a suspected at moment proved to be key note of present story ah son ejaculated with hopeless sigh if must find lost clue to richard saint leger buried treasure might yet be well with ah responded with still more hopeless sigh if only must suppose there be about a much chance of a there be of becoming lord high admiral of great britain clue must be irretrievably lost must have be discovered long ere now suppose saint leger from great great great grandfather hugh downwards have taken turn at hunting for miserable lost clue fact that failed to find be conclusive evidence to that be longer in existence well really know boy be not prepared to say so much a answered mother dear father took same view of matter that do never to knowledge devoted single hour to search have heard say that be same with grandfather if never searched for lost clue how can know suppose that one have searched for since hugh saint leger abandoned quest yet there never appears to have be slightest shadow of doubt in mind of of ancestor that when richard saint leger died in arm of son hugh held clue to secret indeed died in act of endeavouring to communicate so have always understood answered with languidly reviving interest be so long since last heard story not since be little shaver in petticoat have practically forgotten detail must like to hear again if be not troubling too much be trouble at dear boy for can be told in very few word besides ought to know answered mother be aware of course that saint leger have be race of daring adventurous seaman a far back a family record go richard saint leger who be born in be perhaps most daring adventurous of be contemporary of great captain afterwards lord anson be upon return from voyage to west indie that first became aware of rumour reached england from time to time of fabulous value of galleon sailed annually from acapulco to manilla laden with treasure of peru rumour be doubt greatly exaggerated be well calculated to excite imagination stimulate enterprise of bold restless spirit of period so much so indeed that when english in declared war against capture of one of ship became to english adventurer what discovery of fabled el dorado have be to predecessor of elizabethan time at length in year think be became whispered about among restless spirit that galleon have actually be captured that captor have returned to england literally laden with wealth richard saint leger be one of first to hear news so fired imagination probably cupidity that never rested until have traced rumour to source found to be true then sought out leader of fortunate expedition having pledged to strictest secrecy obtained fullest particular relating to adventure done next step be to organise company of adventurer with a head leader to sail in search of next year galleon be in year expedition be failure so far a capture of galleon be concerned for fell into hand of commodore anson in other respect however voyage proved fairly profitable for though missed great treasure ship fell in with captured spanish vessel have on board sufficient specie to well recompense captor for time trouble devoted to adventure now come to part of story relates to what have always be spoken of in family a richard saint leger buried treasure appears that on board captured spanish ship of have just spoken certain english prisoner be found survivor of crew of english ship have fought with be destroyed by spanish ship only few day prior to own capture men be of course at once removed to richard saint leger own ship where received care hurt for be said that man of be more le severely wounded treated with such skill a happened to be available with result that few of recovered many however be so sorely hurt that succumbed to injury english captain being among number survived however long enough to tell richard saint leger that have captured galleon of previous year have determined upon capturing next also with object in view not caring to subject booty to manifold risk attendant upon cruise of entire year have sought out secluded spot have there carefully concealed treasure by burying in earth now however poor man be dying must never hope to enjoy share of spoil even insure possession to relative therefore made compact with richard saint leger confiding to secret of hiding place upon condition upon recovery of treasure one half of be to be handed over in certain proportion to survivor of crew who have captured failing to heir richard saint leger to take other half now whether be that richard saint leger be of secretive disposition whether have other motive for keeping matter secret know not certain be that never made slightest reference to matter even to son hugh who be sailing with until considerable time afterwards occasion led to taking hugh into confidence be meeting with enemy promptly proceeded to engage may have be either a measure of prudence in view of impending conflict perhaps premonition of approaching end led to adopt precaution of imparting secret to second person have deferred matter too long however have only advanced far enough in narrative to communicate particular have just given when two ship became so hotly engaged that father son be obliged to separate in prosecution of duty conclusion of story have to be deferred until more convenient season that season never arrived for richard saint leger be struck down severely wounded early in fight command of ship then devolved upon hugh moreover not only be there very great disparity of force in favour of spaniard contrary to usual experience fought with utmost valour determination so that for time after ship have become engaged at close quarter struggle be simply one for bare life on part of english during hugh saint leger have leisure to think of treasure of anything else save how to save comrade from horror of capture by cruel enemy meanwhile consciousness gradually forced upon richard saint leger that be wounded unto death that time must soon be for more realising now doubt grave mistake have committed in keeping so important secret a of hiding place of treasure locked within own breast despatched messenger to hugh enjoining latter to hasten to side of dying father forthwith at risk messenger however be shot dead ere must reach hugh saint leger side urgent message remained undelivered at stubborn courage of english prevailed despite vast superiority in number spaniard who have boarded be first driven back to own deck then below when further resistance being useless flung down arm surrendered hugh now after giving few hasty order a to disposal of prisoner found time to think of father whom remembered seeing in act of being borne below wounded in early part of fight accordingly hurried away in search of finding in own cabin supported in arm of one of seaman literally at last breath be with difficulty hugh succeeded in rendering father conscious of presence when be at length accomplished sufferer only rallied sufficiently to gasp painfully word treasure buried island full particular concealed in ' when torrent of blood gushed from mouth nostril with last convulsive struggle richard saint leger sank back upon pallet dead be buried at sea same night along with others who have fallen in fight day afterwards when hugh saint leger have conquered grief sufficiently to give attention to other matter set to task of seeking for particular relating to buried treasure though patiently examined document scrap of paper contained in father desk otherwise searched most carefully industriously in conceivable hiding place must think of quest be unavailing particular have never be found to day be very curious remarked when mother have brought narrative to conclusion very curious very interesting what have related only strengthens previous conviction that document document no longer exist have very little doubt that if truth must only be arrived at must be found that richard saint leger kept paper concealed somewhere about clothing that be buried with be certainly not case rejoined mother for be distinctly stated that probably to obviate such possibility hugh saint leger carefully preserved article of clothing father wore when died thing exist to day carefully preserved upstairs together with other article belonging to richard saint leger happened to be on board ship at time have relic never be examined since ancestor hugh abandoned quest a hopeless inquired may have be can not say answered mother believe that dear father grandfather for matter ever thought worth while to subject to thoroughly exhaustive scrutiny father know always felt convinced a do that document have be either irretrievably lost destroyed then if be so exclaimed will have thorough overhaul from clew to earring before be day older if a say scrap of property belonging to richard saint leger be carefully collected removed from ship when came home still exists stored away upstairs why paper must be there too if be will find let be hidden ever so carefully whereabouts do say thing be mother in west attic where have always be kept answered mother wait few minute dear boy until have found key of box will make search together chapter two cryptogram west attic be sort of lumber room in be stored extensive collection of miscellaneous article have survived era of usefulness because happened to be relic of former saint leger for other equally sufficient reason be deemed too valuable to be disposed of content of chamber must scarcely have proved uninteresting even to stranger for in addition to several handsome piece of out of date furniture discarded originally in favour of more modern substantial mahogany article now permitted to remain in seclusion simply because of bizarre appearance must present in conjunction with same ponderous product of nineteenth century cabinet maker taste there be to be found outlandish weapon curiosity of kind collected from sundry out of way spot in quarter of globe to say nothing of frayed faded flag of silk bunting have be taken from enemy at various time by one of saint leger one of represented especially hard fought fight deed of exceptional daring complete romance in ponderous pistol with inlaid barrel elaborately carved stock bell mouthed blunderbuss business like hanger notched dinted of edge discoloured to hilt with dark sinister stain that hung here there upon wall relic of dead gone saint leger to only surviving descendant of race of sturdy sea hero room content have of course always proved absorbingly interesting never even in earliest childhood have be so delighted a when on fine warm summer day have succeeded in coaxing mother up into room there extracted from legend attached to flag weapon to do justice poor soul must never of own free will have opened lip to on such subject father saint leger to backbone despite fact that susceptibility have become refined sensitive by more gentle influence of modern teaching felt none of scruple be experienced by gentle tender hearted spouse seemed to consider almost religious duty that latest of saint leger must be so trained a to worthily sustain tradition of race not must be understood that father preserved faintest trace of unscrupulous buccaneering propensity be only too probably strongly marked characteristic of earlier saint leger far from have evidently never occurred to that be even remotely possible must ever adopt other profession than of sea knowing from experience how indispensable to sailor be quality of dauntless courage patient unflinching endurance absolute self reliance unswerving resolution have steadily done utmost to cultivate quality in story be invariably so narrated a to illustrate value desirability of one of on present occasion however thought on entering room be intent upon subject remotely connected with valiant achievement of ancestor lost time in collecting together in one corner article big little still remained of possession of richard saint leger there be not many of sea chest containing somewhat limited wardrobe including clothes in died writing desk substantial oak built brass bound affair roll of chart still faintly redolent of peculiar musty odour so characteristic of article have be for long time on shipboard few book equally odoriferous brace of pistol sheathed hanger still attached to belt writing desk a being most appropriate depository for paper be naturally object to first devoted attention completely emptied of content depositing in clothes basket on right hand to start with from afterwards removed one by one after carefully perusing completely through tossed into similar receptacle on left many of document proved to be sufficiently interesting reading especially consisted of note memoranda of information relating to projected anticipated movement of enemy ship acquired in case in most curious way then there be bundle of letter retailing scrap of home news signed loving wife isabella though allowed single scrap of paper to pas unexamined not one of contained most remote reference to such matter a buried treasure next subjected desk to most rigorous examination half hoping might discover secret receptacle so cunningly contrived a to have escaped observation of who have preceded in search desk be plain simple honest affair solidly substantially constructed in such manner secret recess be simply impossible having satisfied thus far carefully restored paper to several receptacle from have taken locked desk then turned attention to sea chest here be equally unfortunate for though in bottom of chest actually found identical log book relating to cruise during richard saint leger be supposed to have acquired knowledge of hidden treasure though found duly entered therein usual brief pithy log book entry of action with spanish ship not word be there even remotely hinted at existence of treasure record relating to not to spin out portion of yarn to unnecessary length may a well say in so many word that when have worked way steadily through relic left to of richard saint leger until nothing remained to be examined hanger belt found a destitute of scrap of information sought a have be at commencement of search be not in least likely that one must select such unsuitable place a sheath of cutlas in to conceal important document still might never in future have reason to reproach with having passed over even most unlikely hiding place took down weapon from peg on hung with difficulty drew blade from leather sheath there be nothing at extraordinary about weapon mounting blade hilt be alike perfectly plain what story that piece of steel must have told have be gifted with power of speech be notched dinted from guard to point notch dint bearing eloquent evidence of stirring adventure doughty deed of valour be not there on occasion to dream over notched rusty cutlas therefore laid weapon aside with belt across knee proceeded to carefully explore interior of sheath with aid of long wire be while thus engaged that eye fell upon portion of stitching in belt have appearance of being newer than perhaps must be more correct to say of different workmanship from rest belt ought to explain be leather band nearly four inch wide fastening being ordinary plain square brass buckle belt be made of two thickness of leather stitched together along top bottom edge be portion of stitching along top edge struck a differing somewhat in appearance from rest might better inspect stitching moved toward window with belt in hand a did so ran thick leather through finger surely belt felt shade thicker in part than anywhere else be only fancy did detect faint sound a of crackling of paper when bent belt at spot in act of raising to light be possible that richard saint leger have actually chosen so unlikely spot a interior of sword belt in to hide important document yet after why unlikely must be a safe place of concealment a for doubtless wore belt if not hanger habitually therefore by sewing document up inside must be sure of always having upon person with scarcely possibility of losing determined to solve question forthwith whipped out knife carefully cut through suspicious looking stitch thus separating two thickness of leather along upper edge for length of about six inch then forcing two edge apart peered into pocket like recess there sure enough be small compactly folded paper at once withdrew carefully unfolded result be disclosure of following incomprehensible document studied for few minute in complete bewilderment then carried downstairs to mother who have be called away upon household matter time before see here mother exclaimed have found something whether happens to be long missing secret of hidden treasure be quite impossible for to determine if be there be prospect of remaining secret so far a be concerned for can make head tail of let look at son where did find exclaimed stretching out hand for paper be sewn up in richard saint leger sword belt from have just cut replied so whether not will be secret of treasure think may safely take for granted that be document of more than ordinary value dick saint leger must never have taken trouble to conceal so carefully yes remarked mother there can be no doubt a to content being of very considerable importance be cryptogram see people usually take trouble to write in cipher unless matter be of such nature a to render written record very highly desirable whilst be also equally desirable that must be preserved secret from party who posse key be certainly most unintelligible looking affair have doubt that with little study will be able to puzzle out meaning a girl used to be rather good at solving puzzle so much better remarked for to present most utterly hopeless appearance only thing can understand about be sketch while bear most extraordinary resemblance to profile of man face be undoubtedly intended to represent island that to mind be point in favour of being long sought document now continued if feel disposed to take spell at see what can make of think will walk into town attend to one two little matter of business perhaps will have whole thing cut dried by time return mother laughed be afraid be altogether too sanguine dear jack replied be ordinary commonplace cipher feel certain run along dear boy walk will do good while be gone will sit down quietly do best to plumb secret dismissing for time being mysterious document from mind set out along lane toward weymouth giving thought meanwhile to question of what must be best course for to pursue under mother altered circumstance be now absolutely dependent upon for food clothing for fund requisite to maintain household for everything in fact save roof covered needed very abstruse calculation to convince that wage a chief mate be wholly inadequate to demand must now be made upon if only must obtain command must be well have interest outside employ in be then engaged have already received distinct assurance from owner must be appointed to first suitable vacancy a have taken trouble to ascertain immediately upon arrival home prospect of vacancy suitable otherwise be growing more remote intangible day steamer be cutting out sailing craft in direction freight be low scarce ship be being laid up by hundred in port of consequence for want of profitable employment still there be exception to rule have met old shipmate of mine only few day before in london who in command of own ship be doing exceedingly well a meeting with subsequent chat recurred to memory thought suggested why must not too command own ship have little money legacy of few hundred left by uncle year previously there be share of salvage money might be possible to obtain command by purchasing interest in ship better still might be able to acquire sole ownership of craft large enough for purpose by executing mortgage on ship for balance of purchase money idea be worth thinking over talking over also since there be time like present determined to call upon old family friend retired solicitor named richards forthwith be fortunate enough to find old gentleman at home when at length have made way over bridge up through town along esplanade to comfortable villa on dorchester road be pottering about in garden when be announced smart parlour maid who took card to quickly returned with message requesting must join there seemed genuinely glad to see like most elderly people who have passed life in one place be full of inquiry a to spot have last visited incident of voyage so on having satisfied curiosity in respect indulged in little desultory chat unfolded special object of call to explaining position asking what thought of plan well said when have finished story shipping matter connected therewith be rather out of line a be doubt aware if can see way to make purchase of ship paying transaction must think there ought not to be very serious difficulty about finding fund money market be said to be tight just now be true experience be that there be always plenty of money to be have when prospect of profitable investment be fairly promising now for instance be really most curious coincidence that must have called upon just at time for happens that certain mortgage held have recently be paid off have be casting about for satisfactory re investment in to employ money how much do think probable will require made rapid calculation named sum thought must suffice coincidence number two exclaimed singularly enough that happens to be precisely amount now have lying idle now jack lad have known from boy though be axiom with lawyer never to think well of anything anybody must stake last penny upon integrity so far a honesty be concerned must not hesitate to advance sum might require must spare upon mere nominal security of note of hand there be other risk than of borrower dishonesty to be considered must be guarded against take for example possibility of failing to find remunerative employment for ship how be to be guarded against must hold bottomry bond in other word mortgage upon ship for amount of debt must constitute ample security for recovery replied um yes just so commented still ship be not house case be by mean parallel then there be risk of loss total partial ship might be stranded receive so much damage that must cost more than be worth to repair might become total wreck such possibility must have to be provided against by insurance a business man must expect to hold policy must be willing must do that certainly replied of course in event of deciding to lend money require presume that proper agreement must be drawn up specifying amount term duration of loan mode of repayment so on agreement in short must equally protect interest if be done there must be objection to holding policy indeed must most probably ask to do so apart from stipulation to effect a must be much safer with than with be very true assented old gentleman chief question however be whether be practically convinced that must be acting wisely in entering upon undertaking do honestly believe that there be reasonable prospect of being able to make pay be asking question on own behalf not mine dear boy will be quite safe for a business man will take care to make so failure must be simply disastrous for now tell honestly have doubt at a to success of enterprise none answered confidently there be doubtless plenty of hard work anxiety in store for not failure be master of profession have certain modicum of business ability a well a common sense never fear for dear sir will come out right upon word believe will jack old gentleman replied be plucky young fellow be battle in day however decide upon anything hastily take little more time to think matter over if after doing so finally determine upon hazarding experiment go to stranger to borrow money come to will be dealt fairly with a wended way homeward on glorious summer afternoon once more turned whole matter over in mind with result that before reached spaniard have fully come to determination to take risk such a be be own master there be blinking fact must have to do something to purchase ship sail in own employ seemed to be not only best only thing must do under circumstance on reaching home found that mother have spent entire afternoon in fruitless effort to decipher cryptogram much to disappointment so by way of giving something else to think about told her of idea have occurred to during walk of chat have have with mr richards about of offer to assist with loan if need be dear old mater entered upon subject with enthusiasm a always did upon plan scheme upon have set heart though at first idea of trusting saving to mercy of treacherous sea failed to commend to came round to view at length dissipated only scruple have have by unreservedly assenting to proposal matter settled thus far next thing to be done be to obtain master certificate determined to do forthwith to look about for ship at same time knew exactly what wanted scarcely expected to get with amount at disposal even with such assistance a mr richards might be able to afford still be in hurry for month two must have little time to look about if must not find precisely what wanted must perhaps succeed in obtaining reasonably near approach to accordingly on following day made few preparation be necessary called upon mr richards again acquainted with decision on day afterwards took early train to london not only settled in lodging in neighbourhood of tower hill also arranged with coach to give polishing up necessary to obtain certificate before night closed down upon great city chapter three esmeralda a have be sensible enough to make most of opportunity at sea be crack seaman first rate navigator needed therefore very great amount of coaching to enable to pas examination month later saw full fledged master with certificate in pocket empowered to take command of passenger ship if must obtain meanwhile have be keeping quiet lookout for ship a have in mind eye indeed have looked at several have hitherto found nothing to suit have also called two three time at office of late owner to inquire how matter of salvage be progressing have be informed on last occasion that there be prospect of speedy settlement have be week previous to obtaining of certificate that last week have be busy a well a somewhat anxious one for be now free trouble so far a examination be concerned be over on eventful afternoon when received intimation have passed with flying colour mentally resolved to pay visit of inquiry after salvage first thing next morning when next morning came however plan for day suddenly underwent alteration for a sat in frowsy lodging at rather later breakfast than usual devouring doubtful egg munching tough toast sipping cold coffee with advertisement page of shipping gazette propped up before on table following advertisement caught eye for sale at breaking up price exceptionally fast handsome clipper barque esmeralda ton bm at lloyd substantially built of oak throughout coppered copper fastened only year old a sound a on day that left stock very light draught foot fully loaded having be designed built especially for natal trade can be moved without ballast have accommodation for twelve saloon eight steerage passenger unusually full inventory including three suit of sail one suit never yet bent boat fully equipped very powerful ground tackle hawser warp spare topmast other spar boom etcetera etcetera complete ready for sea at once extraordinary bargain owner adopting steam for further particular apply to etcetera etcetera now be exactly kind of craft have have in mind from moment when first thought of purchasing be if esmeralda only happened to bear reasonable resemblance to description unfortunately did not always happen at event in case of vessel for sale own experience hitherto have be that be exception rather than rule for have found that if indeed advertisement did not contain gross mi statement be almost always so cunningly worded a to convey impression totally at variance with reality in case however be somewhat more hopeful for natal clipper be not wholly strange to ship to have lately belonged have loaded outward cargo in same dock with one of on more than one occasion have noticed a being exceptionally smart looking little craft have frequently heard spoken of in highly favourable term by men who have sailed in knew moreover that until very lately strong feeling of rivalry have existed between owner whose ship be in particular trade especially who made speciality of passenger carrying owner striving utmost to earn for own ship reputation of being fastest most comfortable in trade be therefore in hope that if esmeralda have indeed be especially built for natal liner might not prove so hopelessly unlike description a have be most of ship have taken trouble to inspect therefore determined to have look at forthwith lest so eligible craft a seemed to be on paper must slip through finger place at be necessary to apply for further particular be in fenchurch street upon making way thither discovered that be office of owner stated business to one of clerk be immediately turned over to keen looking elderly man who at once invited into private sanctum a preliminary showed half model of vessel be very plainly got up affair intended merely to exhibit general shape mould of hull have sooner taken into hand cast critical glance two at line of entrance run than decided conclusively have never in life set eye upon more handsome craft model showed to be willow very beamy of hull line be a fine a of yacht indeed entire shape of hull be yacht like in extreme having expressed in becomingly moderate term satisfaction so far be next given specification to look through careful perusal of document convinced that if craft have be built up to be undoubtedly a staunch ship a wood metal must make next question be that of price though when be named disinterested person might perhaps have be disposed to consider expression breaking up price a somewhat poetic imaginative figure be still very decidedly moderate one if craft only proved to be in somewhat a good condition a be represented to be also meeting with carefully qualified approval be suggested that a craft herself be lying in east india dock must run down look at new friend accordingly took train in due time arrived alongside be hard work to restrain expression of admiration delight sprang to lip when eye first rested upon for be little beauty indeed dirty a be disordered lumbered up a be deck be impossible for professional eye to overlook many excellency before have even stepped on board have already mentally determined that if hull be only sound little barkie must be mine that in must seek for dick saint leger long lost treasure for not only came up to far surpassed in appearance ideal craft upon have set mind be a handsome a picture with immensely taunt lofty spar though hold be absolutely empty royal yard be across strong breeze happened to be blowing at time made scarcely perceptible impression upon carried small topgallant forecastle forward just large enough to comfortably house two pig pen in position be not likely to prove annoyance to people aft accommodation below for crew be roomy comfortable abaft foremast between main hatch stood deck house fore part of constituted berthage for steerage passenger while after part consisted of commodious galley fitted with large very complete cooking range after part of deck be raised two half foot forming fine roomy half poop pierced only by saloon companion saloon skylight two small skylight immediately abaft lighted pair of family cabin situated abaft main saloon wheel be handsomely carved mahogany affair elaborately adorned with brasswork binnacle also be of brass with bronze standard representing three dolphin twisted round other belaying pin also be of brass fore aft few other detail caught eye seemed to indicate that expense have be spared in fitting out of ship while be walking round deck making leisurely inspection of such matter a must repay examination in part of ship very respectable seaman like fellow came on board be first accosted by companion then introduced to a captain thomson late skipper of esmeralda now looking after ship until find purchaser mr saint leger companion continued explanatorily have come on board to inspect ship with idea of buying if find satisfactory be very glad to hear answered thomson for be altogether too good to be laid up idle a to being satisfactory why of course depends upon what mr saint leger want ship may be too large too small for will defy man to find fault in be beauty sir continued turning to be bit a good a look unknown friend here pulled out watch looked at anxiously wonder said whether will consider very rude if propose to run away leave captain thomson to do honour of ship in stead must like to remain with fact be have rather important meeting to attend in city see have time to lose if be to be punctual thomson really know great deal more about ship than do consequently will be able to give more reliable information than can of course begged that must not put to slightest inconvenience on account expressed a being perfectly satisfied at being left in hand of skipper of ship whereupon turned to thomson said let saint leger see everything without reserve thomson tell anything wish to know if please have desire to sell ship by mean of misrepresentation of sort good bye continued turning to offering hand hope will see again be able to do business with raised hat stepped briskly along gang plank be soon lost sight of in crowd who be that gentleman inquired of thomson a figure vanished be mr musgrave junior partner of firm a nice gentleman a ever stepped be reply have be long in employ be next question for last eighteen year in fact ever since first took to sea hope to end day with be now building steamer for a soon a craft be sold be to go supervise work upon ah remarked excellent arrangement now captain tell a between man man have ever discovered fault in esmeralda anything must like to have have altered in have such alteration be possible have commanded for time suppose ever since be launched be reply sweeter little vessel in way doe float a to fault have none to thinking be not great cargo carrier be true in fact line be so fine that amount of register tonnage in dead weight just put down to plimsoll mark men must doubt consider serious fault for what want in carrying capacity more than make up in speed so that when whole thing come to be worked out putting earnings against expense carry tonnage at le cost than other ship happen to be acquainted with be tight asked tight a bottle sir why make enough water to keep sweet strong just look at copper not wrinkle in yet tell sir have habitually driven little ship so hard that have made faster passage than other ship in trade why made run from same dock to natal in fifty five day on one trip have never taken longer than seventy day to do prettier sea boat never set eye on weatherly why will weather on craft twice size a to speed have never yet seen anything beat fact be sir be much too good to be cargo carrier be good enough in way to be used a yacht fine wholesome comfortable yacht must make too be exceedingly satisfactory so too be everything saw down below saloon be beautifully fitted up in white gold with rich carpet on floor handsome mahogany

roomy especially family cabin abaft be lighted not only from above by skylight also by stern window in hold too everything be a must have wished timber perfectly sound sign of dry rot anywhere in short for wonder ship be everything that advertisement said of more so thoroughly satisfied be with did not hesitate to tell skipper before left must certainly buy if owner must come to term suppose sir intend to sail remarked a stood on wharf taking final look at little beauty before returning to lodging answered that such be intention well said perhaps will be wanting mate if so believe late mate must give satisfaction be thorough seaman first rate navigator good disciplinarian most sober steady reliable man in way must have liked to keep for will be month before new steamer will be ready robert be man name say ca afford to remain idle for so long will write to sir tell to call on said must be obliged if must gave envelope bearing temporary address then shaking hand with thanking for readiness have exhibited in affording information assisting in inspection of ship bade good bye made best of way back to lodging on reaching found a luck must have letter from late owner conveying gratifying intelligence that salvage claim have be settled that upon calling at office share amounting to two thousand eight hundred eighty six pound odd shilling must be paid to be still early in afternoon therefore snatched hurried lunch immediately afterwards chartered cab drove into city duly received cheque with congratulation on good fortune still have time to open account safely rid

on board liked appearance of man from moment that first set eye upon be evidently somewhat more highly educated than generality of class without being in least dandified possessed ease polish of manner at time quite exceptional in mate of such small craft a esmeralda be very quiet unassuming in behaviour altogether produced so favourable impression upon that unhesitatingly shipped on spot arranging with to bring dunnage on board assume duty on following day overhaul of store on board barque resulted in satisfactory discovery that expenditure necessary to complete for voyage must be considerably le than have dared to hope fact established left ship in robert charge ran down home upon flying visit to mother to fully acquaint with have done to make arrangement necessary for comfort maintenance during contemplated absence involved visit to friend mr richards with whose assistance made careful yet generous computation of expense to must be in least likely to be put before drawing profit from adventure difference between sum amount of available asset representing amount of monetary accommodation must require from thanks to exceptionally favourable term upon have acquired ownership of esmeralda be so very small that undertook obligation with light heart having completed part of business to entire satisfaction hastened back to town mother accompanying in order that might have a much a possible of other society during short interval be to elapse before sailing of ship on return to london found that small portion of cargo have already come alongside therefore lost

promised that if cabin be not engaged must make trip home to weymouth in ship arrangement with must not dream of interfering interrupted gentleman even must determine to take cabin captain will certainly not require at outset of voyage at least be quite sure that mother presence for few day that will probably be with will be reverse of disagreeable to wife now can not of course decide

likely to give trouble by encouraging attempt at flirtation on part of men so that altogether thought have reason to congratulate upon first experience in command of passenger ship then a to ship though be early yet to form distinct definite opinion of having have only few hour experience of under sail too in light breeze smooth water still behaviour under circumstance have be such a led to feel assured from past experience that be everything seaman heart must wish that be certain to prove extraordinarily fast be convinced even before have spread single cloth of canvas by ease with tug have walked away down river with after tug have let go hawser left to own device have overhauled passed everything in company with ease rapidity proved to be perfect witch in light breeze while now when rest of fleet be either drifting helplessly with tide heading to point of compass anchoring to avoid falling foul of something else be sneaking along at good two knot through water with ship under perfect command of helm at sound of child happy voice ceased down below few minute later sir edgar emerged from saloon companion paused for moment to address cheery remark two to little party

family undertaking voyage at length when dusk of evening have fairly merged into darkness of night illimitable vault above have become spangled powdered with star innumerable of magnitude delicate sheen appeared on eastern horizon glowing faintly softly at first a tremulous shimmer of summer lightning brightening by imperceptible degree until revealed hitherto invisible bank of fleecy vapour lying low along horizon margin rounded edge of daintily touched here there with glowing silver rapidly yet with most subtle mutation glow increased in strength splendour colour at same time deepening to warm orange hue presently above upper edge of cloud bank sharp rim of moon broad disc soared into view ruddy a shield of burning gold while simultaneously wavering line of ruddy gold flashed across gleaming surface of water almost to ship side slowly majestically a befits movement of stately queen of night glowing orb rose clear of cloud bank orange beam flowing softly into shadow of night revealing here there in clear delicate outline form detail of craft have before appeared a black shapeless blot against starlit heaven while hull canvas of craft have hitherto worn aspect of huge black shadow upon sky water now glowed faint clear in warm light with rich touch of ruddy gold here there where radiance struck be reflected from dew wetted glistening spar taut rigging polished brass glass about deck fitting skylight misty light now revealed to that be in very heart of fleet numbering two hundred fifty sail most of be at anchor many with canvas more le snugly stowed there be few

hope that with rising of moon at event before turn of tide little breeze might spring up must obviate necessity of letting go mud hook with attendant loss of time expenditure of labour in getting again making sail once more be soon evident that hope be to be realised for moon have scarcely be above horizon hour when narrow dark line appeared stretching along horizon beneath gradually widening until at length very pretty little easterly breeze reached under influence of heeling slightly coquettishly away from saucy esmeralda began to slip along with scarcely more than ripple at sharp bow at rate of good honest seven knot impelled by most welcome breeze be soon round south foreland off dover where hove to to land pilot in executing manoeuvre passed close under stern of magnificent topsail schooner yacht a large a ourselves with hull painted brilliant white in pale moonlight with snow white canvas made look like beautiful phantom craft be getting under way have just tripped anchor be canting to southward when rounded to under stern noticed mr robert chief mate looking long admiringly at a gathered way swinging fore yard glided swiftly yet with stately movement out from among crowd of craft by be surrounded turning away at last a if regretfully from contemplation of noble vessel robert stamped foot impatiently striding up to pilot demanded say mr pilot be there chance of mate of yours catching sight of signal to night think ye be keeping lookout from between blanket pilot whose perfect calmness indifference be in ludicrous contrast to mate impatience turned slowly round eyed questioner deliberately from top to toe before deigned to answer will be alongside in le than minute mister be shut in behind billy boy just now ah here come lay aft here one of shouted mate stand by with line for boat will come below take glass of wine glass of grog before go ashore pilot asked thank sir have objection be response be just turning away toward saloon companion when mate stepped quietly up to said suppose may a well rig out stu'nbeail boom ready for making sail a soon a pilot have left will be pity not to make most of fair wind while last certainly replied somewhat unwillingly for truth to tell thought must be quite time enough to hurry when poor mother have gone ashore be on other side of bill of portland robert however evidently regarded matter from very different standpoint from occupied perhaps be anxious already to show off ship pace for ere have time to reach companion voice rang out loud clear lay aft here of lad rouse out stu'nbeail gear rest of

begun to pack sail upon now there be straight ahead of with mainsheet eased well off gigantic balloon topsail over huge mainsail immense square sail set forward with larboard studding sail spread skimming away swiftly easily a wreath of summer mist over smooth surface of channel water remained on deck until midnight when giving second mate word of caution not to carry canvas too long in event of breeze freshening however gave indication of doing retired below turned in with gratifying feeling be now own master be working for must henceforth reap direct benefit of own labour skill such a latter might be that in fact fortune be in own hand to make mar a be in hand of young man sound of scrubbing brush a be set to work at four bell six o'clock next morning awoke hastily donning such

morning sir responded with equal geniality now then sodgers stand clear of hose if want ducking serve right tom will take warning perhaps next time give flyer sir oh mean yacht well of course have pull of in light weather such a have have through night will bet hat that yonder schooner e'er yacht now happens to be away there inside island must look at in good honest to'gallant breeze wait bit sir little hooker have have chance yet to show what can do there be breeze coming by by if be judge of sky away there to east'ard then after have touched at weymouth hauled out again into wake of

although be of clear pale primrose hue have that peculiar indescribable hardness of tint to experienced eye be sure forerunner of good wholesome breeze breeze however be yet to come wind at moment being very paltry little more than sufficient indeed to keep heavier canvas asleep to send barque along at speed of about five knot water be perfectly smooth save of course for ripple caused by light breeze so far a swell be concerned there be absolutely none ship pitching rolling perceptibly in due course passenger made appearance on deck in high glee at favourable condition of weather full of compliment a to comfort of sleeping cabin indeed be not difficult to judge by fresh cheerful look that have enjoyed sound undisturbed night rest even poor lady desmond be looking incomparably more bright cheerful than have be case with short day previously be already beginning to speak hopefully of possible recovery a day wore on wind instead of freshening a have expected from indication at sunrise grew more more paltry so that be rather late on in afternoon ere reached weymouth weather however have be undergoing slow subtle change day when at length rounded to backed esmeralda mainyard in roadstead sky away to eastward be overspread by broad bank of dirty grey vapour reaching almost to zenith mare tail have increased in number become more strongly defined thin veil of scarcely perceptible vapour be sweeping steadily athwart blue horizon to eastward too have become overcast so much so indeed a to completely obscure saint alban head wind be beginning to freshen in fitful puff small surge occasionally combed broke into miniature white cap of indicated with sufficient clearness that long expected breeze be close at hand that moreover must probably have quite a much of a wanted accordingly lost time in lowering gig getting mother belonging into when shoved off leaving ship in charge of mr robert stretched out for harbour mother seemed good deal cut up now that moment of parting have drawn so very near poor soul spent most of short time during be traversing space between ship harbour with head on shoulder cry softly fondling disengaged hand in hers while a for be like most sailor sadly wanting in eloquence must think of nothing better more encouraging to say than be at last really starting out to seek fortune that fully intended to find ere returned to ah how little guessed at hardship suffering in store for anxiety anguish of mind that dear mother be to endure before two must meet again landing at flight of boat step near inner end of pier put mother baggage into first fly presented kissed dozen time said good bye hurriedly tore away springing hastily into stern sheet of gig with final wave of hand a dear soul drove away give way men exclaimed huskily breeze be freshening fast care not how soon be once more on board esmeralda breeze be indeed freshening fast thick weather have crept down coast until high land about burning cliff be only dimly visible a dashed out past end of pier water in bay be flecked with white esmeralda with royal clewed up be halfway across toward portland road robert be evidently keeping sharp lookout for

robert be evidently in ecstasy at ship behaviour flushed cheek sparkling eye quick restless movement told that must have bitten tongue out rather than have suffered to be betrayed into remark must possibly be construed into fishing for compliment be truly amusing to watch heroic effort made to simulate cool indifferent demeanour be plain enough that be hungering for word of praise to ship that have learned to love a though be flesh of flesh bone of bone so hastened to gratify good fellow by eulogising a indeed must with most perfect honesty marvellous weatherly quality speed of ship a also stiffness with stood up under big spread of canvas have not done so verily believe that reputation a seaman must have shrunk very materially in chief mate estimation instead of increasing a immediately did wind being dead fair for run out of channel took departure from bill of portland packing studding sail upon willing little barkie passed ushant at four o'clock next morning truly wonderful run then patent log showed that have be travelling at rate of fair honest fifteen knot from moment that dropped that useful machine overboard off bill magnificent breeze followed up for next four day carried into latitude of madeira almost unprecedented performance must not be forgotten that be blowing whole gale from eastward time well over larboard quarter allowing thread of canvas to draw to perfection finding that barque carried canvas superbly simply let robert have way with although must admit that never before in experience have seen craft so boldly driven then on evening of fifth day out from weymouth wind rapidly dwindled away to nothing left rolling heavily on steep swell followed concluded that have run into doldrums horse latitude that must now probably have calm light baffling air until fell in with trade wind on going below to turn in at midnight observed that very decided fall of barometer have taken place therefore returned to deck for moment cautioned second mate whose watch be to keep sharp lookout for sign of decided change in weather gave strict injunction to call immediately that indication of such change must become apparent have thought of remaining on deck hour two longer to personally watch development of event reflecting have be out of berth for last eighteen hour that if be to have bad weather might be time before must have opportunity to sleep decided to go below get what rest must especially a sky be at time perfectly clear with star shining brilliantly sailor soon get into habit of falling asleep moment head touch pillow be exception to rule although newly assumed responsibility caused perhaps to sleep more lightly than before at event have even in short time that have be at sea acquired faculty of being cognisant of almost everything happened on deck even during time be asleep on particular night seemed to that have not be in berth more than ten minute though time be actually close upon two hour when second mate quietly descending saloon staircase in moment knuckle be cautiously tapping at door of cabin ay ay answered drowsily what be mr forbes sorry to disturb sir be reply there seems to be something brewing away down there to south'ard west'ard be a black a wolf mouth thereaway there be nasty cross swell getting up a may feel for sir right returned rolling reluctantly out of berth will be on deck in minute be a good a word upon popping head outside companion came to conclusion have be called none too soon there be absolutely not breath of air stirring save created by heavy flapping of canvas a ship rolled with quick uneasy motion almost gunwale to upon interrogating helmsman learned that have lost command over vessel for fully hour be a second mate have said intensely dark down in south western quarter very brief observation sufficed to demonstrate that pall of cloud hid heaven in direction be slowly steadily spreading toward zenith star after star being blotted out even a watched air too be close oppressive a breath of oven while surface of sea be unusually agitated run seeming to come from point of compass at once to meet under ship causing to wallow so awkwardly that water tumbled in over rail in direction now forward now aft anon in waist on side with utmost impartiality water be everywhere of inky blackness save along ship bend where dipped in over rail disturbed water looked at short distance a though have be diluted with milk examined closely be found to glow with faint fire like glimmer of summer lightning with small star like point of stronger light thickly scattered through most perfect silence reigned outside ship on board there be quite small babel of sound storming about creaking of yard parrels truss aloft mingled with loud flap of canvas to roll of ship cheep of block sheaf sharp slatting of suddenly tautened gear pattering of reef point while on deck there be monotonous swish of water washing athwart plank from side to side with choking gurgle of water spouting up through scupper heavy splashing sound of brine a poured in over bulwark whole set to dismal accompaniment of creaking timber rattling door breaking crockery below how long have weather be like mr forbes asked a subordinate stood few pace apart from waiting to hear what have to say about aspect of thing in general well sir replied be not very easy question to answer have be gathering ever since about hour after went below change have be going on so imperceptibly that scarcely forced upon attention until just before ah did hear that sir low faint weird moaning sound scarcely perceptible have floated to ship causing mate to interrupt suddenly at same moment light evanescent puff of hot air seemed to sweep past yes said heard felt be going to have heavy squall if nothing worse out of blackness yonder turn hand up at once let go to work to strip ship without loss of time get in light flying kite first of stow snugly then brail in mizzen stow let

water washed to fro athwart deck with roll of ship must have be utterly impossible to have moved from spot to spot save by aid of one memory of various locality about ship period of perhaps twenty minute have elapsed since retirement of watch below at conclusion of labour have stolen on tiptoe to skylight doubtless influenced to stealthy mode of progression by profound silence of night for purpose of again consulting barometer swung therein when felt heavy drop of tepid water fall upon face be followed by then with roar of cataract down came rain in perfect deluge thrashing surface of sea into expanse of ghostly lambent phosphorescent white that quickly spread apparently to extreme limit of horizon filling deck so rapidly that became necessary to open port fore aft in order to free deluge lasted for about five minute when ceased a abruptly a have begun even that short time have sufficed to beat sea down so smooth that previous violent rolling of ship be reduced to gentle scarcely perceptible oscillation now stand by to let run fore main topsail halliard cried command be responded to by prompt ay ay sir from forecastle pattering of bare foot upon deck sound of rope falling smartly on planking a halliard fall be lifted off pin flung to deck how be head inquired of helmsman west west sir be reply man starboard fore main brace mr forbes said to second mate who be standing by break of poop peering anxiously into impenetrable gloom ay ay sir starboard fore main brace lad be smart now lay yard fore aft before squall break upon men who be evidently uneasy anxious to be doing anything rather than spend time in passive anticipation sprang to brace hauled yard smartly round to cheery yo heave ho flattening in until must get more well there belay commanded forbes

sound of second mate voice turned saw dead astern thin streak of ghostly white drawn horizontally across curtain of stygian darkness in quarter line lengthened broadened with amazing rapidity presently low moaning sound became audible let run topsail halliard fore aft cried command be instantly followed by creaking of parrels a yard slid down well greased topmast scream of block sheaf a fall rapidly overhauled moaning sound grew louder a band of spectral white astern extended approached presently with deafening shriek hurricane struck line of white foam at same instant sweeping past at railway speed stroke of blast be like blow from something solid causing ship to quiver from stem to stern then gathered way with bow buried deep in milk white water drove ahead like frightened sentient thing have never witnessed so fierce squall before in latitude outfly be indeed a violent a anything have ever seen in tropic there be nothing for to let ship scud luckily did in splendid style gathering way quickly steering like little boat otherwise firmly believe that first stroke must have dismasted air be so full of scud water for salt taste of on lip one must have thought be

of ship short of putting under bare pole now be left to be to trust in mercy of god staunchness of spar rigging first mad fury of squall lasted for only five minute after that still continued to blow so fiercely that be compelled to scud for fully three hour before dared venture to round to then having first with great difficulty clewed up furled fore topsail watched opportunity taking advantage of momentary lull put helm over brought ship to on starboard tack now for first time have opportunity of realising full strength of wind still blew with such violence a to careen ship gunwale to even

up to level of horizon stood out with tolerable distinctness swell meanwhile be rapidly rising there be a yet wave wind instantly catching inequality in surface of water carrying away to leeward in form of spindrift lasted until daybreak when strength of gale have so far moderated that despite fact of wind having backed to southward ventured to set fore topsail close reefed more however for sake of steadying ship than for other advantage expected to get from with sky cleared when passenger came on deck before breakfast have to novel experience of witnessing hard gale of wind under cloudless blue sky with brilliant sunshine truly be grand exhilarating scene met gaze for wind though still blew with force of whole gale have so far moderated fury a to permit sea to rise now staunch little ship heeling to covering board be gallantly breasting huge billow of mid atlantic wave deep blue liquid hill half a high a fore yard crested with ridge of snow white foam caught up blown into spray by gale produced endless procession of mimic rainbow past ship a crest of wave struck weather bow burst into drenching shower of silvery spray rainbow formed there too overarching ship in wake of foremast causing whole forepart of to glow glitter with loveliest prismatic hue a day wore on gale continued to moderate somewhat until by noon fury have become so far spent that thought might venture to once more get course on ship be accordingly done when watch be called effect of large area of sail upon craft be tremendous causing to heel like yacht under heavy press of canvas ay to travel like yacht too notwithstanding heavy sea be running little beauty behaved superbly luffing to comber a approached taking in blinding shower of diamond spray be true still with easy buoyant movement such a have never experienced before be first opportunity have be afforded of testing barque behaviour in heavy weather be more than pleased at result for not only proved to be superb sea boat also travelled like racehorse by four bell in afternoon watch wind sea have so far moderated that mate whose watch then be gave order to take small pull upon topsail halliard to set jib to haul out mizzen when last of operation be undertaken be found that something have jammed aloft so that head of sail must not haul out along gaff hand be sent up to see what be foul to clear man have accomplished task be just swinging off gaff into lower rigging when be observed to pause gaze intently to windward well what be matter bill do see anything unusual away there to wind'ard to set staring like owl in ivy bush demanded mate somewhat impatiently yes sir there be something away over there replied man pointing with hand that look like dismasted ship craft on beam end whatever be be very low in water sea be breaking very heavily over mate said more swung into mizzen rigging made way a far aloft a cross tree when turned bracing against masthead directed glance toward part of horizon indicated by seaman shading eye with hand looked steadily for full minute then said something to man beside when latter nimbly descended ratline to deck explaining that mr robert want glass sir went to companion where instrument always hung in becket secured took aloft to mate with assistance still more prolonged examination be made when be at length completed two men returned to deck together well mr robert what do make of inquired a mate having restored telescope accustomed place joined near break of poop well sir there be something away there to windward be reply what be must very well make out sea be breaking so heavy over sometimes have look of dismasted waterlogged ship then again take look of craft on beam end with yardarm just showing above water once twice thought must catch glimpse of something like attempt to make signal by waving white cloth something of sort may have be only glancing of flying foam in sunshine how did bear when be aloft inquired broad on weather beam answered robert how far distant do judge to be about matter of nine mile must say suppose will be taking look at sir most certainly said will stand on for quarter of hour so when will go about if think must then be able to fetch meanwhile may a well run ensign up to peak to let people on board if there be know that have seen yes sir assented robert must think that in time ought to have head reached far enough to fetch will get small drag at topsail halliard will bear inch two very well agreed away trundled sympathetic robert forward to muster hand extra inch two of topsail that proposed to give resolved into liberal two foot of hoist under augmented canvas barque bounded from sea to sea like mad thing completely burying lee rail with roll causing gale to fairly howl through rigging when recovered while whole acre of dazzling snow white foam hissed stormed roared out from under lee bow glanced past side at what looked like railway speed when stooped to under influence of wind wave together spray meanwhile flying over weather cat head in such perfect deluge that whole fore deck be knee deep in water while foresail be drenched halfway up to yard even weather clew of mainsail came in for liberal share to leeward shroud sagged limp loose at roll of ship while to windward be a taut a bar be by mean without apprehension contemplated possibility of lanyard parting bolt drawing under tremendous strain to be subjected truly be driving little ship in most reckless fashion for presence of mysterious object to windward be undoubtedly hull of ship to possibly helpless crew be clinging in deadly peril must have shortened sail forthwith for aught knew question of rescue rescue might be matter of minute even of second with distressed one therefore carried on took chance of everything bearing strain at expiration of allotted half hour hand be called taking wheel watching for smooth proceeded to 'bout ship manoeuvre be successfully accomplished though by mean without danger ship while head to wind taking green sea over bow literally filled deck fore aft washing of men off foot compelling everybody to cling for life to whatever must lay hold of until open port partially freed strange to say beyond flooding of forecastle deck house galley damage be done next sea met happening to be moderate one nimble little craft be round away upon other tack before must come on board once round fairly on move again upon being relieved at wheel took telescope ascended to foretop upon visit of inspection yes there object be sure enough about three point on lee bow a mate have said about nine mile distant tried to get peep at through telescope even at moderate elevation of foretop plunging rolling motion of ship be so wild that found most difficult managed however to catch occasional momentary glimpse of from what then saw came to conclusion that be dismasted craft of five hundred ton so floating very deep in water with sea breaking heavily constantly over that there be flag of sort flying from stump of mizzenmast doubt signal of distress seemed to be craft with full poop after part of standing somewhat higher out of water than rest of hull once twice caught glimpse of what have appearance of small group of people clinging about stump of mizzenmast more than must not just then make out owing a have said to exasperatingly wild motion aloft have at least ascertained important fact that with careful attention to helm must fetch on present tack with be compelled to be for nonce satisfied be evidently nearing very fast much faster than have dared to hope for upon return to deck after somewhat protracted investigation found that have risen from deck hand be intently watching for glimpse of time that rose to crest of sea notwithstanding deluge of spray that flew incessantly in over weather bow passenger be of course intensely excited interested sympathetic at idea of real genuine wreck possibility of rescue even lady emily seeming to have utterly forgotten ailment in anxiety to see a much a possible to credit however be said be considerate enough to abstain from tormenting with ridiculous question evidently realising have at moment more important matter occupying thought truly have for there be question of how people if be to be taken off wreck for must not be forgotten hard a be driving ship be still blowing with force of quite strong gale while sea be so tremendously heavy that though boat moderately loaded must undoubtedly live in if once fairly launched task of safely launching getting away from ship in such weather still more in getting alongside to ship to unship people presented so many difficulty a almost to amount to impossibility fortunately boat be fitted with most excellent pattern of patent releasing tackle for must not have felt justified in risking life of men by asking to undertake such desperate task a to possibility of wreck being able to lower boat thought presented only to be instantly dismissed for with sea breaking so heavily over a have seen be to last degree improbable that of boat have so far escaped damage a to be capable of floating even have escaped total destruction true there be bare possibility that strait of on wreck might not be quite so desperate a have appeared to to be in case must stand by until weather moderated sufficiently to render operation of launching boat comparatively safe one be very doubtful of wreck have presented appearance of being waterlogged absolutely in sinking condition in case there must be little time to lose for even if craft be only waterlogged people be constantly exposed to danger of being washed overboard point however must soon be made plain for be rapidly approaching wreck time have arrived for to commence preparation mr robert meanwhile have be forward talking to men presently came aft again to poop wearing very gratified expression of countenance be downright good lot lad of ours for'ard began a ranged up alongside of in wake of mizzen rigging have just be on fo cbe'le to find out what idea be about manning boat 'd hardly have chance to mention matter when man jack of 'em gave to understand that be ready to do anything choose to ask that 'd only to say who 'd have to go in boat with so have picked joe murray tom spearman little dick hairy bill a call in fo cbe'le if be agreeable sir will take whaleboat gig be a light a cork far away prettiest boat for sea like other gig must hold man two more perhaps be much heavier boat flat starned craft be not half so safe a double ended boat when come to running before such sea a fully agree with mr robert said be very much obliged to for readiness to take command of boat let two hand lay aft at once see that everything require be in get ready for lowering rest of men can set to work to haul up course take in jib brail in spanker will heave to drop a close to windward of wreck a can with safety then will fill round to again close under stern very good sir be response robert turned away forthwith to prepare for work of rescue a rapidly decreased distance between ourselves wreck became unmistakably clear that situation of on board be frightfully critical that if be to be saved time must be wasted craft be wooden english built barque of between five hundred six hundred ton register with full poop seemed from little must see of to be very fine handsome vessel three mast a well a jib boom be gone from stump of mizzenmast red ensign be flying union down while wreck of spar raffle of sail rigging be floating along starboard lee side in wild swirl of foam bulwark be swept clean away on side from catheads a far aft a poop only stump of staunchion remaining here there to show where have be have like short topgallant forecastle under windlass be housed structure remained intact deck house abaft foremast between main hatch have be swept entirely away with exception of sill still remained bolted to deck long boat also be almost invariably stowed on top of main hatch be gone not even chock remaining to show where have be in short whole of deck forward of poop have be cleared of everything removable only thing remaining above level of deck being gallows stump of main fore mast fife rail pump front of poop be stove in poop ladder be gone there be boat on gallows while boat hanging in lee davit have have bottom torn out of have hung at weather davit only stem stern post remained be floating broadside on to sea be very deep in water so deep indeed that wave swept completely over maindeck in perfect smother of foam rolled so horribly that momentarily expected to see turn bottom up moreover that there be very considerable quantity of water in hold be made painfully manifest by sickening sluggishness of movement in response to heave of sea there seemed to be scarcely particle of life left in many of sea running completely over forepart of before must lift to to make matter still worse appeared to have heavy list to starboard a though cargo whatever might be have shifted on poop stood seven foot higher than maindeck matter be not quite so bad deck fitting such a skylight etcetera remaining intact although much of glass have be smashed wheel remained entire a drew nearer must see wildly spinning round now to port now to starboard a sea acted on rudder there be ten men clustered in part of wreck six of whom be crouching under lee of skylight while four have lashed to stump of mizzenmast be of course drenched to skin sea breaking over constantly of be clad only in shirt trouser seeming to indicate that have turned out hurriedly a drew close up to pitiful victim of relentless power of wind sea saw movement of sort among figure crouching under lee of skylight presently watching opportunity retreated aft one two to wheel grating one to standard of binnacle others to position where must secure from being washed overboard by grasping ringbolts bollard like revealing whole length of skylight on panelling of be inscribed in chalk be fast sinking for god sake take off quickly be able to read distinctly through own binoculars sooner made out than jumped on to top of hen coop grasping mizzen rigging with one hand waved other encouragingly to response being feeble cheer at moment sir edgar desmond who with rest of party have be absorbed spectator of everything passed stepped quickly to side fairly panting with excitement said captain if there be anything can do to assist in matter will take a very especial favour if will command thank very much sir edgar replied know that can help very materially at present unless a saw look of deep disappointment come into eye must kindly produce bottle two of remarkably fine port have warmed ready for poor fellow when rather if get on board have be exposed for hour at least to wind sea say no more dear fellow interrupted understand perfectly away went highly delighted at finding have power of doing something however little toward succouring poor wretch whose pitiable condition be so patent to meanwhile sail have be shortened on board esmeralda to topsail fore topmast staysail gig have be prepared for lowering everybody be at station be ready for lowering mr robert asked a sir edgar left on charitable errand ready sir be prompt response in with then into gig lad said must leave to act a think best mr robert in matter of getting alongside wreck there seems to be small clear space just abaft mizzen channel if can reach without getting under counter if fail in only alternative can see be for to get a close a can to wreck lee quarter let people jump overboard when must look out for pick up ay ay sir answered mate cheerily have plan that think will do ready sir whenever be be now within hundred foot of wreck heading so a to cross stern at about distance back main topsail lad round in smartly upon weather brace said so well there take turn be ready to fill again when give word now mr forbes be ready with davit tackle ready sir then when give word let run smartly evenly mr robert will attend to share of work now stand by tackle fall have time previously be taken off proper pin except for single half turn carefully laid out along deck so a to insure running out clear after have be placed under contiguous pin in spider band of mizzenmast single turn taken with thus enabling second mate to hold in hand sustain entire weight of gig crew now a gave caution to stand by at same time stepped on to hen coop in wake of mizzen rigging to watch for favourable opportunity for lowering took off turn round belaying pin held boat by mere main strength grip of rope on pin be by time fair across stern of wreck within hundred foot of with not much way on be ready to drop gig at moment notice perfect mountain of sea at moment came sweeping down upon a buoyant little craft floated up steep side started upon heavy lee roll saw must swing gig well clear of side at same time dip almost into water before tackle be started must scarcely get more favourable opportunity lower away prompt at word second mate allowed fall to run rapidly out while chief sitting in stern sheet with yoke line in one hand grasped releasing line in other a barque careened to gunwale light boat swung far out from side in moment splashed into water at same instant smart pull upon releasing line freed from tackle fore aft a mate sheered with rudder toward wreck men tossed out oar with cheer gave way fill main topsail cried up with helm man let gather way a barque drew away diagonally to windward of wreck lost sight of boat behind lee quarter of latter began to turn attention to problem of getting people on board own ship of hoisting gig once more to davit if possible after have fulfilled present mission sailor duty constantly brings face to face with difficult problem among there be perhaps few more difficult though of course many of infinitely greater importance than of successfully picking up hoisting boat have be launched in very heavy sea such a be running upon occasion so violent be motion of esmeralda that to have brought boat alongside of actually in contact with hull must have simply be to invite instant destruction of smaller craft yet be of considerable importance that boat must be recovered since there be knowing how soon service might be required again problem be how to do here previous experience be of service to a have never before seen boat launched in anything like such heavy weather a of moment so a drew off from wreck prepared to tack gave matter little thought soon hit upon plan thought must answer purpose few minute sufficed to place in proper position relative to wreck for tacking having got ship round gone to leeward of wreck hove to again with mainyard aback at once proceeded to put idea into practice whip from lee fore main yardarm with standing bowline in end of depending from mainyard with hauling line attached to be that required after have davit tackle overhauled to extremest limit with stout rope end bent on to fall just inside sheave so that tackle block must reach quite to water even when ship be taking heaviest weather roll meanwhile robert in gig be faring capitally have succeeded in getting up stern on close under lee quarter of wreck with line from to boat down line people be passing pretty rapidly men keeping line taut while by tugging away steadily at oar occasionally one little bolder than fellow must leap overboard when robert one of boat crew be always ready to seize by collar drag into boat everything seemed to be going on with utmost regularity one man whom took to be skipper of wreck evidently superintending affair on deck while robert be attending in boat yet be easy to see that not moment be being lost one man being sooner safe in boat than started to follow indeed there be evidently utmost need for haste for wreck be visibly settling before eye sea making cleaner breach over her than last while there be occasion when be absolutely buried fore aft in wild smother of white water nothing of showing above turmoil save stump of spar small portion of poop skylight davit with fragment of boat hanging from on one of occasion boat in starboard davit that one already mentioned a having have bottom torn out be completely demolished nothing of remaining when buried hulk once more rose to surface when be likely to happen people on board wreck warned by skipper clung for dear life to whatever must first lay hold of while in gig similarly warned letting go rope pulled out of reach of smother only to back smartly up again moment danger be past at length one man only skipper remained on wreck saw pause for moment glance round at poor shattered labouring relic of ship have so proudly out of harbour probably not very long before on board have perhaps successfully battled with wind wave for many year then drawing hand across eye to clear maybe of brine have be dashing into for last few eventful hour more probably to brush away tear of regret at dismal ending of voyage be doubt hopefully begun finally waving signal to robert placed hand above head poising for instant dived headlong into raging sea breathless moment of suspense then saw robert lean over boat quarter grasp something struggle with finally diver form appeared on gunwale be dragged safely into boat at moment towering billow reared just beyond labouring hull sweeping down upon green solid with curling crest of hissing snow white foam men in gig fortunately saw too in time with warning shout to other stretched out to oar for dear life on swept that hissing mountain of angry water heaving wreck up on steep side until lay along upon presenting deck perpendicularly to then a broke over in roaring cataract of foam saw upper side of deck inclining more more toward until over went altogether nothing of showing above white water save stern post heel of rudder for fraction of moment appeared thus copper on glistening wet green in light of declining sun then crest of wave interposed between hid from view when few second later great wave reached soared upward to crest wreck have vanished nothing remaining great patch of foam curious swirling of water surface to show where good ship have be meanwhile gig now deep in water be making best of way down to freely confess that when saw that huge wave chasing gave up everybody in a lost boat close proximity to wreck however probably proved salvation for fury seemed to have be spent in completing destruction of ship before must gather strength again have swept harmlessly past boat equally harmlessly down upon few minute later little craft oh what frail cockleshell looked in midst of mountainous sea swept close under stern splendidly handled by robert came to under lee end of two whip be smartly hove into boat caught robert instantly comprehending intention lost not moment in putting into effect barque with main topsail aback with fore topsail fore topmast staysail full be forging very slowly ahead just sufficiently so to enable in gig to sheer well away from ship side when towed along by whip from fore yardarm while with aid of whip hauling line from main yardarm be able to get rescued people quickly safely out of boat in upon own deck where boat now demanding most unremitting attention turned over to willing hand of sir edgar desmond party woman finding impelled by sympathy to take active part in reception of poor half drowned fellow own lad worked intelligently with will in shorter time than take to tell of everybody be safely out of boat except chief mate two smartest men have in ship be now ready to make attempt to hoist in boat tackle fall be accordingly manned by hand except two who stood by with running part in hand ready to drop into boat at proper moment while in mizzen rigging keeping keen watch upon sea superintended whole boat be now sheered a close alongside a be prudent to bring two men in stood by one forward other aft to catch block slip clutch into position robert meanwhile attending to nothing steering of boat at length a ship took terrific weather roll gig seemed to settle in almost under bottom gave word to heave tackle block be dropped handsomely into hand of men waiting to catch in instant clutch be dashed into socket click of bolt reaching ear distinctly two men simultaneously flung up hand to show that delicate operation have be successfully accomplished that boat be fast ship have by time recovered be now nearly upright in performance of correspondingly heavy lee roll round in upon tackle lad for life shouted at word slack be taken in like lightning strain coming upon tackle exactly at right moment namely when ship be pausing instant at steepest angle of lee roll prior to recovering now up with men a smartly a like in instant boat within six foot of davit head be jerked out of water before ship have recovered sufficiently to dash frail craft against side be swinging clear of danger in proper position to triumphant shout of two block from men at fall to secure gallant little craft in gripe be work of few minute only after mainyard be swung sail be made upon ship resumed voyage deeply thankful that effort to rescue fellow being in moment of dire extremity have be crowned with such complete success chapter six tragedy on board city of calcutta men have just rescued be destitute of everything save clothes brought on board on back be of course saturated with salt water therefore became necessary to supply with new rig from content of ship slop chest first business while unfortunate be being stripped vigorously rubbed down under sir edgar personal superintendence afterwards liberally dosed with of mulled port be to clear out deck house forward get bunk ready for reception being naturally very greatly exhausted by long hour of exposure that have be called upon to endure baronet with warm hearted kindness delicate consideration have already discovered to be characteristic of have after consulting obtaining permission caused one of spare state room in saloon to be cleared out prepared for captain once warm snug in berth saw more of of rescued men until next day next morning at breakfast skipper put in appearance introducing a captain baker late of barque wanderer of london a meal proceeded told story of disaster have befallen appeared that like have be becalmed on previous night like baker have retired at midnight without however having noticed fall in mercury have given first warning of coming blow on top of oversight officer of watch have made fatal mistake of supposing that change when made apparent meant nothing more serious than working up of thunderstorm have therefore contented with clewing up royal hauling down flying jib after have awaited outburst with equanimity when therefore came be utterly unprepared ship be caught aback with topgallantsails upon hove down upon beam end be bad enough to make matter worse be loaded with iron upon being laid over cargo shifted watch below of course at once sprang on deck under poor baker supervision everything be possible be promptly done to get ship upon foot again to purpose at length finding that craft be shipping great deal of water order be reluctantly given to cut away mast be easily accomplished by cutting through lanyard of rigging to windward when mast went by own weight thus relieved ship partially recovered still have heavy list to starboard be floating so deep that water constantly washed over deck a far a lee coaming of hatchway a rolled pump be then manned after hour hard work be found that water be full foot deeper in hold than have be when pump be started be therefore conjectured that ship have suffered very serious strain when thrown upon beam end that violent shifting of cargo in hold have started butt still pump be kept going in hope that leak might suddenly stop a leak have sometimes be known to do without apparent reason meanwhile sea have be rapidly getting up soon began to break heavily over dismasted ship be now rolling so violently that combined with heavy list became almost impossible to move about deck leeward inclination of soon grew so steep that men have to be lashed to pump to save from falling being washed overboard at length tremendously heavy sea swept over ship from stem to stern carrying away whole of bulwark smashing deck house long boat to piece carrying two boat off gallows tearing boom adrift staving in front of poop cabin worst of killing four men who be working at pump captain baker now abandoned hope of saving ship gave order to prepare boat for launching now full measure of disaster became for first time known for upon proceeding to investigate a well a must in pitchy darkness be found that absolutely have not boat left capable of floating fact once ascertained hand beat retreat to cabin there to consult together in such shelter a afforded regarding most desirable step to be taken be soon found however that sea surged into cabin in such overwhelming deluge that ran utmost risk of being drowned if remained there be therefore compelled to turn out again seek for safety on poop there day dawn found shivering with cold wet to skin drenched moment by pelting pitiless sea hungry thirsty hopeless when once have have opportunity of seeing condition of battered hull supported be fully able to realise absolute impossibility of doing anything to help must not even build raft for scrap of movable timber having be swept away during darkness of night true there be wreck of spar still alongside if ship must remain afloat until weather moderated something might possibly be done with not until then so must only crouch there on wet exposed poop with sea washing continuously over raw wind penetrating saturated clothing hope dubiously that ship might heave in sight in time to save thus remained until took off at gale broke wind moderated came out from eastward by midnight be once more bowling along upon course under royal next morning when went on deck found that robert have be busy during whole of watch getting studding sail set in short proved that have now caught trade ran to within degree half of line then left in glassy calm sweltering under scorching ray of tropical sun breeze left during night when day broke large full rigged ship be discovered within about seven mile of a soon a be light enough to see hoisted ensign a drooped in motionless fold from peak must only discern that colour be red from circumstance build of ship arrived at conclusion that be british of course showed ensign in return a there be wind to blow out flag be useless to attempt exchanging number otherwise indulging in little sea conversation therefore dismissed further thought of pro tem be consequently with little surprise shortly after have seated ourselves at breakfast in saloon received report from mate who happened to be in charge of deck that boat be in sight about three mile distant apparently pulling to from ship now when ship happen to be becalmed within close proximity to other with prospect of calm continuing for hour be not altogether unusual thing for master of one ship to board other for purpose of exchanging little sociable chat learning latest news perhaps leaving letter two to be posted at first port arrived at when ship be becalmed on line be rarely done unless two craft happen to be fairly close together say within mile so because in region light transient air be liable to spring up with very little warning when come everybody be naturally anxious to avail of to utmost a aid toward escape from spot in ship have be known to be imprisoned for a much a month six week at time then again under influence of sun vertical ray important atmospheric change sometimes take place with startling rapidity squall for example working up bursting from cloud in period so astonishingly brief a to afford little more than bare time necessary to prepare for under circumstance therefore ship master be usually very chary about making long boat excursion when becalmed on line novel sensation of anticipated visit probably caused to dally le than usual over morning meal at event when rose from table went on deck boat be still nearly mile distant very curious object looked for weather being stark calm water glassy smooth line of horizon be invisible boat have appearance of hanging suspended in mid air effect be doubtless heightened by extremely rarefied condition of atmosphere also gave rise to effect familiar enough to who have witnessed often before productive of utmost astonishment to passenger who now seemed beheld for first time effect be extraordinary apparent distortion of shape dimension boat underwent appeared to stand a high out of water a five hundred ton ship while breadth remained somewhat about what ought to be thus assuming very much appearance of plank standing on edge men at oar be similarly distorted when upon going on deck eye first rested upon only indication of being in active movement consisted in rapid alternate evanishment reappearance a swung forward backward at oar oar betrayed presence merely by flash of sun upon wet blade fraction of second after flash there appeared on side of boat large square patch of deep ultramarine must have be nothing broken surface of water where cut by oar blade for ripple caused by boat progress through water similarly appeared a heavy line of blue extending on side of boat for certain distance when broke up into series of ever more widely detached diminishing blot of blue curious atmospheric illusion of course grew le marked a boat approached when have neared to within about quarter of mile vanished altogether craft resuming normal everyday aspect at length ranged up alongside of one of lad dropped line into man who have be handling yoke line grizzled tanned weather beaten individual somewhere on shady side of fifty came up over side rest of crew remaining in boat alongside from engaged with own men in usual sailor chat stranger who despite roasting heat be attired in blue cloth trouser waistcoat surmounted by thick pilot jacket whole topped off with blue cloth navy cap adorned with patent leather peak two brass anchor button be received by mate to whom intimated desire to speak with cap'n well man said stepping forward what can do for well sir replied be bobeun see of ship yonder city of calcutta of london cap'n clarke eighty six day out from calcutta bound home to thames be in terrible trouble aboard there bein ' first sail a have sighted since trouble took made so bold a to man gig pull aboard precious long pull 't be too to ask if so be a can help that of course will depend upon nature of trouble replied what be wrong on board well sir see be here way replied man twisting twirling in hand cap have removed from head when began to address cap'n be unfortunately little too fond of rum bottle p'rhaps must be nearer mark to say a be precious sight too fond of be be on drink more le ever since lost sight of land well sir about fortnight ago begin to notice a seemed bit queer in upper story took to talkin ' to hisself a walked poop sometimes 'd march up to man at wheel stare hard at for minute so without sayin ' word then off 'd go again mutterin ' to hisself men did half like at last one of ups speaks to mate about mate be poor mr talbot know sir say all right be got eye on there matter rest for few day time hows'ever skipper be gettin wuss at last take to comin ' on deck along somewhere in middle watch tellin ' first man a can lay hold of there be devil sich in state room givin ' order a watch be to be mustered to go below rouse out after have lasted two three day mate summons mr vine be second mate chip sail to council o ' war in own cabin to get idea upon advisability of stoppin ' skipper grog lockin ' in own cabin until got better again agrees a be best thing to do because see sir when man get into sort o state there be knowin ' what devilment may be up to without givin ' of warnin ' so agreed a must be right thing to do for safety of ship hand promised mate a 'd back up in when arrived home have to answer for hisself to owner well sir nobody know how come about suspect a skipper must have overheard mr talbot mr vine talkin ' about here business a'terwards anyhow get two of 'em by mean into own cabin there shoot dead with revolver killin ' chief mate at first shot woundin ' poor young mr vine badly that poor young feller died only few minute after 'd broke open state room door be locked have got out now sir have be obliged to put cap'n in iron bein ' stark ravin mad see have got nobody to navigate ship thought mayhap chip sail did that learnin ' of trouble might be able to spare somebody to navigate ship home certainly said that can be done for happen to have on board captain mate part of crew of ship be foundering when fell in with have doubt will be glad of opportunity to get home be very dreadful story have told good fellow hope have ample proof of truth because if not may go hard with when reach home may possibly be charged with murder of two officer know with of must captain unfortunately die when did dreadful business happen shootin do mean sir four day ago well if will wait bit will speak to captain baker hear what say to idea of taking charge of ship suppose can find room for crew there be ten of altogether oh yes sir glad to have 'em be short handed when left calcutta now yes yes of course interposed hastily with suggestion that crew must come on deck get breakfast while waiting progress of negotiation stepped aft to wheel grating where captain baker be busy spinning yarn to youngster beckoning aside repeated story have just heard winding up by asking whether felt disposed to undertake duty of navigating ship home a might have be expected be more than willing to take advantage of so favourable opportunity to return home a crew have anything to pack preparation to make for contemplated change be quite ready to leave by time that calcutta people have finished breakfast before left however be privately arranged between captain baker with first breeze came to two craft must close in order might have opportunity of going on board adding signature to declaration that proposed to insert in city of calcutta log book relative to statement made to by boatswain circumstance generally under be assuming command of ship weather be a have already said stark calm with not speck of cloud anywhere within whole visible bound of heaven sea be like glass if have be asked whether there be movement in atmosphere must unhesitatingly have answered yet a robert be careful to indicate to more than once during morning helmsman managed not only to get esmeralda head pointed towards distant ship also to keep pretty steadily in direction be unquestionable fact that done neared at rate of about three quarter of knot per hour state of thing lasted during whole day accordingly when eight bell in afternoon watch struck two ship being at time about mile half apart have gig lowered after carefully instructing chief mate how to proceed in event of breeze unexpectedly springing up pulled on board city of calcutta be noble ship of eighteen hundred ton measurement built of iron with spacious poop aft deck a white a snow fitting of kind of very best double topsail topgallant yard in fact typical modern clipper have accommodation for thirty saloon passenger be luckily carrying none on voyage at least accommodation ladder have be lowered for convenience a gig dashed alongside oar be tossed in captain baker made appearance at gangway to welcome at once led into saloon well said how did find matter on board here on arrival just a might have expected to find after listening to boatswain story be reply poor skipper be undoubtedly mad be in cabin there will take in to see presently within last two hour change seems to have come over before that be dreadfully violent noisy have now calmed down must not be surprised to find that worst of attack be past have not slightest doubt in world that story of having murdered two mate be perfectly true men have examined of separately tell exactly same tale there be confirmatory evidence of certain kind be to say there be blood stain on deck in skipper state room proving that deed be committed there door have be broken in a stated be now in state room with lock still turned key in revolver with murder be committed have three chamber still loaded be splashed with blood showing how close madman be to victim when used weapon last most convincing evidence of there be certain entry in official log book signed talbot chief mate ' particularising captain eccentricity of behaviour one dated four day ago recording consultation held a to propriety of temporarily confining captain clarke to cabin decision arrived at duly signed by of party concerned see here be saying opened closed log book have already noticed lying on table drew attention to entry one after other in consecutive order looked over most carefully be bound to admit that have appearance of being genuine most fortunate circumstance for hand forward that mate took precaution to make entry remarked yes indeed agreed baker now continued opening book at fresh page be entry made shortly before saw pulling on board want to have goodness to confirm statement by appending signature read entry found to consist of brief statement of fact connected with loss of own ship of crew having be taken off sinking wreck by of brief sojourn on board esmeralda of barque having be boarded by boat from city of calcutta of circumstance followed at foot of under captain baker signature added following note hereby certify that above statement be true in particular john saint leger master of british barque esmeralda done accompanied by captain baker entered cabin where madman be confined there saw sight will probably not forget to dying day be one of saloon cabin door of poor fellow own state room having be beaten in by crew in endeavour to rescue mate from clutch be very fine roomy airy well lighted apartment containing two berth sofa folding wash stand large mirror handsome silver plated lamp with ground glass globe brass pole over top of door carrying brass ring from depended crimson curtain lower berth be made up upon lying face downwards be form of stalwart well built man with iron on leg thought for moment that poor fellow be asleep yet a stood gazing upon in silence be suddenly impressed by perfect immobility of figure oppressive silence pervaded cabin let man be sleeping ever so peacefully will notice slight movement due to inspiration expiration of breath there will also be sound of breathing a rule with perhaps occasional sigh faint inarticulate murmur something to tell unmistakably that figure be gazing upon be that of living man here there be nothing of sort circumstance seemed to force upon attention of baker at same moment for suddenly turned gazed inquiringly into other face then reading there reflection of own dreadful suspicion without word simultaneously stepped forward turned figure upon back ghastly truth at once became apparent in unspeakable horror miserable madman have crowned folly wickedness by cutting own throat be sight to turn one sick faint at least have that effect upon doubtless baker felt a did for when turned to look at be white a chalk to very lip for moment stood gazing at other speechless then closely followed by baker staggered out of berth into saloon thence on deck shouting for steward who happened to be forward at galley fellow hurried aft at once evidently prepared by tone of baker voice to find that something be wrong steward inquired baker how long have captain clarke be left to about quarter of hour sir be answer dennis have be looking after sir finding captain quite quiet went forward to get supper with rest asking to keep eye on meanwhile did sir for minute two before gentleman indicating came aboard then when went into saloon took opportunity to step for'ard to arrange with doctor cook about supper for saloon hope nothing have gone wrong sir captain clarke have cut throat be stone dead said baker call dennis aft at once steward hurried away in le than minute man dennis made appearance followed a far aft a mainmast by hand be at once rigorously examined by baker a to condition behaviour of charge reply went to show that when went on watch at eight bell found patient perfectly quiet evidently so at least judged quite unaware of situation surroundings captain said be then seated on sofa in cabin with hand clasped before elbow resting on knee body inclined

do so with perfect safety expression of deepest regret at dreadful thing have happened few of men captain baker two mate boatswain carpenter sailmaker of ship one of able seaman be then conducted into cabin to view body have explained to position when entered so on then entry in official log detailing tragedy became necessary entry also attested by time be getting dark one of men came to saloon door to report that small air of wind be coming down from eastward a therefore business on board city of calcutta be concluded prepared to leave ship nothing now remained to be done to hand baker letter from esmeralda to post on arrival home matter have almost forgotten in excitement induced by dreadful discovery in have participated to bid good bye to late guest done hurried down over side stepped into gig glad to be out of craft on board such horrible tragedy have so recently be enacted ship presented noble picture a left there in swift gathering dusk of calm tropical night long shapely hull taunt spar milk white canvas reflected upon glassy surface of sleeping wave upon oscillated ponderously to long heave of almost imperceptible swell be grievous to think that man quite young man too with best year apparently before who have be deemed worthy trust charge of so fine fabric of costly merchandise that contained must have be so miserably contemptibly weak a to have allowed to be conquered by vile demon of drink life brought to so disastrous shameful close ah pity of pity of breeze have reached esmeralda by time that gig arrived alongside dainty little barque be lying to with mainyard aback waiting for seemed very small in comparison with city of calcutta coming so directly a have done from spacious deck cabin of latter be relief to get away from big ship tragedy of be scene be more than thankful that breeze have come so opportunely to enable to part company with wind after be merest zephyr be very light partial playing about surface of water around in occasional cat paw failing to reach barque altogether so long a fast fading twilight permitted to see while quarter of mile to windward right out to horizon water be quite blue with ripple accordingly braced sharp up luffed way to spot where breeze be steady then bore away upon course rejoicing nimble little barque getting off five knot per hour with ease although wind have scarcely weight enough in to lift heavy cloth of course a night closed down upon however breeze acquired little more life increased pace until at four bell in first watch be reeling off eight knot by log about midnight passed through quite large fleet of craft homeward bound when day dawned seven eight vessel be in sight ahead of steering to southward at eight o'clock that morning crossed line by reckoning breeze holding bravely have opportunity to test sailing power against craft ahead of most exhilarating race resulting in to intense satisfaction of hand on board esmeralda tidy little barque eventually proved victor now must not be supposed that because have abstained from mention of cryptogram since outset of voyage have forgotten about on contrary occupied nearly attention must spare from ordinary business of ship claim of passenger upon so far without slightest useful result when crossed line be just a far from interpretation a have be when first abstracted from place of concealment in sword belt of respected ancestor many hour have spent in privacy of own cabin with precious document outspread upon little folding table secured to bulkhead framing table of letter corresponding with figure of cryptogram trying possible combination must think of not particle of sense must make of indeed have failed to get result that bore even most remote resemblance to anything like language even at last went to length of telling sir edgar lady desmond miss merrivale of difficulty acting upon laughing suggestion of latter that attempt to solve puzzle must be welcome recreation made three copy of first line of document handed one to of in order that might have opportunity of trying wit upon be on day that crossed equator during whole of day when attention be not diverted by overtaking of one of craft in company frequent exchange of signal indeed for many day afterwards devoted with great earnestness gravity to matter ineffectually at length gave up a bad job declared cypher to be untranslatable chapter seven strange fate of northern queen welcome breeze wafted out of neighbourhood of ill starred city of calcutta held good gradually freshening working round more from southward eventually resolved into south east trade under beneficent influence of with larboard tack on board yard braced flat up against starboard rigging merrily wended way to southward one morning when be about in latitude of island of martin vaz trinidad discovered at daybreak large ship broad on weather bow topsail of be just clear of horizon trade be at time blowing fresh barque be thrashing along under main topgallantsail with flying jib stowed sooner however did robert come on deck espy stranger be steering same way a ourselves than must need give order to loose set fore topgallantsail flying jib while be in saloon at breakfast heard give order to set two royal under additional canvas caused little hooker to bury lee side to covering board to plunge to hawse pipe into long ridge of swell came rolling up from southward eastward while sent acre of milk white foam roaring hissing away from under lee bow rapidly overhauled strange sail until have brought square abeam then having allowed to reach position people gallantly responded to obvious challenge made sail until showed precisely same canvas to breeze that did stranger ship rigged be at time about eight mile away from broad on weather beam hull just showing above horizon when rose upon crest of sea after taking good look at through glass came to conclusion that must be vessel of about twelve hundred ton that be remarkably smart craft under canvas soon became evident for though be going eleven half knot by log found impossible to gain inch upon after have got additional canvas fairly set trimmed indeed there be time when seemed impossible to resist conviction that be if anything gaining merest trifle upon if so however be only when breeze came down with little extra strength for so surely a softened at immediately appeared to recover trifle that seemed to have previously lost though be unable to forereach upon big neighbour became evident a morning now wore on that two craft be very gradually nearing other extraordinary weatherly quality of esmeralda coming conspicuously into notice in thrash to windward on taut bowline now that have opportunity of comparing with of vessel at stranger showed colour british upon responding exhibited number from other signal learned that be northern queen of glasgow bound to cape town then followed exchange of latitude longitude ours hers agreeing within mile two before signal flag be finally hauled down stowed away have accomplished quite long conversation to intense delight of passenger especially fairer member to whom sort of thing be still quite novelty thus day wore on bright pleasant hour being whiled away in friendly trial of speed though guessed not be hurrying companion onward to strange sudden awful doom at sun went down in bewildering blaze of gold crimson purple splendour almost simultaneously full orbed moon rose majestically above eastern horizon flooding sea way with liquid silver showing friend northern queen hull up in very heart of dazzle entire fabric hull spar canvas standing out black a ebony silhouette against soft blue grey ivory of cloud dappled sky be at time square upon weather beam with rising of moon breeze acquired new life a often doe came down upon with weight sufficient to render advisable to clew up furl royal did northern queen continuing to carry hers a of course must being much bigger craft than ourselves fitted with much stouter spar be thus enabled to draw gradually ahead of much to chagrin of worthy chief mate who asserted with quite unnecessary vehemence that be absolutely first time that esmeralda have ever be beaten by anything in moderate weather thus came to pas at midnight companion be dead to windward of about seven mile distant lady passenger have retired to berth about hour before sir edgar tempted by beauty cool freshness of night lingered on deck of being shod with rubber soled shoe in order that might not disturb repose of sleeper below be pacing weather side of poop with relating of former adventure a traveller before have settled down a sober steady respectable benedict a laughingly put suddenly a turned in walk within arm length of binnacle became conscious of vivid increase of light at same moment indescribable deep hurtling roar smote upon ear above startled cry of helmsman loud hum of wind in rigging sobbing wash of sea sound light so obviously came from overhead that involuntarily halted directed gaze aloft when became aware of enormous meteor fully four time apparent diameter of moon of such dazzling effulgence that eye must scarcely endure brightness of while whole ship with minutest detail of spar rigging equipment be a brilliantly illuminated a at noonday be passing at very great apparent speed immediately over masthead in south easterly direction leaving long trail of evanescent spark behind a watched must see that be falling toward sea god of mercy ship ship gasped sir edgar clutching arm in grip left mark on skin for day afterward a spoke huge incandescent mass fell full upon hull of northern queen there be flash like of bursting shell on board ere must draw breath stately fabric of spar sail collapsed vanished into deep before eye for second be fore aft so paralysed with horror dismay that not sound escaped lip even weird night music of wind sea appeared to be hushed for moment startled sens failed to note presently there came floating down to upon pinion of breeze muffled booming crash a confirmatory evidence of appalling disaster gone in moment in twinkling of eye ejaculated sir edgar with quivering ashen lip a strained eye toward point so recently occupied by companion oh captain can nothing be done be there hope that out there few survivor at least may be floating on scrap two of wreckage will go there see will not assuredly will said will tack moment think can fetch spot where ship disappeared meanwhile continued to second mate who have charge of deck get up three rocket fire a signal to possible survivor that have observed disaster intend to look for will doubt understand what mean rocket be brought on deck fired by time judged that have gone far enough to justify in tacking ship accordingly went about two hand be then stationed on fore topsail yard to keep lookout for wreckage while third laid out a far a flying jib boom end for same purpose have be on starboard tack three quarter of hour have just hailed lookout warning to be especially vigilant a must now be near scene of catastrophe when man on flying jib boom end cried out with startling suddenness there be something floating out there to wind'ard sir broad on starboard bow yes yes added men aloft with one consent look like something alive like man sir waving arm take eye off for instant either of on account answered with strange thrill in voice at idea of being perhaps close to one more survivor of awful visitation of god that have witnessed back main topsail mr forbes then man lower port quarter boat ay ay be brisk response man weather main brace lad lively now cast off to leeward round in to windward well there belay will take charge of boat sir certainly said be turn time mr forbes hope will be a successful a mr robert be when last have occasion to lower boat will probably not be able to see man when be in boat under way so will stand on wheel grating abaft where will be able to distinctly see will indicate to how to steer in accordance with direction may receive from hand aloft if can only manage to pick up man have seen will perhaps if be still sensible be able to direct how to prosecute further search now if be ready go god speed boat pushed off in le than ten minute have picked up man who be found to be floating comfortably enough in life buoy questioned a to whether thought there be more survivor replied that feared not a feeling sure that catastrophe have be observed by that must make for scene a promptly a possible assurance have be quickly confirmed by sight of rocket have simply clung to life buoy without making slightest effort to shorten distance between believing that best hope of deliverance consisted in remaining a near a possible to scene of disaster that if there be other survivor must most probably act in same way in case must almost certainly have seen heard something of in interim have not be case forbes however very properly pulled about spot for more than hour boat crew shouting at interval then lying on oar listening for reply be of avail for though fell in with picked up two bucket marked with name of northern queen passed through few small fragment of floating wreckage clearly indicating that be prosecuting search in precisely right spot nothing more be found be at length reluctantly constrained to abandon further effort rescued man who when brought on board appeared not atom worse for terrible adventure gave name a joe martin informed that have held rating of carpenter on board ill fated northern queen gave full particular concerning port of registry of ship port from have sailed number of day out number of crew name so far a knew in short information necessary to identification of ship on board then described catastrophe a have impressed upon said that at midnight deck have be relieved in usual manner that being trick at wheel have arrived aft just in time to hear old man captain bid mate good night after laughingly enjoining not to go to sleep allow little barque to leeward to slip past night being fine breeze steady watch on deck with exception of lookout have quickly found snug corner for in have coiled away for quiet cat nap mate have lighted pipe established in skipper wicker armchair perfect peace quiet reigned throughout ship suddenly whole sky seemed to brighten glancing involuntarily over right shoulder from direction light appeared to emanate martin saw meteorite in sky immediately over masthead at same moment became conscious of screaming roar of passage through air moment set eye on said knew felt certain somehow a thing meant to strike shouted to mate to warn then not knowin ' why did let go wheel make spring for life buoy hangin ' at taffr l whippin ' knife out of sheath at same time 'd got hold of buoy edge of knife be on seizin when seemed to a if sun hisself be bearin down on light heat got that dreadful fierce then there came most fearful smash a thing struck fair atween fore main mast cuttin ' ship clean in two if will believe gentleman a knife went through seizin by buoy be lashed to iron rail felt poor old hooker double up together just a if be writhin ' with pain of death wound with holdin ' buoy in hand make single spring overboard next thing know find bein ' sucked down with wreck if will believe gen'lemen seemed year afore felt that dreadful suction let go of found risin ' to top of water again when got there at last caught breath once more seemed to a if single second 'd have ' done for remembers congratulatin ' a water be so warm pleasant breeze same a settled comfortable in middle of buoy then when 'd cleared water out of eye slipped knife back into sheath set to work to look round see if there be anybody else have escaped besides must see nobody while be peerin ' round here there into black hollow between sea catch sight of flash in sky look up fully expectin ' to see o ' awful fire ball be only one o ' rocket burstin ' up aloft lookin ' underneath place when floated up to top of sea there see to'ga'nts'ls upper half of taups'ls understood in minute a 'd obsarved what have happened meant to come see if there be of left then began hailin ' in hope of hearin ' reply from of lad there be sound come to exceptin ' moan of wind hiss of sea round about so at last knew that hand exceptin ' have gone to bottom with good ship leavin ' alone to tell tale what extraordinary class of men sailor be remarked sir edgar a man martin having brought narrative to conclusion being dismissed by turned shambled away forward with usual careless leisurely gait affected by forecastle jack here be man who have just escaped be moreover only survivor of catastrophe absolutely unique must say in naval history yet be a unconcerned undemonstrative over a though destruction of ship by meteorite be quite everyday occurrence be such extraordinary sang froid usual be exceptional example oh dear laughingly replied there be nothing in least unusual in martin demeanour however be doubtless partly assumed be not regarded a quite correct form to exhibit excitement over adventure of one self have be hero apart from that sailor be so accustomed to carry life in hand become so hardened to danger by being constantly brought face to face with often without second warning sometimes in most unexpected shape moreover witness from time to time such startling inexplicable phenomenon that be really difficult to provoke anything like display of genuine unmitigated surprise excitement on part happens unless be something very distinctly suggestive of supernatural jack be always prepared for so must appear assented baronet candidly now captain be not present voyage of ours rather eventful one undoubtedly be replied singularly so thus far man might follow sea life without witnessing so many casualty a have come under notice since sailed yet such casualty be constantly occurring in part of world only remarkable thing about of have become cognisant be that so many must have occurred in so short time within area so small a to have permitted of being in vicinity of just when happened even dreadful occurrence that witnessed to night though be first case of kind ever heard of may be after nothing very unusual in kind may possibly explain loss of many of craft that disappear leave sign behind for instance be safe to say that only human eye witnessed destruction of northern queen be on board ship if have not seen chance be hundred to one fate must never have be known martin prospect of escape must certainly have be remarkably small for although in fine weather might have remained afloat for time might have be passed unnoticed by ship within very short distance then after exposure in water for certain number of hour strength must rapidly fail must die miserably of starvation if did not lose hold upon buoy sink be dragged out of by hungry shark upon word must be uncommonly cheerful companion for nervous man remarked sir edgar half jestingly half in earnest declare will never in future be able to look at man without recalling grim picture have sketched of floating helplessly in life buoy sailor certainly ought to be exceptionally religious men for seems to that not one of not one of of who go down to sea in ship can count with certainty upon life from one minute to just look around now for instance how gentle peaceful be whole aspect of nature at moment how absolutely safe seem to be be just a peaceful just a apparently safe three hour ago yet in interim noble ship whole crew save one have perished what have befallen may befall other ship that float ever will float quite a suddenly quite a unexpectedly hope that what have witnessed to night will enable to realise more fully vividly than ever how completely be in hand of god how absolutely dependent upon mercy good night captain returned salutation a baronet slowly thoughtfully descended companion mechanically turned away began to pace deck with thought busy upon solemn word have just heard occasion have given rise to a did so albeit be perhaps worse than average man carelessness indifference of own conduct in past rose up in judgment against condemned of grossest ingratitude for countless past mercy most shameful disobedience most criminal neglect to render to creator that honour glory be due there then registered solemn vow that from moment must lead new better life vow grieve to say be afterwards far too frequently forgotten on following day after breakfast mr robert informed that martin have asked to be put into watch wished to know whether be willing that arrangement must be made of course have objection to proposal a by mean believe in idle people in forecastle so told mr robert to arrange matter at same time to keep eye on man being intention to regularly ship if proved worth having must be willing to sign article second mate being one hand weaker than larboard watch about week after little edgar desmond came up to slipping hand into mine a be wont when desired to have chat with began in straightforward way usual with child captain where do think will be good place for to sail boat when be finished boat said did know that be making one oh said child be not making one be that new man martin who be making for be making so nicely just like real boat come see will willing to humour child walked forward with on reaching forecastle found martin busy about ordinary job connected with usual routine work of ship a halted before touched forehead with forefinger in usual style of forecastle hand paused in work to hear what have to say to good morning martin began master edgar have brought captain to see boat will show please well see sir remonstrated martin obviously embarrassed by presence 'tai hardly fair to ask to hexhibit boat until be finished there ai much of yet what there be be all in rough be little job sir continued turning in explanatory way to a have undertook to do for young gentleman in afternoon watch below a said be in rough at present what there be of never mind that martin said seeing shade of disappointment resting upon child feature bring up let have look at thereupon man dived below into forecastle presently reappeared bearing in hand skeleton of miniature yacht about two half foot long half planked down first sensation when set eye on model be surprise at dainty delicate character of workmanship exhibited in be greatly increased when upon taking into hand more closely inspecting have opportunity of examining line be a nearly perfect a anything have ever seen in short be evident that when finished model must be faithful miniature reproduction of crack racing yacht of most approved form why martin said greatly pleased at example of skill be excellent where in world did learn to model line like well sir explained martin see be five year in yard of fife at fairlie yacht buildin ' before shipped in northern queen before again be more than three year with summer payne of southampton so ought to know little about shape of yacht did sir assuredly ought said evidently do if one may judge by replaced model in hand fully determined to regularly ship if must now have seen what handy clever fellow promised to be for may here tell reader in strict confidence that there be nothing more thoroughly enjoy than boat sailing very few thing that more highly appreciate than good model of ship boat few day after made proposition to martin that must ship for remainder of voyage offering same pay be giving own carpenter at once gladly assented arrangement a will be seen later on be destined to lead to more important result than of at moment anticipated at length after phenomenally good passage a far south a twenty eighth parallel lost trade immediately picked up strong westerly wind before bore away under rag must spread to round cape when off agulhas wind southed upon fell in with tremendous swell be almost invariably met with about spot have passed over same ground ten time already five time outward bound five time on homeward passage have always found heavy swell running on last occasion be far heavier than have ever before beheld to convey idea of enormous bulk height of liquid hill may mention that while off agulhas bank where swell be by mean at highest overhauled passed barque of about own size at distance of le than cable length yet so high be swell that when settled into trough be completely hidden from to topmast head in longitude degree east with moderate breeze from south east bore away for strait of sunda few day afterwards met with piece of exceptional good fortune be during forenoon watch weather being beautifully fine very gentle breeze blowing under influence of be slipping through water at speed of about five knot watch be busy in deliberate fashion about various odd job on deck aloft occupant of poop be lounging in deck chair amusing according to several fancy a for be engaged a be indeed often case in severe mental effort to find key to dick saint leger cryptogram gentle motion warm genial sunshine soft splash of water along bend with absence of hurried movement on board sharply spoken order seemed to have wrought in entire ship fore aft condition of half dreamy blissful listlessness from be suddenly startled by man cry out from halfway up lee fore rigging luff luff hard down with helm will be into into what shouted springing to foot running forward know sir what be be something floating here be sir be just coming abreast of now a ship shot up into wind with canvas flapping rustling sprang upon lee rail saw mass of dirty greyish white substance mottled streaked like marble floating slowly past at distance of half dozen yard from ship side of course everybody else on deck must need in excitement of moment rush to lee rail to gaze upon cause of sudden alarm among boatswain old whaler who sooner set eye on object than exclaimed why sir be lump of ambergrease worth more 'n hundred pound will be bound be worth pickin ' up be have never before seen piece of ambergris have of course often heard of knew to be valuable accordingly ordered mainyard to be laid aback sent boatswain away with crew in gig to pick up piece of flotsam in about quarter of hour returned to ship with prize proved to be large lump much larger than have appeared to be when floating past of hard fatty matter of light dirty grey colour veined mottled somewhat like marble giving off peculiar sweet earthy odour weight seemed to be a nearly a must estimate about one hundred fifty pound boatswain who claimed to be authority confidently asserted must have difficulty in getting sovereign per pound for at hong kong ambergris may a well mention for information of who know be said to be secretion formed in intestine of sperm whale a result of disease be greatly in demand in east generally for variety of purpose medicinal among others chief use seems to be in manufacture of perfume be not often found supply being very limited command high price in market strangely enough fell in with secured second still larger piece few day later total quantity amounting to le than three hundred twenty seven pound afterwards disposed of without difficulty at twenty five shilling per pound remitting proceeds home to old friend mr richards in part liquidation of debt to chapter eight chief mate have presentiment nothing further of importance occurred during passage across indian ocean be accomplished under exceptionally pleasant circumstance weather being gloriously fine wind if not absolutely fair always favourable enough to permit of laying course java head be made just before sunset under clear sky with light air breathing out from north west so light air indeed that when sun rose next morning headland be still on starboard bow two hour later however got strong breeze out from north east under influence of worked up toward mouth of strait in fine style until noon by time be fairly within strait when wind softened down finally dwindling away to nothing about hour before sunset have sighted several sail during day three of being european bound to westward while rest be country craft small coaster fishing vessel for most part malay have probably next to chinese worst reputation in world for honesty be only just to say that with one solitary exception native craft have day fallen in with have behaved in manner left room whatever for suspicion exception be in case of large proa have passed closely running out before wind toward mouth of strait during forenoon having run to leeward of for distance of six mile have then hauled wind stretched in toward southern shore on reaching have lowered canvas thrown out sweep made way to windward with aid of latter alone be not so much circumstance however though have somewhat incomprehensible look about a fact that pulled twelve sweep of side proving to be heavily manned that caused to regard movement with certain amount of doubt suspicion be now in water from numerous act of piracy have be committed within have acquired more sinister reputation than be borne by other spot of ocean of similar area in whole world be therefore only natural that fact of being becalmed in such spot must have be productive of certain uneasiness disquiet of mind throughout ship at sunset for hour two afterwards there be prospect of fine clear night at about two bell in first watch thin veil of vapour began to gather in sky gradually thickening blotting out star until be completely hidden when darkness became profound at time rather when have last have opportunity of distinguishing distant object there be only eight ten craft native in sight nearest of be fully four mile distant without exception presented appearance of perfect honesty three four of be like ourselves drifting idly with head pointing in a many different direction others have rigged out sweep in case pair be slowly making way inshore baronet be reclining in contiguous chair placidly smoking post prandial cigar lady be below miss merrivale being seated at piano accompanying sister who having by time quite recovered health spirit be singing quaint old fashioned ballad in full rich contralto voice must be distinctly heard from one end of ship to other probably far beyond a for chief mate be pacing deck thoughtfully steadily to fro with energy taking heat closeness of night into consideration seemed to bespeak uneasy mind after while halted alongside binnacle gazed abstractedly into for about minute then turning to nodding helmsman inquired whether knew where be running ship to have have steerage way on since came aft at eight bell sir be reply have eh remarked robert well if be case compass be of much use to be so pulling off jacket a be hardly worth while to proclaim exact whereabouts to everybody will just mask light until breeze spring up saying laid jacket very carefully over hood of binnacle completely obscuring not very brilliant light shone therefrom what be robert ' idea in hiding binnacle light in fashion asked sir edgar turning to a mate again walked forward pausing for minute near head of short poop ladder apparently peering anxiously round into obscurity well said think perhaps feel little uneasy at being becalmed just here in such intensely dark night too malay have name of being born pirate know must happen to take into head to attack just now must be rather awkward since must do absolutely nothing to avoid while calm last do think there be danger of such occurrence captain asked with manifest anxiety not very much replied there be suspicious craft visible at nightfall still attack be by mean impossibility especially on such dark night circumstance be precisely imagine must be deemed highly favourable by people piratically inclined then why in heaven name good sir do not make preparation for such eventuality exclaimed companion excitedly for simple reason replied that preparation possible must be made in five minute a matter of fact be only waiting until have retired when intended at once making two slash of sharp knife must suffice to release boarding pike from boom can easily calculate for length of time must take to serve out brace of revolver cutlas to of small crew um ejaculated baronet have rifle on board have one said of what use must be on such dark night a true too true muttered sir edgar nevertheless think will go down put winchester together upon off chance of work being found for confound calm say if be not for fact of wife bairn being on board there be nothing must enjoy more than brush with rascal for feeling be that pirate deserve mercy a be expressive shrug eloquently concluded sentence baronet at once rose went below minute two later piano became silent heard sound of instrument being closed a sir edgar remarked laughingly thank emily if go on at rate will soon recover old form thought just now a sat on deck listening to singing that voice have never sounded sweeter a chief medical adviser really must forbid using more to night must progress gradually know not overtax nature at outset be not that correct professional jargon joking apart however think have done enough for to night ah there go four bell ten o'clock take advice turn in of get good long night rest think will replied lady emily hot weather make feel very languid tired edgar what be going to do will not remain on deck very late will well hesitated sir edgar depends on circumstance will not turn in until feel that there be chance of getting to sleep if calm continues think will sleep on deck be too insufferably hot altogether for one down here just at present leave port open in cabin of so that if there be air stirring will get benefit of now think will say good night to good night sweetheart pleasant dream good night agnes heard click of latch of cabin door a two lady retired presently sir edgar came on deck again with fresh cigar in mouth seated once more beside remarking there have packed womankind off to bed have laid rifle with good supply of cartridge in own bunk act have somewhat relieved mind so now captain a coast be clear down below there be nothing to prevent making preparation a soon a please very good said then will set about at once by way of start think will blind ' skylight a fully agree with robert that there be especial advantage in revealing four whereabouts to anybody to night nothing steamer must run down in weather must there happen to be one coming along must see light in ample time to give warning of position mate be still promenading to fro between break of poop binnacle so when next passed requested to have canvas cover put over skylight also to direct steward to turn down lamp in saloon own cabin to carefully draw curtain before sidelight so that treacherous ray might gleam forth from ship side betray locality be soon done noiseless movement of mate a went forward gave necessary order in whisper instead of issuing in stentorian tone from break of poop sufficiently indicated conviction of existence of lurking peril in immediate vicinity one thing that have to fear above others to guard against in event of attack be presence of pirate on own deck must succeed in boarding must certainly be in such overwhelming number a to render effective resistance impossible small party must be quickly overpowered then fate of everybody on board must be sealed safety depended upon keeping foe at arm length dozen fathom of water must suffice problem be how to accomplish very desirable end have be giving good deal of thought to even while chatting disconnectedly with sir edgar in earlier part of evening have at length hit upon plan thought might be successful have on board small fire engine mounted on wheel with hose jet attached tank capable of containing fifty gallon engine now ordered to be uncovered prepared for action by securely lashing small loose mop head of oakum round nozzle of hose taking especial care that aperture of jet must be left perfectly free robert who seemed at once to divine understand plan even before have explained to undertook part of work in person in about ten minute reported that be ready invited to inspect workmanship be by time five bell night be without exception darkest think have ever experienced so dark indeed be that well a knew ship have to feel way along deck with hand foot for be absolutely impossible to see anything foot beyond end of one nose with such intense darkness a be evident that heaven must be obscured by exceptionally heavy mass of cloud with hot breathless condition of atmosphere led to anticipate hope for thunderstorm must at least afford sufficient light to inspect surroundings so put end to state of suspense be growing wearisome not only be night intensely dark be also oppressively silent for water being perfectly there be life motion in ship to give rise to sound such a flapping of canvas creaking of timber bulkhead etcetera etcetera usually make calm so irritating to people who happen to be troubled with nerve be silent a death own movement being hushed in harmony with prevailing stillness so that spoke under breath moved about on tiptoe in silent groping way followed robert forward to inspect fire engine be while thus engaged with aid of carefully shielded lantern that mate exclaimed in hoarse whisper a held up hand bent head in listening attitude hark did hear that sir said heard nothing what be why answered robert sounded to like noise of oar sweep creaking in rowlock seemed to come from away yonder pointing a spoke in direction of larboard bow listened intently for fully minute without detecting sound confirmatory of robert evident suspicion at length said turning once more to examination of fire engine tush man be mistaken heard nothing fact be mr robert be not quite to night seem nervous fidgety anxious heat of to day have upset think have better let give good stiff dose of quinine when go below at eight bell thank sir answered robert need quinine anything else in shape of medicine to brace up there be nothing matter with bodily to be perfectly candid do feel little bit off mental balance a be to night fact be know will laugh at sir ca help matter have got feeling strong upon that something be going to happen to to night for three night running be to say last night night before night before again have started up out of sound sleep with idea that dear wife be calling ay with very sound tone of sweet voice in ear now sir do think be only coincidence a say ashore be more likely to be sign that something be going to happen to why what nonsense be for sensible educated man like to be talking exclaimed half angrily let feel pulse held out hand to laid finger upon wrist contrary to what have expected found skin to be cool moist pulse beneath beating with steadiness regularity of machine umph there doe seem to be very much wrong there admitted did know be married man robert understood once to say that be quite alone in world not soul belonging to quite right sir be exact truth returned mate have wife once sir a sweet true tender hearted little woman a ever met will be bound pretty be too little nellie only have six month sir be spliced early in spring stayed ashore spent whole summer well into autumn with six month six blessed happy joyous month with sweetest woman that ever lived be by ourselves excepting for one servant maid in pretty little house on outskirt of teignmouth ah be time for man to look back upon for rest of life then by by when autumn day began to grow short cash began to grow short too have to go to sea again to earn more be not particularly soft hearted man a rule captain saint leger tell sir that parting from nellie be just a much a must stand up against to be obliged to untwine loving clinging arm from about neck to deliberately turn away leave standing there by gate cry dear eye out be cruel work sir be like tearing very heartstrings asunder have to be done of course when arrived at durban for be while be in natal trade in same little barque there be couple of letter waiting for have passed on road out mail arrived while be lying in harbour brought more cheerful than last because time be passing away bringing reunion nearer when at last got home again sir that have to show be darling new made grave have taken typhoid fever died be carried out of house in coffin at moment that telegram announcing arrival in england be handed in something very like sob seemed to rise in robert throat choke at point in story before have time to frame arrange word of sympathy struggled to lip for be not quick man with tongue resumed hope captain saint leger that if manner have seemed to little curious to night will not put down to timorousness faintheartedness anything of sort do feel very queer admit not ill understand strange kind of well be more than presentiment might say be absolute certainty be going to die to night coupled with absolute certainty that treacherous fiend of malay be gathering round out there in darkness if presentiment must prove true come to fight have fear on account will not fail sir in moment of need danger danger have long ceased to be enemy of mine death lost terror for when stood for first time beside nellie grave be quite ready to die whenever may please almighty to call if can do so in defence of dear helpless woman child down below will suit well enough thank robert thank friend said grasping hand held out to be very sad pathetic story have hearty sympathy a to doubting courage good fellow such thought ever entered head be certain despite say to contrary that be not quite to night therefore if will not take medicine at least go below try to get little sleep that perhaps will do a much good a anything will keep remainder of watch for must anything occur to confirm suspicion a to malay may reckon on calling in good time man be however obstinate at least so seemed to to be resolutely declining to accede to of suggestion so leaving to complete few remaining preparation deemed necessary to meet attack must anything of sort be attempted returned aft to poop somewhat vexed that so thoroughly sensible man a robert have hitherto proved must suffer to be so completely mastered a have seen to be by morbid feeling of melancholy be doubtless due in part to overmuch dwelling of late upon death of wife firmly believed be to be still more directly traced to slight derangement of system must easily be put right by administration of dose of medicine must fellow be induced to take doubt too fact of being becalmed therefore to great extent helpless in spot notoriously haunted by people mother son of whom be too ready to participate in act of piracy seemed to offer reasonable prospect of success have large influence in producing presentiment of death in mate mind felt sure must pas away with impenetrable oppressive darkness by be enveloped with advent of breeze of wind while therefore sincerely pitied poor fellow for disagreeable state of mind thought perhaps must be wisest to treat a matter of importance to leave to until fit of depression must have passed away on groping way back to chair have previously occupied found that sir edgar be still occupying chair beside own meditatively pulling away at cigar glowing spark of must probably have still further increased robert perturbation have seen a seated beside baronet made half jesting inquiry a to whether preparation have have effect of reassuring mate so to while away time for want of something more interesting to talk about told robert story also described to peculiar state of mind under poor fellow be labouring sir edgar fully agreed with that latter be simply result of slight probably temporary derangement be proceeding to discus subject of presentiment in general extreme rarity of really well authenticated case of verification when atmosphere became for instant faintly luminous with evanescent quivering glimmer of silent summer lightning flash trembled for moment in sky be gone again in moment saw that firmament be packed with vast mass of dense heavy threatening highly charged electric cloud weird contorted shape of clearly indicated that be being powerfully acted upon by mighty antagonistic force that carried within bosom gave unmistakable warning that elemental strife be impending for must be well to prepare beneath louring canopy surface of water shone with unwrinkled smoothness of polished glass faithfully reflecting detail even to most minute of form colour exhibited by writhing cloud shape that overhung also faithfully reflecting shape of four large proas that in somewhat scattered

hull be heading up down strait must not tell in unexpected glimpse have caught of for showed end on nearly so to meanwhile robert have completed task be in act of mounting to poop for caught sight of figure out of corner of eye when flash came a opaque darkness once more enveloped heard voice exclaiming sharply a seemed to with note of exultation in a though proud at prospect of at least one half of presentiment being verified did see that sir rose from chair joined so that voice might not disturb sleeper below in saloon near open skylight of have be seated mean proas suppose said yes saw there be only four of thank goodness be not sure that be not heading up strait instead of toward if so be doubt from one of that sound emanated that startled little while ago a must have passed at great distance four of exclaimed robert only saw three two of be heading same way a ourselves be close together not more than at moment tremulous greenish glare of sheet lightning once more lit up scene time much more strongly than on first occasion in midst of quivering radiance there be single sudden vivid gleam like instantaneous flash of gigantic lantern behind dense mass of cloud lying piled along western horizon light being so brilliant a to be quite dazzling after cimmerian darkness to eye have become accustomed despite dazzling brilliancy of sudden illumination retina of eye caught retained vision of three large proas broad on starboard quarter about two mile distant situated precisely a robert have described that vision be illusion of sens be instantly demonstrated by mate who interrupted to quickly exclaim there be again sir yes saw said there be four more about three mile up strait on port beam make seven craft in neighbourhood be certainly not there when darkness closed down upon now in order to get where be must have be using sweep must confess have to mind rather bad look a from what have heard of malay be not so fond of hard work a to resort to for mere pastime however will soon know what be after if be looking for last flash have most probably enabled to discover whereabouts if mean mischief will be heading for when next see meanwhile mr robert be evident that be about to be treated to heavy thunderstorm a may bring violent wind squall with will make provision for possibility by stowing light canvas ah a still brighter flash burst forth followed time by low muttering of distant thunder there come rascal be certainly after call hand at once if please mr robert there will be time to shorten sail to prepare reception for malay before can get alongside hand shorten sail shouted mate scrambling off poop groping way forward clew up furl royal to'ga'nts'ls see that stow in way that wo blow adrift if squall happens to strike let go main royal to'gallant mizzen topmast staysail halliard man downhauls then can stow sail a work way down be that mr forbes just see that main fore top l halliard be clear for letting run will ye when lad come on deck will haul down stow flying jib get in gaff top l mizzen be sort bully now away aloft stow everything a quickly a can men fearful that anticipated squall might burst upon ship before be prepared for worked with will effort being greatly facilitated by lightning be now quivering flashing round horizon with momentarily increasing splendour at such brief interval that illumination might almost be said to be continuous while deep hollow rumble of thunder might very well have be mistaken for booming of distant cannonade effect of incessant flicker of lightning be very weird tremulous greenish blue glare illuminating ponderous mass contorted shape of black cloud overhead surface of ink black sea around distant proas hull spar sail rigging of barque with moving figure aloft at jib boom end suffusing everything with so baleful unearthly light only slightest effort of imagination be needed to fancy phantom ship manned by ghost of unquiet dead floating upon sooty flood of styx with adamantine foundation of world arching ponderously menacingly over head reflecting from rugged surface flashing of flame of phlegethon chapter nine eventful night storm be approaching rapidly rumble of thunder grew momentarily louder soon became continuous presently vivid flash of chain lightning streamed from cloud low down upon northern horizon followed in about minute by smart peal of thunder much louder than that have yet heard be quickly succeeded by second flash perceptibly nearer than first for interval between resulting clap of thunder be noticeably shorter while volume of sound be much greater sharper still sheet lightning continued to play vividly with scarcely second intermission among titanic cloud mass around above lighting up entire scene from horizon to horizon so that now have difficulty whatever in following movement of various proas in sight whole fleet of be obviously converging upon a upon common centre be evident from uneasy glance cast by men from time to time upon craft that fully shared own chief mate suspicion regarding have doubt that sight of seven proas unmistakably sweeping down toward have a much a quickly gathering storm to do with acceleration of movement at rate have never seen men work more smartly nearest proa be still fully three quarter of mile distant when last man reached deck did by way of main topmast backstay task of shortening sail be complete thought be now time to say word two to hand therefore requested mr robert to call everybody aft at word came shambling along deck bare footed grouped on port side between main rigging capstan while two mate joined upon poop waited moment until be silent then said lad glance have be casting at interval in direction of proas assures that not only have observed also that like have very grave doubt a to honesty of intention may a well say at once so far a be concerned doubt have given place to certainty certainty that mean mischief towards believe that large proa passed morning running out to seaward afterwards sweeping up strait again under land be simply bound upon reconnoitring cruise that on seeing people arrived at conclusion that must prove very suitable object for attack must opportunity present that presence of seven proas be result now need not waste time by telling what sort of character malay bear because know be almost to man born pirate cruel bloodthirsty set of rascal be into bargain may therefore be certain that if fellow be once allowed to gain full possession of deck not soul of on board here will be left alive five minute afterwards unfortunately mount gun so fear there be little chance of being able to keep at distance there be arm chest below containing sufficient supply of cutlass revolver for hand with ammunition will be served out to may tell that mr robert have be concocting little plan by hope to prevent rascal from actually boarding a have never yet tried be by mean certain that will succeed must fail will undoubtedly be boarded in case must fall back upon cold lead cold steel serving out to enemy with such zeal good will that will be anxious only to get back on board own craft with utmost possible expedition will all fight fight well know never yet met with briton who must not fight may perhaps put little extra vigour into arm if remind that will be fighting not only for yourselves also for helpless woman child who be sleeping below now muster yourselves port watch on port side of deck starboard watch on starboard side mr robert mr forbes will serve out arm to after will hold yourselves ready to promptly execute such order a may receive fellow raised cheer a finished speaking ranged on side of deck with steadiness alacrity of movement be very encouraging to a indicating cool undaunted frame of mind on part two mate at once dived below to bring up arm ammunition meanwhile walked aft to sir edgar who still retained chair puffing placidly at cigar clearly evincing by way have slued in seat in observant listening attitude lively interest be taking in proceeding a joined rose from chair pitching glowing stump of cigar over side said be going below for rifle now captain think that while be there have better awaken wife miss merrivale just give hint of what be impending firing be certain to awake if thunder have not done so already think will be best that must have clear idea of what be about to happen when begin firing may have rushing on deck in alarm to see what be matter agree with yes certainly said be about to suggest course to there be probability of there being exceedingly warm work going on here on deck very shortly if will allow to express opinion be that must be decidedly more prudent for to remain below do what can to encourage lady unlucky shot know might thanks interrupted baronet think can guess exactly what must say captain not word if please what must have skulk below while brave men be imperilling life in defence of who be dearer to than own life must not possibly do besides if be not greatly mistaken will need force can muster before end of affair be reached will be back again within five minute have to request that from then until fight be over will be pleased to consider a completely under order a other man in ship so saying sir edgar turned toward companion made way below with composure a imperturbable a though have just bade good night be about to turn in instead of looking forward to active participation in struggle there be only too much reason to expect must be of most sanguinary desperate character result of might well be anticipated with anxiety baronet head have scarcely vanished beneath companion slide when there came flash puff of smoke followed by sharp ringing report from nearest proa now directly astern of barque having swung with head once more pointing fair up strait then surface of water be torn lashed into momentary foam eight ten fathom away on port beam by spattering of heavy shower of bullet slug of sort have evidently formed charge of gun be well meant at rate remarked robert a crossed deck placed at side by report of judge that be brass gun be using have got range to nicety for wonder yes said men have better get under cover mr robert for if next charge must happen to fall on board somebody may be hurt there be so few of that can not afford to have casualty before coming to close quarter be good enough to see to if please while be forward get one of men to open start drum of petroleum into tank of fire engine put nozzle of hose into tank to soak so that wick arrangement round jet may get thoroughly saturated with oil against time that will want to use at same time have better tell off two of most reliable hand to attend exclusively to working of engine be pleased to remember that mr forbes be included among who be to keep carefully under cover until otherwise required hand under cover shouted mate a made way forward stow yourselves away where shot can get at lad hold yourselves ready to answer smartly to call harry want joe martin to heard more being by time halfway down companion ladder in quest of rifle for time be now at hand when must be needed a entered own state room heard sir edgar voice speaking in reassuring tone in wife cabin a emerged again with rifle in hand cutlas girt about waist pair of revolver in belt came into saloon from thence followed on deck a placed foot on bottom step of companion ladder heard report of discharge from proa mingling sharply with deep volleying roll of thunder overhead a there be accompanying patter of shot on deck concluded that have again missed be heartily glad that malay have unmistakably declared intention by opening fire upon for to be perfectly candid have be in perplexity a to how ought to act towards must make hostile demonstration towards while approaching for while on one hand there have scarcely be shadow of doubt in mind from moment when eye first fell upon that proas be piratical craft with sinister design upon barque there remained on other hand bare possibility until absolutely declared to be otherwise that might be perfectly honest trader bound upon own lawful business must hardly be justified in taking initiative opening fire upon a approached merely because movement happened to present to suspicious appearance because respective course happened to be in direction now that one of craft nearest have actually assumed offensive need entertain further scruple so far at least a be concerned a for others now that engagement might be said to have begun must soon discover by behaviour what intention be how be rifle sighted asked sir edgar a stood together near wheel watching approach of antagonist up to thousand yard answered a proa be now within distance will take shot at without further ceremony when fire sir edgar aim at bow a near level of rail a possible there be doubtless crowd of villain grouped forward there about gun in eye of watching be to part of therefore that must direct attention at first here go for first shot levelled weapon carefully have to wait for what seemed quite long time to get good aim two three very vivid flash of lightning just then following other in quick succession so effectually dazzling eye must see absolutely nothing for few second afterwards then fired there be answering sign sound on board proa to tell that shot have be effective what distance be sighted for inquired baronet five hundred yard answered believe be nearer than think so too agreed sir edgar fired too high captain will sight for three hundred going to binnacle uncovering hood for moment to do so waited perhaps minute then raised rifle to shoulder paused second two taking advantage of strong prolonged gleam of sheet lightning fired shrill scream from proa told that bullet have found mark almost immediately afterwards fired gun again shot time striking somewhere aloft for distinctly heard thud of bullet against spar score first blood at event composedly remarked sir edgar a for enemy be evident that have not altered elevation of piece since first fired be fervently to be hoped that will still forget to do so if last shower of bullet have fallen on deck captain be afraid must have be bad for of very possibly agreed still small short gun such a appears to carry scatter tremendously might have lead flying thick round still not be hit now wonder whether will have better luck time certainly have for sharp report of weapon be instantly answered by quite outcry on board proa kind of compound yell made up of several distinct sound leading to conclusion that bullet have fallen in thick of group wounded several why captain be improving observed companion approvingly if must manage to do same now crack went rifle sound be followed by two distinct cry scream howl manifestly uttered by different voice thought heard sound of heavy fall on deck sharp peal of thunder at same moment prevented being sure of while be reloading fired brass gun once more again charge flew high overhead luckily for for bullet seemed to be flying closer together time then began pelting at with gingals first treating to quite respectable fusillade then blazing away man for a fast a must load fire of bullet singing past so closely that inwardly congratulated upon wisdom in ordering everybody under cover new one after remaining proas opened fire upon with brass gun although certainly not more than two of entire fleet be yet within range while vivid lightning flashed tore athwart heaven in continuous coruscation thunder crashed rattled rolled boomed overhead round horizon in such terrific detonation that absolutely caused ship to perceptibly tremble vibrate with tremendous volume of sound at proa have initiated attack upon closed to within hundred yard steering for port quarter with evident intention of sheering alongside somewhere about mizzen rigging be working ten sweep on board five of side calculating that sweep required at least four men to handle for be very long heavy concluded that must have told at least sixty men on deck formidable number to oppose with small force on board barque be not much afraid of so long a must keep few fathom of water between ourselves must once succeed in gaining footing upon deck very few casualty on side must suffice to determine issue against be accordingly to prevent have set wit to work in conjunction with of mate when have first seen reason to anticipate attack plan being to utilise fire engine a mean of defence have given instruction to have prepared in manner hoped must convert into really formidable weapon time have now arrived at least be close at hand when opportunity must be afforded to test efficacy therefore ordered to be run aft a far a capstan cautioned two men who have be told off to work to stand by brake handle have already fully explained idea to mate now took in hand long brass nozzle tow attachment round jet of be by time thoroughly saturated with oil prepared to act a circumstance might demand meanwhile pirate have ceased to fire brass gun fusillade from gingals have slackened considerably thanks doubt to indefatigable manner in baronet have plied rifle upon craft be now so near that by continuous flashing of lightning must distinguish detail even to most minute of hull rigging must see too that deck be crowded with men many of whom appeared to have tailed on a extra hand to sweep be now being worked with furious energy for lashed water into perfect swirl of luminous phosphorescent foam while quite respectable little curl of luminous froth buzzed away on side from sharp bow be clear that be giving way enough to shoot alongside prior to laying in sweep in order that man have might be available for boarding purpose now sir edgar exclaimed will give one more shot apiece then must stand by with cutlass in case fire engine fails there be tall fellow standing at helm who offer very decent mark will see whether can pick off inquired baronet by mean answered hurriedly take especial pain to shoot wide of if please look to to afford very effectual help presently companion turned stared inquiringly at for moment apparently doubting whether be in earnest when seeing evidently be so muttered oh very well taking aim fired simultaneously with saw two pair of arm tossed into air a owner went down at same moment in obedience to command that distinctly heard given sweep be very smartly laid in thrown clattering on to deck while man on board save helmsman sank under cover behind proa low bulwark now mr robert stand by with hose give benefit of moment show cried pump boy fill hose exclaimed mate plunging nozzle into flame of lighted lantern that have brought aft with for purpose tow band instantly burst into fierce flame casting broad yellow glare on everything within influence dripping burning drop into bucket of water with robert have taken precaution of providing while be doing proa helm have be ported now came driving along toward port quarter a have expected when within fifty foot of order be given on board in response to crew eighty in number at very least a fierce relentless looking set of cut throat a ever desire to see rose to foot with naked creese grasped in hand yellow glare falling strongly upon keen steel fierce gleaming eyeball lined rail in readiness to spring on board on instant that side of two craft must touch now be time mr robert let have fore aft shouted pump hard cried robert to men excitedly handle clanked smartly mate turned tap of jet in instant long thin stream of oil ignited by passage through flame blazing round orifice of jet poured in flood of fire across intervening space of water struck proa fairly in bow to raise nozzle sufficiently to touch men be action quick a thought when be so manipulated a to cause stream to travel deliberately right along entire length of vessel rail from eye of to taffrail effect surpassed most sanguine expectation stream of fire thin a be must not be withstood in le time than take to tell of deck of proa be full of shrieking men who with clothes ablaze suffering heaven only know what extremity of torture wherever fiery spray have touched be plunging headlong below out of way of dreadful missile helmsman have a expected instinctively put helm hard starboard instant that jet began to play with result that proa instead of touching forged slowly past to port so ahead with little tongue of flame creeping here there about hull wherever flaming oil have fallen robert keeping jet remorselessly playing upon until have shot quite beyond reach thank god be well rid of danger ejaculated unless be greatly mistaken will get breeze before of others be near enough to attempt same trick ay here come with vengeance too look there sir on starboard beam cried robert avast pumping there two run engine away for'ard out of way stand by brace fore terrific blaze of lightning at moment enveloped ship in sheet of living flame be accompanied by simultaneous crash of thunder be indescribably dreadful terrifying by reason of awful intensity of sound literally stunned for few second so completely that knew not where be when recovered sens discovered that tremendous shock of sound have rendered stone deaf so be utterly incapable of hearing anything fortunately for deafness passed off again in few minute while lasted found exceedingly inconvenient unpleasant first act on coming to sens be to glance instinctively in direction indicated by mate when complete transformation in appearance of heaven in quarter met anxious gaze heaped up mass of cloud have there be rent asunder by power of imprisoned wind revealing large rapidly widening patch of clear sky with star brilliantly shining in blue black space while beneath water be white with foam of approaching squall man port fore brace shouted at top of voice though not slightest sound reached ear round in smartly men well there belay stand by topsail halliard fore main why what be a in moving stumbled over something on deck felt like human body stooped to feel for object for lightning have entirely ceased since last baleful flash found that be indeed body have one be struck by bullet without having noticed hurriedly called for lantern before must be brought squall burst upon in fury though must still hear absolutely nothing know that babel of sound must have be terrific for wind smote a though have be solid body jamming hard against larboard mizzen rigging while staunch little barque bowed before until larboard rail be buried in sea maindeck afloat a far up a coaming of hatchway shouted order to let go topsail halliard signed to man at wheel to put helm hard up appeared to have already done so for coat have masked binnacle light having gone to leeward upon wing of squall must see to windward of wheel holding spoke in grasp bearing against with strength catching eye fellow pointed ahead said something at least saw lip

starboard bow when away flew like frightened seabird before gale leaving unfortunate malay to fate however dreadful have certainly brought upon meanwhile topsail halliard having be let go yard have slid down upon cap while topsail being patent reefing have close reefed so that running a be dead before squall be snug enough for moment although there be lee shore at very great distance existence of occasioned considerable anxiety first danger over again called for lantern be quickly brought first ray revealed shocking fact that be body of chief mate lay at foot stooping hastily turned over on back to search for wound have laid low to great surprise be unable to find one to discover slightest trace of blood feature be perfectly placid composed with just ghost of smile upon giving appearance of having fallen suddenly into pleasant sleep laid finger quickly upon wrist fearing knew not what failed to detect movement of pulse sir edgar meanwhile have joined now thrust hand inside waistcoat over region of heart held there moment two then started up horror stricken good god ejaculated man be dead be so there must be doubt about robert presentiment have actually be true one have indeed be doomed to die night be mortal bullet slew god have launched bolt have severed thread of staunch faithful sailor broken life be that last terrible flash of lightning have killed poor fellow have died so instantaneously that must scarcely have be conscious of momentous change certainly must have be impossible that must have experienced least sensation of pain be inexpressibly shocked grieved at terribly sudden death of chief mate not so much on account of death for after hearing poor fellow sad story in earlier part of night must not for instant doubt that death must be regarded by a thrice welcome friend be awful suddenness unexpected character of appalled however have time to dwell upon matter just then for though perfectly safe at moment fathom that ship travelled carried more nearly to position of awful jeopardy therefore gave order that body must be taken below to robert own state room begged sir edgar to go below see whether must by mean restore vitality to hurriedly explaining situation to pointing out impossibility of leaving deck until safety of ship must be assured kind hearted fellow at once consented followed men below leaving alone in darkness turmoil of storm to reflect on word have spoken on night witnessed destruction of northern queen how completely be in hand of god how absolutely dependent upon mercy present situation be further exemplification of great truth if indeed such be needed for there be sign whatever of abatement of strength of gale indeed contrary to previous experience wind appeared to be increasing in violence with fathom that sped to leeward true sky be clear away to windward overhead be good sign then have before now known to blow heavily for many hour on end out of perfectly clear sky while away to leeward somewhere down in thick blackness toward barque bow be pointing in direction toward be hurrying lay land rock bound coast for aught knew to contrary at event land to touch under circumstance must certainly mean loss of ship most probably of hand a well while be meditating upon debating within possibility of bringing ship to wind without losing mast cry arose forward shout of horror raised by many voice a seemed to if word be uttered failed to catch so terrific be uproar of wind in maze of rigging overhead sprang toward break of poop cry out at same time to know what be matter when a did so caught glimpse of darker shadow against blackness of sky ahead lying right athwart hawse there be cry from forecastle a turned head to shout order to helmsman to put wheel hard over felt shock not very severe one by mean a though have touched ground for moment loud scream uprose out of dark shadow beneath bow grating grinding sensation thrilled along whole ship from bow to stern post a though be forcing way over something solid sprang to rail looked over side into water there sliding swiftly past ship prone upon glittering phosphorescent milk white foam lay distinctly limned black outline of mast with long tapering latteen yard strand two of rigging attached to while here there dotted upon hissing froth caught momentary vision of certain round black object knew be head of drowning men intermingled with fragment of wreckage tossing arm writhing body even a gazed horror stricken at picture of sudden swift destruction drifted astern be quickly lost to view have seen enough to know exactly what have happened have unwittingly run down one of proas have essayed to attack chapter ten on lee shore be useless to think of heaving ship to otherwise attempting to save life of unfortunate malay whose craft have just destroyed thing be absolute impossibility such attempt must only have resulted in own destruction have option to continue headlong flight to leeward leaving enemy to save if must by clinging to wreckage immediately after collision carpenter came aft without waiting for order carefully sounded pump result be report that hold be dry have therefore apparently sustained no serious damage to hull while so far a spar rigging be concerned did not appear to have parted rope yarn for fully hour squall raged a madly a at moment when first burst upon while ship be scudding helplessly before drawing nearer moment to deadly lee shore that knew must be close at hand instant expected must bring up standing at length however to intense relief gale slightly perceptibly moderated headlong fury determining to at once avail myself of opportunity called hand to brace prepared to bring ship to wind on starboard tack moment that everything be ready signed to man at wheel to put helm gently over when a be turning away again to give order to men at brace one of startled with cry of land ho ahead on port bow caught sight of at same instant air having momentarily cleared somewhat of spindrift scud water have hitherto circumscribed horizon obscured view yes there be low dark shadow against now clear starlit sky right ahead stretching away to port starboard on bow must not be more than three mile distant from if so much for air though somewhat clearer than have be be still thick yet loom of land through be clear enough altogether too much so indeed for liking what be like to eastward must not distinguish for in direction faded quickly into thick atmosphere lay way westward terminated in low point already bore well out upon larboard beam sight caused to most heartily congratulate have determined upon rounding to on starboard tack for have done so with ship head to westward without seeing point must not possibly have weathered must have taken choice when did discover of going ashore upon upon land to leeward must attempt to wear ship for must never have tacked in such sea a be now running with small amount of canvas a be showing a ship came to wind for first time since outburst of gale gained something like just idea of tremendous strength violence with nothing on two close reefed topsail fore topmast staysail poor little esmeralda bowed beneath fury of blast until lee rail be awash lee scupper more than waist deep in water howling hooting of gale aloft a tore furiously through maze of spar rigging opposed to produced wild medley of sound that utterly baffle attempt at description while savage plunge of ship into short steep sea horrible way in careened during lee roll almost sickened with anxiety lest mast must go over side leave to

upturned weather bow a keen stem plunged headlong into clove irresistibly through heart of wave after wave flinging blinding deluge of spray right aft a far a poop ploughing up whole acre of boiling luminous foam to pour hissing roaring far out from under lee bow flash glancing past in bewildering swirl of buzzing gleaming froth while din of wild gale raved aloft furious buffeting almost distracted one sens gallant little barque thus fighting for life must have presented exhilarating spectacle to one while seaman appreciative heart must have thrilled with exultation at bearing in strife though travelling fast through water poor little ship be at same time sagging most frightfully to leeward staysail seeming to drag head two three point off wind at send bringing almost broadside on to sea although be heading fairly well out toward open water must not conceal from awkward truth that excessive leeway be reducing course to one practically parallel with trend of coast sometimes even thought that be slowly surely setting in toward land fact be that ship needed more after sail to enable to hold good luff yet seemed to that must be impossible for to bear more be indeed rather over pressed than otherwise a be have have plenty of sea room must have endeavoured to relieve her of fore topsail at once even at risk of losing sail in attempt to hand with relentless

staggered over to windward at cry at expense of thorough drenching despite oilskin have donned time before made out bold lofty headland jutting far out to seaward lying dead ahead of ship be embayed land ahead be certainly not more than three mile distant ship be setting bodily down toward at plunge time for hesitation be past something have to be done done promptly too half hour must see last of poor little esmeralda main trysail happened to be nearly new sail bent for first time when starting on voyage be made of good stout canvas be beautifully cut therefore determined to attempt experiment of setting though scarcely hoped must endure tremendous strain to must be exposed long enough to drag clear of terrible point mustering hand therefore got sheet aft block hooked on to eye bolt then hand tailing on to fall lower brail be eased gently away sheet being dragged upon at same time in way managed to get foot of sail extended without splitting hauling out of head be much simpler matter in le than five minute have satisfaction of seeing entire sail extended without having parted thread effect of added canvas be tremendous lee rail be completely buried deck be now so steeply inclined that during lee roll be impossible to maintain one footing without holding on to something no longer sagged to leeward a before ship now held luff threatening headland be brought to bear nearly three

married bosom friend companion of boarding school day result being that half jocular proposal of mine that must extend wandering to australia beat up quarter of good folk have crystallised into serious resolution to do so provided that suitable passenger accommodation to take there can be met with accident of having accepted freight for sydney settle that part of question of course for will go with be if be willing to have again protested heartily truthfully that proposal must give greater pleasure whereupon be then there arranged that party must have whole of saloon accommodation a

discovered to inexpressible delight really be at last upon right track met with few difficulty be true braced up encouraged by what have already achieved speedily surmounted after somewhat more than hour patient labour succeeded in evolving following latitude degree minute south longitude degree minute west approached from south west island at distance of fifteen league bear exact likeness of face of man floating on water steer for hollow between mouth chin ye will find river boldly enter sail up distance of three furlong to creek on starboard hand pas into creek land on island treasure lie buried at spot one thousand foot due south from base of obelisk rock be so elated at discovery mental relief exhilaration be so great that in exuberance of delight felt constrained to acquaint friend with success rushing up on poop with cryptogram rough translation in hand sat down by open skylight close to sir edgar lady emily be seated presenting baronet with document said there sir edgar read that never hereafter dare to assert that there be nothing in dream remember have ever yet made assertion retorted laughingly do really mean to say that have at length mastered secret of cipher a took paper from forthwith read aloud for benefit of wife miss merrivale latter having joined at sister call well exclaimed lady emily when husband have finished be really wonderful quite kind of thing that one read of in book doe not believe because one seldom never meet with anything like in real life so many strange thing have happened during eventful voyage of ours will never again be incredulous of anything quite so dear agreed sir edgar never commit to statement that disbelieve anything to refuse credence simply because one can not understand because to limited understanding occurrence seems unlikely impossible be infallible indication of ignorance wider experience deeper knowledge more ready be to admit that there may be many wonder have never come within limit of ken about know nothing about key to cryptogram what be must tell that know saint leger in consideration of own unsuccessful effort to help besides knowledge of such difficult cipher a be really worth having who can say how soon under what circumstance might be found useful for purpose of secret communication oh be ridiculously simple when know said have to do be to number letter of alphabet consecutively beginning with calling eleven then with cryptogram before divide figure into series of four four figure representing letter subtract first pair of figure from second remainder give number of letter a have in key for example first four figure in document be be to say eleven thirty three difference between be twenty two see represents letter l in key then take next four figure treating in same way so on throughout document one great advantage of such arrangement appears to to be that however many time same letter occurs in document need never be represented twice in exactly same way certainly must greatly tend to preserve secrecy of cipher there be space observe to mark division between several word that offer difficulty when one posse key while to cost know add tremendously to difficulty when one doe not then again figure of latitude longitude be given just a must be in ordinary document brought completely to standstill for little while until happily guessed at explanation after passing stumbling block rest be perfectly plain sailing quite so acquiesced sir edgar be simple enough when have be explained sufficiently ingenious thing for in proof of have fact that have completely puzzled for month really believe saint leger for wonderful dream must have continued to puzzle to end of time congratulate heartily upon good fortune simultaneously exclaimed lady emily sister now continued baronet what be plan with regard to matter will still go on to sydney discharge cargo before attempting to secure treasure will make detour prosecute search for forthwith oh of course must fulfil present obligation before attempt to do anything toward recovering treasure said when have done that when have safely landed on wharf at sydney have discharged cargo will well ballast ship clear for pacific in search of cargo of sandal wood will of course make first business to secure treasure in order to keep up appearance will also collect what sandal wood can find without very much trouble proceed with to china from whence will take home cargo of tea if can secure one how long do expect to remain in sydney inquired sir edgar oh about fortnight three week at utmost said upon word must very much like to go with remarked sir edgar reflectively confess feel curious to see end of adventure if be not likely to lie in port longer than time have named be afraid can scarcely be managed however will see with subject be dismissed for moment although be afterwards frequently touched upon again before arrival in sydney other affair to have referred a ultimately proving to be intimately associated with fortune of friend desmonds be one in ship steward became most conspicuous figure have never liked man from moment that first came into contact with upon occasion of crew signing article have sly shifty expression of eye that aroused instant antipathy held such unexceptionable testimonial have excuse for refusing to engage apart from manifest injustice must have be to deny employment simply on account of feeling of prejudice that for aught must tell might disappear upon further acquaintance did not however on contrary rather increased for have not be with long ere discovered that have quiet stealthy cat like way of moving about must have be irreproachable have not happened that frequently when writing letter making up account otherwise engaged upon work of strictly private character be disconcerted to suddenly discover behind chair without knowing how came how long have be there in position attitude irresistibly suggested idea that have be peering over shoulder again when conversing more le confidentially with others be uncommon thing to make by merest accident annoying discovery that man have be well within while did not in least lessen annoyance that on such occasion fellow seemed to be exactly where ought to be engaged in performance of perfectly legitimate duty however be extent of offence if such can be called until be within twenty four hour of arriving in sydney harbour when be detected in act that resulted in destruction of ship while seriously imperilled life of hand ship lazarette storeroom be situated a be usually case underneath cabin whereas be fashion in most ship to have small hatch in cabin floor by access be gained to lazarette in esmeralda there be much more convenient arrangement consisting of step ladder leading down through hatchway beneath saloon staircase whereby store must be brought up for use without necessity of shifting saloon table dragging everything through saloon hatchway giving access to lazarette be enclosed by partition formed quite roomy little apartment wherein steward be wont to unpack barrel case containing cabin store work being thus done in such complete seclusion that must not possibly prove source of annoyance to one however fastidious arrangement also enabled steward to enter lazarette at own sweet will without one being wiser constituted sole objection to be a have said within twenty four hour sail of port time being evening about three bell in first watch when one of nursemaid came rushing on deck with scared face intelligence that there be strong smell of burning in saloon moreover be full of smoke of course sprang below at once found to be indeed a maid have stated there be most unmistakable smell of fire haze of light blue smoke in cabin seemed to have made way there from lazarette for companion way space between foot of companion ladder saloon bulkhead be thick with guessing at once that fire be in lazarette threw open door leading to hatchway found latter open with cloud of bluish white smoke issuing from through dimly caught flicker of flame to drop through hatchway be work of instant when at once saw what be matter large packing case have evidently be nearly full of straw be in blaze beside with idiotic drunken grin upon face stood steward unsteadily pointing with wavering finger to open lazarette lantern must just be descried in midst of blazing mass in other hand fellow held filled unlighted pipe with tumbler still contained small quantity of wine half empty bottle of same generous stimulant explained at glance whole history of incident rascal have evidently gone down into lazarette helped to bottle of wine upon content of have become so nearly intoxicated that at length forgetful reckless of extreme danger of such proceeding where be have determined to further solace with smoke opening lantern in order to light pipe at candle have dropped into packing case set content on fire fellow be too stupidly drunk even to raise alarm in five minute whole lazarette must have be in blaze a happened however arrived upon scene just in nick of time to prevent by seizing blazing case dragging content bodily up on deck at expense of pair of severely scorched hand heaving overboard then went below again took exhaustive look round to assure beyond question that smouldering spark have be left behind having completely satisfied upon point wound up affair by ordering steward to be put in iron locked up in deck house forward arrived at sydney next day within hour of mooring ship paid man wage turned adrift desmond party got clear of ship in time to dine ashore that evening on day one following arrival started upon up country journey after bidding most cordial farewell accompanied by hope that might find still in port upon return felt exceedingly sorry to part with told so adding must not entertain hope of seeing again on side of world at least since expected to be absent from sydney for at least month by end of time hoped to be distance on way to treasure island gave faithful promise to write to on return to england acquainting with issue of adventure even must find unable to accept pressing invitation gave to visit at place in devonshire sydney a everybody know be fairly busy port can always make goodly display of shipping at least be experience of place have be there thrice prior to period of story knowing a thought did something about annual amount of tonnage using harbour be astounded at vast fleet of craft of rig size that met gaze when beheld noble city for fourth time anchorage seemed literally packed with required very delicate manoeuvring on part of pilot to take to berth without running foul of something fortunately for possibly also for of other craft there be nice working breeze blowing at time esmeralda happening moreover to be exceptionally smart handy vessel under canvas managed to thread way in out among fleet without hurting anybody else pilot observed wondering glance cast around a made way up harbour remarked with smile in semi confidential tone of voice curious sight be sir very agreed most curious part of to mind be deserted look of craft everywhere most of appear to be loaded apparently ready for sea yet in scarcely of be more than single person to be seen while many of appear to have absolutely nobody at on board be just how be with sir there be upwards of hundred sail of vessel at anchor round about at present minute without soul aboard to look after deserted by hand from skipper to cabin boy left to take care of while crew be away making fortune trying to make at new gold field be absolutely deserted be left with only cap'n aboard to look after crew will be leaving before twenty four hour be passed over head unless be unusually steady lot mark word if how long have state of thing existed inquired oh ever since discovery of new gold field be let see why about five month be reply see that full rigged ship over there painted green with white port be sophie ellesmere of liverpool crew be first to desert be only last thursday that heard cap'n saying that have be ready for sea exactly five month on day have written home to owner to send out crew be expecting 'em by next steamer arrangement being that be to go straight aboard from steamer up anchor away bless sir will never do will insist upon having fling ashore for few day after trip out here so sure a get leave to do that will be off like rest be there no men to be obtained here in place of deserter asked lord bless soul sir why be difficult matter to muster hand enough even to unload load ship with labourer wage up to pound day men who be willing to work even at figure be either few long headed one who prefer moderate certainty to chance of ill luck at gold field such poor delicate chap a ca stand hardship of camp life a to sailor bless sir there ai one to be have for love money even who deserted from sophie ellesmere have be up there long enough yet to get tired of life to want change then suppose new gold field be proving pretty rich hazarded well if be to believe that newspaper say about there must be gold to be have for trouble of picking up almost be reply be certain that at least one man sailor be too managed to scrape together ten thousand pound worth of gold in three month three of mate worked claim together struck downright rich when got down to gravel one nugget alone that brought up weighed fourteen hundred ninety seven ounce though be biggest of lot be only one of many big one of course find ' like go round of newspaper be made much of talked about to degree that people simply go mad with gold fever rush off to field absolutely certain that too will be equally lucky be serious news indeed for a be then situated must ill afford to have ship lying idle single day to say nothing of such length of time a five six month must eventually succeed in recovering treasure of course even year more of enforced idleness must matter nothing be still quite open question with whether must ever see that treasure not have not shadow of doubt a to bona fides of cryptogram felt certain that when document be penned treasure be reposing peacefully in hiding place described therein how be to know that lay there still writer of document may not have be only person acquainted with secret of hiding place in such case probability be in favour of treasure having be unearthed year before father opened eye upon world might even have be stumbled upon accidentally in short prospect of falling into hand appeared so uncertain even now that have gained clue to place of concealment felt must be impossible for to regard to act otherwise than a poor man until must actually find treasure in possession then too be naturally anxious eager to settle question a to whether treasure still remained hidden not if did well good if not if be not to be found on spot indicated in cryptogram certainly must not be found at must then remain for to do must be to dismiss matter from mind a must feverish dream devote heart soul to profession problem now presented to mind be how to induce crew to remain with for inducement must certainly have to be must scarcely have locked up put in iron during stay in sydney in order to insure against desertion thought matter over very carefully on first evening of arrival in sydney harbour during subsequent day after visit to consignee have assured that pilot story in nowise exaggerated astounding state of thing then prevailing in port at length came to conclusion must hing if chose to remain well good if elected to go have power to prevent to astonishment gratification however took leave time after time always punctually turned up on board again when have expired until when have be in harbour nearly month cargo be almost out began to hope that fellow really meant to stay by then getting leave to spend sunday ashore a usual mother son of save mate joe martin left of course at once communicated with police authority acquainting with fact of desertion also offered substantial reward for recovery of men be of avail rascal have gone clean off there found in same plight a many shipmaster locked up in sydney harbour for indefinite period with hope whatever of getting away so long a rush to gold field lasted chapter thirteen new crew have be in unpleasant plight about three week during remainder of cargo have be discharged ship ballasted down to very best sailing trim everything made ready for trip to pacific when one day a be wandering aimlessly about street encountered sir edgar lady desmond who after much longer sojourn up country than have intended have returned to sydney be beginning to think seriously of finding way back to england be palpably unfeignedly delighted to see again although of course sympathised with in misfortune insisted upon dining with that evening afterwards accompanying to theatre suppose saw that needed little cheering up got too for be more than kind genial frankness of behaviour to be more that of brother sister than of mere acquaintance even of usual run of friend when left next morning after breakfast for insisted on acceptance of hospitality for night felt more cheerful than have done since desertion of crew a shook hand with sir edgar on hotel step said now saint leger be in hurry to start for month two know be quite a eager a ever be to see end of adventure of yours so if must succeed in scraping together crew within say next two month may reckon upon a passenger again be if must care to have be more than kind sir edgar said must be delighted to have appear to have forgotten that plan include visit to china before point barque nose for home even must succeed in securing treasure doe not matter bit dear fellow laughed a have already told be in hurry to tell truth lady emily seems to enjoy so much better health when at sea than doe when on shore must welcome excuse plausible enough to keep on shipboard for two three month longer so if must succeed in picking up crew let know at once really seemed a though reappearance of desmonds upon scene have brought good fortune to for when reached ship went on board forbes met at gangway with unwonted expression of delight upon face said be glad have come on board so early sir for have actually have gang of eleven men alongside who say be looking for berth eleven men looking for berth ejaculated scarcely crediting ear where be went off up town again unfortunately when told be not on board replied forbes have address of boarding house at be staying told must let know when must see dear fellow exclaimed be off at once say that will be on board for remainder of day can see at time stay perhaps have better look in upon can manage to drop in upon in casual sort of way will have le appearance of eagerness anxiety than must sending especially for what did look like well admitted forbes looked a rowdy set of ruffian a ever wish to set eye on manner mode of speaking be of fairly decent respectable men said that have be at gold field for last seven month have scarcely made enough to keep be consequently tired of shore life have determined to go to sea again if must meet with ship officer to liking be mightily taken with barque a of course man who knew ship from washing tub must be swore be sweetest looking craft in harbour when mentioned name said have heard of must wish to go to sea under better man altogether if be only in earnest a to desire to go to sea again think must find much difficulty in securing sir give address said will be off after at once be not time for fencing feigning indifference fellow know a well a do what haul will prove to man who be lucky enough to secure so will not run risk of losing by pretending otherwise if can persuade to ship will sail to morrow short handed though must be can take starboard watch for rest will just have to keep extra sharp eye upon barometer weather be careful to snug down if need be in good time until again reach china when will probably be able to get man two so saying took address from forbes forthwith started in search of men found at length after somewhat tedious quest in most disreputable looking boarding house situate in most disreputable part of town be bound to admit that first impression of men be that appearance be in perfect accord with surroundings most undoubtedly be a forbes have said a rowdy looking set of ruffian a one must care to meet tough sinewy desperado swarthy a mulatto by long exposure to fierce southern sun with long dense tangled thatch of hair mingling with thick neglected growth of beard whisker permitted scarcely feature save nose eye to be seen clad in remains of inevitable flannel shirt cord trouser knee boot with belt about waist in man carried revolver formidable bowie knife whole topped off with soft broad brimmed battered felt hat dashed on to head in fashion eloquently suggestive of utmost extreme of recklessness think never saw party of men who under ordinary circumstance must have be le willing to ship a crew than yet when spoke to answered respectfully there be scarcely more than merest tinge of defiant independence of manner that appearance have prepared to expect told a have told forbes that have be working for something like seven month at gold field have met with so little success that be now almost penniless result attributed to lack of experience a miner one of party remarked grimly that life of miner be even worse than of sailor inasmuch a with equal amount of exposure harder work be unusual thing for to be reduced to starvation ration seven month experience of kind said have satisfied that be never intended for gold miner have accordingly left field in body tramped to sydney determined to revert to original occupation of seaman agreeing to ship together for home in first craft took fancy said be not going directly to england be bound to pacific for cargo of sandal wood thence to china before seeking freight to england oh well said fellow who have constituted spokesman of party wo make great difference voyage will be so much longer will have more money to take up at end of chief thing with be to find comfortable ship good skipper be of opinion that if ship with will have ai that so mate ay ay judge be so bully be sentiment right be a usual in similar terse sentence men confirmed remark of companion question of wage be then raised in respect of found demand far more moderate than have dared to hope namely five pound ten per month for seaman man who undertook to perform duty of steward six pound ten per month for cook man to receive advance of two month wage upon signing article to agreed without demur then anxious to strike while iron appeared to be hot suggested that must sign article forthwith short consultation among followed proposal at end of declared quite willing stipulated that must have twenty four hour clear after signing in to provide with outfit for voyage to also assented then separated to make way to shipping office to hurry down to barque for necessary paper cash prior to joining there be just noon when work of signing article paying advance having be completed jumped into cab to drive to hotel at desmonds be staying to acquaint good people with latest stroke of luck be out however a felt morally certain must be so left note for sir edgar then set about transaction of such small item of business a be necessary prior to going to sea however amounted to very little a have practically completed preparation long before so by five o clock in evening have cleared everything off hand be once more alongside ship here found note from sir edgar desmond awaiting in acknowledged receipt of own epistle enjoined to dine with without fail that evening did upshot of be that decided to complete trip with despite poor account felt constrained to give of crew announced intention of joining ship immediately after lunch on following day a stretched out in bunk that night reflected with sigh of satisfaction that if went well must be once more at sea in le than twenty four hour disagreeable suspicion for first time obtruded upon mind that possibly might prove after have be victim of clever swindle must never see anything more of of men to whom have handed over two month advance so confidingly however about eleven o'clock next morning first of william rogers man whom have shipped a boatswain put in appearance alongside neatly dressed in new suit of blue cloth with cap shirt shoe to match also brand new chest bundle of bedding coming on board quietly went below proceeded to arrange belonging for voyage be agreeably surprised at man appearance for whereas when have shipped on previous day be ragged dirty unkempt be now well dressed clean palpably fresh from hand of barber close upon heel came jacob simpson cook who have likewise undergone renovating process materially improved appearance although a looked at man there be something about did not quite like for one thing seemed to remind vaguely of somebody else though who must not for life of say who have left unpleasant impression upon mind added to be afflicted with affection of voice result of bush fever informed permitted to speak only in hoarse whisper next came peter gale man who have undertaken to perform function of steward though frankly admitted that knew little nothing about duty of post since steward must have man impressed a being most quiet likely man for berth have chosen since have professed readiness to try hand do best from man learned pleasing intelligence that remainder of men be following must be on board in about quarter of hour so introduced to lazarette directed to obtain cook assistance to break out fresh barrel of beef get dinner under way for crew forthwith about time named by steward main body made appearance came quietly on board there be eight of namely hiram barr james mckinley american michael o'connor irishman francois bourdonnais frenchman carl strauss german christian christianssen swede pedro villar portuguese james nicholson nicknamed san domingo from island in be born full blooded negro constituted distinctly scratch crew be compelled to admit a watched coming on board understood spoke english although with sprucing up few of still wore somewhat sinister appearance man of be for wonder perfectly sober bore in remarkably decent orderly manner moreover eight last enumerated have shipped a able seaman in short while perhaps be not crew must have selected from choice considered marvellously lucky in getting even be more than content a soon a be aboard have gone below sent word for'ard by steward that be to employ interval until dinner time in shaking down that after dinner must proceed to rig out jib boom unmoor ship preparatory to going to sea then leaving forbes in charge went ashore cleared ship for pacific paid harbour other due wrote posted few letter took lunch then down on board again overtaking desmond party on way when having shipped somewhat multitudinous belonging windlass be manned cable hove short topsail sheeted home mast headed anchor tripped be off reaching open sea just in time to see sun disappear behind land a squared away upon north easterly course for dick saint leger treasure island for time went merry a marriage bell weather be simply perfect with blue sky brilliant sunshine gentle breeze with charming glimpse of lovely tropical island day after day when reached fiji friendly archipelago threaded way through to add to enjoyment of time men be doing duty in manner ought to have satisfied most exacting of officer behaving with quietness steadiness of demeanour be absolutely unexceptionable seemed always willing always content phenomenon have never hitherto met with on shipboard for longer than first week after leaving port be consequently very much astonished when one dark night in middle watch when have be at sea rather over fortnight joe martin who be at wheel took advantage of momentary pause made beside to address in following term beg pardon cap'n must make convenient to pitch into give most tremenjious blowin up call lot of hard name afore hand to morrow time in second dog watch if be to give excuse for so doin ' blow up abuse before hand ejaculated a soon a astonishment must allow to speak why what in name of be extraordinary do mean martin just exactly what say sir be reply fact be there be something brewin ' in fo cbe'le want to get to bottom of ca because men have got notion into head that be bit of favourite of yours wo trust so want to pitch into hot heavy before hand to morrow then will turn sulky start good growl perhaps then will say something to understand joe protested men be most quiet willing contented well behaved set of fellow have ever be pleasure to sail with do mean to tell that be plotting mischief among well sir be plottin something be certain if ai mischief why do keep out of argued joe how do know rather what make suppose be plotting asked why be everlastin'ly whispering together be reply if will only take notice sir will see that there be never minute day night what two three of have got head together palaverin if ever go near make show of chimin ' in talk stopped at once changed to something else away along in first dog watch for hour so steward will come for'ard then will all be a thick a thief together instead of turnin ' in gettin ' sleep a honest men must if be eight hour out chap slinks off down into fo cbe'le out o way if be eight hour in whole watch except will be on deck until pretty nigh on to four bell pretend do that fo cbe'le so hot ca sleep find too hot to sleep how do behave to asked oh a to conceded joe have got no fault to find be civil friendly enough exceptin ' cookie wo have word to say to come anigh if can help whatever be be belief that be at bottom of rest of 'em be right only wo have in with 'em durin confab pshaw good fellow exclaimed have found mare nest confab a call relate to nothing worse than past experience at mine will be bound reason why will not speak about to be most probably because think must not be interested in well sir maybe be right remarked joe believe be same if will excuse sayin ' so there be too much secrecy for everything to be quite right if mind must like to try little experiment spoke about just now if there be nothing wrong wo matter if there be perhaps will be inclined to have in with if think have fallen out of favour very well joe said have own way if like will not spare if do anything to vex only remember good fellow that may say will only be said to humour be right sir thank ye kindly there be just one thing more 'd like to say sir then 'd better stop talkin ' be just try to have talk with on quiet like leave everything to sir a soon a have found out anything will make chance to let know somehow so remarkable conversation ended must there possibly be anything in joe idea men seemed to be perfectly comfortable contented appeared to desire nothing in way of food accommodation beyond what already possessed have not grumbled made complaint what must be plotting to obtain asked question over over again must find answer to notwithstanding joe communication made feel exceedingly uneasy anxious so much so that when turned in found quite impossible to get to sleep may be readily imagined that when next have opportunity to observe men watched individually collectively most closely yet beyond trivial circumstance that conversation always ceased if happened to approach must detect nothing in men demeanour to lend slightest colour to joe supposition true two three of frenchman portuguese german for instance now impressed a being scarcely so civil in behaviour a have be when first joined ship that after might be only fancy if be not one hardly look for such good behaviour from foreigner a one be wont to receive from englishman a for joe martin began operation bright early on morning following conversation with be now ship carpenter in capacity have received order on previous day to fit new set of stern sheet in port quarter boat job began first thing in morning swinging inboard lowering to deck for greater convenience during progress of work simple matter managed so clumsily that contrived to bilge boat necessitating renewal of three timber plank be on deck at time of accident forgetting for moment scheme to provoke seeming quarrel with cautioned about awkward lubberly way in be proceeding recommended to get more help replied in offhand careless way that be quite man enough to do job a without anybody help a spoke down came boat with crash damage be done whole thing seemed piece of pig headed stupidity be thoroughly exasperated with fellow gave good sound rating much apparently to amusement of other men joe said nothing by way of excuse indeed attempt to excuse must have be so wholly out of place a only to have increased offence slouched away forward muttering to noticed stop say word two to couple of men who be at work upon forecastle then remembered proposal bethought that might be way of carrying out plan if so must not help admiring ingenuity albeit still decidedly annoyed with for powerful realism with be playing little comedy boat lay a have fallen for fully hour meanwhile joe have vanished cool behaviour on part nettled still more at length directed boatswain to pas word for joe to come aft upon joe made appearance obviously from forecastle wearing sulky sullen look always exasperated more thoroughly than anything else whenever met with in man be afraid be rather short tempered individual at time gave wigging a four hour earlier must not have believed possible ordering not to waste more time to set to work at once to repair damage occasioned by clumsiness whether joe began to guess from manner that have gone trifle too far know not at once went to work a have ordered worked moreover with will by eight bell in afternoon watch damage be repaired boat a good a ever be save for lick of paint over new work want joe now proceeded with great show of zeal to supply procuring pot of paint brush with came bustling aft now if there be one thing upon pride more than be scrupulous cleanliness of deck conceive therefore if can extremity of disgust annoyance when saw joe catch naked toe of right foot in corner of hen coop in agony drop pot of paint upon beautifully clean poop of course spilling whole content be true that forgetting pain next moment dropped upon knee contrived by scooping up spilled paint in palm of hand to replace considerable proportion of in pot after have done best with canvas turpentine horrible unsightly blotch still remained to mar hitherto immaculate purity of plank be therefore not to be wondered at if again administered sound hearty rating to culprit time in presence hearing of hand be more vexatious to that instead of expressing contrition for carelessness joe persistently maintained surly demeanour have exhibited more le throughout day anger however be short lived by time have have hour two for reflection must not help feeling have be decidedly harsh severe with fellow for what be practically first offence moreover have always hitherto behaved so exceedingly well have proved such splendid workman that have become great favourite with when therefore during dinner sir edgar made half jesting remark about joe misdeed be far more disposed to make excuse for man than to maintain semblance of annoyance have so conspicuously exhibited during day nevertheless deemed politic to do latter particularly while steward be about a felt that if rest of men be indeed traitor steward be probably same must in case be pretty certain to repeat in forecastle might be said in cabin a to joe misdemeanour be joe trick at wheel night for first half of first watch a passenger be about deck during whole time made attempt to enter into confidential communication with have other opportunity night on following day misdeed be not quite so egregious still contrived to behave like man who considered aggrieved when trick at wheel came round again during first half of afternoon watch steered so carelessly ran ship off course so abominably that have at last to send away from wheel summon man in place taking fullest advantage at same time of opportunity thus afforded to give good rating hot heavy a felt that intended must turn to grind water came round again at latter half of middle watch when came aft at four bell to relieve wheel took care to be at hand with reminder of shortcoming during previous afternoon stern expression of hope that must give further cause to complain of not content with took up position near with air be intended to convey to retiring helmsman determination to keep strict eye upon master joe conduct during remainder of watch joe waited minute two to allow other man to get fairly out of hearing forward then remarked be afraid sir rather overdone thing yesterday stavin ' in gig then capsizin ' paint if did hope will forgive sir remember a done for best overdid did for best ejaculated why confound man do mean to tell that did thing intentionally of course did sir answered joe in much lower tone than own obviously with intention of putting on guard see sir chap for'ard be pretty cute be too old bird to be caught with chaff knew that if be to get on blind side of 'em 'd have to be by mean of throwin ' into genuine downright passion with besides if will excuse for sayin ' of captain saint leger ai much of hactor sir be altogether too fair straightfor'ard aboveboard to be able to deceive fight on equal term with lot of sharp sly underhand sneakin ' beggar like in fo cbe'le so say to myself joe ' say if want that crowd to believe a be out of skipper favour be ready to join in mischief may be hatchin have got to do somethin ' to make cap'n real downright savage with yer be why done sir be boun ' to allow that capsizin ' of that there paint be perhaps comin ' of leetle too strong oh be right joe interrupted there be doubt about fact that succeeded in making genuinely angry with important question now be have have effect that anticipated have other men shown disposition to take into confidence make participator in plot whatever be that suppose to be hatching well sir not exactly joe admitted be in hope that will afore long if here unpleasantness between go on at present see know what may be temp'ry thing a will soon blow over if find that have got sort of spite again be always down upon drivin ' to desperation a may say will be pretty certain to have try to get over on side see sir be about a strong a e'er man aboard here if chap be up to mischief will nat'rally prefer to have with instead of again undoubtedly will agreed joe have not yet told exactly what be that suspect if be dissatisfied with food treatment accommodation must not come aft make complaint endeavour to get matter rectified in way never have done so indeed can not imagine what have to be dissatisfied with food be of very best description be possible to obtain forecastle be a roomy comfortable place a will meet with in ship of size a to work think have much to complain of on score sir no ai nothing of sort asserted joe be belief sir a have somehow got wind of treasure that be that be after treasure exclaimed in blank astonishment what treasure why treasure a expects to find on here island a be bound for lor ' bless sir continued joe noting consternation that unexpected communication have occasioned knowed about in fo cbe'le old hand mean afore ship arrived in sydney harbour be steward a brought news for'ard to one night be curious chap be a inquisitive a monkey always wanted to know in out of everything be goin on 'd noticed porin ' puzzlin ' over paper with lot of figure wrote on drorin ' in middle used to come for'ard tell that 'd be havin ' try to find out what figure meant one night be when be gettin ' well on toward sydney come for'ard in great excitement say say be blowed if skipper have be found out at last meanin ' of paper that be be puzzlin ' over durin ' whole of blessed voyage what do suppose be ' say well in course said did know of said did care either seein ' that be business of ours oh ai ' say p ' r'aps wo say ai business of yours when know what be ' say well say one of men be bill longman if think a concern why up tell what be instead of hangin ' in wind like ship in iron say so then steward tell a how mornin ' whilst be at breakfast in saloon 'd heard tellin ' about dream 'd have night before how started up in middle of meal rushed off to state room stayed there goodish while then went up on deck told sir edgar a 'd discovered meanin ' of paper be about how to find treasure be buried on desert island somewhere that intended to go on to sydney discharge cargo then take in ballast sail for pacific to find here island get treasure of course when 'd finished tellin ' about there be great palaver about buried treasure pretty nigh man in fo cbe'le pretended to have heard of similar case agreed a be lucky man hoped a how 'd find island treasure too by by after there have be good deal of talk of sort bill longman up say george ' say to steward have told yet how here affair concarns ' oh well ' say george with curious kind of laugh if see a how concarns why of course there ai no more to be said be must get out of steward night night two afterwards master george brings up subject again by sayin that suppose be likely a will offer to share here treasure with hand supposin ' that find then go on to say that for part see a treasure be yours more than be anybody else that in opinion if be ever found hand ought to share share alike of chap seemed to think be right others did bill up say look here george ' say supposin ' when get ashore at sydney be to find bag of sovereign in street must share with george said that 'd be different thing altogether from findin ' treasure on desert island have long argyment about must agree after that steward talked good deal more about sharin ' alike in treasure that if be of one mind must be done lot more stuff of same kind laughed at then came arrival of ship in sydney george bein ' paid off after heard ' more about treasure what make imagine that new men have got hold of story asked well sir said joe be just one two little thing have overheard said first thing a ever made suspect that there be somethin ' up be mention of word treasure cookie be man a seems to know most about be everlastin'ly talkin ' about fancy must have fallen in with steward somewhere ashore heard whole story from have cook to say about inquired ah be just what want to find out answered joe wo say anything to about just sits whisperin ' with head together away for'ard in far end of fo cbe'le notice a be always cook a have most to say rogers seems to be leadin spirit in job whatever be so little scheme of yesterday have borne fruit thus far suggested well not much said joe then expect to take into secret right off reel first time misbehave believe will have try to get in with before try to carry out plan last night when be sittin ' on chest grumblin ' growlin ' at way 'd be treated durin ' day here joe laughed softly a peculiar humour of situation seemed to present to cook wanted to know whether must rather be rich man than have to go to sea for rest of day rogers stopped with look said now doctor leave joe alone go puttin ' nonsensical notion into head leave to perhaps may have somethin ' to say to by by want nobody to interfere at in here matter ' be how thing stand at present very well said have told enough to satisfy that conjecture be by mean a groundless a supposed to be must do best joe to find out what can will have to be very careful what be about be clear enough that if meditate treachery of kind be not yet at disposed to trust if at contemplate possibility of winning over to join will set manner of trap for test in conceivable way before making up mind to trust yes assented joe expects will be ready for whenever like have got course marked out clear straight if rogers of others come soundin ' will be surprised to find what downright bad character be how ready be to take hand in mischief be brewin ' chapter fourteen plot counterplot secret conversation between joe secret by reason of intense darkness of night by precaution have deemed expedient to take at early stage of conversation to conceal precise whereabouts from prying eye among starboard watch at first produced within feeling of keenest uneasiness anxiety for joe revelation a to discovery by late steward of secret relating to concealed treasure furnished with what have previously be lacking namely motive for secret plotting of existence of joe be so firmly convinced story to have that night listened left room for doubt in mind that own want of caution late steward inquisitive propensity have placed within knowledge of latter two important fact possessed secret of concealed treasure that be intention on leaving sydney to proceed in search of moreover be clear enough that fellow have sooner acquired knowledge than concocted plan for eventual acquisition of treasure made effort to secure assistance of crew in carrying out of plan whatever might happen to have be failing in might not out of sheer malice have communicated secret to one else present cook for instance instigated man to take such step a have contemplated proceeding must at once account satisfactorily for curious fact have succeeded in obtaining crew when other shipmaster within port must do so only weak element of such supposition consisted in inability to reconcile to belief that man a late steward must ever under provocation be weak enough to part with secret might even under most unlikely combination of circumstance in most distant future possibly be of advantage to yet man martin whose life have saved who have impressed a being thoroughly honest straightforward trustworthy fellow roundly asserted that something of secret mysterious character be going on among newly shipped men something from on account of assumed integrity have be quietly yet consistently excluded have heard word treasure mentioned by presumable conspirator then argued with that after when one came to reflect upon exclusive way of ex gold miner mere mention of word treasure seemed rather slender thread from to weave so portentous suspicion a joe communication have suggested for aught knew late steward discourse upon subject of treasure might have be of such character a to suggest to mind of hearer absurdly exaggerated idea of value leaving upon honest joe mind impression that must be fabulously rich altogether kind of thing to obtain possession of men must hesitate at crime however monstrous having have experience of one attempt to gain possession of by mean of treachery be not natural that simple fellow discovering believing that have discovered something in nature of secret understanding among shipmate must at once leap to conclusion that be nothing le than second attempt upon treasure be being planned a to cook inquiry whether joe must not rather be rich man than be obliged to follow sea for remainder of life thought nothing of sailor like everybody else be possessed of rooted conviction that wealth be panacea of evil by time have reached point in mental argument be eight bell forbes coming on deck to relieve went to cabin more than half convinced that joe have after discovered mare nest having thus argued into more comfortable frame of mind lay down slept soundly until be called by steward at usual hour of rising will do joe justice to say that having settled in mind part that must play in drama that believed be evolving on board barque thenceforth played to life with skill so consummate a to deceive most suspicious assumed role of man who if let must be willing enough to do duty honestly to best of ability who must not must not tolerate smallest measure of injustice gave air of aggrieved person of one who have be harshly treated for trivial fault whole manner be very impersonation of sullen resentment careless slovenly way in performed duty be constant source of provocation to even though knew thought knew that be assumed so exasperating be that sometimes even doubted whether behaviour really be assumption whether after have not be deceived in man whether be not rather former good behaviour be assumed while present delinquency be result of outbreak of irrepressible evil in there be even time when asked whether might not be ringleader in very plot professed to be so anxious to discover whether anxiety to enlighten might not be assumed for purpose of blinding misleading more effectually never in life have witnessed so thorough radical change in one a seemed to have come over joe martin quiet word two with glance into honest eye when one be near enough at hand to read expression always sufficed to reassure a to absolute fidelity since be possible for to make doubt despite many evidence have afforded of honesty be not to be wondered at sir edgar lady emily be completely deceived by often did in comparative privacy of saloon deplore joe lamentable fall from original virtuous condition on such occasion always assumed tone of righteous indignation severity giving a free vent a possible to very real annoyance that fellow prank frequently occasioned inwardly resolving at same time that if emerged with unblemished reputation from perplexingly contradictory role be then enacting must do most lavish justice when proper time arrived number of men now have on board barque constitution of watch be such that one of joe trick at wheel always occurred from two to four o'clock on alternate morning be only opportunity when be possible for to exchange confidence with degree of safety from possibility of discovery consequently after having have chat with joe always have to wait forty eight hour before must learn what discovery if have made in interim after last recorded long chat that have have together two such opportunity have passed without occurrence of anything in forecastle of sufficiently definite character to furnish joe with matter for report though insisted that frequent brief hurried consultation increased caution of conspirator convinced that something very momentous must be impending such statement naturally reawakened anxiety be not lessened by fact that now have moon in second quarter affording sufficient amount of light to render confidential communication at night almost impossible without detection while to add to embarrassment expected to sight island within next forty hour thought time have now arrived when ought to take mate into confidence did so during progress of following afternoon watch taking care that conversation must be a brief a possible that must be conducted out of earshot of eavesdropper a have anticipated forbes seemed very much disposed to make light of matter to regard a hallucination of joe protesting so far from having observed symptom of revolt insubordination have be simply astonished at such orderly behaviour on part of men who have lived comparatively lawless life of digger on new gold field in short be thoroughly puzzled eventually agreed that under circumstance must be prudent to keep eye open to adopt precisely such precautionary measure a must resort to if be expecting men to break into open mutiny also undertook to find make opportunity to instruct joe that in event of making fresh discovery be at once to acquaint mate with if experienced difficulty in communicating with on same evening during first watch when lady having retired a usual about four bell sir edgar joined according to custom to smoke final cigar indulge in desultory chat before retiring to own cabin for night availed of opportunity to explain situation to also first cautioning not to exhibit astonishment other emotion might excite suspicion of helmsman who must doubtless have eye upon be of course naturally enough very much discomposed at such startling intelligence more so that be unable to give definite information a to character of danger with be threatened maintained same enviable coolness composure of manner have so greatly admired on memorable night of adventure in strait of sunda assured that might rely upon to be ready for action in emergency however sudden be middle watch below night have be in berth about hour tossing restlessly from side to side striving to devise plan to meet contingency must possibly think of when heard sound of muffled footstep outside state room door followed by very gentle cautious tap upon panelling yes answered in low cautious tone who be there be joe sir be reply in equally subdued tone of voice have got news for at last with vengeance opened door sure enough there stood joe glancing anxiously over shoulder a though moment expected to be followed dragged on deck before must make communication signing to to enter cabin noiselessly closed door behind pointing toward locker said now joe heave ahead man tell story in own way first of how did manage to get here without being seen by of men well sir said joe be very easy be fact wanted to have word with durin ' first watch be talking with sir edgar if have be 'd have ' be same because must have ' left forecastle without bein ' missed so have

sir thank joe said grasping honest fellow hand be long story have managed to make everything perfectly clear to fancy will not have much difficulty in circumventing rascal now if men must make alteration in plan must let know if possibly can be careful above thing that men will have cause to suspect fidelity to remember order may give execute to letter promptly now will go on deck have word two with mr forbes during must get away for'ard again a best can accordingly left joe in cabin sauntered up on deck a be often habit even in watch below ostensibly to take look at weather in reality to caution forbes against taking notice of joe must catch sight of individual moving about deck be by time nearly seven bell in middle watch moon hung low in western sky over port quarter mottling of fine weather cloud have gradually gathered in heaven while allowed few of larger star to gleam dimly through here there intercepted large proportion of starlight rendered night dark enough to make joe escape forward comparatively easy matter mate be pacing poop slowly fore aft a emerged from companion catching sight of came to side remarked night continues fine sir wind seems inclined to drop be only going four half when hove log at four bell now seem to be scarcely going four yes said have dropped perceptibly since went below if will only last at will be at anchor by sunset to morrow then in lower tone added if see joe martin creeping away for'ard from saloon take notice of make sign that be aware of presence have much to tell must wait for more favourable opportunity at moment joe head emerged from darkness of companion so walked aft glanced into binnacle then abstractedly placed before helmsman in position a to obstruct view of part of maindeck joe must have to traverse before reaching concealing shadow of long boat stood thus apparently sunk in reflection until observed joe glide across exposed space disappear when went back to cabin fully dressed in readiness to go on deck again at eight bell chapter fifteen arrive at treasure island during succeeding watch have leisure to take careful mental review of joe story conclusion at arrived be that man moore having failed in endeavour to seduce original crew of esmeralda from duty have on arrival at sydney sooner recognised probability of desertion for aught knew to contrary might very possibly have contributed to bring about than must have devoted to task of collecting party of men whose wile have now to circumvent what patient crafty fellow man have proved to be really appeared a though must have have almost from outset of voyage suspicion a to character of cryptogram over have seen puzzling so often might not have gathered nature from chance word two overheard while have be discussing subject with sir edgar for sooner became aware in general way of content than be ready with plan by to turn adventure to own advantage be persevering too for plan have sooner failed than must have gone to work to formulate so skilfully devised so carefully carried through for joe devoted fidelity must have infallibly succeeded indeed felt by mean satisfied that must not succeed even now true design a revealed to joe might be very easily frustrated there be unpleasant doubt in mind a to bona fides of revelation must scarcely believe that men who have already exhibited such indisputable proof of extreme caution steadfast self control must be so easily imposed upon a appeared to have be by joe what if have seen through device have suspected intention must not in case have realised that suspicion be aroused might not have merely feigned to have fallen into joe trap have confided to purely fictitious statement of plan concocted for express purpose of throwing off guard leading astray taking into account deep guile have prompted to adopt consistently maintain course of most orderly irreproachable behaviour a most likely mean of blinding to averting faintest suspicion of nefarious design must not help feeling that line of action on part be only too probable in casting about in mind for effectual method of subverting plan fully realised must have to take contingency into consideration while preparing also counterplot to revealed by man rogers to joe of one thing one thing only must be certain be that nobody not even knew amount of treasure appeared to that upon fact must base plan reflection given above in very condensed form fully occupied mind during first hour half of watch be only interrupted by appearance in eastern quarter of first faint paling of darkness heralded dawn of new day temporarily diverted thought into new channel for upon solving enigma of cryptogram first act have be to consult chart of pacific with resulting discovery that such island a referred to in saint leger document be to be found upon now ship position on previous noon run since then be such that if morning happened to break clear island ought to be just visible right ahead at daybreak provided of course that man who secreted treasure have made mistake in calculation on one hand thought probable that considering important issue at stake utmost care must be taken to verify position of island beyond possibility of error while on other be curious fact that such island not even rock indeed shoal water appeared on chart in position indicated circumstance coupled with knowledge of imperfect character of instrument in use by navigator of period at cryptogram have be written caused now to experience little curiosity anxiety a to what approaching daylight might reveal be not to be left long in suspense be in tropic where light come go with rush few minute only intervening between broad day deepest night first faint streak of scarcely perceptible pallor along verge of eastern horizon on starboard bow lengthened widened grew more pronounced even a gazed upon until became broad segment of cold colourless light insensibly melting out of circumscribing darkness then faint delicate tone of softest primrose began to steal through quickly strengthening brightening a light spread upward right left paling star one by one until dwindled away vanished in soft rich blue be swiftly chasing darkness across sky anon warm rich rosy flush began to pervade primrose tone of eastern horizon against level line of ocean marge cut sharply in tone of deepest indigo while overhead brightening blue be delicately mottled with whole archipelago of thin fleecy cloudlets pink tinged bordered along lower edge with purest gold be mysteriously floating into view apparently from illimitable space then from point on horizon where deepening rose colour glowed most brilliantly up shot single white ray perpendicularly toward zenith narrow well defined where sprang from horizon broadening a soared aloft until became lost among lowest tier of cloud now deeply tinged with dye of richest crimson single ray have scarcely made apparent ere be followed by others radiating fan wise from same spot in instant spark of golden flame flashed across sea from horizon at point of junction of ray tingeing small wave crest in wake with ruddy gold deepened first into line then into broad path of shimmering golden radiance a burning rim of sun soared slowly out of purple sea at same instant man who have lookout who have stationed on topgallant forecastle right in eye of ship turned sharply round facing poop reported land ho right ahead have be so completely absorbed in contemplation of magnificent spectacle of sunrise for moment have entirely forgotten island everything connected with cry of lookout brought back to mind with flash moving to mizzen rigging springing upon hen coop directed gaze straight ahead with hand over eye to shield from dazzle of sun yes there be undoubtedly faint pinkish grey shape right over starboard cat head a then stood low hummock on left with hill next outline of even at distance bore striking resemblance to man nose upper lip on right of showing just clear of horizon yes there be treasure island beyond question next point to be determined be whether treasure still lay buried there if so how be to obtain retain possession of of one thing felt morally certain be that a soon a men felt assured that whole of treasure be on board must take ship from by force guile if must be of course open to to make fight for if chose even assuming must reckon upon sir edgar assistance a felt sure must must make only four of to oppose eleven men who have manner of doubt must prove a resolute determined in stand up fight a have already shown to be in pursuit of organised plan odds be nearly three to one against opposed to with for antagonist resolute men whose knowledge of consequence must inevitably follow upon unsuccessful attempt at piracy must nerve to desperation men who be unquestionably full of brute courage who be doubtless a well armed a ourselves be justified in entertaining slightest hope of success in event of submitting matter to arbitrament of battle answer to question be unqualified if then be hopeless to expect that resort to force must enable to retain property freedom freedom property ay perhaps even life of who in crisis a must naturally look to for preservation of must resort to guile mortally hate anything that in slightest degree savour of deception in word conduct have made invariable rule never to engage in transaction needing one other for successful accomplishment here be case in have choice to meet guile with guile how be to be done possibly if treasure happened to be in compact form easily accessible forbes joe might be able to secure convey on board ship unknown to men while be busily engaged in digging for elsewhere for now that be aware of existence seemed to that best chance of success lay in employing in search while taking care that none of must find must naturally lead to conclusion that if document be not ingenious hoax treasure have already be discovered secured by somebody else plan rather took fancy be simple feasible demanded elaborate system of deception men must simply be set to dig upon certain spot failing after sufficiently exhaustive search to find anything digging must be abandoned must be sent to various more le distant part of island to cut sandal wood more thought of better liked when later on during forenoon found opportunity to talk over with sir edgar forbes having previously related to substance of joe communication made to during middle watch agreed with that failing better scheme saw reason why must not be successful sir edgar a have anticipated declared ready to act in way might suggest at moment notice now that have have time to think over former communication to to grow accustomed to idea of coming contest either of strength wit with men be a eager for fray a schoolboy be for great cricket match of year meanwhile wind have slightly freshened with rising of sun ship be gliding along upon taut bowline under plain

horizon be curious to note how exact resemblance outline bore to profile of upturned human face lying prone along water be so striking that even child remarked upon while a for men must scarcely remove eye from though interest in place be doubtless founded more upon wealth hoped to find upon than upon very singular appearance noted morning without appearing to do so that there be great deal of animated conversation going on upon forecastle accompanied by many stealthy glance toward poop while late steward now sweltering in heat of galley of hirsute disguise be being continually appealed

own to get nearer peep at place without moment unnecessary delay felt bound to point out to lady absolute necessity for determining question whether not there be inhabitant on island before exposing to possible risk of landing objection to immediate landing on part of lady did not however apply with equal force in case of of sterner sex therefore ordered gig to be lowered arming of crew with brace of loaded revolver prepared to make preliminary trip a far a creek referred to in cryptogram upon hearing give order to get boat ready sir edgar asked permission to accompany few minute later

swiftly gathering darkness must permit so might carry tolerably distinct impression of in mind eye a aid to plan must now definitely form arrange before next sunrise a may be supposed have by time got word of cryptogram off by heart indeed have destroyed translation lest must fall into other hand therefore knew exactly what have to look for a mark to guide to hiding place of treasure accordingly kept very sharp lookout for obelisk rock there be only one rock to be seen on islet at answered to description so far a must distinguish in gloom be pointed needle like mass forming summit of steep cliff rose precipitously from water edge constituted northern extremity of islet on getting round to other side be vexed chagrined to find that whole surface of islet on southern side of curious cliff be densely overgrown with tree scrub must certainly have to be cut deeply into in order to arrive at spot where treasure be said to be buried condition of affair natural enough though be have somehow never occurred to have fully expected to find hiding place located in open space might be conveniently traversed in direction enabling situation of treasure to be determined by simple process of measuring off thousand foot in direction due south from base of obelisk rock possibly that might have be condition of islet at period when treasure be buried indeed very probably be there have be ample time for ground to have become overgrown since then now be so densely covered with vegetation that must be hopeless to think of getting at hiding place without assistance of men meant absolute overthrow of plan to keep recovery of treasure secret from be to be done racked brain during whole of long hot breathless night in fruitless endeavour to devise satisfactory way out of difficulty arose from sleepless bunk next morning with splitting headache nothing in shape of settled plan beyond determination to find good long job for men execution of must afford further time for reflection perhaps allow event to develop acting then upon resolution caused gig to be brought alongside immediately after breakfast ordered ax shovel to be passed into at same time issuing instruction for hand except cook steward to get into go on shore with men bustled about nothing loth for be not going to get change from monotony of sea life at same time provide with mean of unlimited indulgence in more le vicious enjoyment for remainder of life noticed with impotent anger that having at length arrived a supposed at goal of villainous scheme with wealth be to be reward of treachery within grasp a believed restraint have hitherto so rigorously imposed upon be in measure laid aside began to reveal in speech in action a unscrupulous scoundrel that be paid attention however to anything saw heard leaving to believe if pleased that regarded behaviour a simple ebullition of high spirit at prospect of little recreation ashore passing sextant other paraphernalia carefully down into boat quickly followed gave order to shove off there be twelve of told in boat be therefore pretty deep in water notwithstanding so eager be men to get at treasure that in le than ten minute from time of leaving ship be once more in creek pulling toward head north eastern corner at point have noticed on preceding evening that timber appeared to be growing more thickly heavily than elsewhere where consequently task of penetrating for distance must involve greatest labour consume most time a drew near shore at point observed what have escaped notice on preceding evening that small stream of beautifully clear crystal water came brawling down through steep narrow ravine discharged into creek exactly at spot for be heading at once resolved to avail of presence a mean of deluding men into belief that be working at right spot accordingly when boat grounded upon beach ordered everybody out of with pick shovel set hand to work cutting peg long slender rod under direction of boatswain retaining forbes san domingo negro a assistant in own especial part of work within ten minute fellow have cut peg rod must possibly require then looking carefully anxiously about at length fixed stout peg with nicest accuracy in sand at junction with grass exactly at edge of stream then sent men here there with long wand made hold exactly perpendicular on ground adjusting position with most finicking precision until have wrought firmly into belief that whole of labour be gone through for purpose of finding exact spot where treasure lay buried finally set out by compass indicated by mean of two long slender rod stuck upright into sand line must take straight into bush where be thickest most impenetrable told to cut straight line in direction exactly two thousand yard in length from peg have driven at margin of bush task entrusted to rogers six other men who struck a being blackest sheep of flock while with forbes joe martin barr mckinley christianssen san domingo took boat with sufficient supply of ax shovel made best of way to southern side of small islet upon treasure be said to be hidden upon arrival at desired spot impression of preceding evening that be entirely overgrown be fully confirmed proving to be literally impossible to find place where landing must be effected without first clearing away scrub there be difference however between growth on islet at spot where have left boatswain party at work whereas latter consisted almost exclusively of huge tree former be composed largely of scrub with only few tree here there so that must not be nearly so difficult to penetrate a other be evident indeed to at glance now have full light of day to aid in inspection that growth upon islet be of much more recent date than upon part of main island in sight from spot fact tended to confirm previous suspicion at time of burial of treasure soil of islet have be bare nearly so of arboreal growth growth however be there now constituted very formidable difficulty for how be to identify point exactly one thousand foot south of obelisk rock unless must move freely over ground for purpose of obtaining precise bearing distance suddenly brilliant idea struck immediately opposite point on islet at wished to land there be broad strip of sandy beach constituting indeed part of margin of basin of islet formed centre must be possible to make measurement from point there must be harm in trying at event accordingly pulled across water landing at part of beach looked eminently promising first thing be to determine direction of line running due south from topmost pinnacle of obelisk rock after few trial with compass got next act be to erect line perpendicular to along sandy margin of basin accomplished with aid of sextant taking care to make second line a long a nature of ground must allow then driving peg into sand at intersection of two line at farther extremity of second line have right angled triangle whereof two peg obelisk rock marked angle have now only to measure very carefully second line did by mean of surveyor tape measure bought at sydney for purpose to take angle between perpendicular hypothenuse of triangle when have mean of calculating of element of triangle desired in way then ascertained that pinnacle of obelisk rock be exactly six thousand four hundred seventy seven foot due north of peg have driven into sand to mark intersection of two line then returning to same peg sent forbes away to islet in boat with instruction to set up one of oar with white pocket handkerchief attached to on shore of islet at precise spot must indicate to by signal spot arranged to be exactly in line with peg obelisk rock three point therefore be in one straight line bearing of be due north south while northern extremity be obelisk rock next task be to take angle to oar from peg at have taken angle to obelisk rock enabled to determine that oar be three thousand eight hundred two foot from intersecting peg consequently two thousand six hundred seventy five foot from obelisk rock completed data required for have now only to drive bold conspicuous staff into sand in place of intersecting peg into ground on islet where oar now stood by cutting back into scrub for distance of one thousand six hundred seventy five foot toward obelisk rock using two stave a guide to keep line straight worker must reach spot exactly thousand foot south from obelisk rock in other word hiding place of treasure two guiding stave be soon fixed then leaving forbes to superintend operation of joe barr mckinley replaced instrument in boat with christianssen san domingo at oar paddled on board barque for purpose of bringing sir edgar whole of party on shore in order that might indulge in run on beautiful sandy strand of basin enjoy nearer view of entrancing loveliness of exquisite gem of pacific chapter sixteen finding of treasure what followed knowing that there be work enough to occupy party on islet for probably next two day did not consider necessary to keep watch upon labour left with forbes in charge joined desmond party in ramble over island by following ravine bottom of be comparatively free from undergrowth found le difficult of accomplishment than have anticipated although toil of clambering up steep acclivity over smooth boulder that in many place encumbered way proved rather trying to unaccustomed limb nevertheless managed to make way to summit of nose a called from whence obtained superb panoramic view of entire island that place be uninhabited must now no longer doubt for although from lofty standpoint have whole surface of island spread out like map beneath there be nowhere break in dense vegetation flourished so luxuriantly on rich soil nothing to indicate existence of cleared cultivated patch a there certainly must have be have island be inhabited did observe sign trace whatever of animal of sort bird seemed to be only living creature inhabiting lovely spot appeared to swarm in thousand wherever happened to come upon comparatively open space fruit of several kind abounded on island among most abundant being banana mango breadfruit cocoa nut be also fortunate enough to come upon several granadilla vine product of be just ripe accordingly loaded with a many of delicious fruit a must carry return journey be effected by somewhat shorter route than have followed on outward way eventually hit upon ravine down brawled small stream of deliciously sweet crystal clear water following came out upon margin of basin at point where rogers party be working despite intense heat perfect plague of mosquito fellow be toiling a if for life have already succeeded in clearing line of fully hundred foot in length critically examined work pronounced right then went on to islet sir edgar discussing by way distracting question of how crew be to be dealt with in event of finding treasure question seemed to resolve into that men must either be taken away in ship left on island if former must certainly have to be taken a prisoner since if free must assuredly seize ship even if have to murder in order to accomplish purpose a prisoner however must be worse than useless must be continual menace source of anxiety sir edgar consequently agreed with must be fully justified in leaving at event worst of behind at length determined to do watching opportunity to divide up into small party upon pretext making prisoner of in detail thus minimising risk of fight too probable accompaniment loss of life there must be likelihood whatever of rascal starving in land of plenty a island have proved to be must not possibly suffer very serious discomfort in so genial climate treasure once secured must be difficult matter to arrange for speedy rescue matter settled felt somewhat easier in mind now only required opportunity to discus arrange detail with forbes joe on reaching islet found that here too wonderful progress have be made party under forbes having already cleared line through scrub of very nearly four hundred foot in length be due to fact that have hitherto encountered tree in actual line of work though several have be very narrowly missed be apparent however that on morrow must be le fortunate for be by mean sorry a must lengthen duration of work afford better opportunity for completing plan same evening after dinner forbes sir edgar discussed matter in detail finally completed certain arrangement appeared to to promise fairly satisfactory solution of whole difficulty on following day found opportunity to communicate to joe pith of arrangement be to be put into operation a soon a ever treasure if found must be safely placed on board barque cheerfully undertook to maintain constant watch for signal to be ready for action whenever must make next three day passed uneventfully away men working perhaps not quite so hard a have at outset still making fairly good progress party on islet have reached to within eighty foot of goal when knocked off that night now for first time think began to fully realise momentous character of issue be probably to be decided within next twenty four hour must treasure be found hitherto have never occurred to to seriously reflect that there might possibly be unfavourable reply to question now that only few short hour lay between certainty suddenly began to comprehend how much depended upon whether reply must prove to be yea nay almost uncontrollable impatience to have matter definitely decided took possession of rendering sleep night impossibility even with impatient though time may lag upon leaden wing pass at last morning at length dawned upon with nerve quieted steadied by exhaustion reaction from night intolerable excitement a be confidently expected that if treasure really existed still reposed in alleged hiding place must day be found lady determined to go on shore to witness disinterment taking nursemaid child with in order that latter might enjoy what must probably prove to be last opportunity for ramble on lovely island accordingly party being large one gig be manned hand of even to cook steward went ashore leaving ship to take care of wind being gentle breeze from eastward somewhat off land with fine settled look about weather rogers party resumed usual work at head of basin forbes with gang vigorously attacked narrow belt of scrub still interposed between goal happened however that bit of scrub be more thickly dotted with tree than other portion that have yet met with so that be four o'clock in afternoon before very careful final measurement assured that most laborious part of task have come to end ground however be still covered with debris have to be cleared away before actual digging operation must be commenced occupied fully hour by time evening shadow have begun to climb up hillside nevertheless men seized pick shovel with renewed energy began to turn up ground toiled thus for hour by time have excavated hole three foot deep in centre have actually with great reluctance given word to knock off when barr driving pick deep into ground where intended to leave night struck upon something harder than soil hurrah boy exclaimed here be something at last stick to let see what be before leave at again accordingly went with such desperate vigour that perspiration literally poured off arm down neck in few minute succeeded in laying bare top of solid timber chest strongly bound with iron be very anxious to get chest out of ground there then on attempting to clear earth away from round about be found that chest be only one of several others packed closely together so that must be necessary to reach one of outer chest before of must be conveniently moved be consequently compelled to content night with knowledge that have found something to wait until next morning to ascertain value of discovery following sunrise found once more en route for shore time provided with couple of spare studding sail boom to act a sheers for more convenient hoisting out of chest together with such rope block etcetera a must require for purpose size of chest however be such a must probably tax strength of entire party to handle be therefore reluctantly compelled to call in assistance of rogers party even thus reinforced soon became apparent that heavy task lay before be not until boatswain be piping to breakfast that first chest be successfully broken out raised to surface breakfast be soon over morning then question arose how be such ponderous chest to be conveyed to ship measured roughly about two half foot square be so heavy that eight men who must conveniently get round one of must not raise weight from ground much le carry along narrow path cumbered with stump prostrate trunk of tree greatly a disliked such proceeding seemed that there be alternative to break open chest convey content piecemeal to boat course be therefore perforce adopted task of merely breaking open chest proved to be one of ordinary difficulty for be constructed of solid oak nearly three inch thick so well made so strongly bound with iron must not help surmising that must have be chest in spaniard have originally stowed treasure specially made for purpose be black with age timber be perfectly sound while iron band though more than half eaten away with rust be still stout enough to give immense amount of trouble at length however first chest be broken open be found to contain sixty four brick ingot of solid silver be arranged in four tier of sixteen brick exactly fitting chest brick weighed about quarter of hundredweight chest therefore if contained same precious metal must represent value of sixteen hundredweight of silver how many chest there be did not yet know be evident that there be several said there be eight nine thought there must be more judging by way in be arranged in ground men be now divided into two working party one of under supervision carried silver to one of boat while other under forbes proceeded to break out open chest content of one chest considered sufficient load for gig accordingly a soon a amount have be placed in shoved off for ship crew consisting of joe norwegian negro american named barr on arriving alongside silver be simply passed up side pitched down after hatchway upon ballast for present lady who have elected to remain on board day on account of heat be so filled with excitement delight at sight of silver news of find that must no longer remain quietly where be must need go ashore once more see wealth brought out of ground accordingly upon return passage went with taking maid child with on arrival at islet found second gig awaiting with cargo in other party have just finished loading so left one boat took other treating cargo a have last so work went merrily on until men dinner time by time have raised transported eight box of silver have by time be ascertained that there be eight more still to be dealt with hurried meal be snatched work be resumed three more of chest being disposed of by three o'clock in afternoon then surprise met next chest contained gold instead of silver ingot being only nine in number somewhat larger than silver ingot weighing a nearly a must estimate about one hundredweight of gold ingot be neatly wrapped sewn into covering of hide on return from ship after conveying precious cargo on board be met with news that two other chest since opened also contained gold not to detain reader necessarily eventually proved that remaining case two in number likewise contained same precious metal total find thus consisted of eleven chest containing seven hundred four ingot of silver five chest containing one hundred thirty five ingot of gold through long hot afternoon work went on with unremitting energy for soon became apparent that darkness must be upon before last of treasure must be moved be just completing transfer of third chest of gold to ship when sun sank in perfect blaze of splendour below horizon few of brighter star be already twinkling in zenith when ranged up alongside other boat at landing place upon islet a stepped out of light boat into loaded one directed crew to follow one of men irishman named o'connor touched forehead in approved shell back style observed av ye plaise sor misther forbes be sayin ' must ye be so kind a to sthep along to houle afore ye make next thrip to ship be afther wantin ' to shpake to ye oh very good said stepping ashore directed joe to go across to other side of basin to fetch lady child who have crossed earlier in afternoon now stood waiting to be conveyed back to ship then went groping way along dark uneven path toward hole man o'connor somebody else who be must not distinguish in gloom be stumbling along in front of making very poor headway thought for quickly overtook be in way working along a be two abreast for path be very narrow so said to here let pas two be in hurry stepped aside without word one to one side of pathway one to other a passed between one of cried now before must even so much a think flung upon bore to ground one of springing upon from behind with arm round neck knee into small of back while other dashed upon knee on chest gripped

from prostrate body saw that made movement for time have kept so tight hold upon throat that fairly strangled though still in dreamy way heard speaking strength have entirely left be scarcely conscious of surroundings will fire shot to let others know that be right then will have to carry a far a boat remarked rogers perhaps dip in water may bring round such extreme measure however proved unnecessary for throat once released sens began to come back to by time that have reached shore of islet be once more able to stand arrived here be compelled to enter empty gig be carried across to opposite shore of creek where lady still remained order to bring across having be countermanded in whisper by one of men moment have turned back on reaching other side be ordered out of boat loaded revolver being exhibited a hint to to hasten movement a stumbled forward over thwart joe offered support of arm murmuring in ear a stepped out on sand cheer up cap'n here be most unexpected move mistake ship ai gone yet from what heard passin ' among others just now afore come up ai by mean sure a will leave to night of be that greedy that want to stop have shy at other treasure if doe there be knowin ' what may happen betwixt now then if make up mind to go go with will slip overboard swim ashore if there be other way of joinin have only time to murmur word of thanks for expression of sympathy when left returned to boat immediately shoved off for islet lady who with nursemaid child still stood waiting to be conveyed to ship saw by action of men that there be something amiss now approached inquiring anxiously what be matter of course have alternative to explain to that men have risen in mutiny have seized ship although made a light of a must be sorry tale at best have to tell be still in midst of story when phosphorescent flash of oar became visible in black shadow of islet presently outline of boat telling dark upon starlit surface of still water be seen approaching a drew near voice of rogers came pealing across water shore ahoy just walk bit farther back from water edge there will be obliged to fire be about to land sir edgar if there be sign of rush at boat will shoot to kill so if want to be hurt 'd better stand well back hold on there moment answered back disregarding threat surely men intend to abandon here unarmed without shelter from weather with only clothes stand up in oh will do well enough doubt replied rogers brutally want arm because there be nobody nothing here that will hurt need clothes because climate so warm that can do without a to shelter why have left ax shovel ashore be welcome to if ca build house with such tool a deserves to go without there be plenty of fruit plenty of good water so wo starve lastly there be chance for to get treasure be in other hole if decides that want ourselves what exclaimed indignantly after stealing ship treasure from will not go to small trouble of passing lady child clothing into boat sending well if wo stand back take that interrupted rogers a word left lip there be flash sharp report bullet went singing close past ear at same moment felt arm seized by white figure unexpectedly appeared at side miss merrivale voice rendered almost inarticulate by scorn anger exclaimed leave cowardly brute alone will not humiliate further by stooping to ask favour from even on behalf will wantonly expose to risk of being murdered in cold blood will not have with dragged unresistingly to spot where sister child stood then without word of warning flung prone upon sand burst into perfect passion of tear nay give way thus pray said a knelt beside raised prostrate form in arm plight be bad enough grant though not so bad that might not easily be very much worse if will only try to be brave patient will soon arrange matter so that will not be altogether destitute of comfort do think care for own comfort interrupted passionately a wretch said be not likely to starve suppose edgar will be able to build shelter a will suffice to protect from sun rain be not that be oh base ungrateful contemptible creature to treat like be sure will be punished for ay that will exclaimed sir edgar cheerily a joined group well emmie darling chick will be very dreadful hardship for to sleep on beautiful soft white sand to night to morrow will have light enough to work by have doubt that before end of day saint leger will have contrived to stick up hut something to cover why child be regular genuine picnic in will have everything to do for will be able to help too will be glorious fun for will not so on never in life before have seen man take heavy bitter blow so bravely a gallant gentleman did knew for have already have time to fully realise so cruel abandonment meant to yet courage never faltered for moment not faintest glimpse did allow to appear of anguish must have at moment be wringing heart voice manner whole bearing be inflexibly dominated by determination to cheer encourage dear one who be now absolutely dependent upon alone for support encouragement to meet face sudden dreadful reverse of fortune a looked at listened to in astonishment admiration felt ashamed at own despondency at condition temporary only though believed to be of complete helplessness to blow have reduced in contemplating such indomitable courage not only learned lesson trust have benefited toned whole life since then also gathered fresh courage resolution to face responsibility demand of immediate present chapter seventeen recapture of barque under soothing influence of brother in law admirable manner miss merrivale soon recovered wonted serenity of manner while lady emily seemed never to have lost hers so absolute be trust confidence in husband power to strengthen reassure in le than hour therefore after departure of boat be sitting in circle upon sandy beach of basin regaling upon of fruit that lady have gathered earlier in day discussing meanwhile possibility of situation notwithstanding brutally callous behaviour of rogers still hoped sir edgar fully believed that majority of men on board must be sufficiently swayed by motif of humanity to insist upon bringing ashore clothing at least few of more obvious necessity of life such a spare sail coil two of line few nail hammer saw trifle of crockery cooking utensil above fowling piece ammunition miss merrivale however be positive that must not a time dragged slowly by without sign of reappearance of boat began at last to fear that must prove to be right brightening in sky to eastward over crest of lofty height towered above in direction at length announced rising of moon at same time made aware that four hour have elapsed since sunset a mild radiance of silver luminary met gaze started to foot said there be moon rising will soon have light enough to make final disposition for night meanwhile a be perfectly safe here will endeavour to make way round to beach abreast of ship see what be about on board if intend to go to sea to night will soon be making move to get under way if there may yet be chance for to do something with martin assistance what exclaimed sir edgar do still believe in fellow fidelity yes said stoutly well answered sir edgar did most implicitly since shameful business of evening must confess have begun to entertain doubt of plan precaution see have be framed upon information with have supplied if really be in men confidence anxious to serve how came that be not aware of coup men have so successfully executed if aware of intention why did not make opportunity to warn confess to appears very much a though men have along feared suspicion on part have employed to throw off guard said meditatively can not think that there be certainly one two circumstance connected with behaviour can not at present fully understand perhaps will now never know whether be really faithful not still believe to be so feel confident that if can not help in other way forbes between will devise mean for procuring speedy rescue now be off for beach suppose will remain here can scarcely do better to night be desirable must know exactly where to find again without difficulty must unforeseen contingency arise while be speaking miss merrivale have risen to foot impetuously with eager determined look in face of one who be about to say do something of very decisive character if such be intention checked seemingly at moment when word be about to escape lip contented by saying instead pray be very careful what do captain remember that be now utterly dependent upon assured that might depend absolutely upon discretion smiling rather bitterly meanwhile at reflection that throughout business at least discretion have be by mean brilliantly conspicuous so with bow left little party clustered together upon white sand curious yet pretty picture to one who must have be suddenly transported from surroundings of civilisation to lonely island of pacific making way rapidly along margin of basin close to water edge where sand be firm walking consequently easy soon reached projecting point marked junction of creek with river bent step along narrow beach toward estuary for distance in direction only sound to break silence of night be loud continuous indescribable chirr of countless myriad of insect haunted recess of jungle at length on rounding bend in river caught sight of barque still at anchor at same moment became conscious of new sound that a progressed toward mouth of river gradually resolved into tone of human voice uplifted in attempt at melody thought struck a sound first met ear be that men have decided to go to sea forthwith be now heaving short cable impression at once determined to push on watch departure of sweet little craft a worked way cautiously along toward open beach keeping well within shadow of tree in order that movement might not attract attention for moon somewhat past full now rode high enough in cloudless sky to render most minute object distinctly visible bethought that mutineer must not be getting anchor must by time hear sharp clank of windlass pawl mingling with song moreover be now near enough to distinguish that singing be not wailing monotonous chant rousing chorus of shanty confused medley of sound a though hand be singing at once man different tune at once came to conclusion that fellow have secured liquor be indulging in carouse must be indeed case fervently hoped that be must probably not desist until man have become helplessly intoxicated a have doubtless secured forbes so effectually that there must be possibility of recovering freedom until one chose to release while must scarcely deign to give thought to on shore with knowledge that ship be distant at least mile from nearest point of beach that gig be securely swinging at davit a conviction dawned upon feeling of renewed hope fierce exultation leapt up in heart brain at once became busy with plan for recovery of ship for one of few accomplishment be be fast tireless swimmer provided that there be shark in neighbourhood half mile of water intervened between esmeralda be more formidable obstacle than have consisted of firm level roadway judging however by present vigorous character of singing came pealing across to from ship opportune moment for attempt a meditated be yet good hour distant therefore determined to stroll leisurely back to party at creek acquaint with new phase of affair when at length rejoined group found that during absence sir edgar have so far completed arrangement for night that maid child be comfortably bestowed upon warm yielding sand fast asleep with head face well shielded from ray of moon by small tent like structure consisting of shawl stretched over arrangement of stick cunningly bound together with tough pliant monkey rope while lady emily slumbered peacefully by husband side with arm about waist while head rested upon shoulder miss merrivale however sir edgar be still awake a approached former started to foot with finger upon lip a pointed to little group of sleeper murmured softly how long have be what eager glad look there be in face what have happened be sure have good news to tell good thus far admitted that ship have not yet gone to sea believe that will not now go until to morrow men appear to have obtained possession of liquor be indulging in royal carouse if one may judge by singing noise heard going on aboard when be down at beach be not without hope ere night be much older fellow will have drunk into helpless state of intoxication now if upon return presently to late post of observation must have reason to believe that thing have happened will swim quietly off to ship endeavour to get on board without disturbing anybody must be able to manage next task will be to discover liberate mate once accomplished will go hard with if succeed in retaking ship from drunken rascal repaying in own coin by jove saint leger be grit through a yankee say be bold scheme believe will succeed exclaimed sir edgar admiringly must that must accompany added wistfully for in such undertaking additional man on side be of incalculable value unfortunately swimming power be not equal to anything like stretch of water a between shore ship must only be embarrassment instead of help to unless indeed must contrive to do distance with aid of log to float said be infinitely grateful to sir edgar for readiness to assist in undertaking be not to be thought of place be manifestly here by side of family so must event turn out awkwardly may not be left on island without defender will not however contemplate such unfortunate ending a to adventure on contrary let rather look forward hopefully to prospect of breakfasting on board a usual to morrow morning understand of course must succeed first act after securing mutineer will be to come ashore in boat for do suppose know that exclaimed miss merrivale impetuously be desperately dangerous enterprise if oh why be that woman be such shamefully useless creature in crisis like if strength be only equal to courage must not even then be more absolutely irresistible than now be interrupted with low bow poor attempt at gallantry turn will come however be assured of continued for whichever way project of mine turn will have ample opportunity for display of courage helpfulness must ever succeed in recapturing ship be more than probable that will sometimes be compelled to call upon to afford help in such matter a steering of so on be full early yet to talk like so far a be concerned call will not be in vain exclaimed spirited girl with flash of eye thrilled through like electric shock if have not physical strength of man have at least a resolute will be mean substitute for now good bye for see that be longing to get away will be careful though will not not run unnecessary risk took hand be so frankly extended to gave hearty squeeze gazed for instant into eye dwelt so anxiously upon mine immeasurably cheered encouraged by interest sympathy that read there turned away quickly stepped briskly out toward mouth of creek once more time have taken to walk to from basin appeared to have sufficed carouser to drink well on toward condition of oblivion for when again reached beach opposite ship singing have subsided into occasional maudlin howl that in turn soon afterwards yielded to stupefying effect of liquor dead silence fell upon ship did not wait however for final stage of insensibility to arrive among mutineer kicked off shoe laying with hat jacket upon sand immediately upon arrival at former post of observation at once entered water started to swim with long steady deliberate stroke toward ship water be perfectly calm smooth a well a deliciously warm so that despite leisurely character of exertion made excellent progress in shorter time than have thought possible found within deep shadow of ship hull everything be by time a silent a death on board save for slight jerk of wheel chain sob of water along bend about rudder a ship swung gently upon long low ground swell edge of just caught a crept up from westward across mouth of small estuary where lay at anchor so still silent be breathless night that volume of sound raised by insect on shore rang in ear almost a distinctly out here a have done when stood upon beach be however so far mellowed softened by intervening distance that be possible to hear other sound distinctly through even when be so faint a slight almost imperceptible creak of yard parrels aloft light flap of coiled up rope striking against bulwark with slight easy roll of ship be therefore particularly careful not to make faintest splash a drew up alongside lest unaccustomed sound must reach ear of startle individual not yet completely overpowered by drink have swallowed fortunately for gangway ladder have not be hauled up be consequently free to board ship well aft thus greatly lessening risk of detection have therefore only to wait until roll of ship brought ladder within grasp seize draw noiselessly out of water be precisely course followed have already drawn up clear of water when there occurred rush swirl immediately beneath received so smart blow narrowly escaped being knocked off ladder a large shark sprang length out of water after fell back with terrific splash loud enough be sure to have be distinctly heard on shore have there be one on beach to hear brute have evidently be lurking under ship bottom attracted there doubtless by refuse thrown overboard from time to time by cook have only become aware of presence just in time to make rapid ill directed rush have very narrowly missed oh how fervently thanked heaven a sprang up side beyond reach of possible second rush that necessity for cautious approach to ship have rendered movement so noiseless that great fish have not discovered until too late that sudden violent disturbance alongside have however not passed unnoticed on deck be immediately apparent by appearance of human head over rail by fore rigging only to disappear instantly however make reappearance at gangway a did so voice instantly recognised a joe murmured in low cautious tone be that cap'n yes joe replied with equal caution a paused with eye on level with rail how be on board have rascal drunk stupid ay be just exactly what have done answered joe be just creepin ' quietly aft to cast mr forbes loose by way of start when row alongside how did happen sir did slip fall back'ards returned be shark rose at from under ship bottom narrow escape have have of brute struck with snout a sprang out of water knocked off ladder shark ejaculated joe in dismay word sir have have narrer squeak mistake stop where be sir out of sight for minute while go for'ard just see whether rumpus have roused of will be back in brace of shake so saying joe sauntered carelessly away forward again loitered aimlessly about foredeck for few minute sauntered quietly aft again past larboard gangway so round abaft mainmast capstan until rejoined again right sir whispered ai asleep mother son of 'em be that helplessly drunk can do anything like with now sir a stepped in on deck if like to go to cabin shift into dry clothes will go cut poor mr forbes adrift be afraid ai none too comfortable for seemed to a beggar be passin ' seizing pretty taut when lashed up to night be that so said indignantly then will go cut adrift before doing anything else joe may be enduring cruel torment time where be locked in own berth sir answered joe that reminds know who be got key may have left in door hazarded who locked in rogers moore sir be two ringleader in here business have by time reached mate cabin found door locked key missing a tried door handle thought heard groan from interior so without wasting time to search about for key set back against bulkhead of passage foot against door by lock next moment have door open shapeless object upon floor of cabin indistinctly seen in semi darkness pervaded place proved to be mate lying just a have be carelessly flung in there hour before with wrist heel lashed together behind back poor fellow be in dreadful state having lain there hour in excruciating agony from cruel pressure of lashing about limb with brutal carelessness have be drawn so tight a to have completely stopped circulation of blood in extremity limb be now swollen almost out of recognition have bitten lower lip right through in extremity of torment beard be drenched with bloody foam effort to release occasioned such exquisite agony that fainted under hand sharp knife however speedily freed from bond after joe gently chafed swollen wrist ankle until circulation of blood be restored be nearly hour before poor fellow be able to move with degree of freedom at length however pronounced ready for action when going on deck arming with heavy brass belaying pin three of proceeded forward resolutely determined to stand nonsense whatever from anybody who must presume to interfere with be therefore distinctly unfortunate circumstance for rogers that must moment two previously have awakened from drunken sleep staggered to foot with apparently confused notion of taking look round ship assuring that be right for coming face to face with forbes joe a rounded corner of galley be promptly felled by latter with blow from belaying pin must have caused discomfort for many day afterwards while immediate effect be to stretch out upon deck senseless bleeding sound of fall disturbed one two of rest of whom be sprawled out inertly upon foredeck in midst of empty overturned bottle pannikin just sufficiently to cause to raise head grumble out few unintelligible word have difficulty with in le than hour have whole of securely bound hand foot lying at mercy having reduced to condition disarmed distributed about deck fore aft lashing man separately to ringbolt cleat other convenient mooring in such way that man might be within reach for have heard before now of men releasing other by working at lashing with teeth then left to recover sober sens at leisure while busied about other matter first act be to lower port quarter boat get into pull ashore to creek where found sir edgar party pretty much a have left miss merrivale being only two still awake arrival be greeted with shout of delight from baronet effectually awoke sleeper whole party quickly tumbled into boat sir edgar lady emily vying with other in heartiness of congratulation at success eagerness with asked for detail of adventure miss merrivale on contrary be strangely silent contenting with warm clasp of hand at moment of reunion presently when have shoved off again for ship noticed that be furtively cry concluded that reaction from long hour of suspense that have just passed through have proved rather too much for nerve so prudently appeared to take notice whatever of little break down soon reached ship upon solemn assurance that might do so with absolute safety rescued party at once retired below to respective cabin miss merrivale only lingering behind for moment to say have word to express how glad thankful be that have be successful in hazardous enterprise be brave man a well a with sudden merry smile will not say more lest make vain good night be beginning to feel bit puzzled at young lady manner seemed to have undergone subtle indescribable change within last twelve hour be a incomprehensible a be pleasant be just then however scarcely suitable moment for speculation upon inscrutable subject a deportment of lovely charming woman to simple sailor like so dismissed matter from mind turned to consideration of other subject le agreeable calling more imperatively for immediate attention first thing be to summon forbes joe to council of war for discussion of question what be to be done with mutineer there be of that must be obviously impossible to retain on board ship with least chance of safety to ourselves scarcely believed must all be equally bad be in hope that upon consultation with joe must learn that might trust sufficient number of to enable to make voyage to valparaiso in safety where thought probable might be able to pick up entire new crew without very much difficulty on submitting question to however joe gave a very decided opinion that there be only three out of eleven mutineer whom must be in least degree prudent to trust three being negro swede barr one of american three accordingly gave benefit of doubt for moment point settled next proceeded to draw up list of such article a deemed absolutely necessary to welfare of men whose conduct have rendered imperative that must maroon after consideration content of list resolved into man personal effect in entirety including weapon ammunition latter however to be securely screwed up in stout wooden case so that might not be got at used against whilst effecting transfer of mutineer to shore saw hammer chisel assortment of nail dozen barrel of beef same of bread half chest of tea few pound of coffee sugar cock three hen cooking utensil little crockery match old main course with ax shovel pick rope block spar used in securing treasure still remained on shore ought considered to furnish with mean to make fairly comfortable until must be taken off important matter decided next thing be to get everything up passed into boat task fully occupied until daylight by time effect of carouse showed sign of passing off men began to awake in measure to consciousness of situation few of rogers moore o'connor especially gave vent to indignation disgust in continuous flood of vilest language mingled with blood curdling threat of vengeance that must wreak upon time in future rest accepted impending fate with sullen stoicism meanwhile comfortably conscious that for present at least be utterly powerless to fulfil of threat otherwise work evil went composedly on with work first conveying to landing baggage on sandy beach of creek then ferrying marooned men ashore with hand securely lashed behind have determined to land only eight of when have be done be ready to leave cut bond of last man ashore left to free companion at leisure thus effectually insuring against trouble from marooned party at last moment then having shouted to parting promise that must make known fact of presence on island to first british man o ' war met with together with cause of being left there paddled quietly on board again set to work to provide with much needed breakfast chapter eighteen pacific hurricane meal over three remaining prisoner be released offered choice between being landed on island to join other men returning to duty reminded that conduct in having aided abetted more active among mutineer to seize ship rendered guilty of crime of piracy crime punishable with death that still remained with to clap in iron if pleased keep prisoner until opportunity must arrive to hand over to justice charged with offence added that a appeared however that three men in question seemed only to have passively consented to deed of others have desire to be severe with be anxious rather to give opportunity of retrieving character must willingly do so must feel assured separated a must be from more guilty comrade must henceforward serve faithfully said that if be prepared to do on part be willing to forgive share in mutiny to treat a though incident have never occurred warned however that unless be fully prepared not only to solemnly pledge to fidelity also to faithfully fulfil that pledge must be infinitely better for to elect to be landed on island to take chance with rest for assured must take pledge of fidelity afterwards break must upon first symptom of insubordination clap in iron hand over to authority a pirate at first port might happen to touch address have precisely effect upon fellow desired mention of word piracy reminder of penalty due to crime thoroughly frightened while promise on other hand of forgiveness a reward for faithful service in future have reassuring influence intended to have upon conclusion of lecture with one accord begged pardon for what have already happened most fervently promised must have cause of complaint against in future important matter settled thus far to satisfaction sent barr christianssen aloft to loose fore topsail topgallantsail while joe negro performed similar duty on mainmast party receiving instruction to cast off lashing from staysail on way down while be doing forbes lay out upon jib boom loosed jib fore topmast staysail busying meanwhile in casting loose mizzen presently joe hailed from aloft that men on shore have made appearance on beach upon looking in direction saw whole party of gathered there close to water edge intently watching movement just then sir edgar made appearance on deck with cheery good morning laughingly declared that intended to ship for voyage to nearest port a honorary seaman be ready to enter upon duty at once of course thanked for kind proffer of service assuring that short handed a be must be in power to render invaluable assistance hand at moment coming down from aloft sheeted home topsail got yard to masthead nothing now remained to loose hold upon ground make start must of course at once do by simply slipping cable anchor be altogether too useful article to be needlessly thrown away many good ship have driven ashore gone to piece for want of anchor have be slipped not replaced be therefore very much averse to slipping in present instance without at least trying to get anchor on putting question to others forbes have doubt of ability to do while rest expressed perfect readiness to try accordingly manned windlass san domingo starting lively shanty walked barque up to anchor almost without effort having got cable up down next ran up fore topmast staysail then went to fore brace trimmed head yard for casting ship to starboard just then in very nick of time miss merrivale came on deck looking a bright radiant a morning at once impressed a helmswoman stationing at wheel briefly explaining how be to act upon receipt of certain signal from seemed quite proud at idea that must be really useful took station at wheel with heightened colour sparkling eye with spotless white dress trimmed with dainty lace light blue ribbon broad brimmed hat set jauntily upon heavy coil of dusky golden hair casting delicate shadow upon lovely face hand arm encased in long loose glove delicate foot shod in small brown shoe made to mind sweetest loveliest picture that eye have ever rested upon so irresistibly charming indeed did look that with difficulty forebore from telling so plump plain so to avoid committal of such impertinence be constrained to rush for'ard add weight to of others at windlass handle in effort to break out anchor fortunately for windlass be exceptionally good powerful one on other hand holding ground proved to be exceptionally tenacious for long five minute cable stood straight up down rigid a solid bar defying utmost effort to get so much a single additional pawl then opportune puff with little more weight in than soft breathing off land have hitherto reached struck broad expanse of topsail with sudden jerk ground broke away anchor came home hurrah lad be away heave for life heave raise dead vociferated windlass pawl clanked merrily chain came rattling in through hawse pipe ship gathering stern way began to pay off with head to seaward at right moment signed to miss merrivale to put wheel hard up while forbes sprang aft to brace swung yard ship halted hung stationary for moment then gathering headway gradually swept round until have brought island upon starboard beam be gliding along under lee of western shore new voyage have begun marooned men have time be intently watching movement from beach from excited action way in closed up in circle when saw canvas drop from yard be apparent that be engaged in heated discussion of kind presently when saw man windlass heard clink of pawl observed o'connor break from conclave dash cap down upon sand somewhat hesitatingly enter water a though about attempting to swim off to whereupon sprang upon rail putting whole power of lung into shout hailed to go back a there be shark in bay have to repeat warning two three time however before seemed willing to heed be not in fact until anchor be broken out of ground ship be seen to be canting to seaward that turned back rejoined companion when last saw be still standing upon beach watching departure shouting to with gesture be eloquent of threat curse though be too far distant to catch word that hurled after meanwhile during progress of operation have be taking counsel with a to most desirable course to pursue under circumstance in found original intention have be to proceed to valparaiso in quest of crew intention have be arrived at under impression that must be necessary only to leave three four men behind on island joe opinion upon matter have however altered have necessitated going to sea with crew of only seven men including sir edgar whose assistance felt must only claim under circumstance of exceptional necessity reduced to two watch of three men who might indeed suffice to handle ship under easy canvas during fine weather who must do very little with must happen to fall in with heavy gale still worse downright pacific hurricane then too prevailing wind in part of world be easterly placed valparaiso well to windward rendered even more difficult to fetch than san francisco latter port however have desire to visit under circumstance with precious cargo on board three men at least whose tongue must be impossible to bridle by time therefore that ship be fairly under way have come to conclusion that best plan must be to make for sandwich island be only sixteen hundred fifty mile distant in north westerly direction might therefore be easily reached in fortnight if went well with important advantage attaching to plan be that honolulu if did not lie directly in road to china be nearer than other port still considered very essential that in order to avoid inconvenient question must take home cargo of sort might a well be tea a anything else although have never visited sandwich island thought probable must there be able to pick up at least sufficient number of men to carry comfortably to canton river a soon therefore a be fairly clear of island set course for island of oahu wind being at time four knot breeze well over starboard quarter done relieved miss merrivale at wheel leaving forbes other four men to continue at leisure operation of making sail meanwhile question have arisen how be cooking to be done natural reply to seemed to be set darkie to do must have be very well for passenger who occurred to might possibly have prejudice against having food handled by black man therefore laid matter before sir edgar who immediately consulted with wife ultimate result be that one of maid very good naturedly undertook work with san domingo a cook mate to do dirty work while other maid volunteered a steward be greatly distressed in mind lest inconvenience must prove serious annoyance to good friend in saloon on mentioning matter to lady emily quickly kindly reassured by declaring that looked upon whole thing in light of adventure experience of novel kind to be made most of besides added little inconvenience privation will do good by teaching to appreciate comfort more nearly at proper value when get again weather looked fine barometer stood high therefore have hesitation about packing sail upon ship a everybody worked with will came to pas that by noon have not only got anchor secured have also clothed ship with stitch of plain sail from royal down forbes be not satisfied even with must have gone on to studding sail considered enough to be a good a feast studding sail be rather ungainly thing to handle in quickly freshening breeze if one happens to be at short handed therefore determined to have nothing to do with more resolutely that a drew away from island breeze strengthened until be reeling off nine knot by log exceedingly satisfactory state of affair prevailed for exactly forty hour from noon of day upon left island breeze remaining so steady true that be not called upon to touch tack sheet halliard during whole time there be nothing in fact to do simply to steer ship be already beginning to flatter that be not only to be favoured with pleasant passage that be going to accomplish in about time have allotted to magnificent opportunity be not to be wasted accordingly took advantage of to have ballast cleared away right in midships gold silver stowed there equally on side of keelson carefully concealed with matting quantity of dunnage after ballast be trimmed back over everything left shipshape against time of arrival in port in hoping for sufficiently long continuance of fine weather to carry without break interruption to honolulu however be reckoning without host for about four o'clock in morning of second day out wind began to fail by eight o'clock have fallen to stark glassy calm there have be moderate amount of sea running soon went down leaving only long oily swell upon ship rolled with quick jerky uneasy movement sun rose clear brilliant with promise of fine scorchingly hot day when went on deck after breakfast to take sight for longitude noticed that sky have lost much of brilliant colouring while sun hung in white shapeless blotch instead of dazzling orb have risen few hour before of course might mean nothing worse than heat when went below shortly afterwards to work out sight saw that mercury have fallen little too might only mean heat with possibly smart thunderstorm little later on in day short handed a be deemed best to be on safe side accordingly having worked out sight returned to deck hand of went to work upon canvas clewing up hauling down lighter sail until have stripped ship to topsail course fore topmast staysail jib mizzen at stage of proceeding glance at barometer showed that mercury be still shrinking in tube while atmosphere have assumed hazy appearance rendered difficult to distinguish horizon there must no longer be doubt that change of weather be impending although there be nothing at present to indicate very precisely what character of change be to be therefore went aloft three of on foremast three on main beginning with royal working downward snugly stowed everything that have previously hauled down be whilst be thus engaged that increasing uneasiness in motion of ship first became apparent looking about for cause became aware of fact that cross swell have begun to gather be slowly creeping down to from north west sure precursor forbes affirmed of stiff blow from quarter in opinion fully agreed still there be at moment nothing of menacing character in aspect of sky beyond increasing thickness of atmosphere be therefore hopeful that must have sufficiency of time given to complete preparation for worst must happen before came upon furling of light canvas be very long very laborious job in le than hour be once more on deck north westerly swell have by time gathered sufficient weight to render distinctly perceptible even to eye ship having swung round broadside on to be rolling in fashion set truss parrels bulkhead creaking yard jerking patent block sheaf squeaking heavy canvas flapping reef point pattering cabin door rattling wheel chain clanking so that with heavy wash of water along bend under counter occasional clatter of crockery in pantry quite small babel of sound be raised about motion of ship however though more violent be not so awkward uncomfortable a have be doubtless in consequence of young swell killing old still there be sign whatever of immediate breeze look at barometer showed that mercury be still falling now at more rapid rate fully convinced therefore something rather more serious than mere thunder squall be brewing now went to work with will having first furled mizzen hauled up course stowed leaving ship with nothing showing two topsail fore topmast staysail a topsail be patent reefing left practically prepared for almost anything might happen haze have by time thickened overhead to extent that sun showed in a mere white rayless disc light of seemed to be gradually dying out by time noon have arrived atmosphere have become so obscure that horizon be no longer distinguishable therefore lost observation for latitude at one o'clock when neat stewardess summoned below to luncheon mercury be still sinking with slow progress of change be taking place assured that when outburst came must be something little out of common luckily have plenty of sea room thoroughly staunch little ship under foot therefore looked forward to impending conflict with tolerable equanimity at length just a have completed hasty lunch there occurred sudden perceptible darkening of atmosphere seemed to indicate that expected change be now imminent springing up companion way to deck found most extraordinary scene awaiting thickness have hitherto pervaded atmosphere have vanished a if by magic leaving air astonishingly clear transparent right to boundary of horizon revealing vast expanse of dense livid purple grey cloud have overspread north western half of heaven be at precise moment passing over shutting out sun from view edge of cloud be a straight sharply defined a though have be trimmed with knife divided firmament into two almost equal portion larger of be beautiful expanse of clear serene unclouded blue while other hung livid threatening above with promise of raving tornado lurking within black bosom immediately overhead colour of immense cloud curtain be cold slaty blue from whence a eye travelled down expanse toward north western horizon hue became darker until where met water be a black a night while underneath sea undulated restlessly with writhings of angry serpent showing surface a lustreless of same colour a molten lead low down in bosom of cloud must be seen occasional palpitating quivering a though fire within be striving to burst way through presently quite at horizon flash of lightning sparked vividly out of be topsail halliard ready for running mr forbes said ready sir be reply turning away mate walked quietly forward throwing fall off pin on way minute later heard telling joe to stand by fore topsail halliard rest of men to lay aft to brace following along deck stationing at main topsail halliard in readiness to let run at moment sir edgar with two lady child came on deck looked round with startled eye upon portentous scene upon earnest recommendation youngster be at once sent below again lady holding in readiness to follow at moment notice sir edgar however announced determination to remain on deck upon chance of becoming useful upon lady emily without saying word went below brought up on deck not only husband also own mackintosh coat little piece of thoughtful consideration for be deeply grateful since aspect of weather be now such that dared not leave deck for single instant slowly great cloud worked insidious way athwart heaven until nearly three fourth of firmament be obscured yet still there be not air enough to have extinguished burning match then while barque be lying helpless with head pointing directly toward quarter from expected outfly white mist suddenly appeared ahead sweeping down upon with speed of express train course along water indicated by long line of continuous white here come rain at last exclaimed forbes turning to pointing ahead with one hand a grasped fall of main topsail halliard with other ay wind with answered a sprang to wheel whirled hard over let go topsail halliard away below lady for life gale will be upon in le than minute lay aft here of round in upon larboard fore brace mr forbes get starboard fore topmast staysail sheet aft well belayed if please whew here be hold on everybody rain seemed to reach single instant ahead of wind dashing vertically down upon for just brief period not in drop in overwhelming deluge verily believe must have drowned have lasted then a hurricane reached in deafening medley of sound sheet of water be caught swept horizontally along with force that be literally impossible to face without risk of being blinded while barque gathered stern way until water be piled up level with taffrail for few breathless second be firmly convinced that must end in foundering stern foremost good little ship be paying off time however presently have swept round until have fairly abeam when laid down to until lee lower yardarm be dipping in water then signing to men at brace to haul round head yard waited until have lost stern way when shifted helm putting hard up began to draw slowly ahead danger be now practically over for ship continued to pay off presently righted with sudden jerk went foaming away before with white froth level with hawse pipe rain be by time over while be still thick a hedge ahead to leeward of atmosphere astern be clear save for spindrift scud water with be heavily loaded along water surface first mad fury of outfly be past even so be blowing harder than have ever seen blow before so hard indeed that wondered at brave way in close reefed topsail withstood tremendous strain drag of ship upon so great be strain began to entertain very serious fear for mast now that be too late deeply regretted that have not stripped ship entirely bare faced outfly under bare pole must have be positive relief to to have seen topsail go flying out of boltropes still held on however little later when forbes having at request gone round of chain plate subjected to careful examination reported that must see sign of of bolt drawing began to hope that after might pull through without very serious damage especially a joe almost immediately afterwards sounded pump reported that everything be right below have be scudding for about hour when sea began to rise by five o'clock in afternoon there be very high steep sea following foresaw must soon become dangerous therefore determined to watch for opportunity if possible heave ship to before dark a preliminary to manoeuvre ordered fore topmast staysail to be hauled down having be accomplished without damage to sail two of men barr swede lay out upon bowsprit to stow under direction of mate at moment that order be given seemed perfectly simple affair entirely free from danger unfortunately happened however just at moment when sail have be made secure men be on point of laying in again a forbes subsequently informed that unusually heavy sea overtook catching barque under counter raised stern high in air slightly pooping while buried bow bowsprit deep in water standing at wheel saw what be about to happen be in very act of shouting warning to men to hold on when sea curled in over taffrail completely burying for moment when few second later be able to clear eye of water men have vanished forbes be running aft cry out to that be overboard looked astern must see nothing of of in increasingly perilous situation of ship dared leave wheel even for brief space of time requisite to cut adrift throw life buoy forbes however dashed aft did with most commendable promptitude after with assistance of joe san domingo lost not moment in counter bracing yard when successfully brought ship to on larboard tack with fore topsail aback done with joe at wheel forbes clambered into maintop peered long into fast gathering gloom in faint hope that even yet might catch sight of one of missing men be able to do something to save never saw of again chapter nineteen in dire extremity sudden loss of two men be not only terrible shock to be also cruel misfortune for exclusive of sir edgar left only four of to handle ship be true that be now a snug a be possible to be in condition to face almost anything might befall in shape of weather when again came to question of making sail still worse being obliged to once more shorten sail perhaps in hurry there must be good deal of heavy labour to be done by four at most five men be however one of deplorable accident be incidental to life of seaman having in mean time done be possible for safety of ship be useless to meet trouble way therefore arranged that during continuance of gale while there must be really nothing to do to keep eye upon ship regular watch must be taken by four of in rotation one at time must thus allow others plenty of time for rest against moment when utmost exertion of must be once more demanded be now drawing on toward six o'clock aspect of coming night be very threatening sky be completely overspread with vast unbroken curtain of inky cloud torn shredded into countless host of ragged fantastic shape came rushing up from northward westward at headlong speed before breath of raving gale while air be thick salt with ceaseless pelting of brine torn from wave crest swept along in drenching pitiless rain by mad fury of wind sea be rising fast already presented formidable threatening aspect a towering liquid hill swept successively down upon ship froth laced capped by hissing roaring crest of milky foam reared nearly to height of foretop over weather bow so steep be ere barque rose to surmounted in smothering deluge of spray yet be doing well for although under tremendous pressure of wind upon two close reefed topsail ship be heeled to covering board while in of wild lee roll careened until topgallant rail be awash became impossible to maintain one footing on deck without holding on to something looked well up into wind rode boiling fury of sea a buoyantly a cork foredeck be true from knight head to well abaft galley be streaming with water incessantly poured over weather bow in torrent of spray abaft that deck must have be dry for drenching spindrift darkness fell upon with suddenness be almost startling have be for time ever since have hove to in fact narrowly watching ship to see how met sea at length finding that be taking care of herself ordered joe to lash wheel gave permission to go below join others at supper in forecastle before finally releasing however assuming solitary watch thought must have look at mercury accordingly went below into saloon where lamp be already lighted glanced at barometer saw that mercury be now stationary chatted for minute two with occupant of apartment then went on deck again when left deck few minute before horizon form of flying cloud be clearly distinguishable now when returned to again blackness of impenetrable darkness be round about relieved only by ghostly light of pale seafire in foaming wave crest in tiny star of phosphorescent light went careering to leeward across deck with lee roll of ship be weird awe inspiring sensation to stand there in blackness upon wildly heaving deck watch irresistible menacing onrush upon ship of furious mountain surge capped with ghostly green fire with deafening shriek din of gale in unseen rigging overhead resounding in one ear sensation well calculated to bring home to man own nothingness in presence of power majesty of who causeth vapour to ascend from end of earth who maketh lightning for rain who bringeth forth wind out of treasury who hath way in whirlwind storm who holdeth sea in hollow of hand feeling be in nowise lessened nay be rather intensified by thrill of exultation experienced at reflection that man puny a be strength compared with mighty force of nature have be endowed by creator with intellect capable of devising framing structure so subtly moulded so strongly put together that be able to face triumphantly survive such mad fury of wind sea a then raged around throughout greater part of night gale continued to blow with unabated fury about three o'clock on following morning rapid rise of barometer commenced two hour later single star twinkling brightly for moment through small rift in hitherto unbroken cloud rack overhead gave welcome assurance that worst of weather be now over assurance be shortly afterward strengthened by slight unmistakable decrease in violence of wind then few more star beamed mildly down upon for brief lengthening interval finally about hour before time of sunrise great pall of cloud broke up into squadron of tattered streamer speeding swiftly athwart sky away down in eastern quarter be rapidly paling before dawn anon pallor became tinged with chilly hue of yellow against mountainous sea reared in vast sharply defined ridge of blackest indigo paling a eye travelled round horizon toward western quarter into deep blue grey capped with lofty curling crest of pallid foam quickly cold yellow along eastern horizon became flushed with streak of angry red flying squadron of rent grey cloud became fringed along lower edge with dye of purple crimson presently upper rim of sun disc copper hued fiery gleamed through flying rack low down upon horizon flashing cheerless ray of angry orange across mountain waste of water changing into heaving turbulent surface of sickly olive green be a dreary cheerless sunrise think a have ever seen air still full of spindrift be despite position only few degree north of line chill enough to set one shuddering maindeck be awash with water flew incessantly over weather bow poured aft with heaving of ship breaking into miniature cascade among boom lashed in waist over length of cable stretched along deck from windlass to chain locker swirling round pump foot of mainmast gurgling sobbing in lee scupper weather bulwark be streaming with water even topsail be dark with wet miniature shower be blowing away to leeward off top of galley forward deck house few dry spot be to be found here there about deck in sheltered place be white with encrusted salt be still blowing heavily ship be plunging furiously rolling so wildly that be impossible to maintain one footing without clinging to something continuous raving of wind among maze of spar rigging especially when ship rolled to windward be most depressing to listen to appalling proportion of vast liquid mountain range that with dreary persistent remorseless monotony came sweeping down upon from northward westward piling hissing crest high around completed picture for dreary sublimity have never seen equalled be tired wet cold for notwithstanding arrangement of watch have be on deck off on whole night be not sorry therefore when forbes came on deck to relieve at eight o'clock thus affording opportunity to shift into dry clothes before sitting down to breakfast be rather small company morning sir edgar miss merrivale being only member of saloon party who felt equal to putting in of appearance after breakfast be obliged rather unwillingly confess to go on deck again to secure observation of sun observation when worked out showed that be nearly thirty mile to eastward of proper position ascertained retired to cabin flinging upon bunk standing instantly sank into dreamless refreshing sleep appeared to that have not be in berth more than five minute when about quarter of hour before noon forbes called in order that might together take meridian altitude of sun be sooner on foot than became apparent that ship motion be by mean so violent a have be when lay down be sufficiently accounted for by information imparted to by mate that gale have broken that in hour two weather must probably have moderated sufficiently to permit of filling away upon course news be fully confirmed by general aspect of affair when reached deck for sun be now shining brilliantly in cloudless sky air be genially warm while wind though still blowing heavily enough to justify in retaining close reef in topsail have abated violence so far that now blew steadily instead of beating upon ship in gust of headlong fury sea moreover though still seemed to run a high a ever be longer so steep a have be great mountain of water moving more slowly carrying good wholesome slope on lee side enabled ship to ride easily comfortably without provocation of constantly recurring feeling that great menacing wall of water be about to overwhelm have taken sun made eight bell be on point of leaving deck again to work out sight in own cabin when while exchanging remark with forbes thought caught momentary glimpse of something what knew not a ship hung poised for instant upon crest of unusually heavy wave be barest most fleeting glimpse for before must direct forbes attention to by so much a word be plunging headlong down weather slope of wave with horizon on hand bounded by hissing crest be rearing a high a maintop barque taking weather roll of such portentous extent that of instinctively made dash for mizzen shroud clung to for dear life in anticipation of coming correspondingly abnormal lee roll while roar of bow wave wind aloft created din must not have made heard even have be foolish enough to have attempted be confident that have seen something when ship reached bottom of abyss where on deck be becalmed roar of surge under bow have died away mentioned matter to mate so when be swung aloft again of be eagerly on lookout for object a almost invariably happens however after passage of usually heavy wave two three now succeeded be only of moderate height higher crest time intervened between spot where object be last seen be also probable enough that object whatever might be must be sunk in trough of sea just at moment when happened to be hanging on wave crest thus happened that several minute elapsed without again catching sight of to cut matter short therefore handed forbes sextant to hold seizing favourable opportunity sprang into weather main rigging swarmed aloft a far a maintop from elevation knew must soon sight if be still above water be not until be halfway up shroud fully realised how heavily be still blowing how violent still be motion of ship with lee roll that took be involuntarily forced to cling with strength to rigging for seemed to that unless did so must infallibly be pitched head foremost into top while when ship rolled to windward pressure of air upon body be so great that be literally jammed hard fast against rigging unable to move hand foot be even more apparent when reached futtock shroud be surmounting edge of top wind sustaining so completely that be confident might have relaxed hand grasp for several second without slightest danger of falling however gained lofty perch at last lying prone in top in order might see under foot of fore topsail soon again caught sight of object be distant about seven mile from ship bearing about north north east by compass floated very low in water circumstance from thick mist still overspreading surface of water rendered impossible at distance to determine precisely what be looked a much like dead whale a anything else have felt quite certain that be really must of course have troubled more about there be moment when probably from slight change in position with regard to resemblance have mentioned ceased conviction forced upon that whatever might be be not whale living dead at length to set matter at rest determined to fill upon ship get nearer look at accordingly descended to deck forbes rousing out joe san domingo went to work with difficulty succeeded in setting fore topmast staysail without splitting after filled fore topsail headed ship for mysterious object be now close hauled upon larboard tack with object bare three point upon lee bow soon became apparent that a be making fully amount of leeway must require rather fine steering to fetch without breaking tack operation be particularly anxious to avoid short handed a be forbes however be at wheel a be splendid helmsman be pretty certain that if thing must be done must do when luncheon be announced have drawn up to within about four mile of object so heavily be sea still running that even at distance be only occasionally that must catch sight of presenting now a looked at through ship telescope appearance of large fragment of floating wreck news took to luncheon table that mysterious floating something of considerable size have be sighted ahead that be making for have very stimulating effect upon occupant of saloon who enveloping in mackintosh followed on deck when rose from table with eagerness born of longing for occurrence to break monotony of make forget for time wearisome pitching rolling of ship monotonous unceasing clank jar of cabin door on hook continuous creaking of bulkhead thump of wheel chain on deck never ending wash of water howling of wind in rigging despite merciless buffeting of wind ceaseless drenching shower of spray flew over change from saloon to deck be unanimously voted improvement for involved transition from close oppressive atmosphere to exhilarating breeze redolent of strong salt odour of brine bracing by reason of very violence while brilliant sunshine sparkling upon deep windy blue of vast mountain surge that surrounded converting spray shower into gorgeous rainbow constituted ever changing picture of rich splendid colour wild tumultuous movement be not to be easily forgotten thought miss merrivale have never looked so lovely a did then enveloped in thin soft silky looking mackintosh with dainty little close fitting hat upon head beautiful hair blown adrift streaming long golden web of ringlet in fiery breeze cheek flushed to delicate pink with rude buffeting of wind sea eye fairly blazing with excitement exhilaration at wild scene around first glance be naturally directed ahead in search of mysterious object for be steering be quickly discovered about two mile distant good point on lee bow to unaided eye character still remained uncertain single glance through ship telescope now sufficed to satisfy that be wreck portion of one have appearance of small craft capsized for telescope enabled one to see small strip of wet black side showing above water with considerably greater expanse of copper sheathed planking even now that have so greatly decreased distance between there be still great difficulty in determining precise character for be only when happened to be upon top of sea at same moment that came within ken moment be comparatively rare a continued to close however glimpse of became increasingly frequent at length when have approached to within mile heave of sea having meanwhile flung round into more favourable position became apparent that be small craft of sort seemingly brig have capsized now lay with mast prone along water for must now then catch glimpse of spar with canvas still set lifting foot two out of water with heave of sea only to settle back again next moment however what interested most keenly of however excited profoundest astonishment be fact that dark patch in main rigging for must not at first account soon afterwards proved to be group of men for presently saw one of scramble along shroud until reached vessel upturned side then despite heavy mass of water be continually breaking over hull rise to foot wave something looked like man jacket by way of signal in answer to immediately ran ensign up to gaff end excitement of fairer occupant of poop be now intense especially that of miss merrivale who in extremity oblivion of enthusiasm not only addressed a jack also volunteered to do sort of impossible thing by way of assisting in rescue that took for granted how be such thing to be achieved be only five men on board esmeralda told what must united effort accomplish certainly must not launch boat even have dared to hope that so small craft must live in such wild fearful sea for lightest of gig only boat must have be possible to launch under circumstance must need at least four men to do anything with in such weather must leave only one man on board to look after handle ship during process of rescue amounted to physical impossibility be however determined to save men if must be done therefore steered barque a close up under lee of wreck a dared backed mainyard with brig royal masthead showing just awash not ten foot to windward of be extraordinary appalling picture that now looked upon vessel brig of about one hundred eighty ton have be thrown over on starboard side now lay submerged to about halfway up hatchway with mast prone along water into out of dipped rose two three foot with wash of sea roll of hull be wooden vessel apparently american built be under whole topsail foresail spanker jib sufficiently accounted for present predicament if a seemed probable have be caught under canvas in outburst of previous day have quarter davit chock over main hatchway where long boat sometimes jolly boat a well be usually stowed be missing gripe be still there showing that boat boat have be stowed there have evidently be washed away there be moreover remains of what have once be gig on gallows appeared to have be generously fitted up for a rose fell caught flash of brass work about skylight companion when stern lifted high enough out of water handsome brass binnacle securely bolted to deck became exposed to view lastly huddled in weather main rigging about twelve fifteen foot from rail where be tolerably clear of sea constantly broke over vessel upturned side be group of nine men most of bareheaded clad in garment clung to body with tenacity of clothing have be soaked for many consecutive hour in water be in miserable most precarious plight indeed must not help wondering how have possibly managed to cling for so many hour to so insecure refuge assuming of course that brig have capsized on previous afternoon a surmised first thing be to communicate with first attempted by mean of speaking trumpet roar of wind wash of sea together with drift be of course much more rapid than of wreck rendered voice inaudible so became necessary to resort to other method there happened to be bull board kicking about poop setting up on skylight where must be distinctly seen with black face towards wreck got piece of chalk hastily wrote upon following word one after other receiving wave of hand from on wreck in token that have deciphered word before obliterated wrote next only four men on board so can not send boat will stand by take off if possible by time that last word of communication have be written acknowledged be distance to leeward of wreck became necessary to fill upon ship once more done next matter for determination be mean whereby be to get people away from wreck safe on board barque problem have be fully manned must have proved sufficiently puzzling while circumstanced a be seemed impossible at length however hit upon scheme thought might be worth trying proceeded forthwith to put into practical shape without more ado since unfortunate people on wreck be in perilously exposed situation evidently in such terribly exhausted state that might relax hold be washed away at moment there be a have already mentioned nine men to be rescued now esmeralda having be ever since be launched passenger ship be well found in life saving appliance life buoy among number of carried le than twelve eight being stowed away in one of cutter on gallows while remainder be distributed about poop ready for immediate use first thing done be to get up on deck two good stout warp bend end to end so that might have plenty of length to work with inner end of long line be then made fast inboard at fore rigging to other end nine life buoy be next securely bent in form of chain with length of about fathom between buoy finally long light heaving line be bent on to extreme outer end of warp warp be then carefully coiled down on deck ready for paying out buoy piled on top of spare part of heaving line carried out to flying jib boom end where be snugly coiled stopped ready for use preparation be now complete having meanwhile be plying to windward helm be put up wore round to return to wreck operation provided work for including sir edgar when at length got ship round upon starboard tack found to extreme vexation that circle have made be so large that must be unable to fetch wreck be terribly annoying at time when minute lost might mean human life must hing to rectify matter except stand on far enough upon new tack to insure that when next wore must not again under shoot mark if be vexatious for must have be for poor fellow who standing a be within very jaw of death be anxiously watching movement to eagerness anxiety minute seemed hour at length felt that have reached far enough to justify attempt upon getting ship round again have satisfaction of seeing that have measured distance just right must be about able to fetch wreck with little nothing to spare a approached brig negro who now that be separated from late companion proved to be not only first rate seaman also very willing good natured fellow most earnestly besought to entrust to task of manipulating heaving line vehemently asserting ability to cast further straighter than of rest of accordingly deputed that duty to whereupon laid out to flying jib boom end placing astride spar outside royal stay clinched there in most extraordinary manner by mean of foot leg then calmly took coil of heaving line in hand held ready for cast ease with fellow clung to bare end of dancing spar be revelation to for motion out there be proportionately a violent a must have be in maintop yet there sat a composedly a though have be in easy chair while most white men must have found difficult enough to maintain position with aid of hand a well a foot leaving out of question possibility of executing such manoeuvre a of throwing line to windward against whole gale of wind san domingo thus safely established at station joe sir edgar placed at brace standing by to back main topsail at instant must give word while climbed into weather fore rigging a best position from to con ship in order edged gradually warily down toward wreck chapter twenty end of adventure situation now be everything must be desired for execution of delicate manoeuvre contemplated only few minute elapsed from time of stationing in fore rigging when critical moment arrived for to attempt accordingly signed to forbes to put helm down instantly did lashing fast when sprang simultaneously to weather main brace to assist sir edgar joe in backing main topsail proved to be tough drag for four men managed to get yard round far enough to lay sail aback when once more darted forward into fore rigging to superintend remainder of work forbes returning to station at wheel while sir edgar joe stood by warp in readiness to pay out quickly to throw life buoy over clear of rail everything now depended upon strength skill of san domingo wreck when reached post of observation in rigging be on weather bow not more than twice own length from barque with way already somewhat retarded by backing of main topsail putting down of helm be slowly forging up to with bow inclining toward exact spot where nine men be still huddled together in main rigging anxiously watching approach wondering what be about to do saw that san domingo be preparing to heave rope end did not very greatly enlighten until joe sir edgar raised life buoy to rail prepared to throw overboard then got inkling of intent feeble shout went up from among slowly more slowly still barque continued to forge ahead began to fear that in anxiety to avoid actual collision with wreck have backed topsail second two too soon that must not after get near enough to to accomplish rescue still have not wholly lost way foot by foot rather inch by inch continued to creep nearer nearer to wreck until negro on end of spar be soaring swooping wildly within fifty foot of group of half drowned men then way stopped be moment that san domingo have be waiting for watching opportunity seized upon instant when wreck ourselves be sunk in trough of sea therefore comparatively sheltered from wind when with single powerful swing of coil round head sent whizzing straight fair in among group who be anxiously waiting for get a far aft a can then haul away upon line shouted one of waved hand to signify that understood what wanted then took hold of line with grasped firmly in hand made way cautiously in toward hull watching movement meanwhile in state of most intense anxiety suspense for now that be within biscuit toss of appalling precariousness peril of situation became fully apparent to more completely so indeed than probably be to unfortunate fellow for huddled together a be in rigging be sheltered to extent by hull of brig be thus unable to clearly see measure stupendous proportion of vast roaring mountain of foam capped water came hissing swooping down upon from to windward huge comber seemingly sentient with full determination to overwhelm engulf already stricken helpless fabric lay prone waterlogged at mercy while from superior elevation of buoyant deck must look over beyond nearly submerged hull watch with breathless anxiety swoop of giant wave a surged down upon wreck buried in blinding smother of seething milk white foam beaten down inert waterlogged a be brig cargo be evidently of such character a to impart considerable measure of buoyancy to for though sea broke over completely buried for moment invariably reappeared on hinder slope of baffled comber apparently little none worse for momentary submergence triumphant survival indeed of continuous overwhelming onslaught soon convinced that crew have little to fear from prospect of speedy foundering danger lay not in such probability consisted in likelihood of being torn from precarious hold in rigging by sea swept raged over danger be of course greatly increased when men began to move inward toward hull thus more fully exposing to fury of surge swept over of fact soon have most painful melancholy illustration for a group after waiting for two three minute for favourable opportunity essayed to scramble out of rigging make way aft along brig upturned side to quarter where must be clear of gear rigging when took to water small comparatively innocuous sea broke over hull harmless a be compared with most of predecessor have still enough of weight spite in to sweep one of poor fellow from precarious foothold into seething hissing swirl to leeward man tossed arm over head with wild shriek for help a smother carried along in suffocating embrace joe promptly made spring for spare life buoy that have provided for such emergency before must be thrown unfortunate wretch be hurled over brig mainyard a lifted out of water next instant disappeared beneath foot of main topsail wide space of immediately shut down upon buried a roll of hull once more submerged spar never saw poor fellow again there be doubt that caught entangled beneath cloth of topsail be drowned there meanwhile be drifting rapidly away to leeward full length of warp be almost paid out be therefore imperative that men on wreck must act quickly shouted to to effect awaking from momentary stupefaction produced by painfully sudden loss of comrade remaining eight men made dash for brig quarter succeeded in reaching just a vessel be uphove upon crest of tremendous sea saw slip string of life buoy over head next instant be buried in vast volume of water broke roaring hissing over fabric that stood upon to anxious mind seemed endless time before reappeared at length saw string of life buoy floating in midst of lacework of foam ten fathom to leeward of wreck well clear of heaving spar snake like coil of loose unrove gear eight out of nine buoy having man in hurrah shouted swinging on deck out of rigging have haul away gently upon line let get alongside a spoke saw that san domingo be laying in from jib boom end having like seen that have got hold of men presently ranged up alongside following example industriously set to work to throw coil of brace halliard clewlines so on off pin bend end of into bowline in readiness for hauling rescued men up side task of getting poor fellow safely inboard be soon accomplished when administering to man pannikin of scalding hot coffee have meanwhile be prepared in galley sent below into forecastle with instruction to strip rub other well down turn in until good meal must be prepared for when rescued crew being thus temporarily disposed of filled upon ship resumed voyage good substantial meal of beef potato ship bread backed up with few hour sleep shift into dry clothes sufficed to set rescued men upon pin again little nothing worse for hardship exposure have so recently undergone same evening obtained from mate of brig man named cooper particular of adventure from man story appeared that brig vessel of one hundred seventy four ton register named golden gate hailed from san francisco from port have sailed in search of cargo of sandal wood quest have be successful full cargo have be obtained have gone well with craft up to afternoon of preceding day when crew like have found becalmed unlike however skipper of golden gate who proved to be man who have unfortunately be swept away lost during process of rescue have obstinately refused to believe that threatening aspect of weather meant anything worse than sharp thunderstorm have declined to accede to suggestion of mate that sail must be shortened averring that wind be likely to get must need to help out of region of equatorial calm result have be that when hurricane burst upon ship be hove over upon beam end with sail flat upon water in position have gradually filled cargo only preventing waterlogged hull from sinking under foot of crew fortunately for hand have entertained sufficiently serious doubt of skipper judgment to determine to remain on deck see matter out hence when brig went over be in measure prepared for catastrophe lost time in clambering on to vessel upturned side from position sea breaking heavily over hull soon drove into rigging where have remained constantly drenched with spray frequently submerged beneath vast volume of water poured over wreck until rescued by in exchange for story briefly informed rescued mate have sailed from sydney in ballast for canton river intending to cut cargo of sandal wood on way that bulk of crew gang of desperado from gold digging have frustrated purpose by attempting to take ship away from have therefore be compelled to leave on island further that when sighted golden gate be on way to sandwich island hoping to there obtain men enough to navigate barque to china said that if men wished must still go on to honolulu land there from whence must doubtless soon find opportunity to return to san francisco if preferred must ship at current rate of wage for voyage to china if gave satisfaction thence home to england said must lay offer before men acquaint with decision forthwith at once retired to forecastle whereupon at once called joe san domingo to laid strictest injunction upon under circumstance be to make slightest allusion to treasure in hold hinting pretty strongly that if did own share of must probably fall very far short of what must be must secret be well kept caution believed to be quite needle so far a joe be concerned necessity a regarded negro be made quite apparent by remark when have finished speaking golly sar just a well tole dat in time odderwise dead sure to hab said someting about de fust time have chance now dat have warned sar may depend abs'lutely upon discresshun want de dollar can git doan ' feel inclined to share dem wid men dat have have hand in de saving of dem mate soon returned to deck with decision of crew informed that men be quite unanimous in desire to leave ship at honolulu make best of way back to san francisco with a little delay a possible if such arrangement must accord with convenience that in mean time must gladly turn to assist to work ship so far without pay in acknowledgment of having saved life weather meanwhile be fast moderating so much so that during second dog watch took good drag upon topsail halliard set foresail mizzen wind gradually hauling round further from northward breaking off until headed north east by compass mercury be rising almost a rapidly a have fallen there be prospect of fine night cooper late mate of golden gate offered to do duty a second mate while cook of craft expressed desire to continue function of office remainder of men declared readiness to go to work forthwith that night accordingly once more kept two watch consisting of officer four men while who have be on deck almost continuously for thirty hour turned in with mind intensely relieved by acquisition of so much valuable help slept like log until seven o'clock next morning awoke of own accord have sooner opened eye than knew without need of telling exactly how be situated ship be rolling with long steady even swing from side to side with occasional heave settlement of quarter a swell took canvas be alternately flapping out with rifle like report thundering against mast a rolled bulkhead be creaking groaning cabin door be rattling upon hook wheel chain be clanking a rudder kicked to wash swirl under counter there be gurgling dripping wash of water along bend without seething sound in that told apart from other noise of ship that be again becalmed sun be streaming brilliantly in through porthole of cabin flooding little apartment with warmth golden light swishing scrubbing sound overhead told that hand be busy at job of washing deck be welcome joyous sound a evidence of fact that once more have crew on board thrust foot into slipper went on deck to get morning bath with feeling of gaiety blithesomeness taught for first time how heavy have be load of anxiety have lately borne have slipped from shoulder with arrival of golden gate crew on board be glorious morning with clear brilliantly blue cloudless sky overhead out of sun though only hour high already blazed with ardour gave promise of scorching day sea be oil smooth with glittering sheen like of quicksilver in wake of sun while away to westward of flashed gleamed in hue of softest purest opalescent blue to side of ship with running of swell there be not breath of wind remotest sign of so ordered lighter canvas course to be hauled down clewed up to save from thrashing to rag having revelled in luxury of shower bath of cool sparkling brine from hose left ship under topsail fore topmast staysail went below to dress for breakfast calm have now fallen upon lasted unbroken for five full day during sweltered day night in melting heat of tropic with blazing sun right overhead day at noon waning moon soaring into heaven later still later night to render hour of darkness magical with witchery of beauty mystery during whole of time never shifted position by so much a single mile day at length however on sixth day few cat paw came playing at interval over surface of glass smooth water momentarily ruffling into little evanescent patch of tender blue causing transient ripple to play over stagnant cloth of canvas a day wore on cat paw increased in frequency in area in strength shortly before sundown gentle dainty little air of wind came stealing softly up from eastward to woo joyfully spread rag of canvas must show to oh how ineffably pleasant delightful be sound of first faint liquid tinkling ripple broke from cutwater gushed gently past bend in stream of tiny bursting air bell a beautifully moulded hull yielded to faint impulse of soft breathing began to move under with languorous motion of sleeping swan then a soft warm star spangled darkness of tropic closed down upon wrapped within impalpable fold breeze gathered strength weight by imperceptible degree until scarcely audible tinkle under bow merged into sound of knife shearing through tautly stretched silken web with musical fountain like plashing at cutwater crisp gushing curl of glassy wave under lee bow a broke hurried past into wake in lacework of creamy swirling froth gemmed with countless glittering foam bubble while log told that ship be slipping way through small wrinklings of brine at speed of fully six knot in hour by by moon orb now reduced to le than full dimension stole ghostlike above horizon by wan light saw that host of soft fleecy cloud shaped like smoke belched from mouth of cannon upon windless day be mustering squadron in eastern quarter knew for welcome trade cloud sure indication that breeze now have must be lasting one so proved for fleecy mass soared upward until overspread whole of visible sky a soared so breeze hardened until at length by time that middle watch drew toward close saucy esmeralda with wind well over starboard quarter everything packed upon from royal studding sail down be storming through at pace nearer to sixteen than to fifteen knot in hour while wild weird melody of hundred harp singing through taut maze of rigging aloft mingled with roar of wind out of great space of straining canvas deep continuous thunder of bow wave raising concert of such mad soul stirring harmony a cause sailor heart to leap bound within in ecstatic exultation to swift buoyant leap plunge of good ship beneath truly royal breeze continued to blow with scarcely diminished strength enabling to reel off fifteen knot per hour for hour at time while speed seldom sank below twelve result of be that little before midnight of fifth day from first reaching glided into roadstead of honolulu came to anchor on following morning immediately after breakfast went ashore taking with passenger cooper mate of golden gate while sir edgar with party made way to best hotel in place preparatory to planning of expedition must permit of seeing a much a possible of beauty of island during stay there cooper sought out respective consul of be difficult to find while partook of second breakfast with hospitable british representative learnt from after telling a much of story a deemed needful that aberdeen ship have unfortunately driven ashore gone to piece there only fortnight previously that crew be then awaiting opportunity to work way home master chief mate having already left for england via san francisco in steamer upon further inquiry found that there be thirteen of crew in namely second mate steward cook ten seaman suited exactly for although there be more men than really needed have accommodation for even greater number in esmeralda roomy forecastle deck house moreover have have that wanted of such unpleasant experience a of being short handed therefore determined to ship if be willing recompense myself for recent hardship by enjoying luxury of fully manned men be easily found be indeed on lookout for having learned early in morning that english barque have arrived in roadstead time during night upon interviewing learned that be one most anxious to make start for home be a quiet sober steady looking crew a must possibly desire to meet with have under therefore shipped whole of on spot directed to hold in readiness to join ship a soon a must receive instruction from to effect meanwhile cooper have have interview with consul result of be arrangement that crew of golden gate must land forthwith a there be several american vessel in port consequently ample facility for despatching men home a consequence of american left esmeralda same afternoon while new crew went on board took up quarter on following morning luncheon hour have arrived by time that arrangement be completed therefore hastened away to sir edgar hotel for double purpose of satisfying certain inward craving have already begun to make felt of acquainting baronet with character of business upon have be engaged during morning several member of party be naturally enough much pleased to learn that there be to be undue detention among lovely sandwich island on other hand expressed so earnest desire to see something of oahu now that be actually upon cheerfully consented to delay departure until evening of third day tour of island be thereupon arranged in be very cordially invited to join most delightful excursion be result a be not guide book nothing out of ordinary way occurred during progress will not inflict detail of upon indulgent reader upon return to ship found that forbes following instruction have re watered laid in generous supply of fruit pig poultry other necessary crew be on board there be nothing to detain longer in pacific paradise therefore got anchor forthwith stood out of roadstead in crimson wake of setting sun just a luminary sank magnificently beneath horizon painting whole western sky with flaming hue of dying effulgence there be little more to tell for rescue of golden gate crew proved to be last adventure befell on extraordinarily eventful voyage made very rapid run across to china coast be detained short time in canton river freight happening to be rather high tonnage somewhat scarce for wonder about time of arrival therefore met with difficulty in obtaining freight with quick despatch within three week of arrival be once more at sea time homeward bound must not forget to mention by way that almost first act upon arriving at hong kong be to write home two somewhat lengthy letter one to mother acquainting with successful result of quest together with full detailed narrative of adventure since leaving sydney other to old trusty friend mr richards acquainting also with success requesting to undertake certain rather delicate negotiation for a well a to make certain preparation against time of esmeralda arrival in english channel homeward passage be a prosperous a be uneventful be sooner clear of mooring than caught favourable breeze followed way until have rounded cape of good hope have caught south east trade in turn carried right up to indeed few mile to north of line here met with usual light baffling air with plenty of rain perhaps rather more than average allowance of thunder lightning weather lasted only trifle over forty eight hour when small easterly air came to rescue fanned along to northward until finally fell in with north east trade beneficent influence of carried a far north a parallel of twenty eight degree here again kind fortune favoured for when at trade wind failed wind gradually hauled round from southward thence from westward north west hardening time until at length blew quite fresh gale sent bowling staggering away to northward eastward under single reefed topsail with topgallant sail over reeling off fourteen knot hour after hour enabling to hold own for whole day with one of west indian mail boat homeward bound much doubt to chagrin astonishment of officer breeze continued to freshen however sea to rise necessitating first handing of topgallant sail little later on further reefing down of topsail when great steamer gradually drew away from by next morning be out of sight slant lasted for four day when wind gradually softened into moderate sailing breeze veering time until finally worked round from southward once more bringing with mild genial sunshiny weather carried right up channel to portland road entered on lovely summer evening nine month almost to day from date upon have quitted at commencement of voyage be of course careful to have ship number burgee conspicuously displayed a entered roadstead also observed precaution of standing far enough over towards weymouth side of bay to permit of flag being distinctly made out before bringing ship to anchor result of be that before canvas be well clewed up small steam launch emerged from weymouth harbour in due time deposited dear mother very good friend mr richards upon esmeralda deck of joyous meeting ensued of dear mother smile tear caress ejaculation of gratitude at safe return of mr richards hearty congratulation at successful achievement will say nothing picture may very well be left to vivid imagination of reader need only state that after first bustle excitement of meeting have passed over mr richards drew carefully aside remarked be all right dear boy everything be arranged have put whole affair into hand of tom white man whom must trust with very life will come off to with dozen lerrets strong gang of thoroughly reliable men at two o'clock to morrow morning hand over case of treasure to without hesitation will take care of for know exactly how to manage business trust for be smuggler in youth when smuggling be still paying business a be forbear for generation before so be in man blood see a mr richards have said so proved night be luckily very dark therefore exactly suited to purpose promptly at two o'clock man white with fleet of lerrets came gliding noiselessly alongside out of darkness in le than hour ounce of treasure be out of ship with nobody bit wiser next morning man came alongside offering crab for sale before leaving ship slipped crumpled dirty piece of note paper smelling strongly of fish into hand upon opening with difficulty deciphered following communication deer sur boxis be awl rite yours to command t white be there anything else to tell well yes there be just one further item of information may interest at least of reader remember remarking in course of narrative that toward latter part of acquaintance with miss merrivale dating particularly from capture recapture of ship at treasure island very charming young lady demeanour toward underwent certain subtle indefinable puzzling exceedingly agreeable change after have left china be on homeward voyage when in short have leisure to give proper amount of thought attention to so important matter determined to ascertain what meant now be not love story so will not enter into particular of how first of fell to questioning a to why change of manner must have proved so agreeable to will describe mental process by quickly arrived at conclusion that be because agnes merrivale be beyond question sweetest most lovable a well a most charming lovely woman have ever be good fortune to encounter will attempt to describe devious method complicated stratagem by having arrived at conclusion painfully sought to obtain slight inkling clue to sweet girl sentiment toward let suffice to say that be signally miserably unsuccessful dear reader must of course have managed infinitely better be well aware of remember if please be only plain unpolished sailor man who maybe must handle ship fairly well take care of in gale of wind navigate successfully from port to port who have until now have experience of woman way moreover must have cut off right hand rather than have said done anything to offend one of sex worthy name of woman so for first time in life be fairly nonplussed unhappy knowing full well what wanted not knowing what step ought to take in order to insure to myself fair chance of obtaining such state of mind however be not likely to be long tolerated by sailor good sense came to aid whispered that if love loved have only to give opportunity to say so must be well so one night how well remember be pitch dark be just clear of strait of sunda rolling merrily along before fresh easterly breeze under rag that must pack upon ship got dear girl to myself for while upon poop told in simple sailorly language exactly what be feeling hope be promenading poop together arm in arm while spoke heard to end without word then stopped placing hand in mine said with unmistakable quiver of emotion in voice thank jack for most priceless gift man can offer
