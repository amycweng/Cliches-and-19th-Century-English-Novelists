care that hare brain of yours doe not get into trouble meanwhile for know what be when come into plymouth on holiday never fear for harry returned roger have now something in view of more importance than street brawl such folly will take care get into trouble to prevent joining at sutton pool a agreed with word two lad separated harry returning to home to break momentous news to sister elicit view concerning proposed expedition roger proceeding to house of uncle worthy mercer of town with whom be staying during holiday be at time taking in plymouth little did two boy for be scarcely more realise momentous nature of step that have taken when pledged one on plymouth hoe must have foreseen wild terrible day awful sight hardship privation lay before through must have to pas ere might return to native country be highly probable that must not have started on expedition at if have done so must have be with far heavier heart more serious face than carried at time when made compact to

to look with eye have somewhat more in than mere friendship after two lad have have meal sorely needed after long pull roger intimated that desired to speak to father mother in private so three moved to adjoining room said roger dear father mother have for time be of opinion that be only wasting day at home here doing nothing have long be wishing to speak to about matter while be on holiday in plymouth heard of nothing adventure exploit of men who have gone to indie south american coast of success in arm against spaniard to mind there be occupation so befitting english gentleman a of taking up arm against natural enemy spanish also be quite clear to that huge fortune be to be won in grand game of war while know a well a in what great need of money house stand at present so few morning

work hard a fully intend to do doubt cavendish will soon promote to post under a officer of rank suitable to age ability then be what have wished to speak to about now having told wish beg that will let go be needle to say that sudden news of roger determination came a somewhat of blow to parent especially mother who be very much against son adopting profession in there be so much danger roger father however looked at matter from more practical business point of view being fully aware that what roger have said about glory honour rich to be won by brave man at sea at period be perfectly true although loath to lose only son saw quite clearly that lad have fully made up mind to go to sea even before speaking about matter that if be forbidden must take kindly to nothing else so promised roger that must talk matter over with wife that in due time must let son know decision possibly in course of day roger mother a might be expected raised opposition must to going away husband pointed out to so clearly advantage to be gained that eventually gave way consented with many tear to part with boy found slight consolation however in fact that mary edgwyth must be with during roger absence for knew that mary must be to even a daughter must help in measure to fill roger place until returned father accordingly communicated to roger result of talk with wife latter being high spirited young fellow be naturally greatly elated thereat plied father with question a to when might be allowed to leave how adventure be to be brought about there be good deal to be done however before roger harry must get away clothes have to be bought packed roger father have to make enquiry a to whether mr cavendish must find room in ship if so whether must take two lad however proved satisfactory in long run roger harry be ordered to be on board cavendish ship stag royal on before twentieth day of july left two boy about month in to complete preparation before day of sailing came round needle to say time lagged most painfully for eager young adventurer although to roger parent seemed too short meanwhile mary edgwyth have come up to manor be safely installed there last week before date of sailing soon came round boy being in perfect fever of enthusiasm delight at prospect of leaving england to fight spaniard on eve of departure roger father presented harry roger with splendid new rapier blade of be made of best toledo steel of so fine temper that be possible without injury to weapon to bend point round until met hilt blade springing back when released to original position shape gift naturally delighted two lad immensely at final order came bidding be on board by th of july without fail a ship fleet sailed on st at daybreak roger harry accordingly packed belonging girding on new sword started down river early next day accompanied by roger parent harry sister of whom be anxious to see a much of two lad a possible before left arrived in plymouth in afternoon lad having reported formally joined ship entire party proceeded to harry house to spend night rose in early hour of next morning last farewell be said upon quay while boat from stag royal remained alongside to convey to ship roger mother wept copiously fervently prayed that son might return safe sound while father le demonstratively shook hand with gave blessing in form of husky god keep boy mary edgwyth embraced brother affectionately must be said that tear shed be not for harry alone be certain that many of be evoked by thought that be also parting from roger at two lad stepped down quay stair into boat looking rather fixedly in front of a battled with peculiar choking sensation in throat gripped sword tightly striving to gain courage by touch of managed to keep back tear threatened to overflow when way to ship be able to turn round wave farewell to three people still watching from quay chapter three how roger harry took part in first sea fight squadron headed by ship of cavendish stag royal be well on way to indie across atlantic having taken in wood water store at western island roger harry by time quite recovered from first sea sickness be fast asleep in bunk being watch below when be aroused by cry on deck of sail ho followed by question in voice where away right ahead sir came reply seems to be large ship spanish by rig be quite enough for two lad who springing out of berth dressed with possible speed ran up on deck when arrived there however there be nothing to be seen from level twenty pair of eager eye be looking out from forecastle head anxious for first glimpse of stranger who be nearly certain to prove enemy therefore prospective prize presently voice exclaimed see see there be right ahead of at same moment hail floated down from masthead sail ho again several of by time roger harry must see topsail of ship first sighted heart beat fast at prospect of coming engagement how many sail can make out shouted officer on deck can see four more besides one sighted first sir came reply ship look to like spanish fleet sent out to intercept for seem to be hove to waiting for something be well replied officer smiling at roger let only lie to until reach there be not much doubt that will get something in nature of extremely disagreeable surprise now fleet of cavendish consisted of three ship only stag royal on board be roger harry with cavendish being flag ship of little squadron behind at distance of about mile came elizabeth good adventure close together cavendish having come on deck shortly after first hail looked at fleet of enemy then cast eye over own small squadron a if comparing in mind comparative strength of two fleet then gave order prepare ship for action men clear deck get hammock rolled up triced along bulwark open powder magazine get powder shot on deck see that captain of gun have plentiful supply of also pas word for yeoman of signal to signal elizabeth good adventure to prepare for action forthwith to range up one on side of having given order seen that men hastened to carry out cavendish turned to harry roger who be standing together anxiously looking ahead at five ship be growing larger more distinctly visible to eye moment well young gentleman said mean to engage five ship that see yonder so will get first taste of adventure have come to seek see that bear yourselves bravely remember be fighting for queen honour glory of country coming engagement be going to be child play may take word for be five vessel to three be more heavily armed of bigger tonnage than be by look of fear not young men faint heart never won fair enterprise if must beat a be certainly determined that will doubtless will have handsome booty to handle after battle yet will be hard fighting trust that not only two man on board good ship of mine will do very utmost with word cavendish turned away went aft to give further order meanwhile other two ship of squadron in answer to signal have crowded on more sail be fast closing up one on side of flag ship hull of five spaniard be now quite plainly to be seen be observed that be prepared waiting to give battle having slightly altered formation since sighting english in order to secure what thought be best position for fighting opponent be by time about two mile distant have formed into two division in order now known a column of line ahead be evidently expecting english ship to run in between two squadron thus formed trusting thus to be obliged to use only one broadside of ship while english must be compelled to use idea of spaniard being that with formation english must pas between one at time while english ship must use broadside upon entering lane between two spanish squadron must be thereafter exposed with empty gun to fire in succession of five spanish ship be to say two ship in line ahead on one side three in same formation on other if imagined that english be going to walk open eyed into such simple trap a that be vastly mistaken cavendish saw at once what tactic enemy anticipated that must adopt immediately made up mind to checkmate by following totally different line of action accordingly promptly signalled for other two captain to come on board did forthwith taking into cabin of ship briefly hurriedly explained to manoeuvre intended to adopt to outwit spaniard explanation be soon made two skipper immediately returned to respective ship two squadron have by time arrived within gunshot of other harry roger eager though be for fight to commence be yet conscious of peculiar feeling something akin to fright in extenuation of must be remembered that of boy have ever be in action before be now hour after mid day one bell sounded on three ship of english fleet at almost same moment before sound of bell have died away first shot in action be fired by spaniard harry who be watching starboard line division of enemy saw flash immediately afterwards heard whizzing sound followed from somewhere over head by sharp crash then shower of splinter fell round roger who be standing close by while immediately following down wind came dull boom of explosion roger looked aloft to see what damage have be done by shot be not very much fore topmast showed white mark where piece have be neatly gouged out of few rope be severed nothing serious have happened in accordance with cavendish order shot be fired in return by english fleet presently a be about mile from foremost spanish vessel very hurricane of smoke fire burst from a many of a must bring gun to bear on little english squadron there be crashing crackling round roger harry involuntarily winced a round shot came flying through bulwark spar splinter came tumbling flying around from behind there came shriek a poor wretch met death wound from across water more shriek be heard announcing that theirs be not only ship be struck first blood to enemy shouted harry to roger through turmoil of crashing wood shriek of wounded men yes replied roger wish must give order to fire plan of sailing along without making reply to enemy gun be unnerving seems to that if be fired upon much longer without replying will have men left in condition to fight when get alongside enemy never fear roger replied harry cavendish know what be about think see even now what manoeuvre mean to execute three english ship be now heading a though indeed intended passing between two line of enemy squadron have so far fired not single shot suddenly however when only separated by few hundred yard english changed course two three point to port headed for starboard side of two ship constituted right hand line of spanish fleet thus three english vessel be for few minute opposed to only two spanish ship three others being unable to fire except through consort manoeuvre compelled other three ship to leave present berth run before wind afterwards tacking before must range up on opposite side of english fleet so bring gun to bear during time occupied by movement english ship be by mean idle upon ranging up alongside two spanish vessel sail of english ship collapsed a if by magic halliard being let go clewlines manned a craft lost way grapnel be thrown ship be secured alongside two of spaniard at period spanish war vessel be built with flush deck be deck be level fore aft without bulwark be of much greater length than english vessel be short therefore more easy to manoeuvre than spaniard likewise there be raised construction at bow stern something like small fort called forecastle aftercastles former word still remaining under modern term forecastle english vessel be then a mentioned above shorter by good deal than of opponent so total length of three english ship be covered by of two spanish vessel fact preserved for moment from fire of other three ship of enemy roger now saw reason why cavendish have reserved fire immediately ship came alongside of enemy broadside of three be simultaneously discharged with fearful effect for amid crash of falling spar rending timber must be heard cry shriek of wounded moan of dying dense cloud of smoke spread over deck concealed combatant from one din be terrific while order shout hoarse word of command fierce oath mingled with cheer of english sternmost vessel of enemy be one have received concentrated broadside of two of english ship be now on fire somewhere on lower deck three four of port be blown into one big opening deck be very shamble of dead wounded fire below made very rapid headway effectually prevented men from working lower deck gun thus happened that with one discharge from english gun one of two spanish ship engaged be seriously crippled two craft however responded gallantly from upper deck with what cannon be still able to serve perfect hail of arrow arquebus bullet swept english deck mowing down men in direction english have quietly reloaded of broadside gun be on side of enemy gun of port broadside being still undischarged now lad roared cavendish above clamour din of rending timber falling spar give broadside let musketeer on upper deck bowman in fore after castle follow up with volley in order to clear deck immediately after discharge boarder be to follow at commencement of engagement roger harry seeing what be likely to happen have laid aside light rapier armed with pair of pistol apiece more formidable english hanger a used by ordinary seaman shoulder to shoulder stood by starboard bulwark ready to spring a soon a cavendish must give order to board meanwhile three other spaniard seeing manoeuvre of english danger of consort have made sail a quickly a possible be now running away before wind in order to go about stand up on starboard tack to engage english vessel relieve companion be in somewhat parlous state gun of english ship starboard broadside now once more opened fire with simultaneous crash be immediately followed by discharge of musketry arrow laid low on spaniard deck nearly living soul who have not taken what cover deck structure afforded now boarder roared cavendish voice ringing high above turmoil away with leave deck until flag come down with wild cheer seaman headed by cavendish who be closely supported by roger harry who be respectively second third on enemy deck dashed at spaniard one of two spanish ship be now blazing fiercely having be set on fire by discharge of english gun crew be beginning to think that time have arrived for to leave in opinion be confirmed by english who be gradually driving from own deck to of consort be thus a be between two fire be badly hampered by necessity to climb from one vessel to other of who must not gain deck of other ship be driven overboard very few of survived to reach goal quickly lad shouted roger drive fellow off deck let regain own ship while can other spaniard be drawing up will be on before be ready for if look sharp seaman animated by voice seeing necessity for doing a said redoubled effort with hearty cheer massed together charged along reeking slippery deck spaniard unable to resist weight of charge scattered finding other way of escape dashed below must not so easily avoid victorious english who followed hunted out of hiding place a roger harry having dashed below in pursuit be running down one of narrow alleyway searching for hidden spaniard man sprang from behind curtain aimed heavy blow with sword at roger who be foremost cutting down with faint groan roger fell harry stumbled over body thus enabling spaniard to effect escape half stunned from force of fall harry raised bent over roger roger roger exclaimed be much hurt speak to lad roger made reply lying perfectly still with stream of red slowly spreading from under head staining white planking suddenly from above sounded harsh cry back back man of cut ship adrift spaniard be firing magazine back for life loud imperative rang out voice of cavendish quick lad for life will be blown up together roger roger wake lad cried harry ship have be set on fire will blow up directly heaven what can do roger never stirred so a there be nothing else to be done harry took body under arm began to drag along toward nearest hatchway at moment broadside of english again rang out showing that other three spaniard be drawing up be within gunshot meanwhile on board spanish ship sound be to be heard save roar crackle of flame a harry putting out strength lifted inanimate body of friend to shoulder plunged along passage through blinding suffocating smoke be dashing forward holding breath a much a possible with eye smarting with smoke feeling a though must burst from socket when crashed up against obstacle dropping body of roger from force of contact puff of fresh air now blew smoke aside for moment harry saw what be cause of stoppage way be blocked by stout oaken door have evidently be closed by seaman when retreated upon hearing alarm that magazine be in danger of being fired harry dragged frantically at handle turned wildly in vain door be secured on other side by kind of spring latch escape seemed impossible smoke meanwhile be momentarily becoming more more dense be now agony to breathe while second of delay meant awful danger roger seemed to be rapidly bleeding to death for want of attention to wound harry looked round for instrument with to force door eye fell upon handspike probably dropped by flying foe seizing smashed madly at door till at panel splintered under frantic blow then putting hand through opening felt for latch found door opened at touch once again raising roger in arm staggered blindly along at last bleeding from contact with splinter hand almost raw with wielding handspike reached foot of companion ladder dashed up with still inanimate burden in arm on reaching deck saw that grapnel have be cut three english vessel have drifted hundred of yard away be even then engaging three other spanish ship have come up air be again full of roar of cannon crashing of timber falling of mast shriek groan cry order imprecation spanish ship have be in company with craft caught fire have vanished only few timber fragment be floating on surface have evidently be sunk by terrible fire of english gun ship on now be maria dolorosa be by time spouting fountain of flame from bow a far aft a mainmast gun be exploding one after a fire reached added thunder to already awful din harry raised voice shouted over water with power of lung to english ship continued roar of cannon mingled with rattling crash of musketry volley shouted command of officer hoarse outcry of toiling fighting men crash of rending wood a broadside tore way into vitals of reeling ship effectually drowned outcry while everybody be far too busily engaged to notice critical situation ah roger said apostrophising inanimate figure lay at foot a stood at extreme edge of poop in order to be a far away from furnace heat a possible ah roger fear dear lad that life be coming to end even before be fairly launched on adventure oh why can not at moment there be roar a if earth heaven be dissolving in chaos harry feeling a if be being whirled downward into everlasting night knew more fire have at last reached magazine chapter four what happened to roger on board gloria del mundo when roger next opened eye be at loss to to recall immediately to mind preceding event must for moment imagine where might be be in great pain from wound in head received on board spanish ship harry have boarded together served to bring memory back to what have occurred remembered rushing with harry down dark alleyway with cutlas in hand also that man have suddenly sprung at cut down that have received so violent blow on head that have felt certain skull be cloven asunder then memory ceased abruptly where be harry inseparable companion roger raised throbbing head painfully tried to look round must nowhere discover presence of dear friend shouted name harry harry where be there be reply only somewhere above must hear roar of cannon hoarse cry of command angry shout trampling foot of many men looking about perceived that lay in cabin of sort very richly furnished lit by light so dim that must only make out object in very indistinctly there be port hole sky light of description in apartment led to conclusion that must be in room far away below water line impression be heightened by fact that exterior noise came to ear muffled a by distance in cabin there be sound save gnawing of rat somewhere on floor below on wall must dimly discern two three picture just above bunk be portrait of lady there be also several star trophy of weapon arranged at interval at one end of cabin be of unusually spacious dimension stood large cabinet escritoire one of drawer of have apparently be pulled out hastily a paper be to be seen protruding from several document have fallen to floor oh how wished might venture to rise from bunk make investigation of cabin be afraid to attempt such exploit for head ached so atrociously felt so deadly sick giddy from anguish of wound loss of blood that felt certain if exerted ever so little must sink helpless insensible to deck while thinking thus abstractedly raised hand to head thus discovered that wound have be bandaged evidently by skilled hand for wrapping be neatly put on adjusted sewn instead of being merely tied be so far satisfactory for seemed to point to fact that have fallen into friendly hand although returning sens enabled to come to conclusion that must certainly be aboard spanish ship with sigh of relief be preparing to pull coverlet over lie down once more when ear caught sound of footstep approaching be just about to shout to person person whoever might be enquire a to where be whether must afford information a to what have become of harry when quick ear caught one two word of conversation unknown person be carrying on be in spanish then surmise be true one be indeed aboard one of enemy ship with stifled cry flung down in bunk pulled coverlet over once again closing eye simulating heavy breathing in hope of persuading new comer that be in deep slumber be only just in time for a composed limb into comfortable position in event of stranger making lengthy stay two men entered roger looked at from between nearly closed eyelid saw that be tall men slender dark wearing long black mustachio closely trimmed beard roger happened to posse slight knowledge of spanish be thus able to gather meaning of at least part of conversation with one accord approached roger bunk leaned over looking at face sleep said elder of two men well let sleep a long a will replied companion sardonically for be little enough sleep young heretic will get when once be delivered over to holy inquisition roger shuddered have heard quite enough of method of institution to understand significance of word longed to open eye take more particular note than have yet be able to do of personality of two visitor withstood temptation kept eye closed listening hard to catch must of ensuing conversation what alvarez be captain order with regard to boy said elder man whose name transpired be de soto senor don guzman order answered other be that be to be kept in cabin until have finally disposed of three pestilent english ship when be done have captured be to be locked up in fore hold with other prisoner will take if rascal in case fight to death a often do then when return to cadiz be to be handed over to holy inquisition roger felt cold perspiration start in bead on forehead ah seems almost pity said de soto that must have plucked lad from shark only to hand over to other fiend of holy office for be handsome stalwart lad limb of be never meant to be seared with red hot iron torn asunder on rack hush de soto friend responded alvarez let man save hear speak thus of holy office thy limb of thou art so proud may perchance make acquaintance with same torment a be reserved for young heretic thanks alvarez returned de soto must not have spoken thus before other than thou art friend know can trust thee with life a indeed be trusting thee in speaking thus freely of so called holy inquisition be not so yes de soto be so be indeed thy friend replied alvarez turning head slightly aside so that companion might not catch evil glitter shone in eye did not know that roger be observing through nearly closed lid that have caught that look on alvarez face a turned from de soto possibly if have known must not have greatly cared if ever devil incarnate looked out of man eye did at moment out of of man whom roger have heard addressed a alvarez how go fight de soto continued after pause methinks there be le cannonading now than there be little time since when left deck few minute ago answered de soto two of ship ala maria dolorosa buena vista have disappeared one be sunk by fire of cursed english unable to hold other brave countryman fired magazine expect young heretic be on board ship blew up for just before explosion came thought saw two figure on poop one of whom be standing up while other be lying on deck at foot think one who be lying down must have be friend here what became of other know not be doubtless either drowned swallowed by one of same shark from only just rescued lad in nick of time will live fear to wish that have left to a for other three ship be engaging right valiantly of enemy beating down too cursed islander seem to know not when be beaten doubt that victory will be at easy one a for although ship of cavendish have lost mast hull be almost intact thanks to wretched gunnery there now lie on water unable to move be true like wounded lion more dangerous for being wounded gloria del mundo be giving attention will be compelled to strike to heavier broadside ere long other two vessel el capitan salvador be engaging remaining ship of english squadron moment can not be far distant when will surrender to flag of most sacred majesty philip of spain invincible flag flag of empire of old world new concluded de soto so thought roger to must appear that be on board gloria del mundo that action be a yet undecided senor de soto be imagine somewhat mistaken if seriously belief that cavendish will surrender ship rather will let sink with colour flying will not believe that flag of england mistress of sea be day destined to dip to blood gold flag of spain end of fight will wager be not only farther off than good de soto suspect will also have different ending from what look forward to name be not roger trevose believe lad be awake said alvarez must almost swear moved just now men bent over roger who have involuntarily stirred upon hearing that two anticipated surrender of english dissented de soto think still sleep must have imagined alvarez glitter came again into eye of latter a replied de soto imagination be not when suddenly roar of cannonading again commenced drowning remainder of sentence then came shock made stately vessel reel throughout whole of massive fabric there be rending grinding of timber frightful crash on deck announced that one of mast have come down roger heard distant cheer knew that prognostication that end have not yet come be correct evidently english have repeated manoeuvre that have so successfully practised earlier in day laid ship alongside once more musketry pistol shot shout groan clash of steel perfect medley of sound floated down from deck above through open cabin door quick alvarez on deck roared de soto plunging out of cabin english have laid aboard will have ship if be not careful alvarez be in nowise behindhand snatching sword from sheath clutching pistol from table a went followed de soto on deck roger attempted to get out of bunk with idea of joining friend on deck taking part in fight fell back on mattress weak giddy from attempt what must not give to be able to go on deck at moment must not stir for reeling giddiness of head felt that to attempt to rise must result in falling insensible to floor of cabin must lie still listen to turmoil raging above head din be terrific now came triumphant shout in english roger must picture to bravo fellow rushing spaniard pell mell across own deck into water below again tide of battle seemed to turn english to be getting worst of oh maddening thought that be helplessly imprisoned here unable to take part in brave doings be being wrought above little by little shout fierce cry died away who have won conjectured roger to there be clatter of running foot in passage leading to cabin man alvarez with hunted look of terror in face clashed into apartment burrowed hastily among paper in open drawer that roger have noticed at first apparently be unable to find what be looking for carramba ejaculated what have de soto done with paper tore remainder of from drawer with curse flung on floor dropping on knee hastily turned over one after a lay there now for time roger have be vaguely conscious of peculiar sluggish movement of ship a heaved on swell sight of alvarez haste suddenly brought ghastly truth home to ship be sinking must wait no longer muttered alvarez to will be drowned like rat in trap in company with young heretic there in bunk wonder whether by chance de soto have taken paper carrajo now remember when came in together to look at english whelp drawer be open without doubt de soto have well never mind will have from before have finished with can recall have said about holy inquisition if be not enough to condemn can easily enough invent something else have paper from before dy will perhaps when be in hand of inquisition hate so much will be willing to surrender document to dear friend alvarez if friend promise to rescue from further torment now for english cub continued rising to foot drawing dagger from sheath once again came that sickening lurch accompanied by sound of washing of water close at hand ship be fast settling down murmured alvarez can not wait life be too valuable to to risk even for pleasure of slaying englishman sea will soon send youngster to nether world rushed from cabin leaving paper chart strewn on floor at foot of escritoire by time roger be pretty fully awake to knowledge of great pressing danger here be weak dazed to point of utter helplessness on board fast sinking ship with none to render aid feeling quite unable to move without oh god help moaned what miserable death to die harry harry harry cried distractedly come help be here below drowning help help there be reply sound that have heard before without attaching much importance to now forced upon attention be swishing of water looking over edge of bunk saw that water be already rising fast over floor of cabin desperation now lent strength pulling together with violent effort slowly painfully rose upright put leg over edge of berth felt incapable of making further effort for moment then once more raised voice shouted for help time fancied that far away in distance heard reply shouted again again then paused listening answering voice sounded little nearer at moment ship gave roll to roger seemed a though must founder immediately there be sickening lurch roger convinced that end have come went tumbling off edge of bunk fell flat on face in about two foot of water be washing over cabin floor shock of fall displaced bandage wound began to bleed afresh confused a still be idea took possession of that be in danger of bleeding to death must nobody ever come to take out of awful hole help help be drowning shouted time there be answering voice then roger once more pulled together began to crawl over floor water splashing round over inch by inch neared door then heard call so near that startled for heaven sake where be roger answer man if be alive voice be harry harry groaned roger here be help quickly will be too late ship sink fast guided by voice harry soon made appearance roger man cried thank god have found thought be gone for ever can help at lad little think if will put arm round replied roger harry flung arm under roger arm pit raised to foot one moment harry cried roger pointing to paper alvarez have left on floor be now floating about cabin secure paper believe be of value harry seized document with free hand supporting roger staggered with to foot of companion ladder how eventually got up into free air two never clearly knew for be deep down in body of ship have two three ladder to climb ere arrived on upper deck reach did after what seemed eternity of suspense then a stepped out once more into blessed free air of whole of atlantic seemed suddenly to sweep over ship felt slide from beneath foot be drawn down down down until appeared a though must never again see light at last with lung bursting almost suffocated shot up to heaving surface of sea clinging tightly to other there oh blessed sight not twenty fathom away lay own ship dismasted looking utter wreck more beautiful to eye than palace from deck there came shout there be there be lower away boat lower quickly shark will have in few minute only remaining boat belonging to ship be lowered dozen willing arm be sending flying over water towards two lad bearded face looked over gunwale brawny arm literally snatched from awful death for a be dragged out of water there be snap of hungry jaw several huge shark be baulked of prey few minute later dripping exhausted two lad found once more safe sound on deck of beloved ship saw cavendish looking at with expression of anxiety on face hope lad be none worse for adventure said sir be safe thank god replied roger have be through good deal be somewhat shaken must therefore like to go below for while be fighting over yes replied cavendish victory be to two then went below harry soon have roger under care of surgeon good man pronounced that wound be not dangerous that must do with care then sitting by roger side harry plunged into recital of adventure since boarding of spaniard circle of eager listener standing sitting round chapter five encounter storm at sea reach island of cuba what have happened to roger be already known to reader what befell harry after explosion on board maria dolorosa may be very shortly recounted shock of plunge into cold water brought to sens in time to prevent from drowning first thought be to look after roger friend be nowhere to be seen shouted name in vain for time then started to swim towards own ship lay quite near in faint hope that perhaps friend might have be seen rescued by made enquiry immediately on reaching deck of ship must elicit information a to roger whereabouts everybody on board be much too busy with own work of fighting three remaining spanish ship to pay attention to harry must not thus easily resign to roger loss peered over lee bulwark in endeavour to discover friend body if be still afloat must however see nothing of be beginning to fear that have indeed lost dear friend companion of boyhood when from gloria del mundo spanish ship be nearest to saw boat lowered pulled away in direction of floating piece of wreckage have not until then noticed saw boat row up close to wreckage take from body appeared to be hanging limply across looking more intently felt almost certain that body be that of roger boat pulled back to gloria del mundo be hoisted on board if body be indeed that of roger then thank heaven be safe for time being poor lad be nevertheless still in very precarious situation being on board spanish ship harry must see also that vessel be in manifest distress have apparently not much longer to float be time after cavendish having at length disposed of previous antagonist ordered ship to be laid alongside gloria del mundo with object of capturing out of hand making prize of before sank be accordingly done crash roger have heard followed by cry musketry be indeed a believed result of english vessel being laid alongside rush of english boarder go without saying that harry be among first to board immediately commenced search for roger unluckily began in totally different quarter from in roger have be placed gloria del mundo be soon in hand of english be found that be sinking too fast for to save boarder be at once recalled harry however determined not to leave without friend be therefore left behind when englishman returned to own vessel grapnel uniting two ship be cut at once craft began to drift apart harry being left on board spanish vessel searching for roger how found rescued obtaining possession of certain document at very last moment hoisted roger on deck even a ship swamped beneath foot have already be told now a to result of action of two ship first engaged by english maria dolorosa buena vista latter have be sunk at commencement of action former have blown up third ship gloria del mundo have sunk salvador el capitan be only two of spanish fleet still remained afloat be fearfully knocked about salvador have lost mast one of boat have be smashed to piece by gun fire of english side be everywhere perforated with shot hole prize crew have be put on board be now hard at work patching up rendering seaworthy rigging jury mast cutting away wreckage otherwise putting once more into sailing trim el capitan be in similar condition have still mizzenmast standing otherwise be a badly damaged a companion be undergoing same repair refit spaniard who have escaped on board salvador el capitan from other vessel crew of two ship still left alive have be divided into five batch one being put on board ship be done by way of precaution since thus separated there be much le likelihood of attempting to recapture own ship take of english english squadron have suffered almost a badly for although none of vessel have be sunk be in very seriously damaged condition cavendish vessel stag royal have lost mast be in great danger of foundering appearance being that of huge mass of wreckage rather than ship carpenter be hard at work on be making good defect a quickly a possible other two vessel of english fleet elizabeth good adventure be not quite so much cut up a ship of commodore stood in need of good deal of repair before must be again serviceable english have put prize crew on board two spanish ship sadly depleting company of own ship hand be kept hard at work of repair for cavendish knew in event of gale springing up none of ship must weather in existing condition be very trying work too patching up of vessel at sea at best must be nothing more than temporary repair at last after three day of incessant toil five of craft be reported a fit to proceed on voyage yet be agreed that ought to run for place where ship might be beached careened overhauled thoroughly otherwise must not be trusted to weather storm must inevitably meet with on proposed cruising ground be caribbean sea cavendish therefore summoned conclave of captain of little squadron in cabin of flag ship to decide upon place where might go to execute necessary repair chart be got out laid upon table course be laid off to various place distance thereto measured calculated after discussion be decided unanimously that must run for west india island trusting that might meet with spanish squadron on way at rendezvous for overhauling place agreed to make for be eastern end of island of cuba a island lay on direct course for caribbean sea coast of mexico where intended to cruise in hope of picking up plate laden galleon from vera cruz tampico island of cuba be be true spanish possession be at time newly discovered only very sparsely populated so by keeping to eastern extremity of island maintaining sharp lookout whilst ship be in process of careening hoped to avoid encounter with enemy until ship being properly repaired once more serviceable must find in position to resume cruise with view to securing of more prize squadron of five ship have just beaten have be sent out from cadiz to intercept cavendish prevent from reaching indie being war fleet have treasure on board gain to english consisted therefore solely in acquisition of two more ship for little fleet be not altogether unmixed blessing because with obligation to man extra two vessel whole five be now short handed cavendish gave order to captain be that five vessel must make for eastern end of cuba if separated meet at spot bearing of gave about day sail from island whence must proceed in company so a to arrive at agreed destination together now remained to appoint two captain to prize put prize crew on board be soon done cavendish appointed first second officer of flag ship a captain of two captured spanish ship replacing first officer by third man named leigh appointing roger to vacant post of second officer have be intention to promote harry to position a officer on one of captured ship lad begged so hard to be allowed to remain in same vessel a roger that cavendish at last consented adding that thought harry be throwing away opportunity might not again occur so long a might remain by roger side however harry did not very much care besides thought made compact to remain always by one be sure roger must have stayed with have be appointed instead of signal be now made for sail possible to be carried so that might sooner reach rendezvous begin work of overhauling repair of stood in such urgent need if separated by storm other mischance be to meet at place agreed upon during conclave in cabin of flag ship sail be made accordingly little squadron now increased by two ship with sadly diminished crew resumed voyage for first three day went smoothly speed of whole being regulated by pace of slowest vessel in squadron on evening of third day however weather showed sign of changing have be sailing along with good following breeze sky overhead deep cloudless sapphire blue sea enough to relieve from uneasiness now however sun be sinking toward horizon like ball of dull red copper western sky instead of being clear a previously be heavy with black cloud be banking up threatening to obscure sun ere set overhead too deep violet cloud made appearance tinged here there to lurid red orange by ray of fast disappearing luminary air moreover felt dull heavy carried peculiar odour not unlike brimstone singular condition of atmosphere be not without effect on men who felt listless disinclined to work sense of impending peril seemed to be hanging over wind too be gradually dying away came fitfully at interval in hot sulphurous puff sea have be sparkling in thousand of tiny wavelet in ray of sun began to assume dark oily appearance long swell be beginning to make felt causing sail a drooped against mast to flap noisily with sound like crack of arquebuse gradually sky grew blacker more overcast sea assumed appearance of ink five ship of squadron be well within sight of one lay motionless save for uneasy heaving to swell be now fast rising having lost steerage way be boxing compass be be heading first in one direction then in bow slowly swinging until pointed in various direction cavendish be on deck looking anxiously at sky presently gave order to hand to shorten sail hailed ship lying nearest to to do same other vessel be lying too far away for hail to carry there be wind to lift signal flag if hoisted commodore be relieved to see remainder of fleet follow example in few moment canvas of whole squadron be seen coming heavily down being rolled up on yard before very long ship be either under bare pole being snugged down with everything secured ready for emergency cavendish however still remained very anxious have cause enough for anxiety for squadron have only recently come through heavy action timber be strained mast have be merely secured in temporary manner necessary stay fore aft preventers have not yet be rigged indeed process of bending new sail rope etcetera be still being gone on with although ship have be got under way at earliest possible moment shot hole have be only roughly plugged in of vessel pumping be still being carried on day night two prize have be knocked about still more badly in fact whole squadron be in very unfit state to encounter even strong gale coming storm threatened something very much worse than everything be battened down made a snug a possible cavendish must now do be to trust in providence hope ship must survive tempest since nothing have be left undone that mortal hand must possibly do dull moaning sound at length began to make heard several hot sulphurous gust of wind came down out of north block overhead creaked cordage rattled in heavy silence weird noise made perceptible roger harry be standing on poop exchanging comment on weather cavendish chief officer richard leigh be in close conversation on main deck just below glancing anxiously from time to time toward northward where sky have become black almost a midnight look there harry observed roger pointing to main topgallant yard looking up harry perceived two lambent globe of greenish fire a continued looking wondering what might be other weird light made appearance on yard arm on very top of mast presenting beautiful at same time very eerie spectacle same phenomenon be to be seen on spar of vessel in sight a be by time very nearly dark there being scarcely twilight in latitude whole squadron have appearance of being illuminated can possibly be queried harry have never seen anything like before suspect returned roger that be in way connected with approaching storm have heard sailor speak of light a witch light death gleam corposant appearance be said always to foretell disaster hope however that forebode evil on occasion although thing be looking decidedly unpleasant just now cavendish hearing conversation looked up observing apprehension of two explained to that light be termed by portuguese navigator light of saint elmo assured lad that light be not cause of harbinger of storm fear however added that be in for bad time of youngster have better beware lest be swept overboard when sea rise for if anyone be washed over side during what be coming will have chance of being picked up again so take care young men suddenly roger perceived far away to north line of white looked like thin streak of paint drawn across ebony background dull moaning noise in air quickly grew in volume at same time becoming more shrill roger shouted down warning to leigh who be standing near wheel pointed away in direction from line of white be approaching cavendish who have just walked forward to make sure that be a must be heard warning shouted order for on deck to prepare for outfly then seizing speaking trumpet rushed up on poop beside boy roared out warning to only ship within hail then turning told two lad to get down off poop on to main deck where must be sheltered to certain extent by high bulwark of ship in obedience to command hurried down starboard accommodation ladder whilst cavendish made way down one on port side three reached deck together cavendish then shouted order to leigh at wheel whatever may have be word be drowned by awful shriek roar of hurricane a burst upon to harry roger who have never experienced anything of kind before seemed a though mighty invisible hand have smitten ship throwing over on to beam end heeled down before blast until seemed a though must capsize altogether while two boy be precipitated together across streaming deck into lee scupper whence found impossible to escape owing to excessive slant of deck leigh be hanging on to wheel for life endeavouring to put helm hard up so turn ship stern to wind to enable to run before gale only course possible under circumstance cavendish few men in fore part of vessel be meanwhile striving manfully to hoist staysail get way upon ship so a to help to pay off before sea so save from being pooped by wave be rising higher higher moment at stability of ship prevailed began to right then roger harry rushing to leigh assistance helped to put helm up ship paid off began to scud before wind while cavendish encouraging little body of men up in eye of ship managed to get foresail set after having have nearly blown out of bolt rope looking astern boy saw huge sea rushing after one threatening to engulf craft send to bottom indeed must speedily have be fate have men not be able to set small rag of sail thus made possible for to keep ahead of wave foaming crest of sea be ablaze with phosphorescence appeared to tower above poop a high a main topsail yard sight of sweeping along after ship be positively appalling wind now began to increase in violence literally tearing off summit of huge wave sending in spindrift hurtling across deck like shower of shot cut face like lash of whip uproar be terrific shrieking howling of wind blending with creaking straining of timber of labouring ship crash succeeded crash aloft must distinguish nothing of what be happening because of intense blackness yet motion of ship be becoming steadier for reason that wind be so strong that be actually beating down sea suddenly two lad heard rending tearing sound followed by crash quite close to a something weighty smote deck through fearful din raged round there rang out scream of man in agony harry said roger be mizzenmast come down have injured poor fellow let endeavour to reach if can still holding to other began to feel way carefully along deck be now encumbered with wreckage suddenly harry cried out fell over something proved to be wreck of fallen mast be hurt harry queried roger lad came response think have found poor fellow whose scream heard just now seems to have be crushed by mast a fell if will stoop down here will be able to feel body have lever of kind might perhaps be able to raise mast sufficiently to drag from underneath roger climbed over mast feeling for harry knelt down beside where found body harry have fallen upon when tripped over mast by touch found that poor seaman whoever be be pinned down immovably to deck mast lying right across middle of body roger put mouth to ear of man shouted be badly hurt can move with assistance caught reply be that master trevose be pinned down by spar believe leg be broken if must manage to get mast raised by ever so little believe must scramble out from under can find lever anywhere shouted roger there be couple of handspike in rack close to if can find will do replied wounded seaman roger worked way to rack indicated by man fortunately found handspike at once taking quickly scrambled back again handed one to harry retaining other two lad then prized point under mast threw weight on shaft using a lever felt mast quiver move slightly be way master trevose one more lift like will be out from under shouted man roger harry again exerted strength mast rose perceptibly heard cry of pain from seaman a wormed from under spar be out now master came voice if ye can lift up get below will thank ye one of supporting on side raised unfortunate fellow upright with great difficulty assisted across deck so to companion hatch found without trouble a be now growing somewhat lighter cloud be not quite so thick occasional gleam came from moon a be uncovered got man below roger taking on back down companion ladder while harry ran for surgeon latter soon made appearance attended to sufferer who proved to be ordinary seaman named morgan having seen patient off hand well attended to couple returned to deck found that wind be lessening moment cloud be disappearing fast permitting moon to shine out fitfully sea no longer kept down by pressure of wind be rising rapidly think squall be past worst harry said roger what have to fear now be sea will get worse be afraid ere go down look there merciful heaven what be that continued pointing away over port quarter with finger inky blackness have lifted somewhat must plainly perceive hull of one of own ship presumably port be open interior appeared a glowing furnace while even a looked tongue of fire spurted up from deck began to lick round mast from hapless vessel long wail of anguish despair came floating down wind eye in ship be at once turned to burning vessel presently made out to be by rig salvador one of two captured spanish vessel what seemed to have happened be that spanish prisoner confined below have fired ship before squall came down in hope of being able to overpower captor in ensuing confusion trusting to luck for opportunity to extinguish conflagration afterwards storm arising after have set fire to vessel however wind have fanned flame until have become raging fiery furnace fore aft there be mean of affording succour to miserable men on board for sea be running tremendously high rising minute be awful gorgeous spectacle presenting appearance of floating volcano vomiting flame smoke a rushed along before wind still more awful be cry shriek of agony be borne to across intervening water cavendish at once gave order that ship must be run a close a possible compatible with safety be done be impossible to save wretched crew rest of fleet endured misery of beholding comrade burn together with panic stricken spaniard author of calamity a many of whom a possible have be released a soon a fire be discovered speedy end however came to appalling tragedy be taking place before very eye for while still watched powerless to save terrific explosion occurred followed by rain of blazing piece of timber gruesome sight of portion of human body have be whirled aloft now came hurtling down on deck of flag ship fire have reached salvador magazine awful spectacle cast deep gloom over entire ship company shortly afterwards none of other vessel being in sight sea having moderated somewhat cavendish ordered ship course to be altered again bore up for rendezvous on tenth day after storm reached without further adventure agreed latitude longitude hove to waiting for remainder of squadron to make appearance two day later first of other vessel elizabeth made appearance on same evening by light of tropic star other two joined four remained hove to until daybreak early on following morning got under weigh again headed for land now must not be many mile distant shortly after noon came ever welcome cry from masthead land ho where away demanded officer of watch dead ahead answered lookout keep a go ordered cavendish with ever lessening wind glided toward land climbed higher higher above horizon by imperceptible degree by end of first dog watch on same evening be close enough to make out formation of land at length sighting bay looked promising for purpose bore up for sounding way a went a land opened up bay toward be heading appeared to offer increasingly advantageous facility for careening repairing presently passed in between two low headland covered with palm dropped anchor in calm inlet in six fathom of water at depth must clearly see bottom of sand thickly dotted with shell broken piece of coral at last after many weary fateful day have reached haven on other side of atlantic haven in one of island of fabled indie where if legend be to be believed gold be to be found more plentifully than iron in england hand gazed longingly at shore leave must not be granted night a country be unknown although appeared to be uninhabited must not be certain what eventuality might arise cavendish therefore deemed better to wait until morning then send strong force on shore to reconnoitre explore meanwhile roger harry went below to bunk slumbered dreaming of coming morn of crew who be off duty slept on deck in hammock a fancy took anchor watch be set thus hand waking sleeping waited for morning must disclose to garden of paradise chapter six how investigated certain cipher met with adventure day have scarcely broken next morning ere harry roger tumbled out of bunk dressed went up on deck so eager be once more to be on shore after many long day at sea a came on deck sun rose in tropic grandeur transfigured little inlet with ship floating on bosom environment of green palm tropical verdure golden sand running down to water edge into veritable nook of fairyland for distance so far a must judge of about three mile ground appeared to be fairly level rising very gradually thickly covered with tropical foliage beyond there be range of hill apparently about thousand foot high beyond again rose peak after peak of lofty mountain bare summit of tallest glowing like jewel in brilliant tropical light close at hand on southern shore of inlet lofty cliff ran sheer down to water edge where ledge of rock ran out little distance into bay rock seemed to be literally honey combed with cave on northern side of inlet water shoaled gradually terminating on beach of clean yellow sand again stretched for distance above water mark be then lost among bush foliage tall coco nut palm graced margin of inlet behind tree bearing orange guava banana lemon mango various other kind of tropical fruit must be discerned close at hand be in truth lovely scene that lad gazed upon bright morning there be moderately good rise fall of tide judging from mark on beach northern shore be undoubtedly one must be chosen by cavendish for careening vessel a ground sloped steeply evenly sand be firm hard trunk of palm tree must be very useful for securing hawser by mean of must heave vessel down on beam end sun mounted higher in clear blue of heaven a looked about rose sound of awakening nature away back in wood must hear chattering of monkey parrot bird of bright plumage screamed sang fluttered among tree near beach several bright plumaged flamingo stalked gravely about willow seeking morning meal in limpid water presently too life on board vessel be stirring shrill whistle of boatswain pipe roused hand to duty men came tumbling up from below business of day commenced officer of ship two lad went down presently to breakfast after leave to go on shore be granted to several of including roger harry who be going ashore quickly determined to make up party keep together because a yet knew nothing of country there be chance that might be inhabited in case if separated savage be in neighbourhood white might find awkwardly situated a many of crew a must be spared be also allowed to go on shore for few hour before business of careening refitting commenced needle to say be delighted at prospect of having little more space wherein to walk about than narrow deck of own ship also of being able to get fresh fruit of stood in great need scurvy having already appeared among after breakfast therefore quickly got boat over side soon there be regular procession of from vessel to shore once there seaman immediately began to gather fresh fruit collecting pile of what most fancied lay down beside ate at ease past peril forgotten for moment of supremely happy few of more adventurous spirit however went off into wood on tour of investigation taking musket bow with in hope of procuring little fresh meat roger harry who have of course gone ashore with first boat load stood for while on beach at edge of water undecided for moment what to do first harry suggested having bathe in limpid water of little bay first of indeed looked so inviting that roger be not slow in seconding proposition accordingly soon slipped off clothes be quickly disporting like young dolphin in water when harry glancing up saw ship lying a seemed only quarter of mile away shape reflected in water with such distinctness that be difficult to say where substance ended shadow began apparent proximity of ship immediately put idea into head at same moment shouted together let have race off to stag royal laughed that must have spoken same word together immediately decided that must have wager of noble on event be ready then roger 't be race to stag royal first up ship side on deck will win noble exclaimed harry agreed lad away go replied roger two started off swimming strongly with side stroke instead of breast for although former required more power yet be faster stroke reckoned strength to be quite equal to much longer distance than to ship a be invariably case distance viewed over water be deceptive by time that have done three quarter of course be feeling pretty well fagged out with unusual exertion though must admit fact remained that be swimming much slower than at start suddenly be startled by loud hail from deck of stag royal ship for be making in voice of cavendish be not frightened lad pull out a fast a can for ship there be shark coming after heart leapt in breast at startling news looking hurriedly round perceived to horror that several black triangular dorsal fin be cleaving water in wake closing rapidly in upon fortunately water in direction in be swimming be a yet clear to appearance can not send boat sir be nearly exhausted with swim hailed roger who be slightly in advance of harry nay can not lad for boat be still on shore must swim for life sake swim hard answered cavendish from deck of ship be leaning anxiously over bulwark rail be lined with face of few seaman who be left on board while two of have gone down accommodation ladder be waiting at foot ready to haul lad in a soon a be near enough men on board now quickly seized missile must lay hand on stood ready to bombard shark in hope of driving off if did not seize lad before got within range a for harry roger struck out with energy of terror felt that be tiring with stroke while knowledge at moment might feel in jaw of one of sea tiger seemed to paralyse limb flesh crept with horror of thought harry especially be showing manifest symptom of increasing distress while roger resisting impulse to swim on reach safety kept valiantly at side encouraging go on roger at length gasped harry be done can not reach ship swim on get on board will follow if can nay harry lad answered roger get on board not did not make compact to break at first sign of danger do utmost will yet get on board right even in extremity harry must not avoid noticing that roger hesitated when came to not brave lad must not bring to utter alternative in word before leaving shore boy have stripped down to pantaloon vest have retained a makeshift bathing costume now a luck must have roger invariably wore belt round waist to be attached very fine venetian dagger slender of blade sharp a razor very strong have be given by father a parting keepsake looked upon almost a kind of talisman therefore never allowed to leave person merely by force of habit have buckled belt dagger about before starting for swim now in moment of deadly danger suddenly recollected that have on idea came to like inspiration harry swim on reach ship said be not at tired have dagger with swim on will swim after argue not lad will waste breath do a say make haste to ship harry knowing that when roger spoke thus be useless to argue did a be ordered struck out for vessel with such energy a must muster for part roger drew dagger held firmly in hand then swimming after harry began to splash shout with might fin have by time come very close to paused suddenly scattered at unexpected commotion little time be thus gained for fugitive who made utmost of shark however be not so easily to be denied presently began to close in again by time harry be approaching side of stag royal while roger be still distance behind splashing shouting vigorously fin drew nearer nearer with deadly determination abandoning now splashing be greatly exhausting roger put out remaining strength swam for life while splashing having ceased shark be after again at once be now race not between two boy for wager of noble between boy school of shark with boy life a stake shark be fast gaining upon roger be a yet quite out of range of missile with men be ready to pelt ravenous monster harry have meanwhile reached ship be hauled in deposited on deck where immediately sank down fainting with exhaustion then seeing friend safe roger redoubled effort distance between shark lessened slightly while decreased distance between ship very perceptibly herculean effort must not last long however shark once more began to draw in upon men on deck of ship now shouted flung missile a far a must swimmer shark be still too far off for latter to be frightened by bombardment inch by inch ravenous fish closed in on lad glanced over shoulder a swam a perceived how close monster be men on board ship must see even at distance that face turned foremost shark be nearly on now there be yet considerable distance to cover ere must reach safety suddenly leading fin disappeared watcher knew that shark have dived in order better to seize prey warning be roared over water to apparently too late for with shout roger body disappeared cry of horror at once went up from ship strong men turned away unwilling to witness death of favourite who still watched however almost immediately saw tremendous disturbance of water just below spot where roger have disappeared presently broad blotch of red stained blue water of inlet while deep groan went up from assembled crowd on deck groan quickly changed to mighty cheer a saw roger form appear again at considerable distance nearer ship evidently safe sound for be still swimming strongly immediately after in rear body of shark rose to surface floating on back dead remainder of shark instantly flung upon carcass tearing to piece churning up bloody froth a struggled tore fought for share of spoil roger have done only thing possible to save life a shark dived so did swimming below brute have ripped up belly with several strong slashing blow from keen dagger thus effectually ridding of one adversary trusting that remainder of school must wait to devour a indeed have done thus giving further chance to escape be now quite near ship shark have quickly disposed of carcass of companion be again after roger however be now within range so a shark came on in pursuit be bombarded with description of missile upon men must lay hand proceeding checked slightly gave roger little more grace at length utterly exhausted plucky lad reached foot of accommodation ladder just in time for a be pulled clear of water pair of huge jaw clashed behind with sound made nearly faint so suggestive be of what have so narrowly escaped by time that reached deck harry have fully recovered be first to grasp roger hand wring convulsively a latter stepped inboard harry must find word wherewith to express feeling adequately pressure of hand spoke for roger felt amply repaid for have done now young gentleman said cavendish sternly when young hero of adventure have be recovered somewhat by administration of liberal dose of rum let be warning to never again to go bathing in sea have have most miraculous escape for one have given pair of up a lost thank heaven be safe after only never let occur again suppose will take care of that added with twinkle in eye first experience with johnny shark have be enough for have reassured on point then went below to dress when be again clothed harry said now how will spend remainder of day roger feel like going ashore again to day even if have boat idea of crossing sheet of water again doe not very greatly appeal to just now feel pretty much a do replied roger have have quite enough of water for to day a alternative suggest that investigate that sheaf of document that took out of gloria del mundo at time of battle fellow alvarez seemed feverishly anxious to find certain paper bitterly disappointed at failure so perhaps there may be something of value among so saying roger went to sea chest having unlocked drew out bundle of paper to have referred laid on table ran through most of without finding anything of interest examined proving to be merely paper relating to provisioning of ship one two old chart with course marked off on on chart however found something claimed moment attention be one upon position of spanish intercepting fleet have be laid down together with supposed course that english vessel must steer thus proving that have correctly anticipated movement of english put aside intending to hand to cavendish a must be of interest to be probably document scoundrel be looking for while gloria del mundo be sinking said roger who have related to harry have happened while be awaiting death in cabin of spanish vessel hardly that demurred harry must think must be something of much more importance because see must not be of much value to after action let search further did so presently came upon sheet of rough parchment have escaped search of alvarez through having worked way into folded chart spread open upon table found that must make nothing of a appeared to be mass of figure nothing else wonder what on earth can be said roger seems to be nothing lot of figure put down anyhow expect be merely sheet of scribbling paper upon rough calculation have be worked at rate be of importance clearly be not what alvarez be looking for wait one moment roger said harry be not over hasty lad believe be more important than look may not be cipher of kind let have look at document presented following appearance beyond figure paper seemed of considerable age be perfectly blank lad gazed earnestly at mass of figure for time trying to fathom meaning that hidden meaning of kind be attached to be almost certain a sane man must put down long string of figure to purpose for mere pastime if writer have not intended meaning to be hidden must certainly have used word in preference to number of mystifying figure roger said more look at cipher for cipher be convinced be more certain do feel that be key to something important of value now friend do notice anything peculiar about figure can not say that do answered roger unless mean that be arranged in group of four yes be certainly so agreed harry there be somewhat else of significance be that although be grouped in four for most part there be two group of six figure one of two one figure stand alone being different from remainder of cipher may at once set down a denoting something different from rest of writing must say that possibly direction instruction may even be compass bearing be concealed in two group of six figure while to mind figure be to be read a really be be a figure only for believe that remainder of figure stand for word letter a indeed must if sense be to be made of thing yes more study more certain be that have found something of value be convinced be document told alvarez be looking for while be in cabin of sinking gloria del mundo by saint george said roger be inclined to believe be right harry only see not how will benefit if can not translate cipher seems to impossible without key thereto nothing be impossible friend retorted harry have key be true by repeated experiment will solve thing eventually be sure let start trying right now then suggested roger well starting from beginning let take first group of mr trevose hie on deck if please want came cavendish voice down companion at moment putting abrupt end to operation on cipher leaving harry to put away document in safety roger ran up on deck touched hat to captain mr trevose said cavendish one of boat have just come off from shore with load of fresh fruit vegetable men have collected have now have short spell ashore be time for to be thinking of work again so wish to take boat proceed to shore in with instruction to mr leigh to collect men forthwith let bring off a much fruit vegetable a can find must not be very long about can take friend edgwyth with if will while men be getting fresh provision together have leave after have delivered message to do a please until be ready to come off aboard have care added skipper that two lad get into further scrape have particularly narrow escape morning of perchance may not get off quite so easily next time roger saluted forthwith ran down to inform harry of errand whereupon two mounted again to deck dropped into boat be waiting for alongside be soon being pulled over water to shore again arrived at beach roger enquired of few men who be there where mr leigh be to be found none of seemed to know one man said believed that mr leigh have gone in direction pointing out with stubby tarry forefinger have taken musket with intention thought of getting fresh meat for pot lad at once set off in direction indicated pushing way through tangled underwood treading down in passage many splendid brilliant flower while startled bird of rainbow plumage flew out from branch over head everywhere stillness reigned supreme sound sign of of men be to be met with pushed resolutely forward however trying to discover indication of people having passed way before so dense be undergrowth in many place harry roger be obliged to draw sword to cut passage through presently roger caught sight of beautiful orchid on trunk of tree just below first branch put forth hand to gather a did so there be bright green flash lad started back only just in time there be swish of steel snake fell to ground severed in half yet still writhing horribly thousand thanks said roger owe life again harry must surely have bitten if have not be so quick with sword examined reptile be about six foot long of brilliant green above light yellow underneath with heart shaped head that betokened extremely venomous variety tossing two writhing half of body into bush with point of sword giving shrug of repugnance roger passed on followed by harry with further desire to pluck orchid taking care to look well about presently came to small clearing on opposite side saw opening in bush seemed to suggest that someone have recently passed that way crossed clearing pushed through opening on other side after going about mile heard report of gun close to followed by great fluttering of wing a host of startled bird flew away from branch where have be roosting few moment later came upon leigh accompanied by seaman carrying large bag seemed to be well filled gave promise of few savoury meal in immediate future roger at once gave mr cavendish order to reassemble men then asked how far have succeeded in hunting oh very well roger replied leigh have nearly filled bag a may see of bird be fine big fellow must be excellent eating at rate will sample at mess evening must be off get men together a two have liberty until start for ship may take musket ammunition if like try to shoot something on own account one own shooting always taste best be told added with laugh a prepared to return must not wander too far away if be advised know place a yet there may be danger that be not aware of so be careful lad thanked mr leigh for loan of musket lieutenant disappeared to collect men telling lad that must sound trumpet if be not in sight when be time to return to ship now said roger when leigh have disappeared where be to go harry do remember that ledge of rock that saw morning asked harry well noticed quite number of cave among what say to going having look at agreed friend said roger can get to wonder from here without going back to beach walking way round oh yes think so answered harry believe remember how lie in what direction if bear away to left here will bring to doubt so two turned off presently found opening in brush through went appears to said roger presently a though someone have be along way before see of small branch be broken growth beneath foot seems to have be recently trodden expect will find that of men have be here before perhaps to look at same cave if so can warn to return immediately if be in front of will give little longer a will take considerable time to get back to boat from here thus reassured in own mind for there be always danger of savage to consider pressed on saw further sign of men whom imagined to be in front of be possible said thought still dwelling upon matter that if have gone way be still at cave may have gone back along beach for suppose be nearest way of return if so will not meet of coming way may overtake have gone little distance farther when roger looked up suddenly harry heard something whistle past head moment ago said nonsense responded harry what heard be one of small creature call humming bird flying past ear be certain be not retorted roger if have be must have seen a well a heard why there be again yes be right roger heard that time wonder what can be exclaimed harry know said roger sound very queer let push on will have time to explore cave pushed forward for little distance again heard more than once same peculiar sibilant sound a of something flying past with great velocity saw nothing must not account for occurrence at suddenly harry who be behind whispered to roger appear to take notice roger at present distinctly saw head of savage peering at from behind tree when turned head just now believe that what heard be sound of arrow flying past must not be greatly surprised to find that there be quite crowd of native round only wonder to be that have not yet be hit now must press on endeavour to reach shelter of cave there defend if necessary until assistance come be useless to think of retreating by way have come must only be ambushed ah see two more face looking at over there in bush have better make haste only need walk little faster will never do to run will see that have discovered in case will attack at once will have chance here by way be that musket loaded yes replied roger be loaded when leigh handed to for remember after discharge heard led to be loading a came up did not fire again very well said harry have better for present trust to sword must reserve musket until last have better drop few more bullet in so that will do a much execution a possible when fire trust to heaven that report may bring of men up will not do that if fire now a will merely think be shooting game if fire from cave will know there be game there to shoot at may attract attention two lad now moved a fast a thought consistent with safety to great relief at length perceived opening in tree got glimpse of sea beyond few minute later emerged on beach found quite close to cave then having clear ground took to heel ran a hard a must for nearest cave a started to run chorus of savage yell broke on ear what have quite anticipated happened native have at last left cover be pursuing at top of speed roger harry unaccustomed to running in sand moved slowly savage gradually began to overhaul be not far from cave by time however presently gained entrance to one of fifty yard ahead of pursuer a soon a be safely inside roger turned raising musket to shoulder discharged piece point blank into midst of nearest group of running savage be lucky discharge extra bullet that have put in scattering a flew have almost effect of round of grape shot dropping fewer than four of black did not check rush however there be time to reload before howling yelling mob be upon roger harry have at once taken up position one on side of entrance to cave allowing sufficient room to avoid striking other with blade of long sword with now useless musket be weapon have savage came at with rush stabbing furiously with spear forced on by behind who feared to use bow arrow at such close quarter lest must hit companion long sword blade however rose fell untiringly flashing in sunlight now parrying spear thrust anon making sweeping cut with blow at least one savage have cause to regret temerity native however have number on side sound replacing fallen until quite heap of dead wounded began to grow at entrance to cave be likewise growing chary of long blade of steel hewed through shield spear haft a though have be paper at length one of native stooped down picked up dead body of fallen comrade held before a shield rushed toward defender of cave a harry thrust at flung body full upon sword point where remained impaled dragging harry weapon from grip man then lunged savagely with spear roger wary eye be on fraction of second before spear left fellow grasp sword flashed fell savage stood looking stupidly for moment at arm still grasping spear have fallen at foot ere sank groaning to ground harry shouted thanks across to roger drew sword out of impaled body with difficulty determined not to be so tricked again once more battle went furiously on savage surging madly about cave mouth two lad straining nerve to keep stronghold inviolate wonder gasped roger how long will be before leigh collect men missing sends out search party must be mustered long before replied companion must remember that took time to reach place leigh started to look for men directly left hark there go trumpet for recall unless be mistaken did not hear think heard something answered roger if be indeed trumpet mean that leigh have collected men only wait for will not wait long before sending in search of because of captain order to return on board a quickly a possible if must find time to reload musket discharge again leigh might possibly hear report must show where to look for be true agreed harry now roger leave to defend cave mouth alone try to load piece discharge may bring down men if load a did last time with plenty of bullet will do enemy considerable damage at same time be time for arguing roger therefore did a harry have suggested leaving defence of cave to friend grasped musket loaded with frantic haste seeing one of defender apparently retreating native at once redoubled onslaught spear came whizzing through air thick a falling autumn leaf long blade however still flashed untiringly hither thither cave remained untaken hasten roger cried harry can not much longer keep fellow off unaided coming lad shouted roger in return huge native at moment forced to front engaged harry at close quarter tired a be boy knew strength must soon fail responded gallantly however drove man back for instant with cry like of furious beast fellow again leapt at beating down sword point bore lad to ground at once shortening spear to pin to earth poor harry closed eye for moment experienced bitterness of death be for moment only weight suddenly rolled from chest opening eye saw roger pulling reeking blade from savage body then dropping sword roger raised musket to shoulder fired into thick of group of native with report came hearty english cheer a leigh couple of dozen well armed sailor rushed round bend in beach lie down lie down roared leigh a two lad flung to floor of cave storm of bullet whizzed over at once accounted for ten of savage then out came hanger sailor charged remaining assailant who turned resolutely to meet while harry roger rising from floor of cave dashed down on rear cutting slashing thrusting with right good will strength renewed somewhat by sight of own countryman thus taken in front rear black seized with sudden panic broke fled followed by storm of shot from sailor now shouted leigh make for boat ere return in overwhelming number in response to order english went off along beach at double soon reached boat be not very far away embarked forthwith be soon once more on board respective ship well boy said cavendish a inseparables climbed ship side morning adventure be not enough for must appear so must need go get yourselves into mess now mark word will day get into scrape one other of will fail to come out again alive chapter seven careen ship be attacked discover that be not first to visit inlet be by time fast approaching evening too late to start lightening ship that day since in tropic transition from broad daylight to total darkness be extremely sudden light dying away after sunset like drawing of curtain men therefore immediately upon arrival on board be piped down to supper ordered by several officer to turn in early a next day must be long arduous one for there be moon figure of various men on watch must be dimly discerned in starlight while star reflected in dark water made placid surface of bay look a though studded with gem presenting most beautiful spectacle roger harry although must have to work a hard a of others next morning did not feel inclined to sleep mind being still in state of unrest after two hairbreadth escape of day therefore remained on deck walking so softly up down a to disturb nobody have taken few turn when attention be attracted by sound of low voice being of men constituting anchor watch roger friend strolled up to sitting down on breech of gun prepared to listen to what be evidently yarn that old quarter master cary be spinning yes heard say ar by mean furst taime be in thaise sea good even to ye mr trevose mr edgwyth tall 'ee be 'ere in zummer of just after taime that there bloody pirate jose leirya be sailing of vury sea e be fiend in 'uman shape if there ever be one nobody be zafe in anny of ship e tuk

'd taich 'un vaine lesson must laads harry come here moment said roger jumping down from gun at point in old man narrative walking aft harry joined what do want old fellow said well lad remarked friend have just come to somehow a old cary mentioned about treasure of scoundrel jose leirya being buried somewhere about here that possibly that cipher of ours brought from gloria del mundo may refer to very treasure see cary say that leirya have be heard of for time seems to point to death disbandment of crew now cary say be here in in summer mention that date be just after time when leirya be committing such atrocity on high sea there be what be presumably date at beginning of document that date if such be be year before cary came to part people write in cipher save to conceal important information from eye of not in secret do very well now what must man wish to conceal by cipher save hidden treasure there be other thing certainly might wish to write about in such way that ordinary run of people must not understand writing to mind treasure be most likely date coincide very well date be cary say that when be here in be just after pirate depredation have not apparently be heard of since say point to death to disbandment of crew what more likely than before of occurrence must bury accumulated booty locate position by cipher believe most strongly harry that have in possession key to hiding place of treasure of jose leirya must have accumulated million of dollar worth in time if can come upon translation of do think of harry well roger lad said harry a put certainly doe seem a though might be right that there may be something in must make attempt to find key to cipher when be found certainly think will obtain something valuable for trouble even though must not be great treasure of jose leirya have better go below now try to get sleep for will have hard day before to morrow be roused early next morning by boatswain whistle having dressed came up on deck to find that boat be just being got over side again to take away kedge anchor by to haul ship closer inshore for careening purpose be decided by cavendish that a beach be very spacious there be four ship to be careened must careen two at time instead of one only a usual vessel that most needed overhauling repairing be commander own ship captured spanish vessel el capitan have be rechristened tiger so be determined to careen tiger stag royal first of leaving other two vessel good adventure elizabeth afloat for purpose of defence must enemy appear in sight while operation be being carried on tiger stag royal be therefore swung broadside on to beach anchor be then taken ashore in boat carried up beach to above high water mark where be buried in deep hole dug in sand with timber laid lengthwise upon to prevent from being dragged out again when strain be put on cable hole be then filled up sand heaped high above to get a much weight a possible upon anchor to allow more purchase then from cable attached to anchor at distance of about twelve foot before disappeared into sand spring of stout manila rope be led fastened securely to palm tree at edge of brushwood in direct line with ship anchor thus affording doubly secure purchase when time came to heave on cable haul vessel up on beach roger harry have be sent ashore by cavendish to take part in work a wished to get insight into part of duty of sailor thus make two useful member of crew for captain must not afford to carry man who be not thoroughly proficient capacity of ship being too small to afford accommodation to mere idler lad be however very quick to learn very anxious to master detail of profession therefore never complained whatever duty be assigned to thus increased knowledge efficiency very quickly cavendish have ground for regret that have taken on board ship anchor belonging to flag ship have be taken ashore securely buried cable with rope attached bent on to anchor stag royal be ready for careening seaman then tramped off along beach to where anchor for tiger have be brought ashore laid on sand proceeded with preparation for careening craft also have begun to dig hole in sand in to deposit anchor when roger attention be attracted by sound of rustling in wood behind looked round perceived that for considerable distance along beach foliage appeared to be moving to fro a though stirred by slight breeze yet so far a must tell down there on beach there be wind at stirring have there be breath of air morning atmosphere in fact be so still withal so heavy that thunder storm be anticipated circumstance that noted be that peculiar movement in bush extended only from just beyond where seaman be now occupied to point trifle beyond where have be at work few minute before fixing anchor of flagship everywhere else foliage be absolutely without movement of kind a have be during whole of morning much perplexed how to account for singular phenomenon stood gazing at moving foliage wondering what must portend movement seemed to be confined to one place only a gazed motion suddenly ceased be quiet a before looked round to see if of other men have observed anything be all much too intent on work in hand to take notice of anything else friend harry be just a busy a rest of men therefore dismissed matter from mind thinking that eye might perhaps have deceived set to work again with other men hole be soon dug anchor deposited therein plank baulk of timber being laid upon a before sand be filled in mound raised above work only remained to further secure anchor by putting spring on to cable fastening to palm tree a before a last part of work be being done spring being lashed round palm tree one of seaman named martin grasped roger by arm do see that master trevose said pointing what do mean martin answered roger why over there sir said man pointing in same direction a in roger have seen peculiar movement of foliage little time before be sure saw something shining among tree just now what d think can be only just caught sight of for moment be sure beaint mistaken roger looked in direction indicated by seaman must distinguish nothing be sure martin asked because fancied that too saw peculiar movement among tree over in direction little time ago yes be sartin sure master replied martin only see 'd for minute 't be true there war mistake about seemed to to be very like glitter of steel roger be much puzzled also somewhat perturbed therefore determined to inform captain of what martin have observed immediately upon return to ship to say nothing to men until work on shore be finished for fear of distracting attention from task in hand be soon completed roger calling men together got into boat pulled back to ship leaving party of men from tiger upon own vessel taking own crew on board flag ship then sought out captain found seated in cabin working out observation lad duly reported that work have be sent to execute be completed satisfactorily very good roger very good indeed replied captain will come on deck presently see how tide serf if be suitable will haul in at once for be anxious to get repair effected a soon a possible sooner start sooner will be finished by way roger continued a know be somewhere on eastern coast of spanish island of cuba while be ashore with men just now have be busy working out exact position on chart cavendish here pointed to chart have open on table before together with pair of compass ruler here be see resumed captain pointing to spot on chart here be island of cuba here pointing to little indentation in coast line be in latitude north longitude west now have better remember that bearing boy in case must ever wish to return here when get command of ship of own sailor must call bearing north west leaving out word degree roger if will take advice lad friend harry a well for matter will start in a soon a can thoroughly perfect yourselves in science of navigation for never can tell lad when may want if intend a suppose do to follow sea a business will not be able to do anything without will tell that want to know about if will come to from time to time when be not busy have here book may study at leisure will find very interesting roger thanked commander for on harry account promised to take up study a soon a be again at sea a friend must be much too busy for anything of kind while vessel be in harbour undergoing repair overhaul be then on point of informing captain of what martin have seen when cavendish interrupted roger said have be much exercised in mind lately a to what will be done with spanish prisoner have on board there be nearly three hundred of although many of be in iron be imprisoned below altogether like idea of carrying about with too long for be dangerous cargo not only that be also great drain upon stock of provision when leave island will probably be at sea for very long time a intend to cruise in caribbean sea out of sight of land for most part on lookout for plate bullion galleon from mexico when finally sail from here wish to take on board a much fresh meat fruit vegetable a can to help eke out ship store now want to carry about with nearly three hundred men who will be of use to who will only help to eat up provision faster than wish moreover men be constant menace to while be on board now have be working out position with view to seeing exactly where be discovering how far be at present from nearest spanish settlement on island for have be in mind for day past must not do better than land fellow here when be ready to sail giving few of own weapon wherewith to procure food by way defend against savage may meet tell where nearest settlement lie directing to make way to be true that much like idea of letting loose nearly three hundred spaniard who be enemy of beloved queen god bless who will perhaps compass death of many englishman before come to own what else can do roger have suggestion to offer sir replied boy think with that only thing to do be to release let make way to settlement of theirs on island well then that settle said cavendish while be ashore conferred with others of officer offer same advice so when be ready for sea once more ashore will go now be quite time went on deck saw about getting vessel hauled ashore be if tide yet serf must do by time let go captain rose be about to leave cabin when roger said have something to tell what be then lad tell quickly a want to get on deck said captain roger then recounted what martin have observed adding that occurrence seemed to to signify presence of body of men hiding in brushwood be possible roger agreed cavendish seeing that harry be attacked yesterday thought that gave savage so sharp lesson then that must not wish to renew acquaintance be sure that be not wind moving tree that be not sun shining on palm leaf that made martin think of glitter of steel be sure there be wind sir replied roger for looked very closely be leaf produced glitter martin saw know glint of steel too well to be mistaken well many thanks for information at rate said skipper will order doubly sharp lookout to be kept must avoid surprise at hazard for might lose great number of men thereby then turned went on deck followed closely by roger when arrived on deck cavendish considered upon inspection that tide must serve a be now rising rapidly therefore immediately gave order that winch capstan must be manned ship hove in towards beach until keel touched bottom be done soon two vessel have be hauled in until grounded gently then boat be again got over side together with number of raft have be constructed for purpose gun be lifted out by derrick deposited in boat on raft so carried ashore unloading occupied considerable amount of time when at length cavendish considered two vessel sufficiently lightened tide be almost at high water mark boat raft be then taken back to ship men climbed on board windlass capstan be again manned vessel being considerably lightened so once more well afloat be again hauled in until keel touched bottom captain considered that be now far enough up beach a receding tide must leave high dry tackle be next fastened to mast above topsail yard fastened to convenient tree be in readiness to heave vessel down a tide left roger harry have be busy with rest of crew a worked roger have found time to inform friend of peculiar occurrence martin have witnessed asked harry opinion of well said harry must seem to to denote presence of savage near that there be hostile native in part of island know from past experience have informed skipper yes replied roger told what have seen seemed to rather a if put circumstance down to imagination martin nevertheless thanked for information promised to be on lookout well said harry strike a rather foolish thing to leave ship gun scattered about beach a be at present if must be attacked must never use pointing a be in direction must not fire without danger of hitting one must be good thing think if captain instead of leaving weapon strewed about beach a at present be to arrange in circle round place where be working on two vessel get loaded in readiness must then be prepared to repel attack if came very good idea harry exclaimed roger always seem to be prepared with good scheme go tell captain see what say harry at once ran off told cavendish what roger thought of matter two lad said cavendish seem ever to be thinking of attack by native yet scheme young man be good one will have carried out at once be well to be on safe side accordingly gave necessary order men turned to with will with result that gun be soon arranged a harry have suggested with muzzle so pointing a to command not only adjacent bush also whole range of beach weapon be then loaded party be reasonably secure from attack in direction by time tide be ebbing fast men took pull on rope secured to ship mast with result that vessel soon began to heel over perceptibly on side a tide continued to drop rope be hauled upon soon vessel be down on beam end then men like swarm of ant grew busy on exposed side working with hammer chisel paint pot brush scene became one of great activity tide have by time retreated so far that hull of vessel be clear of water men must work right down to keel ship being hard fast aground so that must not possibly be moved until next tide a must not leave captured spaniard in careened ship dared not let loose to help with work have be transferred to two craft still afloat elizabeth good adventure roger harry be slung over bow of tiger of busy with scraper taking off old paint before new be put on thus happened that be higher above level of beach than of others part of hull upon be working being just below starboard cat head roger be scraping away merrily when harry plucked sleeve be that movement be speaking of roger said pointing to brush yes there be again said roger excitedly only be somewhat nearer time see be certain be flash of sun upon steel weapon yes see there be again see clearly now answered harry just then hail came from below in captain voice roger man cable secured to maintopmast seems to be working loose may carry away get up aloft boy look at seizing if necessary put fresh one on roger hastened away up into main top leaving harry still in perch examined seizing be a captain have said loose so boy proceeded to secure afresh having finished job to satisfaction prepared to descend from aloft before doing so cast eye round scene nearly fell out of main top in alarm for there coming round point mile away concealed a yet from on beach by low point be large fleet of canoe filled with native who be doubtless hoping to come upon beached vessel unawares must certainly have done so have not be for fortunate circumstance of roger being sent aloft threw glance to seaward to see if must count canoe found that there must be quite hundred of then took survey of brushwood inland found that suspicion a to savage being present there be only too true at greater elevation found looking down upon quite horde of armed with spear bow arrow club be advancing slowly through bush stealthy movement forward have occasioned swaying to fro of foliage roger first harry afterwards have observed roger must not tell whether not native have seen be aware that be discovered hurried down from main top with such speed when have reached last ratline of rigging lost footing fell on back on sand at very foot of cavendish fortunately for sand be soft be not much hurt though good deal shaken pulling together got on foot at once told cavendish what have seen there be time to lose boat be promptly sent away with messenger to two vessel afloat good adventure elizabeth to warn to be in readiness trumpet sounded for men to cease work muster arm be hurriedly served out men be stationed at gun captain be now very glad have loaded arranged according to harry advice very soon be a ready for attack a be possible in short time at disposal meanwhile two vessel afloat have lifted anchor be standing closer in better to defend now helpless consort be evident that native in bush be waiting for friend in canoe to approach closer before attacked hesitation saved english loss of number of men for have savage attacked while men be at work on ship latter must have be taken at serious disadvantage loss must have be very heavy a first canoe made appearance round point perfect pandemonium of savage ear splitting yell arose from bush loud noise of crashing crackling announced that enemy there be coming along at utmost speed outcry be answered from seaward a canoe came pouring into inlet now stand steady lad shouted captain a come in upon give round from gun load again if have time then volley from musket after must trust to good sword keep cool throw away shot a finished speaking enemy burst from bush like swarm of angry bee charged at full speed at little band of white men opposed to whereupon perfect storm of grape shot old nail rusty bolt piece of scrap iron even stone with cannon have be hastily loaded went hissing through close rank from piercing scream yell of agony at once arose from execution must have be terrible yet poured out checked only for moment fire again roared captain musket crashed out in rattling volley bullet mowing native down in swathe second discharge checked caused to waver tall man gaily bedecked with feather instantly sprang from rank haranguing called to comrade to follow leading charge soon reached gun leaping over before must again be loaded be at once among english who have now to fight for dear life howling with fury stabbed slashed struck with spear club from other side of little circle came shower of well placed arrow many brave seaman fell writhing life out on sand by time be assuming sinister crimson hue roger harry armed with excellent sword borrowed from ship armoury be here there everywhere always together doing much execution repeatedly saving other life cavendish in front of men swept long blade from side to side a fell flashing meteor like in brilliant sunshine naked warrior sank before in heap now from seaward came crashing discharge of heavy gun followed by renewed shriek cry a elizabeth good adventure poured broadside into closely packed canoe god grant muttered cavendish that other vessel of ours may keep canoe off for if fellow be reinforced can never hold out against nobody have time to see how other action be progressing for be too busy with work in hand be task of defending own life twice have gallant little band of englishman driven savage back over barricade formed by ship gun twice have enemy led by tall savage forced way in again at last seeing clearly that hinged upon man downfall cavendish made many strenuous effort to reach for time failed owing to press at length however opening occurred cavendish rushing forward stood face to face with arch enemy chief be man of mighty stature evidently of enormous strength standing nearly seven foot high at first sight disparity between two adversary seemed enormous what english captain lacked in height made up in strength agility sword in hand circled round round gigantic foe watching like cat for opportunity to strike deadly blow savage took initiative raising spear darted at englishman with force cavendish however be not to be caught so easily taking shaft of spear with edge of sword parried thrust weapon merely ripped shirt instead of piercing body before native must recover guard body english captain thrust with strength quite unprepared for wily savage next move seemingly careless of wound that inflicted upon savage caught keen blade of adversary in left hand although weapon lacerated hand in fearful manner succeeded in wresting from captain grasp while at same time flinging away spear seized cavendish round lower part of body lifted clear of ground dashed to earth falling with antagonist pair rolled upon ground striving to obtain grip of other right arm to prevent other weapon being used now savage now white man be uppermost at length with huge effort cavendish twisted from under foe lay full length on top of feeling for dagger chief however have likewise seized knife hung at girdle before captain must draw weapon plunged knife into cavendish side englishman grasp relaxed slipped from position lay upon side writhing on sand native now rose to knee raised arm to deal fatal blow even a blow fell sword flashed through air arm knife fell to ground together roger for be who have thus appeared in nick of time at once turned sword drove through heart of chief who rolled over lifeless at foot young hero then raised captain in arm staggering out of press of battle laid down out of sight behind gun carriage meanwhile vessel afloat in bay have be giving very good account of enemy in canoe native be clear have be watching having seen preparation for careening ship have hoped to find four hauled up in case must have secured easy victory from force of number alone a ship must then have be unable to use gun against force in canoe a be have to deal with two fully prepared ship after several fruitless attempt to board be now hauling off with remnant of fleet most of canoe having already be destroyed by broadside from elizabeth good adventure land force seeing companion in canoe withdrawing also having lost chieftain now began to waver observing english hastily formed up into line with loud cheer charged enemy afresh hewing right left with hearty goodwill fierce rally proved altogether too much for savage broke fled precipitately english now rushed to gun hastily completing loading have be checked at first onslaught of enemy gave flying savage dose of grape canister strewed beach with dead dying further hastened flight of survivor who quickly vanished in recess of thick bush enemy thus disposed off finally a hoped roger harry went off to attend to captain found sitting up averred that hurt be only flesh wound after asking for obtaining draught of water gallant fellow got on foot went off to survey scene of carnage over hundred of native lay dead on sand number of wounded be seen crawling towards brush endeavouring to escape be allowed to go a english must not be burdened with wounded savage be indisposed to slay in cold blood there be twenty three of englishman who must never again answer roll call over forty wounded who be conveyed on board good adventure elizabeth afloat in bay dead black white be for health sake immediately buried in sand where lay cavendish after having have wound bound up ordered stockade to be at once built loopholed for gun musket for future defence in improbable event of savage not having already received severe enough lesson seaman be now divided into two party one half of be to continue work of repair overhauling on two vessel then careened stag royal tiger remaining half be to work upon stockade then matter arranged cavendish called roger to first thanking for timely rescue saving of life put lad in command of party who be to build stockade roger be also publicly thanked in presence of officer men for warning have given enabled party to make hasty preparation for reception of native without whole party on shore must most likely have be cut off to man if ship in bay have not likewise be warned be quite within bound of possibility that must have be boarded before gun must have be loaded brought to bear on canoe in case there must be little doubt that savage must have captured vessel through sheer weight of number for there be several hundred men in canoe ought to be mentioned that when cavendish gave roger command of company to be employed in building stockade also endowed with full power to use own discretion a to how work must be carried out only occasionally giving lad few hint invested thus with such great responsibility with such important duty to execute roger naturally needed lieutenant selected harry for post dividing men into two party one of placed under command of friend arranged sent harry away into wood with men armed with ax bush knife to cut timber for stockade while with own party remained on beach digging hole in to deposit upright when be cut also digging ditch round where palisade be to be in order to drain off water might accumulate thus prevent interior of small fort from being flooded harry gang soon returned with load of stout stake plenty of suitable tree for purpose being found close at hand depositing on beach then returned into wood for more material roger men meanwhile proceeding to plant main post in ring round gun be not long ere have driven row of post deep firm into sand starting from margin of beach nearest water edge brought in direction in be going fairly close up to where wood ceased at junction with beach roger be watching men drive in next post with heavy wooden mallet procured from ship when observed that although be hammering hard at stump did not seem to be going down a quickly a must indeed upon closer inspection did not appear to be moving downwards at further mallet instead of giving out dull sound a have done whilst driving through sand now gave out sharper quite different sound a top of post be struck one of men engaged stepped up to roger touched hat seems to sir said a though something be stopping of here post from going down furder expects a how there be stone summat in sand under point do think that ere stump be down fur enough a be will pull un up put un in somewhere else roger stepped up shook post finding quite loose decided that must have to be driven deeper in order to be secure nevertheless be necessary to space post at equal interval one from if idea be to be carried out therefore ordered stump to be pulled up obstruction removed post driven down again in same position seaman thereupon laid hold of post hauling together soon came out with shovel crowbar began to break down sand enlarge hole so a to get at be in way remove be not long ere shovel of one of men struck upon something hard man dropping upon knee went to work to scrape sand away with hand presently laying bare to view what be apparently part of spar of kind not old worm eaten seemingly almost new having located started to clear sand away from whole length of piece of timber while doing so found that there be two other pole spar laid alongside after hour hard work three spar be unearthed proved to be three pole of set of sheer leg have evidently only quite recently be hidden roger then instructed men to start probing in sand to see whether there might be anything else buried took boat pulled away over bay to elizabeth to inform cavendish of discovery found captain lying in bunk nursing recent wound informed of circumstance asking also what must do in matter have dug out of sand what think be set of sheer leg eh boy said captain raising in berth on one elbow have found anything beside sir said roger in reply there be nothing else dug up when left told men to probe sand whilst came off to to see if there be anything else there well responded captain must look into will get up come ashore with just go call surgeon first wish to bind wound of mine up again before leave ship roger did so surgeon having dressed bound up cavendish hurt again two descended ship side getting into boat be rowed ashore when reached beach saw that men have already lifted out three sheer leg pole laid on sand now gang of men be hauling upon rope attached to something still in sand when cavendish roger came up to spot saw that top of iron chest have be uncovered men have fastened rope to ring in lid be now hauling on rope to drag chest clear cavendish watched seaman moment then went to examine pole after few minute observation said to roger be pretty evident to boy that inlet have be used before for such purpose a for be using namely for careening vessel for repair refit pole have be employed for lifting gun other heavy material taken out of ship from off raft now wonder who may be have used thing spaniard must not need to use inlet for such purpose for have own port on island where kind of work must be done far better than here can have be englishman must think for if place be known to of own people must be marked on chart must have heard of most certainly also fact that thing have be buried point to certainty that people who have hidden intend to return use again if have not meant to come back must have taken with when left be evident to that people who left article will return periodically to place to refit a spot be almost unknown a well a being lonely secluded must seem to poor understanding that men who use place be not spaniard english seaman proper pirate also occurs to that there may be something in box that be just getting out will tell want to know a captain finished speaking box came up suddenly seaman who be hauling manfully on rope fell upon back only to scramble quickly to foot again with much laughter at mishap now men said cavendish who have habit of taking crew into confidence before go further let tell that believe inlet to be pirate resort visit periodically for purpose of effecting repair if so must capture if can must therefore be careful to leave trace of own visit here may become alarmed desert place therefore gear must be replaced exactly a found before sail box must not be broken open lock must be picked instead if replace everything exactly a found pirate if such be will not suspect that anyone else have be here will still continue to use inlet day will walk right into little trap intend to set for now lad up with chest be careful with pas word for carpenter armourer to come here bring tool two men be soon on spot between have chest open in few minute eager examination of content showed that there be nothing of intrinsic value contained therein there be document paper written in spanish abundantly verified captain conjecture for from cavendish who must read understand spanish perfectly learned that bay where be now lying be indeed resort of pirate crew while name of chief miscreant a ascertained from paper be jose leirya document gave among other particular detailed account of scoundrel doings ever since have started nefarious trade on spanish main mere recital of atrocity proved enough to make man of there present swear great oath to hunt villain down wherever might be hang with rascally crew from yard arm of own ship nothing else of importance having be found chest be carefully locked up again after paper have be put back everything replaced in former position buried in sand once more utmost care being taken to destroy evidence of thing having be disturbed after little episode work on ship went steadily forward tiger stag royal be soon finished elizabeth good adventure took place last named vessel received same attention a consort be in fortnight pronounced quite sound once more ready for sea be hauled off beach cavendish have great satisfaction of seeing little squadron of four ship once more ataunto ready to sail next morning cavendish called meeting of officer in cabin long earnest consultation resulted in decision that must cruise a originally intended up mexican coast in caribbean with addendum to effect that special effort must be made to capture pirate jose leirya whose atrocious deed a recorded by own hand have made man in fleet enemy determined to hunt ruthlessly to death having be arranged preparation be forthwith made for leaving spaniard be brought on deck in squad armed with weapon sufficient to enable to obtain food successfully defend against attack of savage be then sent ashore in boat load ship having broadside trained on beach where landed to prevent treachery on part in last boat load went alvarez de soto of whom roger have seen on gloria del mundo at time of engagement with spanish fleet de soto gracefully thanked captor for courtesy kindness a went over side alvarez scowled heavily round looked attentively at face near before went a though meant to fix feature on memory that might recognise again in event of future meeting then with glare of hatred at retreating form of de soto turned back without word went also completed landing of prisoner very glad englishman be to be rid of responsibility risk that fellow alvarez will know again when next meet said cavendish with laugh to roger who be standing by side watching spaniard on beach yes replied roger mean mischief be sure must be very sorry for one of who might be unfortunate enough to get into power seems to hate de soto also pretty thoroughly said harry did see look gave a went over side ay answered roger who went on to tell of alvarez little soliloquy relative to de soto while searching for paper in cabin of sinking gloria del mundo will do de soto bad turn of be sure if ever get opportunity remarked roger in conclusion be now ready for departure spaniard have formed up on beach marched off in order into bush be by time nowhere to be seen sail be hoisted flag ship leading little squadron passed out between head one after on way to coast of mexico by evening island be merely long grey line on eastern horizon while eye be strained toward golden west man eager for first sight of sail might prove to be richly laden galleon even pirate jose leirya later in evening moon rose in tropic glory sea in wake gleamed like one huge speckle sheet of silver behind in bush on island by evening camp fire alvarez with certain other choice spirit of own stamp be plotting grim deadly evil by light of same moon lit english adventurer on way chapter eight roger go ashore to rescue marooned man be left in lurch day now slipped by uneventfully morning after morning broke without land ship making appearance to break monotony of perfectly clear horizon slipping down windward channel sailing on south south west course have left morant point at eastern end of jamaica on starboard beam after keeping to south south west course for five succeeding day have turned vessel head to east south east intending to sail a far in direction a la guayra where hoped to find plate galleon in harbour make attempt to cut out thence planned to change course once more standing westward along coast of venezuela crossing gulf of darien mosquito gulf bay of honduras so up through yucatan channel leaving western end of island of cuba on starboard hand into gulf of mexico where intended to cruise for time feeling tolerably certain of picking up treasure ship there at rate even if be not fortunate enough to snap one up whilst cruising on way must of course have reached gulf of mexico much more quickly by sailing down windward channel along southern coast of cuba by yucatan channel into gulf have heard of treasure ship that made la guayra port of departure be anxious not to miss of also believed that by taking longer course there must be more likelihood of falling in with most ferocious bloody pirate jose leirya a be called jose de leirya a loved to call for be said to claim descent from grandee of spain although who knew man be well aware that birth parentage be obscure a have already be related one of seaman on board flag ship one night gave account of pirate former doings discovery that buried gear found at careenage a cavendish have named spot where squadron refitted be property of pirate be proof positive that scoundrel be still prowling somewhere in sea likewise will be remembered man in fleet have sworn to do utmost to bring villain to justice anxiety therefore to catch be such that officer even not infrequently spent hour at mast head in hope of seeing topgallantsails showing above horizon old cary man who claimed to posse knowledge of leirya said that when last sailed in sea pirate be cruising in schooner of unusual length lying very low in water hull painted black with broad scarlet riband in open gun port looked like number of gaping mouth having be built very large to enable broadside gun to be trained almost fore aft craft mast be furthermore said to be of great height might be recognised by remarkable excessive rake aft indeed so asserted cary spar be of such extraordinary length vessel lay so very low in water that have appearance of being perilously overmasted topheavy appearance however cary explained be altogether deceptive vessel sat low in water indeed be not willow craft that looked there be more of below than above surface drew great deal of water for vessel of tonnage great draught of water enabled to carry heavy load of ballast tall mast correspondingly heavy press of sail thus be enormously fast vessel have up till now easily eluded capture being able to run away from out weather many vessel more powerful than in justice to pirate however must be admitted that have seldom be known to run away vessel be exceptionally heavily armed if antagonist happened to be not very much more powerful than invariably stayed fought action out always succeeding in beating off opponent while in many case have captured fate of unfortunate crew fell into hand be if own record be to be credited not to be dwelt upon for described a guilty of most awful atrocity to men woman even child fight of course occurred only between war vessel merchant ship never attempted impossible task a to fight pirate very often seemed too completely paralysed with terror even to attempt equally impossible task of running away such be vessel that everyone in cavendish squadron be so eagerly looking for eagerness being further stimulated by fact that captain have offered a prize to first seaman who sighted best weapon must be taken out of after capture of course on board considered a absolutely certain must once succeed in coming up with while to first officer gentleman who saw offered a reward best suit of clothing to be found in such however be eagerness of hand to come up with destroy vessel rascally crew leader that lookout must have be just a keenly kept if reward have be offered there be still further stimulus in not unnatural hope that jose leirya must have on board at least of vast treasure of with possession of be credited by man who have ever heard of vision of much prize money to spend on return to plymouth be always before eager eye of englishman regulating speed of whole squadron by of slowest ship happened to be tiger rechristened el capitan fleet went slowly to east south east on appointed course in day a of course be hardly necessary to remind reader chart be few few be not to be relied upon a more than approximately accurate on course that commodore have marked out for little squadron must according to chart fall in with land until made oruba island after cavendish intended to steer course between island of oruba what be now known a paraguena peninsula leaving other two island of curazao buen ayre on port hand then heading straight for la guayra several sailor one two officer among whom be roger harry be a usual perched upon cross tree yard at mast head on lookout for first sight of infamous jose leirya schooner with idea whatever of sighting land so everybody on deck be much astonished when on certain morning cry came down from masthead of stag royal of land ho bearing dead ahead at same moment string of flag fluttered up to main truck of tiger be signalling that also have caught sight of land of description what do make of roger shouted cavendish for be roger sharp eye have caught first glimpse of unexpected land a be aloft straining eye in search for raking mast of jose leirya craft well sir responded boy be island of kind very small one lying low in water can make out what take to be few tree probably palm think nay be quite sure now that can see thin column of smoke rising from about centre of island in case said cavendish turning to leigh who be standing at elbow trying to catch sight of land from level of deck there be evidently human being on island who have seen sail of fleet wish to attract attention be taken off suspect there have be shipwreck there very likely there may be more than one man now must not at object to find take off whole crew of shipwrecked seaman provided that be english for what with fight with spaniard brush with savage sickness have have crew thinned down very considerably god grant that be not spaniard for if be be in distress there must take off in common humanity though be in like case doubt if must do same for then will have vessel again lumbered up with lot of useless fellow until can land somewhere moreover that same landing will be very difficult now for will not be likely to find down here place will serve purpose so well a did careenage island land hereabouts being already occupied by spaniard must be running own head into danger in attempting to get rid of mr leigh be good enough to work out dead reckoning up to hour let see exactly where be on chart for there be island land of description marked where be at present sailing leigh did a captain have ordered found that ship be at moment in longitude degree west latitude degree north so that going by chart there ought not to be land in sight for several day at least particular part of caribbean sea sir be not very greatly frequented by english ship said leigh in explanation spaniard doubt know water well yonder island may perhaps be laid down on one of chart very possibly answered skipper have spanish chart next spaniard capture however will search for chart will certainly be of utmost use to during foregoing conversation roger have come down from aloft to report still further to captain have overheard last remark immediately reminded that have brought certain chart away from cabin of gloria del mundo in fact harry have found cipher concealed in fold of one of have intended to give to captain subsequent stirring event have driven idea out of mind having now recollected however explained matter to cavendish asked if must bring chart up on deck by mean replied skipper let have at once trevose man roger dived below soon reappeared with chart under arm be immediately spread open on deck overhauled be found to be of utmost importance paper also being found among giving bearing sounding of certain secret channel leading to port on south american coast there be also found plan of town fortress must prove of inestimable value to last be forthwith placed in safety for future reference chart be presently discovered showing that particular portion of ocean upon be now sailing sure enough there be small island marked in precise spot occupied by one for be heading there be in ink description of island written of course in spanish setting forth that have be named isla de corsarios that be according to english measurement two half mile long by one mile broad also that be uninhabited description written a marginal note further stated that there be spring of fresh water on island that there be palm tree thereon that islet be of sandy soil supported vegetation beyond few palm mentioned then explains matter said cavendish evidently have be missed by vessel don have located can clearly see that chart will be indeed very useful to by time island must be made out from level of deck a also smoke be undoubtedly rising from signal fire have be lighted on beach ship be however not yet near enough to make out who inhabitant be how many of there might be indeed have not be for sight of smoke captain must have imagined island to be totally uninhabited must not have thought worth while to stop thereat for fact of smoke being observed veracious yarn must most probably have have very different ending officer of ship including cavendish roger harry be now standing in eye of vessel have mounted bulwark be supporting thereon by holding on to rigging one be shading eye with hand against powerful ray of almost vertical sun anxious to catch first sight of man men who have built that signal fire on beach in obedience to order from cavendish old martin who be credited with having sharpest eye in ship went aloft to foremast head on lookout with instruction to let on deck know when first caught sight of inhabitant of island in about quarter of hour have very perceptibly neared shore lay very low presented at closer view more appearance of mud sand bank with few dwarfed tree shrub growing thereon than island in accepted sense of word shortly afterward martin voice came down from aloft in accent of excitement see un zir there ' be 'tes only one man zir so far a ai can mek out ' be waving of red shirt zummat laike ai think zir can only see one man martin be there more with think shouted cavendish naw zir responded old fellow a ai zay ai can only zee one of ' e do be carryin on zumthing wonnerful zir e be jumpin up down wavin ' of arm laike to one possessed ai expec a how un belaives 'ave zeen un ' want to attrac ' attention very well martin answered captain stay where be man a perceived old fellow making preparation to descend stay where be keep sharp lookout let know if anything further take place if more men make appearance expect gentleman said captain turning to assembled officer that there be only one man there others must have joined by time have there be more of in way be sorry for must very well have done with great many more men always provided of course that have be englishman for be a know very short handed man be possibly sole survivor of shipwrecked crew a there seems so far a can see at present to be trace of others being there must be more inclined to think that have be marooned marooning be of course very common practice particularly among pirate in opinion be one of most cruel form of punishment ever conceived by brain of man now have occurred to a quite within limit of possibility that man ashore there may be marooned member of crew of scoundrel jose leirya must not be so very extraordinary after if be leirya be practically only pirate at present in sea be aware that marooning be practised chiefly among pirate must happen to be a somewhat suspect man will at event know something worth telling about arch villain for will never be happy until have hunted scoundrel down hanged for dog be captain face blazed with righteous anger a spoke expression be reflected on countenance of officer gathered round boded ill indeed for pirate if ever squadron must fall in with send man into chain continued cavendish speaking to roger a land lie so low in water be not unlikely that water round be very shoal have wish to get of vessel ashore if can help order signalman to signal rest of fleet to keep lead going roger obeyed leadsman be soon perched in chain to windward busy with sounding line to ascertain depth of water in be then sailing to give timely warning if water must begin to shoal dangerously seven fathom now sir reported leadsman very well answered cavendish be safe a yet turning to leigh let go through water other vessel be strung out behind stag royal fell into wake for greater safety for drew more water than of rest being much larger vessel where must go rest must follow be running along with fresh breeze on starboard beam making about six knot hour be therefore rapidly nearing island must by time discern solitary occupant from deck still continued to wave red shirt whatever be that have at first seen appeared a though even now must scarcely convince that have yet be seen although fleet be heading directly for island for continued wild gesture leaping into air waving arm like one possessed six fathom came voice of leadsman from chain can stand in way farther yet commented cavendish want to take ship in a near a can so that men may not have far to pull in boat furthermore gentleman by look of sky methinks that gale be brewing will be well that boat get not too far away from ship five half fathom chanted leadsman few minute later 't be well still keep going a be ordered captain people on deck must now see poor solitary on beach quite distinctly presently came running down to water edge still waving red flag so eager did appear for rescue that seemed a though intended to swim off to ship for waded into sea up to arm pit pray heaven that doe nothing so foolish murmured roger who still remembered own experience with shark unfortunate man have such intention presently appeared yet be still in sufficiently dangerous situation for stopped where be with water up round shoulder continued waving signal of distress five fathom bare be next report of man with sounding line can edge in even little farther yet remarked captain can not understand continued why man persists in acting so strangely must know by time that have seen will rescue yet continues to signal with arm red rag a though be demented must not greatly surprise to find when get on board that brain have given way with horror of solitude suffering privation by leave sir seems very much to suggested roger touching hat a though poor fellow be striving not so much to attract nearer a to warn to keep away why boy prithee what put idea into head retorted captain rather testily why must wish to keep off surely if be in place must be fully a anxious a appears to be to have rescuing ship approach take off without delay what meant to suggest mr cavendish responded roger rather stiffly not one whit abashed by commander testiness be that perchance man know shoal rock round island well may perceive that be sailing into danger wish to warn from approaching closer before be too late zounds boy shouted cavendish heaven believe that may be right in assumption then turning to crew hand stand by to veer ship cried even a spoke there be sudden check to vessel way almost instantly stopped dead sudden shock throwing more than one man prostrate on deck at same moment leadsman in chain gave warning cry three fathom only shoaling fast warning came too late for vessel have taken ground evidently shoaled up with great abruptness fore main mizzen topmast snapped like carrot with sudden check to speed came tumbling down with attendant wreckage thus adding to already great confusion on deck what be worse killing two men whom must ill spare badly injuring five others be right roger shouted captain a ran past lad to stern of vessel with intent to warn other ship from similar mishap warning be needle for have be on lookout observing accident to consort have at once hauled wind gone off on tack in time to avoid similar fate when at safe distance luffed into wind furling canvas came to anchor cavendish seeing that remainder of little squadron be safe ordered wreckage to be cut adrift deck cleared for further operation work away with will lad cried encouragingly ship have taken soft berth lie on sand there be present danger of sinking indeed be in much too shoal water for mr leigh must get wreckage cleared away first of after will get out kedge anchor astern if fail will run out cable to other vessel perchance may thus get off by own hauling others towing must work with will for a may see there be in look of sky prospect of ill very shortly if take ashore like will lose ship now roger take two hand in gig can not spare more bring off poor fellow must that have earlier understood what meant must have saved disaster hasten lad for can not spare even three of for single moment longer than be absolutely necessary yet must have man for may posse information of untold worth to mr leigh will take two hand also go off to other vessel will acquaint with condition give order to prepare for towing to be ready by moment when can avail ourselves of help for have time to waste roger soon found two men boat be got ready over side in very few minute yet quick a have be perceived a pushed off that mr leigh boat be already distance on way to other ship now give way men with will cried lad encouragingly heard what mr cavendish said there be not moment to lose if be to get man off ship too ere gale break indeed like not look of weather at fast grows more threatening will be lucky if get back to fleet in time furthermore fear much that there will not be time to save poor old stag royal be to mind hopelessly lost for if appearance belie not gale will be down on ere can hope to move off sand pray god that poor fellow on board may be able to get away from in time ah wind come away even now pull lad pull will be swamped ere can get ashore a spoke whole sky seemed to darken in moment round sea took on appearance of dull metal became of livid hue away on north western horizon sky be black a ink below between sky wave be line of white extending athwart horizon showing forefront of advancing gale pull lad pull again shouted roger raising voice above deep moaning sound filled air everywhere about unless can contrive to reach shore before line of white know what fate will be will have to wait until gale blow over before can return to ship if indeed survive seaman saw that what roger said be only too true pulled for dear life boat be heavy one full complement of oarsman being eight now however have only two men pulling therefore made painfully slow progress white line of water seemed to be overtaking at speed filled with despair meanwhile roger noticed that solitary watcher on beach have now left water be lying at full length on sand a though overcome by exertion weakened a perhaps be by long exposure privation lad felt extremely anxious a to fate of ship frequently turned head to snatch glimpse of what be happening behind be able to see during brief observation that boat have be lowered from stranded ship from consort be plying at utmost speed between wreck other vessel of squadron be evident to roger that captain observing extraordinarily rapid approach of gale foreseeing unless miracle be to take place stranded ship must be lost have not delayed moment be transferring crew to other ship a fast a possibly must roger fervently prayed that operation of transfer might be completed ere storm burst upon be very doubtful for fatal white line of foam be driving down upon fleet with appalling rapidity must not relax attention from matter that have in hand must not watch what be going on behind also steer boat so set teeth gripped tiller hard looking straight ahead of in search of best safest spot on to beach boat for sea be rising fast must have given much to have have bosom friend more than brother harry in boat with at moment must always rely on harry coolness sound clear headed advice must have felt much le anxious have chum be with then man on shore be now seen to stagger to foot to support with stick alternately pointing out to sea beckoning on roger men with now needed anyone to remind of peril in stood be nearing beach now meanwhile sea have be rising with almost incredible rapidity when left ship sea have be calm with not even ripple lapping beach there have be proverbial calm before storm now although gale have not yet reached boat wave be leaping up beach in foam back wash gave forth roar like of distant thunder roger yearned to look behind again to ascertain how far away white squall still be dared not turn head nerve skill courage be now needed to enable to beach boat without capsizing one glance at face of men pulling who of course be sitting looking aft in direction from storm be coming be enough to convince that must not be by time very far distant be now within few fathom of beach roger for first time dared to hope that must reach shore without mishap when observed two seaman redouble exertion with look of terror on countenance although be very nearly gastados a don say used up next moment with fearful shriek white squall burst in fury upon unhappy trio boat seemed suddenly to take wing be propelled with fearful velocity towards beach spindrift whistled about blinded shriek roar of wind deafened fearful force stunned seaman be blown bodily from thwart into bottom of boat roger clinging desperately to gunwale with one hand fiercely gripping tiller with other contrived to retain seat strove to pierce dense mist of scud water with eye that might see to beach boat safely must perceive nothing next moment wave descended full upon back dashing forward out over bow tiller thus released boat broached to filled capsized three occupant be left struggling in water fighting for life while craft be flung bottom upward on beach dashed into stave by violence of shock tossed hither thither to fro roger strove to get breath must not for seemed buried in salt water be suffering agony of suffocation when head emerged for moment from water drew hasty breath seemed to put fresh strength into fast failing limb yet strive against a must although felt beach under foot be fast being dragged from under be in clutch of fatal undertow knew that exhausted a be if be once swept back again into deep water must drown for strength be now at end summoning up energy therefore gave vent to loud shout for help although help seemed to be last thing might expect at moment made one last struggle for life even a sens failed be sinking backward in fatal embrace pair of strong hand clutched hair arm for few second felt a though between sea on one hand sturdy british seaman on other be being torn asunder presently however wave receded awful feeling of being sucked back left opening eye saw that be on terra firma with sea behind now run shouted seaman one jake irwin who have be in boat with run master trevose before next sea catch ye at same time dragged lad up beach with strength reached safety a wave came rolling hungrily after to retire again with angry snarl a though cheated of lawful prey roger stood up wiped wet from eye ear wrung water out of clothes a well a must looked about saw two seaman one of whom have rescued only just in nick of time from watery grave standing close by not far from perceived figure of man whom have come to rescue for whom have so nearly met disaster seaman who have rowed in boat seemed none worse for adventure asked lad how felt whether have suffered from accident to boat roger aching in limb muscle from recent struggle in water felt carefully over be able to assure that have broken no bone stranger now approached spoke to thanking applauding bravery in coming away to save despite threat of gale be by time raging furiously man appeared be englishman in answer to question put by roger confessed that a captain have suggested on deck of flag ship have be one of crew of pirate having incurred displeasure of captain enmity of companion have be marooned on sand bank with small stock of provision mean of obtaining more when be exhausted have be allowed fishing tackle musket with powder shot although latter must not have be of very much use to for island be small so far away from mainland bird very seldom made appearance there appeared that have be on sand bank thirty six day with few provision that have be moved to give nothing else beside clothing stood up in concluded poor fellow who be emaciated weak to last degree have made bit of shelter to leeward of top of bank let go there since even be better than nothing at boat smashed to piece on beach will be forced to remain here until storm blow out before can send boat pray that may not be long in doing so for although there be water here in plenty provision be pitifully low in fact for four of there be only enough for about two day with strictest economy come round to shelter will make fire so that can get clothes dried will then be bit more comfortable be turning to follow new friend when roger once more cast eye out to seaward came to stand still remaining a if rooted to spot others gazed at for moment in astonishment not knowing what have come over lad a looked however raised arm slowly pointed to seaward other three following direction of outstretched arm at once saw reason for horror despair depicted on lad countenance flag ship have left stranded lay broken in half by terrific force of sea after part of be now being gradually driven shoreward fore part remaining a before embedded in sand worse still for poor castaway remaining three ship of fleet have cut cable setting what sail dared be heading away from island before gale wonder that roger felt stunned with despair a realised that be actually left on island be nothing more than mere sand bank with three other men to bear company be true with between four only two day provision provided that be used with most rigid economy be roused from reverie by jake voice saying to never worry master trevose ship have' forgotten by manner o ' mean skipper see a how ca take off while 'ere gale last so be cut cable run for captain have lost one ship want to lose more so have just bore up out of harm way until gale have blowed out that sir with submission call good seamanship never fear sir ai forgotten skipper ai man to forget crew part of 'em a soon a 'ere bit of breeze be over will see three ship come sailin ' back here to sand bank to take off again know captain cavendish do ai man to forget here sail away leave will see back here to morrow next day at furdest be wonderin ' whether there be poor feller left aboard stag royal when parted in middle old jake irwin looked round shading eye from flying spindrift to see if must discover trace of human being in sea washed up on beach none be visible yes be right jake said roger forgot for moment captain cavendish must be obliged to leave anchorage be blown on shore captain will of course return a soon a be able a to there being people aboard when ship parted jake think be taken off before happened now since can do more for present have better go take shelter a man suggests by way man what be name name sir be william evans replied marooned man mine said roger be roger trevose two men pointing to in turn be jake irwin walter bevan thank sir answered evans yonder be shelter when reach will give history up to present if care to listen to for feel have not much longer to live last month have compassed death so great have be hardship have be obliged to endure after storm have ceased somewhat have better go along beach collect wreckage happens to come ashore pray heaven that food may be washed up for have very little here to go on with few minute later came to shelter be merely deep hole dug in sand roofed over with palm branch grass together with few bit of plank timber have be washed up on beach enter sir fellow seaman said evans to such poor hospitality a can offer be most heartily welcome went in man made fire with help of tinder box few dry stick that routed out from corner fire be soon blazing merrily took off clothes held before flame to dry whilst be being done marooned man whose face even now bore imprint of death brought little food out of scanty store water party sat down to eat drink then when meal be ended resumed clothes be now dry prepared to listen to history of ex pirate gave to accompaniment of beating of rain over head tumult of gale around meanwhile cavendish have not forgotten poor waif having barely contrived to clear shore with squadron be now being driven away fast to leeward of island by furious gale a yet gave sign of blowing out chapter nine marooned man tell story crouching over fire marooned man proceeded to tell story well began must tell first be born in year in town of monmouth in wale of purely welsh parent bearing ancient name of evans in early youth kept about house tended flock of sheep of have great many on dear old welsh mountain life suited well for be of studious frame of mind fond of learning read

on mediterranean commanded by man named thomas west have happened that father in time of prosperity have be able to do man service be reason why took on board ship be bound to say that be always very kind to time for next voyage came round only too quickly for liking bade sad farewell to father mother who somehow scraped up money enough to go to london with to see off little dreaming poor soul that must never see again pirate voice shook slightly paused for moment brushed back of hand across eye then clearing throat resumed left london in latter part of year when be very nearly sixteen year

fell in with barbary corsair captain be brave man determined to fight to last a have very valuable cargo on board fight began early in morning pirate tried at first to ram ship with sharp beak wind be good ship be so nimble answered helm so well that be able to avoid rush of corsair although nearly have on one occasion finding that tactic did not answer drew off turning broadside to lacked through through with ordnance until be mere floating wreck ship company lay dead on deck replied a well a must being only merchant ship be not nearly so heavily armed a corsair men being untrained in warfare very few of shot hit so that rascal be little worse captain then hailed asked whether must surrender master of delight shouted back that if wanted ship must come take whereat came at again laid alongside not being able to move by time owing to having lost mast being so encumbered with wreckage that must hing about hundred fierce bloodthirsty ruffian swarmed aboard began to cut down drive toward fore part of ship while on side fought bravely enough with what weapon must lay hand on at last gallant captain fell dead cut down by scimitar of gigantic blackamoor rest of very few by time can assure seeing threw down arm surrendered to corsair there be then seventeen of left told not one of have wound to show a result of fight five out of seventeen indeed be so badly wounded that died of hurt before corsair reached port leaving only twelve of englishman to be sent into slavery after corsair have removed to own ship stripped delight of that carried transferring cargo to own hold be

corsair from alexandria english have disguised vessel be war ship to look like innocent harmless merchant trading vessel to retard speed allow to come up with have dropped overboard couple of light spar connected together by broad piece of stout sail cloth whole of apparatus being secured to stern of vessel by stout rope thus passage of ship through water caused piece of canvas between two spar to open when acted a drag upon reduced speed so considerably that soon overtook sooner be well under gun than opened fire before must get alongside have worked fearful execution among fighting crew also slave eye be now opened to true character of vessel crew no longer have desire to come to close quarter with so put up helm bore away with speed for cadiz port nearest to then began chase will

since be on vessel god forgive believe be not much better than to continue yarn man came aboard with about hundred others perceived at once although jailer did not seem to notice fact that there be kind of arrangement understanding between jose leirya number of new galley slave what meant did not know until afterwards left cadiz captain thinking perhaps that mediterranean sea be not suitable for enterprise determined to take galley to west indie try fortune there so started away across great atlantic ocean a have told jose leirya be chained next to never once spoke to until after have left western isle few day after however one evening disclosed to plan for seizing galley then knew what understanding have be between large number of prisoner who came aboard galley with on certain night must fall about eight day later at midnight on given signal be to rise overpower soldier sailor of ship seize for ourselves use for own purpose will ask how be to get rid of manacle well be thus arranged sir jose leirya have brought on board cunningly concealed in clothing number of small saw of exceeding fine temper sharpness must cut through manacle a knife cut through wood gave out to of slave on night arranged be to cut link of iron manacle pas tool on to others must of course leave iron ring round wrist ankle must be free to move fight after have won ship must get ring off at leisure saw be given out one by one greatest care being taken that be not discovered immediately after dark on eventful night began to cut fetter galley being then under sail oar laid in by midnight be ready waiting for signal came a shrill whistle from leirya lip at sound swarmed up on deck a most of officer seaman be asleep below quickly overcame watch gave quarter knowing that none must be given to took prisoner then going to companion hatch cried fire ' a former master came running up in shirt be seized flung overboard none of suspected plot vessel be soon in hand then took counsel among ourselves to elect officer determine upon future movement jose leirya be of course elected captain for reason can not make out be chosen for first mate then for plan be about in middle of north atlantic perhaps little more than half way to west indian island so determined to run there take ship on way if must if not capture one in first port must reach for galley be of little use to for purpose ah if have known if must have foreseen be to happen in future what deed must be called upon to do rather must have suffered death by torture than have joined in mutiny did not then know that jose leirya intended to become pirate that meditated awful atrocity have made men curse name swear to hunt down make end worse than dog at length when ship have be ours for matter of fifteen day be approaching island lookout one afternoon reported large ship coming up from westward heart leaped with anticipation kept very cautious lookout lest must prove to be war vessel a came nearer however saw that be large merchant vessel flying flag of spain that country that have grown to hate with hatred passing word have not noticed a yet for lay low in water have sail set a soon however a saw coming toward made sail to escape followed in full pursuit then finding that be gaining upon went about evidently with intention of returning to island be doomed to be prey man of even leirya joined crew of oarsman below leaving only helmsman on deck to steer to report progress to below thus oar be fully manned swept along after gaining on hand over hand until about middle of afternoon man at helm threw alongside for be unarmed with cannon must not fire at swarmed up from below on to deck such be ferocity that cleared deck at once leaving dead wounded in path whole of whom quick dead alike at once flung overboard did not require galley longer so took gun arm furnished ship with sinking galley afterwards thus hiding trace of former crime got under way directly after still making for island then provision wine of there be plenty on ship be got up caroused made merry for rest of day soon found that new vessel be not suitable for be ere long mean of enabling to obtain to suit purpose without loss of life to chapter ten william evans continues yarn be now about two day sail from island of porto rico have discovered from ship paper that be from port of san juan in island that have recently sailed name of craft be villa de vera cruz plan be to re christen alter rig general appearance sail boldly into port of san juan hoping to be taken for vessel just arrived from spain elsewhere then if unmolested must examine harbour if be found to contain vessel suitable for purpose plan be that be to wait for then board other vessel by mean of boat capture sail out of harbour again before daylight with vessel when once well out of sight of land reasonably safe from pursuit survivor of crew if be to be killed flung overboard store cargo gun be to be transferred to new capture present craft sunk a have done with galley have become saying with dead men tell tale so be agreed to kill soul captured taking care that none escaped must thus so believed keep movement secret for considerable period at rate for be useless for to attempt to disguise fact have not be in possession of prize twenty four hour ere have agreed to start piracy in earnest preying on nation selecting nook where must hide what treasure captured well duly arrived in road of san juan anchored well out of gunshot from fort seemingly without exciting suspicion whatever carefully examined roadstead there sure enough be just craft for purpose be lying right under gun of fort be pretty vessel schooner rigged very low in water a found out when took of very deep draught broad in beam flush decked fore aft with raised fore after castle must see by open port that carried twelve gun of side nine pounder be with long gun forward of foremast that threw thirty two pound shot be therefore quite heavily armed enough for purpose there must be no need to transfer old gun to when be captured must thus be saved great deal of labour mast be very long tapering with big rake aft from distance vessel looked overmasted when one got on board one saw that great width of beam gave stiffness necessary to carry such lofty mast with corresponding spread of sail in short be just what wanted indeed must not have have ship better suited to purpose even though have built ourselves needle to say determined to cut out from under gun of fort capture at risk very night during day got up arm loaded pistol sharpened up sword cutlass got ready for night attack be in fever of impatience to try luck must hardly bring to wait until dark still le until midnight decided be earliest hour at must make attempt so great be excitement impatience that strove to allay by drinking raw spirit continually by night be mad with drink only effect of be to turn into gang of demon who must stop at nothing be perhaps due to drink though did not know that actually took vessel after for encountered most stubborn resistance have there be people in fort must certainly have opened fire upon must have be killed to man luckily a happened for there be carnival in progress in town night nearly man in place be attending who have not got leave deserted went same even to last sentry so that when made attack there be not solitary soldier in fort at hour came got boat over noiselessly pulled away toward schooner be dark a inside of wolf mouth there be little phosphorescence in water pulled with muffled oar be nearly alongside when someone on board must have caught glimpse of faint flash a oar dipped for heard voice giving alarm on board in spanish seemingly did not want to know that be on alert reckoned on giving surprise intended for have caught low word of warning knew that be ready for laid boat alongside one held whispered council a result of very slowly cautiously pulled round to farther side of vessel boarded silently there falling upon spaniard in rear be saving of for have lined bulwark on other side have attempted to board on side must never have be successful fight be fierce grim strangely enough silent there be not cry save groan moan of wounded dying struggled fought in silence in dark be difficult to tell friend from foe at length to make long story little shorter drove below cutting vessel cable made sail for open sea have agreed to show red light to own vessel a signal for to slip out also if be successful so looked round for red lantern presently found one signal be made immediately answered by three flash of white light from old ship a decided upon before leaving craft be soon under way for open sea kept other in view by light of star at daybreak must only just see land kept on however until mid day to make doubly safe by time have run land out of sight when craft be hove to then crew of prize be brought up on deck a be after recent right very short handed gave choice of joining of walking plank be for most part rascally lot of men did not need persuasion of plank ' to join indeed seemed glad to have opportunity by mean replenished crew total number now exceeded by forty nine that be before taking galley have therefore crew of two hundred twenty five men be big crew for so small ship then a leirya said have to provide against casualty seventeen men walked plank rather than join after made necessary transfer of store other material sank old vessel be now ready well equipped for piratical undertaking started at once on nefarious career can not recount to took place for many long year have passed since first threw in lot with scoundrel jose leirya took countless ship accumulated vast amount of treasure most part of be buried in certain spot know bay where hiding place be exactly where cache be know not of however little later on to shorten story of expect be now heartily tired will pas over life experience during year have be with pirate until about six month ago must tell first that what with fight disease punishment by death accident so on crew gradually changed until two others with jose leirya be only survivor of original galley slave other men hated for time have be putting about false report of other matter to great harm until at length leirya said must get rid of men clamoured for death for have often sent others of to death jose refused to kill a have be so long with promised to maroon however scoundrel have to be satisfied with promise made many attempt however to murder escaped did not sight island for time now day brooded over wrong jose have done in listening to lie of others acceding to demand determined to have revenge on have always trusted did so still have key fitted lock of cabin one day sighted ship a fell calm boat be ordered out to pull to capture nearly hand went including leirya remained behind to help look after schooner while be away went into captain cabin finding key in pocket of jacket of hung there opened private drawer took out paper be there putting back blank one of similar appearance to have stolen relocked drawer replaced key then hid paper in own chest be certain jose must allow to take will tell why stole paper be because thought must find key to hidden treasure among be not mistaken found what believe to be be in cipher have spent nearly time since have be on island in trying to translate have not be able to do so know however whereabout bay be in hiding place be situated be at east end of island of cuba in latitude degree north longitude degree west have paper still before die will give to master trevose may be useful to if can translate cipher why there be million there for unless indeed jose leirya remove before can get there well sir jose did not discover loss by time that fell in with sand bank according to promise to crew be marooned here gave musket with powder ball enough provision to keep for year men who went in boat to put ashore be however most deadly enemy before reached shore when be far enough away from vessel not to be seen dropped musket overboard leaving only very little provision saying that did not wish to die too soon then after landing returned ship disappeared have seen sail yours since left here two month ago gentleman be story to help hunt down bloody pirate however will tell that intended sailing up through bay of honduras guatemala through yucatan channel into gulf of mexico to cruise there for merchantman sailing to from vera cruz other port be there that will find sir chase run down take at cost hang crew from own yard arm burn ship so will exterminate one of most cruel ferocious bloodthirsty devil who ever sailed sea avenge sir for will soon die hardship exposure have suffered here have killed now have told story can die comfortably for have only lived to impart information to someone else so help to hunt man down see dawn be breaking other three have be so intensely interested in outcast tale that time have passed unnoticed first streak of dawn be indeed in sky moreover wind have dropped rain have ceased sea be going down unfortunate ex pirate seemed exhausted by long recital of experience looked very weak presently laid down on sand under shelter fell fast asleep through sheer fatigue others went outside took survey of beach be lucky enough to be able to collect quite respectable quantity of wreckage together with several cask of provision must see several more being gradually washed in so be in danger of starvation at event for present at once began to roll up cask to shelter promising good meal before beginning work of collecting on must lay hand resolved to collect that must for be impossible to be sure a to when three vessel of cavendish fleet must return knew that there be too many vicissitude in sailor life to permit of absolutely depending upon anything therefore resolved to make possible provision for lengthy stay where be must such prove to be necessary that cavendish must never abandon knew be easy to think of dozen circumstance accident to defer search for indefinitely roger two seaman rolled up few of cask to door of little shelter feeling very hungry determined to broach one of a judged from appearance that be provision cask first glanced at marooned man to see if have yet awakened from slumber into have so suddenly fallen be lying in former position breathing very heavily have evidently not moved since left roger remarked to two seaman fear that poor fellow will not live much longer say be exhausted by exposure privation looking at can easily believe hope will live long enough to be taken on board ship so be able to tell story in own word to captain unless squadron appear very soon will be too late for be few day will see last of then a there seemed fear of rousing went into shelter to look for see how much provision have left found without difficulty there be only about three pound of ship biscuit left two three strip of dried meat be absolutely food be left have not be for wreck cask of provision being washed ashore position must have be very serious indeed jake irwin have be searching for cooking utensil article must be used a such presently appeared with iron three legged pot be only thing in small establishment must serve purpose meanwhile roger walter bevan have secured ex pirate only axe be busily engaged in removing head of one of cask have rolled up opposite to little shelter top presently came away saw disclosed before longing hungry eye not provision so much needed hard rocky mass of caked gunpowder made useless solid by action of sea water have penetrated through crevice of cask god help exclaimed roger if cask hold nothing powder will slowly starve to death hoped must all be provision cask never thought must contain aught else never despair master trevose replied bevan may not be same let try cask may have better luck time disheartened anxious set to work desperate with hunger beat in head of next cask with savage blow oh joy in cask at length found much needed food in form of salt pork with barrel be filled hurrah shouted roger be saved after took out two large piece jake irwin filled pot with water from spring having soon made fire set meat on to boil savoury odour of cooking meat soon met nostril encouraged to fresh effort on other cask strangely enough though first cask opened be filled with spoilt gunpowder rest of barrel have good wholesome provision in second barrel opened be found to contain ship biscuit third fourth salt pork fifth have beef in in one two more cask found further food sufficient in to last for month without going on short ration be not long ere meat be sufficiently cooked to satisfy went in to call evans acquaint with fact that must now have good wholesome meal aroused with great difficulty seemed to be weaker than ever revived somewhat under stimulating influence of hot food told that if only have have such food little earlier must have saved life meal finished got up few more cask have meanwhile come ashore gathered more wreckage piling material recovered from sea in place of safety well above high water mark having at length collected everything in sight on beach next thing set to do be to find suitable spot erect with wreckage that have found hut large enough to contain entire party with comfort first a roger very rightly observed be necessary prudent to build fire smoke of must be seen out at sea might serve a guide to cavendish in search for sand bank must happen to be looking for plan be to feed fire with damp wood sea weed during day to produce thick smoke must be seen at long distance out at sea to put on dry wood at night to make bright blaze must also be seen long way off be soon done site be then selected for projected hut among palm tree on summit of bank be three tree so placed a to form point of fairly spacious triangle roger selected intending to nail otherwise secure plank to trunk making three sided enclosure leaving space of course in one of side for door roof believed must dispense with a tree be not very high tuft of leaf at summit be so thick grew so close together that seemed very doubtful whether even furious rain of tropic must be able to penetrate found number of nail in plank timber have collected served purpose roger jake irwin walter bevan worked right manfully at job of erecting new hut in few hour be finished evans poor fellow be far too weak to take hand in of operation lay in shelter almost unable to move when new hut be finished builder found man too far gone to walk so brought plank put on carrying up in way be laid gently down made a comfortable a possible under circumstance pannikin of water be left with cold provision placed near in case must feel hungry others then went away to seek further wreckage cask found more then decided to make shelter wherein to protect provision be thought advisable to construct place near new hut so old shelter such a be be taken down replaced close behind new structure cask barrel other perishable matter be placed therein a being safer a well a easier to get at at time be now fairly settled down in new domain have shelter plenty of food to last for month even on full ration there be water in abundance to be have from spring altogether lot be far away more satisfactory endurable than of poor marooned pirate have be besides there be now four of have advantage comfort of other company while evans have be entirely alone with only own miserable thought for companion until roger two seaman made welcome appearance on sand bank occurred to roger that must be very good thing to have flag flag staff because fuel must not last for ever with must go only mean of signalling to passing ship so several narrow piece of wood be nailed together two seaman of whom be wearing red shirt sacrificed garment in interest of community lad then split down one side to increase area of improvised ensign tied arm together to increase length flag be then nailed to makeshift flag staff roger jake irwin swarmed up palm tree one of three composing post for support of wall of hut while walter bevan passed up flag staff to from below then roger with sword have carried up naked between teeth cut away part of foliage staff be pushed up through hole thus made lower portion being secured to top of trunk of palm tree men then scrambled down to ground again looked up at handiwork there fluttered far above tufted crown of palm grove large red flag at top of lengthy staff eighty foot above ground visible a judged at distance of at least ten mile out at sea on clear day a roger remarked gave extra chance of being recovered by fleet a flag must be seen at almost a great distance a smoke from fire while two together ensured being sighted by vessel approached island within ten mile satisfied at last with work seeing that there be nothing further for to do at moment roger determined to make tour of little domain so leaving jake irwin to attend to sick man evans roger walter bevan set off starting from point on beach opposite hut began walk going towards eastern end of sand bank found that shore be everywhere sand until have gone mile nearly reached end of island when came upon ledge of rock over have to clamber stretched out for quite long distance into sea two ventured out few hundred yard along ridge to seaward found that have deep water on side of rock seeming to run perpendicularly down to sandy bottom place struck a being excellent situation for fishing from if only possessed hook line for peering down into water be clear a crystal saw manner of many hued beautiful fish disporting below gazed admiringly somewhat longingly at for few minute determining to return later attempt to catch then resumed exploration have not gone very far be walking side by side when roger stumbled over inequality in surface of sand passed on taking notice of circumstance thinking to be only stone piece of rock covered up by sand bevan who have noticed occurrence stepped back dropping on knee began to clear away sand with finger presently revealing to roger wondering eye number of egg be exclaimed lad hardly able to believe sens suppose be egg look like egg have never before heard of egg being buried in sand master trevose responded man smiling at roger astonishment be turtle egg be excellent eating can assure will be grand change of food for a will fish when can catch moreover having laid egg here turtle may very possibly come back to spot to lay more will look out for if return must turn over on back then go back fetch jake who will help to carry to hut need not worry about fresh meat now master trevose if can catch turtle will have meat enough to last for time be rejoiced to hear say so returned roger why turn turtle on back must make appearance well sir replied man way of be by turnin ' turtle over on back can always make certain that if be obliged to go away leave will find in same place when come back because if turtle laid on back ca turn over again by so be perfectly helpless unable to move there be fourteen egg in nest in sand so roger took off coat tying arm together made sort of bag of into carefully put few of egg then carrying parcel very carefully resumed journey found more egg at time discovered nothing further of importance shortly afterwards arrived back at hut having completed walk round islet irwin reported that man evans have called for water have seemed in great pain have revived little after drinking be now again asleep two explorer deposited burden of egg told jake of hope regarding turtle arranging to go down again later watch for creature knowing how important be to health to secure a varied diet a possible before setting out again put few of egg into hot ash of fire baked in shell when thought must be sufficiently cooked took out of ash roused evans up with news that meal be ready for chapter eleven death of william evans appearance of pirate vessel be with utmost difficulty that at length succeeded in arousing unfortunate man to sense of surroundings ever since landing on sand bank poor fellow have be sinking with startling rapidity seemed a though prior to appearance have kept alive by sheer effort of will for sole purpose of relating story putting avenger on trail of former captain done strain be relaxed nature be claiming due evans at last sat up with great difficulty passing hand over forehead gazing at companion around at new hut a though have never seen before three on looker felt infinite compassion for unfortunate outcast although have be by own showing party to most dreadful atrocity yet roger seaman felt that be not for to judge recognised that have never be willing participator in horror have described in opinion have fully expiated offence by suffering agony of remorse have endured on sand bank roger tenderly supported emaciated frame in arm tried to coax food down sick man throat weakly pushed away hand of must be benefactor light of reason presently returning to eye said must eat nothing pleaded for draught of water be at once given seeing that man be too weak to swallow anything solid roger ceased to persuade in few minute poor fellow be again sunk in profound stupor a more must be done for others turned attention to own meal being ravenously hungry did full justice to food before averring that have never in whole course of life tasted anything half so enjoyable thus conclusively proving truth of statement that hunger be very best sauce having at length satisfied appetite be considered quite time to go wait for mistress turtle to make appearance so away went distance not being great soon arrived at spot where sure enough saw fine large turtle have be none too cautious in manner of approach a hardly anticipated finding there so soon if at directly appeared over ledge of rock away went a fast a must for sea roger who be very fast runner soon got in front of headed off few second later men came up when united effort be sufficient to turn over on back after be safe bevan then drew knife cut off head be thrown away then making fast rope have brought with to one of fin dragged carcass off at length got to hut then started to cut up one of fin being at once dropped into pot stood on fire to make soup that sick man might have something more nourishing than water to drink then put away a much a must keep fresh until have used remainder hung out in sun to dry after cutting flesh into strip thus ensuring for plentiful supply of meat for time to come now felt somewhat more comfortable in mind for be certain that with fish hoped to catch occasional turtle two with further possibility of egg now then above plentiful supply of water must be able to hold out until fleet came back to take off temporary prison having removed particle of flesh from shell irwin signified intention of taking latter down to water edge to clean thoroughly a must then afford very handy useful receptacle for water must be further very useful a bath for be highly dangerous to attempt bathing in sea likelihood being that adventurous swimmer must be snapped up by voracious shark before have be minute in water therefore went off dragging shell after while bevan returned to turtle nest for remainder of egg roger busied with simmering turtle soup also taking few strip of meat impaling on piece of wood in readiness for next meal having performed part of duty strolled away down to beach to watch jake clean turtle shell a came in sight of beach what be surprise to see jake irwin in water up to arm pit reaching out a though endeavouring to get hold of object just beyond man did not see roger continued strange antic presently got hold of what be after have appearance of small keg seemed to be about a much a must conveniently carry then turned round began to make way ashore again carrying prize with glanced up saw roger shouted have something here master trevose will be very valuable to if be what believe to be soon waded out flung down small barrel on sand at foot why said roger what be that be barrel of sort a of course can see what do suppose content to be well responded sailor a be getting water to clean shell saw object washed up then taken out again by undertow so determined to get hold of if possible next time rolled in made grab at missed then ran out after after making several attempt managed to get hold of brought ashore here be think valuable because look to like one of ship spirit cask may be brandy if brandy have not be spoiled by salt water getting at will be great blessing to sick man evans may even save life may save ours too if get taken ill for there be knowing when fleet will be here again very true responded roger believe that skipper will give up looking for while ship hold together a say may be long time before be rescued so be a well to secure everything can lay hand on meanwhile let take barrel up to hut open see if content be what hope to be whether have be reached by sea water spoiled not then taking end of barrel be one of small cask called breaker holding about twelve to fourteen gallon therefore very weighty carried up to hut where found bevan just returned with remainder of turtle egg irwin at once set to work to remove bung of cask while roger went into hut fetched out only small vessel belonging to little community wooden mug capable of holding somewhere about pint half few moment more irwin said ready master trevose yes replied lad then here be sir roger slipped mug in front of hole caught liquid in a came gurgling out let mug fill then bung be returned to place driven home with hammer so far a colour smell be concerned there must be little doubt that liquor be brandy a irwin have surmised roger be not greatly addicted to use of spirit being indeed exceedingly temperate therefore considered poor judge of quality nevertheless sipped at content of mug having tasted said that so far a must tell stuff be good spirit enough at rate be certain that have not be got at by salt water bevan irwin then took taste pretty long taste be too for returned mug to roger empty pronouncing to be finest brandy of france have ever passed lip being seaman must have very much liked more roger pointed out that spirit must be regarded a medicine only must be carefully conserved for use a such if ever of must be taken ill men fortunately have sense enough to see that roger be right in what said agreed to liquor being kept for use in case of necessity be now time to prepare next meal be done perfect feast of egg turtle steak bread turtle soup constituting spread evans be again aroused given few spoonful of soup with liberal allowance of brandy in seemed too dazed to enquire where nourishing wholesome food have come from managed to swallow portion revived so much that sat up without assistance faculty seemed to return to certain extent presently asked for more be given supplemented time by small quantity of brandy hot water spirit seemed to do more good than anything else light came back gradually to fast dimming eye spot of colour made appearance in ashen face swallowed with great difficulty taking time managed to eat very fair quantity of food for man sick nigh unto death food together with stimulant revived so much that for time roger thought that with care constant attention good food might even now save man life after effect be only transient be not long before have to lie down again eye lost fire gradually dropped back into stupor similar to from have be aroused to take meal roger be greatly moved by poor wretch condition be very quiet reserved for remainder of day two sailor however have seen more of world vicissitude than lad did not affect at when night fell retired to improvised couch being considered unnecessary to keep watch for replenished fire so thoroughly before turning in that must burn until morning if ship must by chance happen to sight island during night must inevitably see fire built a be on highest point of bank seeing must know that castaway be alive on island must then naturally heave to until daylight day dawned hand turned out invalid of course excepted breakfast be cooked sat down to meal with very hearty appetite despite fact that upon looking round horizon be found to be bare of ship evans be again roused from now constant stupor managed to take little soup brandy immediately afterwards sank back again exhausted relapsed at once into usual state two seaman went away to fish from reef running into sea close to where turtle be taken roger remained in camp to look after evans men have not long be absent on fishing excursion roger be busy in hut when sick man moved turned on side opening eye fixed on roger face sepulchral voice issued from man lip roger understood to ask that must come close to side of course immediately acquiesced lay down on ground beside man so that lip might be level with roger ear thus enable poor fellow to speak without further weakening by raising voice man asked for brandy roger at once gave to revived little be now able to speak though in very low weak husky voice in near approach of death must now be heard be clear indeed that invalid be sinking fast that earnestly wished to communicate something to roger before died first asked lad to see if two sailor be anywhere near boy told that have gone fishing did not satisfy must have roger look make sure to satisfy therefore roger went outside took look round men being nowhere in sight went in reported fact to evans evans then signed to lad to come closer sit down so that must speak directly into ear pulling together with effort said have be very kind to young man be going to recompense by giving paper stole from jose leirya cabin also cipher when translated will put owner of into possession of scoundrel enormous treasure always provided of course leirya have not already returned ere secured think have for a told at end of yarn when left rather when left here be going for cruise in mexican gulf a mentioned treasure be hidden somewhere on shore of inlet at east end of cuba latitude longitude of gave will have to ascertain precise locality of treasure for by translating cipher for know doe other living man except jose leirya will perhaps say that one of who helped to bury must know doubtless did once of who left vessel to bury stuff with jose not one ever returned to vessel be heard of afterward crew of ship so stood in awe of captain that dared not remonstrate make enquiry be convinced in mind that did away with men by poison buried in brushwood near beach there be seven men to bury treasure with big strong a be be must not have killed openly in fair fight jose may may not know by time have key to hiding place of treasure if doe will not dare to remove attempt to bury elsewhere for in ship be aware of what took place when first buried none must go with again to assist must not undertake job alone besides have always expressed utmost confidence that one must ever translate cipher without key that carry in own brain so will almost surely leave wealth where be want seaman to know for men must not keep silence news must soon be known to then of course must no longer be secret paper have not examined merely looked at to make certain that cipher be there finding that be troubled no further have better examine a there may be something of value among told in yarn that have driver on galley named alvarez who left before jose leirya came aboard if did not intended to well must tell that there be originally two copy of cipher alvarez whilst officer in spanish ship of war employed agent of to join crew of pirate vessel steal cipher if possible a alvarez have heard circumstance relative to treasure from one of spy of whom employ great number spy obeyed order be only able to secure one copy leaving other now posse discovered theft while lying in very harbour where treasure be hidden spy got to hear that be known sprang over side intending of course to swim ashore a went be followed by shower of bullet saw more so feel very certain that lie at bottom of bay that alvarez did not get cipher wanted thought roger to be pretty certain did what be more know now that have in cabin aboard gloria del mundo man little think have very paper be talking about in pocket at very moment for must be same said nothing however dying man resumed have therefore rival to fear except jose if must destroy ship a hope captain will do when have told story will be certain of vast wealth provided that can translate cipher believe will certainly be able to do for jose say a to impossibility without key now be exhausted with talking so much please give little more brandy roger did so finding man too weak to lift mug to lip almost too far gone to swallow having recovered somewhat continued in weak voice taking packet from pocket now here be packet of paper cipher be with keep safely by part with under circumstance condition if do fortune be certain ceased speaking head fell heavily back on hard couch roger sprang for more brandy lifted poor fellow head appeared lifeless roger wetted lip with spirit presently parted sufficiently to enable lad to pour little into mouth be gradually swallowed roger poured in little more be also taken in few second heavy sigh escaped lip of sufferer eye opened there be glaze over told own tale white lip opened roger bending down heard last word evans ever spoke god bless sir said keep safe keep promise to sir good bye die now be glad eye went duller still lip ceased to move body seemed to stiffen grew suddenly cold roger knew that end have come that poor fellow trouble be at last over that be at rest roger remained for moment sitting lost in thought then rising placed blanket over dead man face went outside hut determined to go find two sailor inform of what have happened so that might come assist in burying body at once for in climate be necessary to bury body a soon a possible after death for sanitary reason lad have not gone very far from hut when remembered that be still holding packet of paper in hand so slipped into pocket where always kept other cipher a did so paused for moment then drew paper forth again determined there then to compare two cipher for felt almost positive in own mind that two cipher must be found to be identical therefore sat down at foot of palm tree in shade undoing packet compared two paper finding a anticipated that cipher be written in exactly same term therefore thought roger spy of alvarez managed after to evade musket ball fired at succeeded in conveying cipher to alvarez wonder that spaniard be so anxious to find paper day in cabin of gloria del mundo having satisfied on point returned paper to pocket buttoned up jacket again continued on way to find sailor presently made appearance thus saving trouble of searching for saw that be laden with a much fish a must carry explained that have caught far more than be necessary for present use that intended to try experiment of drying in sun even a have done with turtle flesh thus in event of success providing store of food against contingency might arise roger of course returned with men on way back recounted to fact of poor evans death of desire to bury body at once three be soon back at hut choosing spot at distance from dug grave in sand with sharpened piece of wood a have other implement hole having presently be made sufficiently deep returned to palm grove laying blanket on floor placed inanimate body thereon then bevan taking one end of blanket irwin other carried corpse away to lonely grave reverently laid therein done roger kneeling by grave side said prayer whilst seaman stood by with bared head after sand be shovelled back small mound raised over grave death of evans affected three survivor more le during remainder of day be very silent thoughtful turned in early to sleep about midnight roger awoke with vague sense of impending evil turned turned again upon hard couch found impossible to sleep after time began to feel that there be something missing to have be accustomed racked brain over over again vainly trying to remember what be for time without success then came suddenly upon that usual faint reflection of glow big fire at beach have be wont to throw round hut be absent quickly getting into few clothes stepped out of hut saw that moon in first quarter be rising high in heaven giving just sufficient light for to distinguish object faintly therefore did not take lantern with at once walked away down to beach where found fire out cold have forgotten to replenish before turning in for night took out tinder box in order to get light when happened to look up to seaward there before astonished gaze saw vessel riding at anchor about two mile from shore in first paroxysm of joy roger be about to call aloud imagining craft to be one of vessel of cavendish squadron on looking again studying craft more closely saw that be altogether different from of vessel in fleet be wondering who what must be when description of certain ship flashed across mind yes there certainly be exactly a evans have described black long low lying hull flush deck schooner rig enormously tall tapering raking spar yes in moment roger knew for what be be pirate schooner of jose leirya man have doubtless missed paper guessing who have taken have come back to secure evidently knowing bad landing leirya be waiting for daylight before attempting to send boat ashore six hour more of darkness thought roger bounded back to hut a fast a must go awoke two seaman told in few word be naturally overwhelmed with consternation not knowing what to do said roger have plan may possibly save must put provision back in cask bury in sand then must hide everything that brought ashore leaving out only poor evans belonging new hut must of course leave will think that evans built that must remove from trace of own presence on islet then poor fellow must unearth body lay in hut covering up when come ashore in morning a of course will will see that be recently dead will not dream that have be once buried already if be careful to remove trace will naturally be thought that died here alone untended must be very careful to efface sign of presence here leave only such thing a evans have when arrived may be reasonably supposed to have collected from beach then a to hiding at extreme seaward end of rock where to day caught fish there be hollow big enough to conceal dozen men particularly noticed when be on spot must take food water hide there until pirate leave will not attempt to land at place for reason that boat must not be safely put alongside rock if carefully hide everything belonging to will not suspect that anyone else be here will not search now must be quick for life depend upon if be found will certainly die horribly quick now men must do everything have to be done be safely hidden before daybreak will be seen chapter twelve narrow escape of castaway squadron heave in sight again seaman needed second bidding from roger description must be none other than pirate vessel knew what fate must be if be so unfortunate a to be discovered by pirate rapidly throwing on clothes came out of hut examination of vessel over top of bank convinced that roger statement be only too true how about flag though sir said bevan if have seen that be almost certain that have will think there be others here will search will be use hiding then for if believe anybody else to be here will search till find think need not greatly trouble about flag responded roger will imagine that poor evans set up staff flag before died in hope of attracting attention will hardly trouble to examine closely enough to discover that be made of two red shirt besides for aught that know evans might have taken two red shirt ashore with in chest when be marooned no matter not if flag have be seen come along men moment lost now only increase danger forthwith set to work in grim earnest labouring for life cask be rolled out of store hole be scooped in sand for reception to bury be not long job took care however to set aside provision water for use while in hiding next came job of burying simple utensil such a be also shell of turtle then there be gruesome task of digging up body of poor evans have to be done sooner better a roger said so all three went to unpleasant duty mound of sand be removed tilling taken out presently came upon body sand be brushed from hair clothing of corpse be then carried to hut placed in previous position covered with blanket in have be buried completed preparation for pirate landing for be certain that must land otherwise why must have returned to island work have lasted longer than thought away to east first sign of dawn be apparent by time have finished knew marvellous rapidity with day come go in region recognised need for haste if be to gain proposed place of concealment unperceived for there must certainly be sharp eye on board pirate looking for first sign of marooned man therefore took man share of provision keeping carefully below concealing top of sand bank started to run at utmost speed for ledge of rock be to be refuge meanwhile daylight be coming with terrible rapidity shore extremity of ledge of rock be reached after what seemed eternity began passage out along a fast a must go be dangerous going among rock danger frightful danger spurred on looking seaward must make out hull of pirate vessel quite distinctly prayed that might not be so easily perceived at last reached hollow among rock be to be haven of refuge tumbled over one into having at length got breath jake irwin put forward sensible suggestion that must take morning meal at once proceeded to do so however with very unpleasant feeling that might quite possibly be last finished with hearty draught of brandy water to put spirit into after toilsome night work bevan irwin having taken especial care to bring good quantity of liquor along then scrambled cautiously up have look at schooner taking care to remain well hidden be in present position much nearer to pirate vessel than when first saw a sun got up shone on stern must with little difficulty make out name black pearl be painted in large red letter across counter presently sign of returning life be apparent on board soon afterwards boat be filled with men lowered pushed off a soon a touched water made for shore how fortunate be thought roger how much like special dispensation of providence for safety that have forgotten to replenish fire on night before have be burning pirate must have known that living being be on island for evans body gave evidence that have be dead too long for to suppose that fire lit by must still be burning remains of certainly must see must doubtless believe that evans have made that have gone out after death little dreaming at moment when let go anchor ash must have be scarcely cold while thought be passing through roger mind boat landed people got out proceeded quickly up beach shout presently announced that have caught sight of new hut toward hand at once wended way for time nothing be seen heard of pirate eventually three of went down to beach again entering boat pulled off to ship going to inform leirya that victim of cruelty be dead whispered roger to bevan latter nodded after boat have remained few minute alongside black pearl man of enormous size be seen to descend ship side enter when again pushed off be pulled shorewards once more will stake allowance of grog for day whispered jake irwin to two others that man in stern sheet there handlin ' tiller be jose leirya comin ' ashore to make sure that man be really dead to secure there paper what evans said stole from cabin be what be brought back will warrant be pity did remember sir to take from body evans said be vallyble roger according to promise did not inform jake that have paper in possession at moment s sh whispered jake suddenly withdrawing head from point of lookout here come god in heaven why go back to ship now see a evans be dead what more do want surely sir did leave nothin ' about 'd show 'em be here did thought cleared away trace so did replied roger so far a can remember be be perhaps only by chance that be coming way men came nearer nearer ventured out little way along rock presently heard voice at distance away shout in spanish have gomez go out to end of ledge see if water be deep enough for boat to lie alongside rock voice replied ay ay captain from point so close to that owner must have come almost to hiding place without fugitive seeing hearing three looked at one then a if same thought have come to of at same moment with one accord advanced cautiously stationed behind rock by man must pas to reach edge of ledge here where now be everything might transpire must be screened from others unless of be following gomez out along ledge must risk that crouching low a silent a watching cat waited for man gomez in moment two heard footstep on rock heavy breathing nearer nearer came now be almost on then with spring have be down among rock before must utter sound quick a lightning jake pushed handful of sand sea weed into spaniard mouth clapped hand over to prevent ejection roger bevan at same instant seizing man arm leg eye of gomez be staring starting out of head with mortal terror at utterly unexpected attack jake drew knife roger shook head violently in dissent jake whispered hastily must be sir ca help be life ours roger turned head away next moment heard horrible choke gurgle while body writhed violently a held arm flood of something hot rushed over hand arm felt quite sick now sir quick said jake be only chance there be overhanging ledge of rock here must take provision 'ere corpse git into water floatin ' under ledge until go for when chap gomez be found to be missin will search find if do a say must risk shark there be clearly nothing else for so slipped in taking corpse with got under ledge quite concealed supported dead body that might not float away betray proceeding be fraught with danger a shark swarmed in water blood be oozing from spaniard body must be almost certain to attract monster of sea scent for blood being very keen flesh of fugitive crept knowledge that one of might be seized kept in state of perfectly agonising suspense have be in for time position be becoming unendurable when gomez gomez where be hasten man want to wait here day came from very ledge underneath be floating holding meanwhile corpse of man who be then being called by name where can be curse growled same voice what have become of lazy hound carrajo will flog when get on board gomez there be of course reply may have fallen in be drowned taken by shark perchance suggested voice more oath followed together with lengthy dissertation on gomez ancestor immediate remote at moment bevan gave vent to suppressed gasp following gaze others saw dorsal fin of several shark have evidently scented blood still draining from body of slain man be now searching for prey then concealed listener heard from someone who have evidently be to edge of ledge to search for missing man have looked captain gomez be nowhere to be found there be more awful oath from jose for be indeed that renowned most notorious scoundrel then again spoke must have fallen in be drowned curse on for clumsy fool yes there be shark have taken worthless carcass come will return to schooner be useless to search further for for will never come back meanwhile shark be coming ever closer closer still while footstep of pirate companion be heard retreating mind of hiding trio be much relieved at departure of jose leirya villain particularly at jose mention of intention to return to vessel suspense of waiting for to retire while shark be edging ever nearer nearer be awful triangular fin of terrible monster be now darting rapidly hither thither at dart voracious fish came nearer than before momentarily expected to see one more of fin disappear below surface knew that when happened might anticipate seizure by shark few second later a yet fin remained visible on surface of water poor roger be nearly fainting with anxiety apprehension while bevan be rapidly becoming exhausted at length strain on nerve became unendurable jake irwin said think fellow will hear now even if splash if splash shark will be at in few minute anyhow be goin ' to risk forthwith began to splash vigorously although a yet dared not shout sudden commotion of water coming after dead silence have previously reigned startled great fish fin instantly scattered in direction to great relief of fugitive a jake said wo keep off very long have smelled blood will be around again directly then swam stroke two very cautiously out from under ledge in order to have peep at pirate ascertain whether be still in sight be if pushed on without stopping must be out of sight in few moment question be must be able to keep shark at bay for short time be doubtful to say least of yet dared not move out of hiding place just then pirate must be certain to see making attempt inaction be beginning nay have long since begun to tell on nerve poor roger felt a though must scarcely refrain from shrieking aloud so great be tension terrible fin be again gathering about one by one came edging back ever nearer nearer at last fugitive must endure no longer taking corpse by shoulder turning into more favourable position for purpose bevan said will wait no longer now when push dead body off jump for life back on to ledge must risk being seen for shark mean to be denied then gave corpse violent push seaward three made simultaneous scramble for safety of ledge jake be up first extended hand to roger while behind heard clashing snapping of jaw sudden rushing wash of water a body of gomez be torn to piece by hungry monster commotion in water be terrible horribly suggestive a shark snapped struggled fought for share of prey thought that surely pirate must hear hearing return to see what noise be about roger be out now only bevan remained in water jake roger stretched out hand bevan grasped with own with simultaneous pull out came landing on knee on rock only just in time for even a left water huge shark of at least twenty five foot in length came dashing at with such furious determination that ran great snout with row of shining saw edged teeth right up on ledge so close a actually to graze bevan body man however hastily sprang aside capsizing irwin roger three fell pell mell into hollow in rock have served a former hiding place safe at last what narrow providential escape now to discover whether pirate have seen jake climbed up to former coign of vantage a soon a clapped eye to peep hole held up hand in warning roger shuddered after thought after hairbreadth escape have seen be coming back to take jake now came creeping cautiously down whispered that pirate have not gone off a far a have anticipated indeed be not very far away even now have evidently not seen fugitive leave water be standing in group looking back toward hiding place so far a jake must judge seemed to be listening bevan now crawled up have look then beckoned to rest climbed up alongside through peep hole saw that pirate have now relaxed attitude of attention be once more walking slowly away ever anon taking backward glance over shoulder presently disappeared from sight behind rock fugitive breathed more freely roger said if now go straight off to ship be saved trust will not chance to stumble upon of buried provision barrel will at once suspect presence search until find for can see that be not altogether easy in mind over strange disappearance of gomez think be so master trevose replied bevan 't be only fancy for part be convinced that believe gomez have fallen off rock be taken by shark how pale do look sir better have drop of brandy ala there be brandy in haste to escape from jaw of shark brandy small store of food have be dropped be now without doubt safe in maw of one of monster roger turned still more pale bevan put arm round shoulder to support presently head fell back went off in dead swoon experience of last few hour have be too much for poor lad overstrained nature must bear no more will soon come round jake said bevan get drop of water if can without being seen bring in hat slop on face that will soon bring to jake accepted suggestion presently returned without having seen anything of pirate soused roger head shoulder with sea water boy soon recovered feeling little ashamed of weakness worry about master roger replied jake have seen men stronger older than faint for le than what have just gone through roger be soon again took look round time saw jose leirya crew down on beach preparing to get into boat 'd better not leave here spot until see up anchor get well away advised jake for know may come ashore again if be to do a'ter 'd left hidin ' place 'twould be up with others agreed to proposal watched boat pulling away to ship soon got there be forthwith hoisted inboard presently watcher saw sail fall from yard while up came anchor schooner canted sail filled vessel gradually gathered way be off three felt strongly inclined to give hearty cheer prudence prevailed remained silent presently however got out of hole in be crouching made way cautiously along ledge taking utmost care to keep always out of sight of schooner by by reached beach over top of near most rock saw black pearl rapidly growing smaller in distance by crawling creeping dodging behind anything big enough to conceal finally gained back beach then having ridge between pirate vessel set off at brisk pace for hut when at length reached found that nothing have be disturbed body of evans have evidently be searched be now lying upon sand instead of where have left on improvised couch first act be to unearth cask of brandy take good draught apiece feeling that needed deserved after what have gone through morning then evans received second burial poor fellow inanimate body have be put to strange use felt must know must not in least object provision be next got up re stored then found time to take look at retreating pirate vessel yes there still be now very small to view yet hardly a far off a have expected to be continued to gaze for few moment longer be just about to turn away with relief thankfulness in heart when saw pirate vessel hurriedly setting additional canvas then suddenly bore up went off on other tack presenting port side instead of stern to island now what be matter queried jake be headin ' away south for la guayra way what be in tearin hurry for ca make out at answered bevan felt sleeve plucked turning round beheld roger pointing unable to speak toward horizon on side of island opposite to pirate ship there at last perceived fleet hull up above horizon in plain sight with sail set carrying on after pirate at utmost speed chapter thirteen be rescued at last capture of pirate ship black pearl captain jose leirya be scarcely possible that cavendish must not recognise island by sight from reckoning a one on roger little crew have be left yet three of vessel comprising squadron be cracking on in chase of black pearl evincing not least interest in sand bank be leaving on starboard beam well ejaculated roger having come thus far one at least of ship might have hauled in hove to long enough to send boat ashore take off mr cavendish will scarcely need three of vessel to capture that one craft expect old cary have recognised schooner a leirya ship captain be determined to make sure of trusting that will be able to hold out here until have captured found time to return for still pirate may lead long chase lasting perhaps for several day if be going to catch must like to be aboard to help in fight with seaman said nothing be clear that fully shared roger disappointment a stood staring at fleet of ship went sailing past at distance of four five mile too far off for castaway to be observed from deck suddenly bevan uttered ejaculation turning ran at full speed to hut reappeared in moment with armful of wood from stock kept for replenishing fire cast down on beach kneeling beside proceeded with feverish haste to strike light from tinder box quick exclaimed get damp wood wet sea weed anything like will make smoke only for goodness ' sake be quick be only chance other two infected by excitement at once ran to do bidding be quite at loss to understand reason for such violent hurry having secured several armful of varied material just damp enough to make good smoke not sufficiently so to extinguish fire returned tossed on flame bevan have now succeeded in causing to burn brightly more get more said look sharp about quick quick yes right bevan laughed roger what be tremendous hurry for even if captain doe not now take off will come back for a soon a have captured pirate ay ay see man answered bevan forgetting in excitement deference due to roger a officer see man that captain notion be that pirate have be here captured that be now aboard that there black pearl of his'n will catch if can bring to action when be done there will be great slaughter o ' side supposin ' that schooner be sunk with hand mr cavendish wo find when board not findin ' will believe a have be murdered throw 'd overboard else will think that be among dead a will be unrecognisable then thinkin ' dead for will not dream that be be possible for to have hidden here escaped ruffian will continue v'yage wi'out troublin ' to come back here here will remain perhaps till die be reason why be so anxious to attract attention afore run out o ' sight of for if be not seen now may depend upon may a well make up mind to remain here for rest of life what must be sending vessel in pursuit for if did believe a be aboard that there black pearl ye see sir what be thinkin ' about be few barrel of food a have got wo last for so very long even if go on short common ca always reckon on catchin fish turtle gettin ' egg few month 'd find in same plight a be pore william evans when first came ashore on here island oh pray that may be keepin ' sharp lookout aboard ship fire be now blazing up bravely castaway industriously continued to toss on damp fuel so that dense column of smoke be now ascending high in air being sheltered from wind by palm grove just behind three men be careless a to pirate seeing smoke now knowing that even jose with reputation for courage daring must not venture to return in teeth of british squadron to attempt to secure yet must not help speculating a to what pirate must be thinking what feeling must be now that be borne in upon that people have be on island though have not found must of course be able to make shrewd guess a to gomez fate roger must picture to fellow disappointment anger for having failed to find paper in search of have returned to sand bank must almost certainly arrive at conviction that unknown people on island who have evaded keen eye in so mysterious manner have come into possession of to have be so near recovery of cherished paper yet to have missed roger must picture man standing on quarterdeck of black pearl gnashing teeth in impotent fury shaking fist at island a beheld column of thick smoke rising from for swiftly disappearing pirate none of cared jot since be not own dearly loved ship near if god be good must not soon be once more treading white deck that knew loved so well meanwhile however seemed a though even after there might be slip 'twixt cup lip for despite smoke signal that be sending up ship be holding persistently on course after pirate more fuel be piled on smoke went driving away to leeward in dense cloud still there be response sign from ship of having be seen while be now drawing rapidly away from island reckon said jake that be lookin ' at chase aboard there craft why ca of 'em take squint aft at island then must see smoke at rate a if in answer to complaint immediately following upon saw stream of flag float up from first vessel a rightly guessed be ship mr cavendish have taken command of a flag ship few moment later answering signal be displayed from rearmost vessel evidently obeying signal now came round upon opposite tack with bow pointing toward island be seen at last be seen trouble anxiety waiting be now over hurrah hurrah hurrah three castaway seemed to lose head completely shouted leaped into air shook hand embraced other cutting kind of caper in short behaving like very madman in reaction of joy after waiting for so long in suspense for now recognised very clearly truth of what bevan have said a to being seen rescued now never ship approached rapidly under influence of fresh breeze seeming literally to grow out of water looking with cloud of gaily painted canvas like huge bright plumaged tropic bird presently saw yard thrown aback came up into wind remaining hove to until boat be lowered then slowly tacking to fro opposite watcher on beach saw boat lowered down side men scramble into then saw sunlight glitter on oar blade a dipped into water boat shot away from parent vessel side came rushing toward beach a fast a arm of dozen lusty men must drive coxswain standing up in stern sheet peering eagerly ahead at island foam curled white high about stem showing great speed at be being forced through water said bevan to jake skipper have evidently give order that be not to waste time on road in takin ' of off just look at speed of there cutter expect if must only see that be stampin ' up down quarterdeck bitin ' nail with impatience to be away again a'ter that black pearl prob'ly swearin ' at boat crew for bein ' set of lazy lubber in not puttin ' through water faster laughed sudden thought struck roger jake bevan said cut away up to hut get fresh provision down here to beach have lot of fresh meat still left know how tired ship company get of salt provision turtle meat will prove very welcome change of food for so away go look sharp for people will not want to be kept waiting off went two men presently returned with dried turtle flesh laid down on beach in readiness to be put aboard cutter small brandy cask be also conspicuously present jake irwin quick eye fell upon said to roger before go sir let have one more drink to isla de corsarios for be sure 't have proved very good friend to roger thought that there must be harm in such proceeding so raised objection bevan pouring out generous allowance into wooden beaker have brought down to beach without being asked handed to officer for latter to take first drink took drinking toast other two followed example helping liberally smacking lip after with much satisfaction depicted on bronzed countenance cutter be by time quite close jake standing on rock pointed out by sign to coxswain where must come alongside float in deep water thus allowing to embark easily also put little stock of provision aboard craft came dashing up until within few fathom of place indicated by jake then crew a one man threw in oar boat glided rapidly alongside rock coming to stand still just opposite spot where jake be standing now then jump in quick yelled coxswain who happened to be also second officer on board elizabeth vessel be waiting for to come on board look sharp captain be in haste to overtake squadron before come up with pirate craft yonder need not imagine be going to take stuff aboard can not wait have not time irwin bevan looked somewhat taken aback at brusque harangue roger stepping forward said know sir name be roger trevose be officer on board flag ship be fresh turtle meat for most part be sure captain must not grudge few extra moment spent in taking aboard beg pardon mr trevose replied officer did not recognise name be reynolds ralph reynolds a say seeing that cargo consists of fresh meat think can spare time to take aboard pressed though be for time in brace of shake meat be transferred to boat roger following two seaman stepped into boat instantly shoved off roger sat next to ralph reynolds in stern sheet a made way at top speed towards ship reynolds said to roger young man let tell that two seaman have have very narrow escape from imprisonment on island for remainder of life be running up before fine breeze morning for wretched sand bank of yours intending to take off when saw craft steal out from under lee of island one of men aboard at once recognised a black pearl ship of arch scoundrel jose leirya signalled commodore to effect replied ordering ship to make sail chase for see there be doubt very naturally supposed that pirate have carried off with of course sooner later must have brought rogue to action must not have helped a by account be sort of man who go down fighting ship to very last rather than surrender fully expect be what will happen then captain take thinking of course that have gone down with ship must have dismissed from mind in yonder bit of island must have remained for rest of life until taken off by passing ship latter contingency however be very unlikely one so far a english ship be concerned since island be unknown to english have notion that must find much more comfortable to die there than be taken off by spanish vessel delivered into clutch of don fact be that hand be too busily engaged in watching chase to take much notice of island here be alongside now men up come on deck smartly get boat hoisted in hook on fall there up with reynolds sprang up side ladder reaching deck closely followed by roger saluted captain who be waiting for at gangway reported very well said captain get that boat lifted out water must be hauled up secured after have swung yard be once more on move up helm mr widdicombe get way on then turned to roger welcomed on board ship commiserating with on discomfort while on sand bank congratulating upon a yet unexplained inexplicable escape from pirate then recommended roger to care of one of officer directing jake bevan to take up quarter duty with other seaman until such time a must be transferred to own craft turned away to give order attend to sailing of ship even a cutter have dashed alongside vessel a though impatient to resume chase have paid off have begun to move through water bow having be turned in direction of other ship craft merely thrown into wind for moment to lessen way while boat came up to fall be hooked on then helm be put up ship be away on old course once more cracking on showing stitch of canvas to freshening breeze in full eager pursuit of consort pirate latter now being hull down on southern horizon with nothing below topsail yard showing flag ship be leading ship of three pursuing vessel be distant nine mile from elizabeth el capitan tiger a be now named be two mile astern of flag ship seven mile ahead of elizabeth latter vessel therefore have considerable distance to cover before must overtake consort night be now beginning to fall mast of black pearl gradually disappeared from sight of aboard elizabeth flag ship being so far in advance still have pirate well in view now lighted three poop lantern a guide to tiger in turn lighted hers to pilot way for elizabeth darkness soon fall in region in very few minute a seemed night enveloped like pall there be moon night being cloudy star be visible blackness consequently be intense must be seen be triangle of light in flag ship very dim in distance on tiger shining somewhat more brightly because nearer at hand captain of elizabeth commanded that lantern must be lighted on board ship indeed that light of kind must be shown on board at for said sail somewhat faster than tiger good adventure can see light so that can tell where be be in mind to have little sport with good mr cavendish by letting find alongside at daybreak will therefore carry on a hard a spar gear will suffer through night not to give others inkling of purpose will edge away to westward sufficiently to enable to pas tiger about mile to starboard of same with flag ship at time be about two bell in first dog watch must therefore reckon on ten hour of complete darkness sufficient a captain believed hoped to allow to overtake other two ship of squadron continued to crack on a skipper have enjoined maintenance of strict silence ship seemed to on board to resemble dim phantom vessel leaping ghost like from wave to wave before strengthening wind sound be to be heard on board save swish of water alongside low roar of bow wave a plunged through turned aside from bow weird cry of wind through maze of rigging aloft occasional cheep of parral block sheave to becend of ship at about ten o'clock much to captain satisfaction light at stern of tiger must be much more distinctly seen judged that must at time be only four mile distant showing that in past three hour have gained three mile on be good sailing be also at time good mile to westward of starboard quarter of tiger if anything edging trifle more to starboard of a went along reason for be that captain did not wish to pas tiger at le distance than mile because although certainly be very dark night on even blackest of night if weather be clear there be always certain loom faint image of ship thrown against sky loom must be visible to sharp eye unless elizabeth kept distance away from consort little by little crept up overtaking tiger bit by bit triangle of light at stern be becoming merged into one then one light became gradually eclipsed until at length must not see at by one o'clock in morning knew that must be running parallel with tiger at distance of about mile half on starboard beam be possible now to make out light of battle lantern in interior shining through open port hole through gun muzzle also showed in readiness for attack a soon a pirate be brought to bay a opened up came abreast of must see that be lit up fore aft became perfectly clear that not only be cleared for action that captain have given order to men to sleep at quarter thus be ready for fight at moment notice having overtaken tiger elizabeth began to draw ahead perceptibly brilliantly lighted interior of consort be soon eclipsed while bright triangle of light at stern of good adventure now showed up clearly about two half mile distant broad on port bow captain pryce be in great glee for if went well little jest must be brilliant success by daybreak must be foremost vessel of squadron therefore first to come up with black pearl where be pirate seemed certain that flag ship must have in view since be standing steadily along on course not sign of schooner must be made out by people on board elizabeth surely said captain who in keenness be spending night on deck ought by time to be able to see something of craft binnacle light glimmer of sort to show where be be nearly abreast of flag ship can not see trace of black pearl yet mr cavendish seems to be standing on with perfect confidence must hardly do be not within view still may be that have lost be merely trusting that will hold course have hope of sighting at daybreak have barely finished speaking when roger who have be gazing long earnestly into dusky blackness to south west came up beside said in low tone of voice sir have be looking for time over in direction within last few minute have come to that there be black something over there can not see sir be growing very rapidly bigger be very right mr trevose replied captain have done well to tell there be indeed something away there can make out loom of vessel sail quite plainly now who what may be ah have flag ship be sailing at haphazard after pirate have doubled putting out light have trusted to luck to run past squadron in darkness what good fortune for that doubled to starboard that took into noddle of mine to have jest against commodore to night have turned other way must certainly have escaped a there be ship over there to see while here be with light out will run right into arm in few moment let go off couple of point mr reynolds order be now given by passing word instead of by drum whistle in few minute men be standing silently at quarter with battle lantern lighted carefully masked everything ready to pour in deadly broadside a pirate came abreast of ship a approached poop lantern on stern of elizabeth be lighted to serve a guide to tiger people who for part be vastly astonished at sudden appearance light be also displayed in port mizzen rigging to enable flag ship to distinguish friend from foe of course disguise concealment be now at end pirate have seen too late be now le than cable length distant from elizabeth a be bearing up before even men must leap to quarter elizabeth have luffed delivered starboard broadside with murderous effect down came mainmast severed just above deck bringing fore topgallant mast with down on crowded deck crashed wreckage adding own quota of killed wounded to effected by gun of english vessel flag ship have already borne up now came foaming down to scene of combat with tiger lumbering along astern pitchy blackness of night be illuminated redly vividly by flash of gun black pearl finding escape impossible have determined to fight to bitter end gun be run out at once opened galling well directed fire upon elizabeth replied in kind night air resounded with report of cannon small arm be rent with cry groan scream from wounded shout oath from flag ship now arrived on scene taking wide sweep luffing up with main topsail aback under stern of black pearl poured in raking broadside traversed whole length of pirate deck leaving very shamble of dead wounded artillery tight did not last very long anxious to capture jose leirya alive cavendish perhaps not too well advisedly laid ship alongside schooner poured men on to pirate deck seeing captain of elizabeth not to be behindhand did same ordering men away from gun forming up led in person over side on to deck of pearl be by time scene of dreadful carnage blood be everywhere planking be so slimy with that men slipped fell in ran in little rivulet from scupper roger who followed close upon heel of captain thought involuntarily of william evans description of how jose leirya have captured very vessel cutting out from under san juan fort in puerto rico tale of how freely blood flowed on same deck then have time for mere thought attention be wholly taken up with fighting problem of how to avoid being impaled cut down by furious pirate villain knew that be fighting with halter round neck laid about like very demon from pit cut thrust cut thrust came at englishman headed by jose for several moment swept invader before roger be a ever well in front rank of combatant be carrying right manfully when saw one of countryman slip fall in pool of blood losing sword a fell burly black bearded ruffian whom have be engaging instantly set foot on prostrate body shortened hanger to thrust through roger who be engaged with pirate nimbly evaded blow aimed at with one spring like young leopard be on must be slayer taking before must turn passed sword through pirate body with such force that penetrated to hilt while rescuer corpse went rolling to deck together roger disencumbered from dead body setting foot upon pulled violently at sword to get free again then hand be laid over on hilt of weapon well known voice said in ear pull roger lad pull out will come out did come roger faced round right into arm of friend harry what harry said joyfully here so be man whom be lucky enough to rescue from black bearded rascal just now how on earth did get here yes lad replied harry have saved life again be once more in debt a for how got here why how otherwise than over bulwark from ship might rather ask how came here must leave experience until more convenient season will not live to see end of good fight pirate be fighting now with fury of desperation encouraged by bull voice of jose leirya who seemed to bear charmed life prepared to form up into line attempt with one furious charge to sweep english from deck of beloved schooner englishman however who be more le separated scattered about deck engaging own antagonist saw move retreated to own main body in order to strengthen for threatened rally of pirate at moment harry roger found isolated from own countryman in great danger a whole surviving pirate crew be between friend luckily for however only four of enemy turned attention to two friend others being too busy preparing to attack english main body to think about yet even a be odds be quite unequal enough four stalwart men in very prime of life hardened by year of toil activity on sea against two youngster who be little more than boy harry roger knew of course that be fighting for life a have long sword a against shorter weapon of pirate contrived to keep at safe distance for time meanwhile pirate have massed together whole body of even to such of wounded a must stand excepting only four men who be attacking two chum have charged englishman with irresistible fury driving along deck a chaff be swept before wind after first rush however englishman rallied again be now slowly surely driving pirate back along own deck recovering lost ground carnage be fearful dead dying be everywhere deck be heaped with side have lost enormous proportion of men seemed a though fight must only end in party being exterminated roger harry be still fighting doggedly for life countryman be now very widely separated from strength be fast failing in face of furious persistent attack of four assailant be driven back still back until be forced against port bulwark must retreat farther blow after blow be aimed at by foe best that must do be to ward off blow without daring to assume offensive be at very last gasp have mentally resigned to death when there came tremendous shock throwing two lad off foot only just in time to avoid final thrust from two pirate to fortuitous circumstance owed life a lay on deck struggling to regain footing be trampled on knocked over again by swarm of men who be rushing in over port bulwark be tiger crew who have boarded in very nick of time with reinforcement english very quickly turned table massing in one body swept deck compelling few surviving pirate among whom be redoubtable jose leirya to surrender at discretion fierce conflict be at last over pirate long terror in caribbean sea be captive while dreaded beautiful schooner black pearl be prize in hand of english chapter fourteen execution of pirate reconnaissance by night off la guayra at commencement of fight pirate vessel have be manned by crew numbering well over one hundred men now dead lay upon deck literally in heap ala there be also many english body lying among only seventeen of crew of black pearl remained alive among survivor being jose leirya be not due to cowardice shrinking from death on own part that have survived fight on contrary have exhibited fine degree of courage be only by accident for be in nowise responsible that be still alive be now standing with hand lashed behind back scowling heavily at captor on side have suffered almost a severely a pirate having lost enormous number of men coming of sailor from tiger in nick of time be that have saved day turned tide of battle in favour of english roger harry have have sens trampled out of by headlong rush of boarder from ship a circumstance undoubtedly saved life be not greatly disposed to grumble at have soon recovered after examining to discover whether be badly wounded not be now engaged in exchanging confidence experience relating to other have occurred since parting prior to wreck on sand bank of isla de corsarios captured pirate having be bound securely be now consigned to care of armed guard who conducted below to hold bade make a comfortable a must on ship ballast commodore then called roll of three vessel of squadron found that have lost no fewer than one hundred eighty men killed wounded in engagement a for ship tiger be untouched flag ship practically intact elizabeth have be somewhat severely mauled captain cavendish first instruction be that vessel must at once proceed to execute such repair a be necessary in order that must not be at disadvantage in event of storm overtaking before even business must be undertaken came disposal of dead with so many slain to deal with be necessarily brief business be accomplished by simple process of tossing lifeless body over side to find last resting place on sand below if indeed multitude of shark be swimming round round four vessel did not intervene otherwise arrange matter unpleasant duty ended deck be washed down with water pumped up from alongside sanguinary trace of recent conflict obliterated then cavendish sent men who have performed duty to aid fellow seaman in effecting necessary repair to vessel required whilst officer made tour of inspection of black pearl to acquaint thoroughly with vessel to secure paper arm ammunition valuable might be on board roger harry having have brief chat followed mr cavendish down companion ladder found in vessel main cabin be most beautifully fitted up evidently with spoil have be taken out of numerous capture beyond confines of captain cabin entire vessel be filthily dirty eloquently testifying to objectionable habit of pirate everywhere went encountered significant trace of recent furious combat in shape of splintered timber riven planking blood splash gash in wood work from sword axe blade hole made by cannon shot havoc destruction reigned supreme even must not disguise barbaric splendour of fitting furniture of ship rich silken curtain be hung anywhere everywhere where must be fastened thick carpet from turkey persia india be strewn wholesale on soiled planking available space on wall bulkhead be ornamented with trophy star of pistol sword hanger boarding ax pike be hung wherever there be room for roger noticed piece of exquisite priceless old tapestry beside carriage of one of main deck gun have probably served a curtain be now torn down trampled upon smeared with blood blackened with powder smoke officer of vessel have evidently enjoyed cabin to furnished according to occupant taste in one there be article of enormous value while silken cushion thick piled carpet dainty coverlet to bunk might have led one to suppose that cabin have be inhabited by delicate lady rather than by savage pirate to whom murder be almost everyday occurrence exhibited however a might have be expected from such crew most execrable taste in arrangement colour of rainbow be combined together article seemed totally out of place in apartment save that belonging to jose leirya cabin belonging to captain be situated at stern of vessel for window have two large opening leading out on to little stern gallery where jose must walk in privacy be in open air cabin have received full benefit of raking fire from flag ship presented scene of lamentable destruction instead of two window leading out on to gallery there be now enormous gaping hole lower edge of be within hand breadth of water occasionally rippled in a schooner rose fell upon swell rich hanging of silk tapestry be pierced rent long gash have be gouged out of floor by round shot fragment of silver gold statue candlestick lay here there scattered in confusion be evident that have single living thing be in cabin at moment when broadside be delivered must not possibly have escaped yet strangely enough there be three splendid picture hanging still upon cabin wall absolutely uninjured cavendish gave order to be at once removed sent on board ship in magnificently inlaid ornamented bureau there be found private paper belonging to jose together with ship log of provided later most gruesome reading of valuable there be none to be found in drawer hidden away roger mentally decided that man for own safety have never allowed valuable to accumulate on board black pearl have always transferred at first opportunity presented to hiding place at lonely inlet kept surmise to harry vessel hold be next investigated contained nothing of importance value in fact whole vessel yielded small return for careful search officer now returned to deck to find that be once more broad daylight went back to own vessel for breakfast roger having said good bye to captain officer of elizabeth thanked for kindness in taking off island afterwards pushed off to flag ship with mr cavendish harry jake irwin walter bevan poor fellow must rejoin shipmate more have fallen fighting bravely be now lying fathom deep in blue water of caribbean sea little did imagine when left isla de corsarios day before death be so close to after breakfast cavendish called council of officer in own cabin to discus fate of surviving pirate schooner decision be soon made a to pirate be that must be hanged one from yard of own vessel a to vessel took somewhat longer to arrive at agreement in view of fact that be little better than shattered wreck that even if be to be repaired have lost so many hand that must not very well spare men to handle be finally decided that must be destroyed business settled council broke up member of went on deck flag ship boat be then manned officer of fleet went on board schooner order have meanwhile be given on board vessel of squadron that crew must turn up to witness execution captive be then brought up on deck cavendish read sentence over to bade prepare for death met announcement with utmost callousness one two of exchanged remark in low tone of voice one man be actually heard to laugh outright a for jose leirya heard sentence with absolute indifference when asked whether have anything to say answered not word whip be now rove from of fore yard arm of black pearl gun on forecastle loaded with blank charge number of men be then detailed to run aft with tail end of whip a soon a noose must have be fitted round man neck mr cavendish decided that must hang captain first so that survivor of crew might witness death of leader being now in readiness four seaman walked up to jose leirya stooping cut bond secured foot pirate stood still for moment to allow blood to circulate once more freely through limb then bound though arm be wrenched free from grasp of four seaman made furious dash towards side of ship actually succeeding in scrambling on to bulwark with evident intention of drowning thus evading indignity of death by hanging seaman however who have be hurled right left by herculean effort closed upon promptly with very little ceremony hauled off with violence hurling to deck falling on top of holding down with weight yet once again succeeded in wrenching free from men clutch staggering to foot made dart for ship side be pounced upon again once more fell upon deck together taunting laugh rang out from group of bound ruffian who be awaiting fate stung english sailor to madness that one man partly bound must keep four stalwart seaman at bay be too much for temper rushed at pirate again time seized securely then tripping up slipped running bowline over ankle hauled taut thus rendering man helpless yet even then must scarcely keep grip on so enormous be strength with turned twisted in grip at length after infinity of trouble succeeded in dragging to forecastle running noose attached to whip be brought up to pirate slipped over neck cavendish then gave signal gun be fired men holding end of whip ran aft seaman holding man sprang aside pirate body still struggling writhing went flying aloft to stop presently with jerk a reached jewel block dangle at end of fore yard arm still plunging struggling with such violence that yard fairly shook be considerable time before struggle ceased body be allowed to hang little longer then rope be cut corpse plunged downward into sea among shark whose clashing teeth noisy splash gave conclusive evidence a to whereabouts of pirate last resting place remainder of ruffian betrayed not slightest emotion at terrible fate of leader went silently calmly to doom without struggling a captain have done very soon dread ceremony be over pirate have met desert only matter now remained be destruction of notorious black pearl powder shot there be in plenty on board squadron so mr cavendish decided to give ship crew little practice in gunnery by time also necessary repair to vessel engaged have be executed be now in readiness for resumption of cruise sail be therefore made vessel drew off to distance of about three quarter of mile when hove to began to practise on pirate vessel with gun flag ship be first to make hit did between wind water with bow chaser other vessel then got range hulled black pearl with nearly shot harry roger once more together on flag ship have already recounted in detail adventure during time that be separated one on sand bank other on ship driven away to leeward of island by storm be now standing amongst crew of bow chaser gun watching effect of shot with utmost interest roger presently asked captain of gun to allow to have shot man who be much attached to lad by reason of many little act of kindness received made demur gun be reloaded roger with firing match in hand cocked eye along chase of piece watching until heaving of ship must bring sight to bear on hulk presently good adventure dipped to large wave roger who be watching like cat applied match there came sharp report of discharge a smoke swept away young man have satisfaction of seeing shot strike vessel right between wind water just at side of hole where two others have penetrated shot of of course much enlarged already large hole through water of caribbean be now pouring like sluice be seen that pirate vessel be on point of foundering even a watched craft seemed to settle visibly deeper in water rolled heavily two three time few second later stern be seen to lift high bow to point downward steeper steeper became angle of deck then with slow forward movement quickly became diving rush plunged to bottom vanishing from sight in whirl froth of water such be end of black pearl for year have be terror of sea around west indie coast of new spain have be floating den of vice murder conceivable form of infamy now lawless adventurous career have terminated in becoming target for gun of avenger of evil have wrought while captain surviving crew have swung from yard arm of own vessel before be destroyed career of murder terror destruction be ended at last evil spirit of sea be laid all now being over being no longer necessary to carry out original intention of scouring mexican gulf for pirate chance having so fortunately thrown in way be decided to carry out other part of programme will be remembered be to run to la guayra see whether there be plate ship lying there if so to endeavour to cut out capture course be therefore set little squadron bore away to southward eastward in direction of port roger harry have now little time to having so recently witnessed destruction of pirate vessel execution of notorious captain conversation naturally enough turned to cipher roger have in possession have already acquainted friend with news that marooned man william evans have given exact duplicate of cipher that have in possession taken from gloria del mundo two lad now seriously turned attention to translation again foiled must make nothing of did not wish to communicate fact of being in possession to third person ask advice knowing that secret shared with others be usually secret no longer so harry kept knowledge to went over remainder of paper evans have given roger a well a cipher also proved to be of importance to anyone former owner a merely contained note from log diary of pirate indeed consisted mainly of skeleton account of many atrocity recorded for who know what reason two lad must not see that useful purpose must be served by retaining memoranda therefore tore up small consigned to deep for reason history of doings exploit of pirate jose leirya have never be written never will be a two lad must make nothing of cipher put away deciding not to worry head about matter until time in future when must have nothing else to occupy two cipher be therefore folded up into neat packet with assistance of needle thread harry sewed little parcel into lining of friend coat in position manner even rigorous search must probably fail to disclose presence of paper now have quite safe friend said harry so long a stick to jacket need never be afraid of losing cryptogram must anybody ever come by chance to know that have key to jose treasure will never be able to find even if attempt to rob harry must say not laughed roger think need fear that person will try to rob of cipher for so far a know only person now alive who be aware that one existed be that evil looking fellow alvarez will imagine doubtless that cryptogram went down with other paper in spanish man of war probably think too that also went down with at rate be not fault did not well objected harry be not so sure about thinking be drowned on occasion for when sent other spaniard ashore at lonely inlet saw looking very hard at believe recognised for spoke to man beside tapped own pocket other fellow then looked at a though to make sure of recognising again nodded to alvarez a went down side yes be pretty sure that alvarez recognised think not unlikely that may have idea that saw looking for something in cabin that when be rescued took with paper that left behind in fright if so of course belief that have cipher in possession at moment well harry old lad laughed roger in reply suppose will ever see alvarez again if do will take care fall into power may be quite sure there be one thing certain now that jose crew be dead that treasure will never be found except by only by if can succeed in translating cryptogram for there be one else on earth now who know even locality quite true roger friend replied harry do most sincerely hope that possession of paper will not bring to harm conversation between two lad be at moment interrupted by cry of land ho from above boy ran up on deck to catch first glimpse of hurrah shouted roger in great glee hurrah show that be not far from la guayra now then for more fighting adventure perhaps may be able to get ashore for hour two land must be discerned fairly clearly from fore topmast cross tree to roger friend ascended showed a bold headland apparently of great height rocky in formation having satisfied curiosity two came down from aloft seeing one of officer attentively looking at fast rising land asked what might be if be anywhere near la guayra how far away be two youngster seem very eager to sight land again replied lieutenant smiling must have thought that trevose must have have enough of land for time after being so very nearly left behind on sand bank to satisfy curiosity will tell that tall headland that see yonder toward be now steering be called cape oruba be north north west extremity of island of oruba will leave island on starboard hand a pas ought to see island of curazao in distance island of course leave on port hand then head into gulf of triste so on to la guayra now young men have posted up in different landmark that will pas can look up for yourselves see where be from that spanish chart that be so thoughtful a to bring with from gloria del mundo roger harry thanked lieutenant for information went below to see where be ship actual position nothing of interest happened here in three day from time when first sighted point be a close in to la guayra a dared venture without further investigation once more council of officer be held in mr cavendish cabin on board flag ship plan of campaign arranged squadron be decided be to lie to in little bay not many mile to north westward of port of la guayra there be danger of presence there being discovered there being town port near cliff rose up almost perpendicularly from water edge little bay be practically landlocked thus hidden from seaward then three boat be to be provisioned with food water for two day leaving ship early in afternoon be to arrive off la guayra about midnight thereabout be to make a close investigation of harbour ship might be in a must be made with safety be to ascertain if possible whether there be plate ship in roadstead if so precise position in be lying be also to determine a nearly a must what chance of night attack must be whether likely to be successful otherwise in short be to accumulate information must without being seen little squadron have be hove to during consultation filled away once more carefully felt way into bay after many very narrow escape of falling foul of rock sand bank with entrance be encumbered came to anchor in safety in spot where be to remain until such time a boat expedition must return boat be provisioned manned by ship in squadron roger harry who be always ready for adventure promised spice of danger pleaded so eloquently to be allowed to accompany boat sent by flag ship mr cavendish after considerable demur agreed to going at same time cautioning that even very slight indiscretion on part might easily involve expedition in something nearly approaching disaster next day being in readiness boat set off on dangerous errand about two bell in afternoon watch immediately after seaman have taken mid day meal be accompanied by prayer good wish for success from in fleet cheering be indulged in lest perchance wandering herdsman on height must catch sound look for source discover lurking ship hasten away to city to give warning kept a close under huge cliff towered above narrow beach a must with safety in order to lessen danger of being seen to seaward after dark pulled slightly farther out to sea to avoid possibility of running on rock might see avoid by daylight not after dark about nine o'clock roger who be away up in bow of leading boat keeping lookout passed word aft to officer in charge that have just opened up light apparently on shore be goal then said officer be la guayra now to find out whether there be anything in there that may be worth while to attack then made signal for other two boat to close to give officer in command opportunity for final consultation be presently arranged that on entering bay be to separate be to scour certain part of harbour join others again at three o'clock in morning at spot where parted company bearing of be to be carefully accurately taken la guayra lie in hollow of extensive open roadstead be built at foot of range of huge mountain tower up into cloud behind at back of lie caracas now capital of venezuela be to extremity of roadstead that three boat have now come twinkling light of town be clearly discernible at distance anxiously scanned bay for sign of ship lying there after few moment be able to make out certain detached spark of light felt certain be riding light of number of vessel now remained for to pull quietly unobtrusively shoreward ascertain what vessel be a far a possible discover strength how lay for protection from shore battery oar be therefore muffled with piece of cloth have be brought for purpose order having be given that light be to be shown in of boat for purpose separated making for several point agreed upon before starting boat belonging to flag ship have position of honour therefore of most danger be to take middle course pull down to foot of bay close inshore right under gun of battery task so dangerous must by misfortune be seen there must be hope possibility of escape for in dead silence pulled slowly along peering carefully about getting ever nearer nearer to town light began to show more clearly large object ashore to assume somewhat definite outline dark background of mighty mountain behind town must be made out towering far above head seemingly among few star be night shining be creeping on inward steering for cluster of light evidently betokened presence of large vessel at anchor about mile farther in when same light be suddenly obscured little later there came plainly to ear swish of water strongly suggestive of vessel moving at speed at whispered command of officer boat crew backed water simultaneously brought boat to stand still just in time to avoid being run down by dark mass came swiftly with light showing out toward open sea a passed boat within oar length must hear quite distinctly sound of voice to utter amazement speech of voice be english vessel be moving so swiftly that only few word must be caught be be well so far john lad in hour from will be out of bay once on open sea will take more than voice be lost in distance roger have time before come aft be now by side of lieutenant said in hushed voice what doe mean mr story there be strange happening abroad night ship have englishman aboard yet so far a know there be english ship beside in sea just now besides why be carrying light word roger know replied story a say there be other english about here excepting yet people in possession of craft be undoubtedly english ah can be wonder that people be english prisoner who be effecting escape from spaniard to night of night having managed to get hold of ship be now clearing off zounds believe be right be have happened be doubly annoying first because be very short handed ourselves if must only have got fellow to join must have helped to make up crew once more secondly because escape will surely be discovered before long search made will render very awkward for wish must somehow contrive to communicate with other two boat let know for having happened be high time for to beat retreat will be caught like rat in trap there be way so have better make best most of get what information can then be off back to rendezvous to wait for others start for ship directly appear give way again boy be silent for very life sake therewith went swiftly silently forward again shortly afterward came close alongside ship for have be cautiously steering discovered that be spanish war vessel very presence there suggested plate fleet be probably destined to convoy after pulling very cautiously round ascertaining strength made off toward group of light on arrival there found war ship craft be apparently sister ship to first one have seen of same strength having ascertained seeing more light such a lay in track of other two boat turned bow of boat seaward finding that be well nigh time for to be at rendezvous pulled vigorously in direction have taken few stroke when from somewhere behind in town heard distant clamour suggestive of voice calling shouting listen moment said story stop pulling lad want to hear what be going on behind there men lay on oar strained ear listening presently sound rose from dull murmur to one of greater volume trumpet pealed out from shore answered almost immediately afterwards by one from of warship suddenly from one of battery flash of fire rushed out illuminating for few second a doe flash of lightning whole bay then came dull report of gun now men said lieutenant give way give way for life have discovered escape of other fellow will find also if be not out quickly resistance to such overwhelming odds a must meet with must be hopeless so pull put back into make move light now began to flash out from part of bay disclosing presence of vessel have not supposed to be there indeed seemed a though be surrounded on side by craft of rig size how have threaded way in without falling foul of of now seemed mystery prayed fervently that other two boat might be making escape while there be yet time to do so men set back to work pulled like very trojan boat shot through water picking out course must take a far away a possible from light now shining over roadstead lieutenant steered with utmost caution for knew that life depended on together with of boat crew at length after what seemed eternity passed out clear of encircling ship nothing stood between open sea in hour took bearing pulled to rendezvous luckily to joy of hand when arrived there one boat be already waiting even a lay on oar third came up from other direction news be now quickly eagerly exchanged be ascertained putting together that plate fleet consisting of three ship be indeed there that be guarded by two warship other craft in bay be mostly coasting other small vessel about need not very much concern when came in to attack position of land battery have also be ascertained now nothing remained to return to squadron with speed acquaint captain with information obtained then sail for la guayra forthwith so a to arrive there before plate fleet must effect escape from port for once out of sight below horizon must scarcely hope to find again except after long wearisome search once more united boat began return journey pulling hard while darkness lasted so a to make good offing by daybreak also to leave le toil after sun rose be about four in morning when rounded promontory shut in roadstead must not reckon on more than two hour more of darkness men although fatigued held well to work boat moved along at very good speed day broke with suddenness usual in tropic sun rising disclosed to view short half mile in advance of identical vessel have made hurried exit from roadstead on previous night be excellent english flag be at once hoisted at stave of three boat to show that be english not a people aboard stranger must naturally suppose spaniard in pursuit seeing english flag vessel hove to boat soon came alongside arriving on deck story asked for captain man stepped forward saying that be english seaman who have originated plan of escape finally contrived there be nearly hundred englishman on board who have be captured in small party at various time have be incarcerated in prison at la guayra have nearly all be subjected to torture of holy office bore most dreadful scar a memento of attention many under influence of torture have recanted abjured own faith in order to save from being burnt alive appeared that for time past have be considering plan of escape difficulty in way be many great have of course be immeasurably increased by number first opportunity therefore have only come on previous night have made most of with what success reader have seen story then informed of reason of boat presence there telling of proposed attack on plate fleet invited subject to cavendish approval to join squadron gladly acquiesced without single dissentient voice expressed a right glad of opportunity to be revenged on enemy spaniard with understanding story took charge of ship calling boat crew on deck made fast boat astern towed a with freshening breeze arose with sun made better progress sailing than pulling a result of arrangement arrived sooner than be expected there be much joy throughout fleet at news of plate fleet also because of valuable reinforcement to strength be very badly needed now made crew up to almost full complement captured vessel by mean of prisoner have effected escape be only carrack of very small tonnage therefore being of use be sunk squadron weighed made sail toward evening cavendish purpose being to arrive after dark attempt surprise attack odds being so very greatly in favour of enemy sunset therefore saw under easy sail heading along coast toward la guayra chapter fifteen capture of plate fleet sack of la guayra disappearance of roger harry to make certain of not arriving at destination too soon before townspeople garrison have retired for night english ship carried small amount of canvas consequently made only two to three knot per hour be little after midnight when roger who be a usual on lookout who be credited with sharpest pair of eye in ship saw for second time light of la guayra opening up a came into fuller view of town of roadstead be somewhat astonished to find that be enveloped in almost perfect darkness there be scarcely light to be seen ashore afloat there be one two scattered here there about town there be none at in fort not single glimmer be to be made out anywhere in roadstead surely be not possible that vessel of plate fleet two protecting warship must have left port disappeared during short time have elapsed since boat expedition have made reconnaissance at time too there have be numerous other craft lying there at anchor yet now seemed a though bay be deserted fresh arrangement new plan be obviously necessary english ship showed light strictest silence be observed captain have received order beforehand must have known exactly what course to pursue have there be light showing now became necessary to take fresh counsel among decide how to act flag ship be a usual in van mr cavendish ordered boat to be lowered manned be then to spread out in line so a to make sure of intercepting other two vessel a came up having found to give order for to heave to for respective captain to repair on board good adventure boat be to return to flag ship a soon a order have be carried out luckily there be difficulty in picking up other ship even in pitchy blackness prevailed night with few minute delay officer of fleet be once more assembled in cabin of flag ship situation be discussed a briefly a possible for there be time to lose be presently decided that instead of remainder of fleet following flag ship lead a originally agreed officer of ship who have be with boat expedition must do best to pilot vessel under care to berth occupied by warship arrived there must spanish ship be present a on board fervently hoped must prove to be case be to attack at once whichever of two spaniard might happen to be first attacked other must almost certainly come to help of consort flash of gun noise of tumult must serve to guide remainder of english squadron to scene of conflict if on other hand must be found that warship plate ship have made escape vessel be to return to entrance of roadstead await arrival of consort a too retreated from bay when having rejoined be to return to former hiding place where fresh plan must be discussed made matter being arranged captain returned to own ship very shortly afterward fleet be again under weigh standing inshore in same order a at first slowly noiselessly a ghost glided on heading for place where pilot thought hoped against hope to find warship lying with behind plate fleet be actual objective of expedition english ship have separated on board flag ship nothing must now be seen heard of remainder of squadron pilot having taken direction in personally considered enemy to be lying nothing must be made out ashore afloat to guide in slightest degree in search be indeed groping blindly forward in hope of accidentally coming upon quarry few light of town be visible be away at other side of at long distance from be so far from being of service that be positively misleading to extent at moment might happen that must find ship ashore roger harry be standing in usual position on fore deck gazing eagerly ahead anxious to be first to sight enemy when harry caught friend sleeve pointing into darkness at faint blur upon port bow said there be something there roger d 'ye see lad be ship of sort can just make out mast will pas at very close quarter now wonder if perchance be one of warship that be searching for word be scarcely out of mouth when perfect volcano of flame flashed from side of vessel harry have just sighted immediately followed by thunderous roar shot from well aimed broadside came crashing aboard doing considerable amount of execution men fell in part of ship cry shriek groan curse arose from deck for moment be perfect pandemonium of confusion captain rushing along deck shouted steady lad stand to gun spaniard expected be ready for forget that be englishman pull yourselves together men give back better than received confusion be momentary crew be by time too well disciplined to become panic stricken awaiting word of command presently poured in already prepared broadside with great effect for mainmast of war ship be seen to quiver totter finally fall with rending crash over side remote from good adventure throwing crew of spaniard into momentary disorder a flag ship came up to antagonist took in sail ranged up alongside inshore of there be battery opposite where vessel be lying so that danger be to be apprehended on score like light flared up from part of town aboard vessel in bay a also in fort at opposite extremity of roadstead war ship became blaze of illumination a did also consort must now be seen lying half cable length distant also opened tremendous fire upon flag ship other two ship of english squadron meanwhile have shifted helm be fast approaching guided by flashing of gun uproar of action even ship of plate fleet lying near at hand proved to be heavily armed now began to open fire a well a distant fort be soon very evident that english fleet have entered into engagement in odds be vastly against have anticipated surprising enemy surprise be other way have reckoned on plate vessel being nearly so heavily armed booming of cannon now resounded from side darkness be made light by flash from gun whilst air became thick heavy with powder smoke elizabeth tiger have come upon scene be attacking second war ship be resisting gallantly supported a be by gun from ship composing plate fleet indeed english be in very warm corner flag ship be engaging first war ship name of discovered to be sotomayor yard arm to yard arm vessel fairly reeled under concussion a heavy shot crashed in at one side out at other while good adventure be already on fire below from flash of gun of opponent english sailormen however be ready then a now to meet emergency fire be speedily quenched only to start again however be again put out three time did cavendish pour boarder on to deck of sotomayor three time be driven back by desperate valour greatly superior number of spaniard spaniard have lost mast foremast english ship be in almost a bad plight ship be badly riddled by shot crew be decimated seemed a though unless decisive move be made to end conflict that combatant must be exterminated to man second war ship villa de mejico be in even worse plight than consort having two vessel to engage instead of only one fought with valour of desperation however be packed with soldier who have be put aboard from fort in anticipation of attack have somehow got to be known although be never discovered how that english be near at hand be suspected of contemplating attack on fleet in view of suspicion elaborate preparation have be made for reception crew of tiger elizabeth have several time endeavoured to board have be swept back to own ship on occasion by combined sailor soldier on spaniard harry roger be a usual in very thick of fighting side by side like young hero that be truth to tell doing considerable amount of execution be pausing for moment to take breath when happened to glance forward at once saw that two ship good adventure sotomayor with be drifting right down upon second spaniard antagonist spaniard on sotomayor finding almost overpowered have cut cable purposely to drift down with tide on board consort in hope of being able to make better stand together than separately be mistaken in expectation other vessel having have two to contend with be in condition to render assistance of kind rather indeed did stand in need of help from sotomayor brief minute later flag ship still grappling with quarry be aboard other three craft confusion became worse confounded spaniard determined to make one last desperate effort to beat off english rallied combining force forestalled antagonist by attempting to board two spanish ship acted in concert hurled soldier sailor aboard three english craft be hopeless attempt from first english closed up forming solid phalanx cut down right left driving back quickly compelling shattered remnant of boarder to seek refuge of own deck did stop at followed pell mell close on heel in retreat to deck of spanish ship spaniard fought with courage of desperation utmost effort be unavailing blood of englishman be now thoroughly up there be stopping rushed with irresistible courage determination among shattered now completely disheartened remnant of enemy cut down wholesale mere mortal flesh blood must no longer withstand impetuous onslaught of englishman presently voice be heard from diminished rank shouting surrender surrender mercy mercy cavendish raised voice in command slaughter ceased two armada be in hand of english spaniard be ordered to fling down weapon obeyed be then at once sent below secured under hatch victor be now free to turn attention to plate ship be primary objective such boat a must swim be quickly lowered filled with armed men whose order be to board vessel capture out of hand carry out to sea under own canvas after english vessel two prize must make way out of roadstead a well a might be in shattered state once out of bay uninjured vessel of plate fleet must be able to tow companion in misfortune at sight of approaching boat containing victorious english crew of plate ship be seized with uncontrollable panic many of incontinently jumped overboard whilst remainder hurriedly lowered boat pulled shoreward anxious only to escape by mean from so terrible foe be allowed to do without let hindrance from english a latter have already quite a many prisoner a must conveniently look after vessel be boarded sail made presently enraged population of la guayra have bitter mortification of seeing plate ship sail out of roadstead in possession of english swore vengeance deep awful must of pirate a always termed english adventurer ever fall into hand latter be equally ignorant of indifferent to such threat vessel injured uninjured in due time gained outside of roadstead there hove to in order to effect temporary repair meanwhile cavendish have resolved to jury rig vessel sink two armada in full view of town to make defeat capture still more bitter to spaniard spaniard be transferred from sotomayor mejico to english fleet at daylight warship be sunk in full view of town english fleet then anchored proceeded with work of repair whilst for safety sake prize crew be put on board of plate ship be then sent away to former hiding place at little bay down coast whilst repair be going forward cavendish held council at be resolved to send expedition by night to attack la guayra argued that spaniard must deem content with capture of plate ship must never expect to land attack city must be taken by surprise a crowning event of successful enterprise just executed must sack burn town to give spaniard something to remember by a phrased sailor be only too delighted at idea of attacking enemy again a also at prospect of plunder to be obtained at looting sack of city boat be therefore lowered over side of ship remote from town lay under vessel lee during day in readiness for attack night day long repair be gone on with after nightfall torch lantern be lit to deceive spaniard into believing that be working hard through night so lessen suspicion a to probability of further attack keen watch be kept on town day long to discover whether preparation be being made to resist attack nothing of kind must be discovered evidently spaniard a cavendish have anticipated be lulled to security by supposition that english having secured plate fleet must have reason incentive for returning fondly hoped that a soon a repair to ship be finished must sail away must be last must see of heretic dog little knew character of cavendish be not man to abandon enterprise upon have once entered be principle of to inflict greatest possible amount of damage on enemy that must meanwhile town of la guayra still remained uninjured therefore so ran argument la guayra must be sacked laid in ash before must consider duty a thoroughly finished a consequence shortly after midnight boat of fleet stole silently out from under sheltering lee of parent vessel made swiftly noiselessly with muffled oar for town roger harry ready a ever for adventure matter how dangerous might be be in boat keeping sharp lookout ahead for by time there be few light to guide whole city being wrapped in darkness everything ahead of around be perfectly quiet not sound disturbed still night air save only scarcely audible ripple of water under boat bow a swept gently shoreward presently there be grating of pebble under keel boat stopped dead crew silently disembarked stood still for few moment listening intently to ascertain whether noise of boat grounding on beach have be heard sound came to after waiting little longer to make certain boat be gently pushed off again in charge of couple of hand to take care of marauder proceeded up beach soon arriving on road ran whole length of town at edge of shingle first thing to be done be to obtain possession of fort feeling way a best must in dense darkness set off in direction in knew lay up hill marched presently black mass somewhat darker than surroundings showed against sky be there stealing quietly round searched for gateway soon found everything be now ready for attack officer went silently among men to discover whether be present when be found that not single man be missing have lost way in dark two sack ready filled with powder tightly pressed down tied at mouth be now brought forward be placed in position against ponderous iron bound door train be laid to men then retreated to safe distance lay down waiting for explosion presently there be flicker of light a spark be struck at same moment roger harry grasped hand for second for bloody work be about to begin there be splutter stream of fire ran along ground a gazed enormous flash of brilliant white light blazed up nearly blinding followed by deafening report tremendous concussion seemed to make very earth tremble with came sound of wrenching iron cracking timber crash of falling masonry from interior of fort clamour outcry of sudden awakening of occupant english with cheer shout to announce approach leaped to foot dashed across intervening ground plunged over fallen masonry wreckage of gate into interior of fort into dim radiance of hastily kindled lantern here there found man only half awake confusedly running to ascertain what might be origin of uproar cut down at once from room to room went giving quarter knowing that must receive none one by one unhappy spaniard be killed there be organised resistance be man for for have be taken most completely by surprise roger with harry few more ran at once up aloft came out upon battlement where with mallet spike industriously proceeded to render gun useless into touch hole of gun spike nail be driven a far a must go thus effectually preventing possibility of weapon being fired until spike be drilled out must necessitate expenditure of at least hour of hard work in very short time gun be effectually spiked capture of fort being by time completely accomplished men formed up again outside descended at double to town be now thoroughly awakened alarmed cathedral be to be next place of call object being to remove gold silver plate with be known to be furnished meanwhile tocsin be being sounded brazen voice of church bell pealed out high above other clamour to add to confusion terror english halted fixing arquebus fired volley into square where troop seemed to be mustering immediately upon crash of volley came cry scream from terrified populace bearing eloquent witness to execution wrought by flying bullet then picking up weapon english flew like fiend through town cutting down who have temerity to oppose cathedral be soon reached entered light be glimmering far up aisle just lit by trembling priest who have come in by one two to find out what uproar be about english pressed on undeterred by presence moving up long chancel reached altar two three seaman made way to belfry loosing bell rope in madness of excitement began to ring bell in steeple presently clang clang clang came from tower a hauled on rope rushing from one bell rope to started bell in steeple ringing with effect be appalling terrible a bell gained momentum swung on beam so did rope attached to fly up down through appointed hole in belfry roof with ever increasing velocity now began to twine round other like living twisting serpent sailor pulling have to spring quickly aside to avoid being caught by flying coiling end clang clang sound of bell now became mad jangle steeple fairly rocked to swinging everywhere people be pouring out of house in terror panic not knowing whither to turn for safety who be below in church be now tearing gold silver ornamentation from altar communion plate be scattered on floor of chancel vainly frightened priest strove to stay work of destruction violation seaman be deaf to entreaty cut tore silken hanging from altar wrapping costly fabric over own tarry soiled clothing man plundered for only must allow none to rob of intended spoil above altar stood life sized figure of blessed virgin mother exquisitely modelled in solid gold clothed in rich fabric be adorned with precious stone innumerable sailor saw leaped one after upon altar drawing sword hacking off gem whilst priest covered eye with horror at desecration sacrilege eye of figure consisted of two magnificent sapphire of great size being unable to reach with sword sailor put weapon behind under image with few violent wrench came crashing to ground with thunderous noise a fell from above in belfry came most awful piercing agonising scream of anguish rose in one shrill cry above other sound echoed long drawn out ghastly among dim arch of roof high above fearful cry rose fell while below stood still frozen into silence by utter horror of sound be a voice of lost soul in most dreadful torment a suddenly a have arisen ceased be now noticed that tenor bell be no longer clanging deep mellow voice above in steeple old priest stepped out from among brother cease ye wicked men cried in excellent english cease ye heretic sacrilegious dog ere worse befall ye awful shriek be despairing cry of soul torn from body in awful torment take warning ye from man dreadful fate for man be although ye might have deemed voice that of devil can tell ye doom be caught up by whirling rope of bell ye have rung to own confusion body have be torn to piece in pipe through bell rope run take warning say leave sacred place in peace spoke more for one of officer fearing effect word might have on superstitious seaman seized by shoulder hustled down long aisle of building through door into street harry roger must not bring to take part in shocking work of desecration be standing distance away surveying scene with disgust when suddenly above bestial shout uproar came cry save yourselves lad run there be time to lose church be on fire run run startled amid work of destruction men paused looked round to see whence voice have come must not discover whereabouts a looked however column of smoke be seen drifting about building issuing from crevice of roof wall evidently alarm be genuine by whomsoever given sailor made for door who have overturned golden figure still clung to booty raising in arm half carried half dragged away with by main force be scene of most utter confusion staggered away overladen with gold silver cup others with costly silk fabric most appealed to erratic taste when nearly be out of building roger friend awoke to fact that be being left alone ran forward to escape while there be time even a turned to go ground seemed to fall from beneath foot plunged down down until struck hard ground below shock causing to lose consciousness chapter sixteen in hand of inquisition must now move forward for period of four month during time many change have occurred when men have escaped from burning cathedral cavendish have mustered in plaza opposite found none missing except roger harry two be great favourite with ship company many willing hand have gone back to bring out of smoking edifice trace of must be found be then thought that might have missed way on road down from fort search be made in direction without success town be then thoroughly searched yet two friend still remained missing eventually therefore cavendish be most reluctantly compelled to sail without many be conjecture a to what fate must possibly have befallen since time cavendish have taken fleet round horn sailed up western coast of spanish south america arriving eventually off coast of peru at callao have received news that plate ship be expected to arrive shortly from manila on way to acapulco in mexico have determined to waylay capture at date to history have now arrived have just intercepted captured off mexican coast taken out of vast treasure finest richest prize have ever be taken before since at point exigency of narrative demand that must be left meanwhile former acquaintance alvarez whom lost sight of at careenage have successfully made way through cuban jungle arriving at port of matanzas with remainder of men have sailed thence to vera cruz in mexico where have received high appointment from viceroy now held de soto have travelled with to mexico for so gallant gentleman have be singularly unfortunate alvarez have found impossible to disabuse mind of idea de soto have cryptogram in possession remembering what have be said by about holy office have brought fact before notice of body repeating de soto remark denouncing a heretic unfortunate man be thereupon seized thrown into prison under direction of villain alvarez dreadfully tortured ostensibly to compel to retract word against inquisition really to enable alvarez to wring from de soto cipher a price of release from prison torture persistent unwavering assertion of de soto that have not paper knew naught of whereabouts be received with incredulity unhappy man be tortured again again to force from disclosure of hiding place supposed burning of cathedral at la guayra have be merely ruse to get rid of spoiler several of priest have hit upon ingenious idea of setting fire to large quantity of damp straw in certain secluded part of building smoke drifting hither thither through interior have caused english to believe that place be indeed on fire have occasioned hasty flight disappearance of harry roger on other hand be purely due to chance have not a might be imagined be brought about by design explanation be simple enough happened that paving of one of aisle have be undergoing repair at time of cavendish attack upon town one of large paving slab be loose harry roger in haste to escape have trodden on causing to tilt have fallen into vault below unconscious body being soon afterwards discovered by priest when latter went to extinguish burning straw upon departure of raider be recognised by priest who have be present in building during spoliation who have uttered warning to sailor hastened to impart good news that two of pirate heretic have fallen into hand thereupon two lad be promptly delivered over to tender mercy of holy office who did with what must ultimate fate be to be delayed until must have be publicly exhibited tortured in town of importance in new spain a example of what must happen must heretic ever again dare to set foot upon sacred territory two poor lad have be branded tortured publicly in plaza at la guayra with refinement of cruelty yet stopped short of permanent injury thence have be sent to mexico to undergo similar treatment in city after be to be returned to la guayra to undergo final punishment of burning alive at auto da fe next meeting with two lad therefore be a sit bowed head on hand in small horribly dirty cell in building of holy inquisition in town of vera cruz in mexico have already be tortured cruelly at la guayra constitution be strong yet unbroken sea voyage from la guayra to vera cruz during have be carefully nursed in preparation for endurance of further torment have done wonder in setting up again to extent indeed that be now almost old self except for recollection of suffering must never forget scar from instrument of torture must remain with for rest of life be first day of imprisonment at vera cruz having only disembarked from ship on same morning have just partaken of scanty meal put into cell by unseen jailer be now occupied with own thought be none of pleasantest a sat upon two low stone served for chair with larger block of stone for table constituted sole furniture of cell cell be like tomb be about ten foot long by eight broad twelve high lit by one small window looked out on to dirty dingy quadrangle surrounded on side by building of holy office unglazed window be barred up with stout iron bar be deeply sunk into wall thickness of be fully four foot much too thick strong for ever to dream of breaking through without aid of tool plenty of time interruption ledge below grating be foul piled high with accumulated filth of year cell wall be damp slimy covered with growth of fungus nourished by hot steamy moisture building be hundred of year old having be aztec temple before spaniard have taken over adapted for present purpose cell door have be of stone in mexican time consisted now of thick solid slab of teak strongly bound with iron stout enough to resist attack of battering ram chancing once to glance upward toward door having heard slight sound outside roger be just in time to catch sight of eye dark shining sinister orb glued to small hole in door have not before noticed be apparently covered when not in use for spying purpose be evident that watch constant strict be to be maintained upon that therefore attempt at escape on part might be ill advised enough to hazard must be discovered at once promptly frustrated in fact appeared that escape be too absolutely hopeless impossible to be thought of seriously a roger glanced up eye vanished leaving with unpleasant sensation of being continually watched be being spied upon harry whispered roger saw eye at door just now indicated place to friend harry rose went toward door a did so both lad caught sound of retreating footstep if have anything suitable replied harry might close up suppose must be quite useless for to do so must only clear out again very likely torture for pain well remarked roger if do here a did at la guayra be always pas food in through trap in wall never enter cell might risk doing see what happens can open hole once more can make plan indeed can do anything while be watched constantly so might try at event at moment a stood gazing at tiny aperture there be slight click at back of turning round quickly saw platter of food jug of water inside cell close against wall of aperture through have be passed must discover trace in dim light even after close careful examination be a thought said roger seems to be custom in spanish prison never to allow prisoner to see speak to anyone even jailer may depend upon that will never have anyone entering cell until come to conduct to torture chamber shuddered recollection associated with word torture be exceedingly unpleasant in case agreed harry will try effect of plugging that hole see what happens first have better take meal while have chance dinner consisted of slab of kind of coarse dark coloured ill flavoured bread bowl of maize meal porridge such a have constituted staple food of native of part of world for century ate food hungry a be found great difficulty in swallowing porridge so exceedingly unpalatable be hunger however provides excellent sauce managed between to finish supply then emptied water pitcher forthwith a be very thirsty now to hit upon good way to stop up villainous spy hole said harry looked around cell for something must answer purpose must see nothing suitable until eye fell upon accumulation of dirt upon window ledge ah have ejaculated roger climbing on harry shoulder reached down handful of dust now mix went on with liquor left from porridge contains good deal of sticky matter will make stuff hold together mixed dirt dust floury water together leaving for time to harden slightly found that mass held fairly firmly together might make reasonably good plug must however wait for darkness roger said harry if put in after dark will not be noticed until morning by time ought to have hardened sufficiently to prevent being pushed out again if be to do now must be noticed when friend spy come round for final look at must doubtless be removed again before have have chance of setting darkness soon fell then two silently carefully pushed in already nearly solid plug of earth have sufficient to fill little opening completely for heard of patter down on to stone floor outside there said harry when have finished if find that before morning must be hard then doubt whether will trouble to bore out again after have set will see be now perfectly dark in cell for even on most brilliant moonlight night light must not reach cell because of high wall round quadrangle outside prevented ray from streaming in being exceedingly tired rather sleepy two friend spread jerkin on block of stone forming table a be far too damp to lie on floor be soon fast asleep in one arm be awakened next morning by sound of trap shutting after morning supply of food have be put in first thought before even glancing at meal be to see if plug have be disturbed to great joy so far a must tell have not be touched upon testing proved to be perfectly hard quite immovable will take little time to get out even if try to do so said roger trust that will not attempt if be at least safe from observation if not from being overheard to be on safe side think must be wisdom on part to converse only in whisper quite agree with there replied harry one never know who may be listening now let turn attention to breakfast see whether have anything different morning from miserable tasteless meal porridge black bread examined food found that time instead of porridge bunch of banana have be provided for rest black bread water be there a before nothing beside however ate heartily of what found finished feeling much refreshed after ever hanging over be black cloud must not forget remembrance of torture through have already passed anticipation of others to follow made further careful examination of cell time by dint of patient search located aperture through food be thrust day be constructed with much skill only by very close inspection must make out small joint indicating position of trap before found vague idea have formed in mind of watching for time when must be opened to pas in meal endeavouring to scramble through before be closed again be hare brained scheme must never have suggested be not for fact that mind have be persistently dwelling upon chance of escape have become so dulled by long confinement that be not now so clear a have be in happier time second glance served to prove to utter futility of attempt at escape by mean a size of opening be insufficient to permit passage of body discovery came a severe disappointment to remained for considerable time sitting on respective stone stool prey to black despair utter hopelessness be aroused from dismal reverie by hearing stealthy footstep approaching door stopped outside by leaning head against wood work listening intently heard slight creaking sound a of wood against wood to now alert sens indicated that watcher be gently pushing back slide concealed spy hole there be then pause lad looked across at one must not forbear smile even in state of misery suspense at idea of spy astonishment disappointment at finding dark when expected to be able to see into cell presently there ensued slight scratching knew that spy be attempting to remove obstruction plug however answered purpose well showed sign of budging then scratching noise began afresh somewhat more loudly a man became impatient of delay dispensed with caution after several ineffectual effort on spy part noise ceased stealthy footstep be heard receding in distance well roger said harry when sound of spy footstep have ceased got better of that time did not ay responded roger gloomily must not expect that matter will rest there will be certain to return drill hole out again make fresh one be sure to be punished in way for what have done by starvation torture be by mean sure that be wise in stopping up spy hole that by doing so have served good purpose oh come now roger old fellow must not think like answered harry now that have seen that know watch may not attempt again must surely not do very much to for little thing like besides be intolerable to think that be being spied upon day long that do say be known there must be absolutely chance whatever of making successful attempt to escape at time if have not closed hole at rate be done now be good worrying over must just wait see what happens if be going to make fresh place of observation punish for what have done will not defer long so to day will in opinion decide matter meanwhile must wait while be unobserved have better make most of time be right harry old friend said roger for part feel much like talking anything else if have something really useful to occupy to pas time must be different a be well what can do well will tell answered harry will wait for little while in order to ascertain whether mean to do anything about matter of closing up spy hole if one come think must not do better than make attempt to translate cryptogram of ours have made many attempt already be true have always got better of then have never until now really have time to spare to attend to properly now must be very good opportunity have plenty of time drag heavily enough god know must serve to make pas if succeed must be able also to effect escape must then be ready to secure treasure without delay for although so far a be aware be only one who know anything about affair delay be dangerous someone might easily even get there before discover treasure by accident one never know what think roger why harry lad said roger brightening up considerably think that be very good idea be surprised that never thought of have better wait little however see what happens before extract paper from jacket want to be taken by surprise word be hardly out of mouth when from somewhere in building evidently distance away came long wailing cry low at first then rising gradually higher higher until became piercing scream scream of man in mortal agony long drawn shriek continued for moment then died down again to low moaning sound then rose again changed into series of short yapping cry of anguish almost like barking of dog then ceased what on earth be that harry ejaculated roger looking at friend on whose forehead cold perspiration be now standing in bead what awful sound be afraid friend replied harry that mean that poor mortal be undergoing torture almost greater than can bear what devil inquisitor be if must be at head of few hundred english seaman at moment must not pull place of torture about ear must not put few of to torture just to teach by experience what feel like a warning to rest god help poor wretch whoever may be what fearful awful sound be be getting dreadful went on a shrill blood curdling scream broke on ear quavering a be with extremity of fearful agony yet not quite so loud a before a though unfortunate individual be losing strength to be imprisoned here not to be able to do anything to help poor fellow oh be fiend in human shape cried roger stamping foot on ground in impotent fury then came sound made lad start look apprehensively at other be noise of footstep approaching down long passage at end of own cell be situated chapter seventeen in torture chamber of vera cruz lad felt heart stop beating cold chill seized body a heard footstep pas other cell door without pausing continue down passage towards own dreadful cry still rang in ear felt that if approaching person be coming to conduct also to torture must not bear be still must be remembered only lad sound of cry of agony have racked nerve a might of much older men more than knew felt very hair rising on scalp sensation of deadly sickness faintness swept over harry be first to recover presence of mind spoke to roger come come roger lad said pull together friend if be indeed coming for must make up mind to endure a best can even a have done before perchance be mistaken intend to torture at roger came out of dismal reverie of foreboding face became once more immobile few heartbeat be a well prepared a harry for what might happen once for moment footstep paused heart gave great bound of thankfulness messenger then be not coming for after sensation of relief however be of brief duration after pause lasting few moment inexorable footstep resumed approach once more nearer nearer came toward door of last cell roger harry glanced at one rose from respective stool stood upright facing door have just time to give other firm reassuring hand clasp when key grated in rusty lock outside bolt be slipped back with grinding noise door creaked open on hinge disclosing against semi darkness of long corridor form of man robed from head to foot in black even head face be invisible covered by kind of black cloth helmet terminating in peak with two slit cut in for eye through slit must discern pair of fiery orb shining like of cat in darkness looking full at a though to read inmost thought if mysterious visitor anticipated seeing sign of alarm on lad face be disappointed for two stood up facing gave back glance for glance just for single instant same thought leapt through brain why not make rush knock dark visitant down stun attempt to find way out of building before aught be discovered indeed exchanged glance at instant seemed however a though masked man read thought for stepping to one side of door pointed silently down corridor there saw what at first have not observed namely file of similarly masked figure on side of passage standing against wall with naked sword in hand be of use escape way be on face of hopeless masked messenger read expression on boy face a looked must have sworn that cruel smile lurked behind black mask then came voice from figure in pure english without trace of foreign accent be required to attend scene of punishment be order of grand inquisitor be required to witness a earnest of what yourselves will undergo here must be foolish enough to disobey in way attempt to thwart wish design of holy inquisition here crossed warning be seldom given to heretic so accept one a be meant for own good tell now follow be careful that make attempt at escape for be absolutely impossible for to succeed must bring heavy punishment on yourselves above see hear keep still tongue in head presume to speak to anyone where be going if obey implicitly may be that will be leniently dealt with masked man turned beckoning over shoulder for to follow then preceded up passage be great deal relieved to find that be not to be time tortured knew only too well what punishment be that be to witness felt heart sicken within knew that advice have just received be good resolved if possible to abide by therefore followed leader along corridor in silence while masked men with sword fell in behind a soon a have passed effectually preventing attempt on part at escape up passage went reached end of then turned to right afterwards climbing up long flight of step brought to long passage much wider than one leading to own cell be also covered with kind of matting several door opened into corridor along corridor went came presently to large door through passed finding in large lofty room be somewhat dark after light through have just passed must not for few moment discern object contained therein then a eye became more accustomed to half light perceived hanging on wall strange instrument of iron wood in different place in apartment be standing curious looking machine use of must only imagine with shudder door through have just entered be closed locked turning round two friend saw that masked guard have vanished a also have guide who have conducted thither chamber be tenanted by several funereal figure in black with face hidden whose movement even seemed to suggest something horrible repulsive in silence one of masked figure took down instrument from wall walked to opposite end of room where stood group of men in black with cowled head lad watched a if fascinated with inward feeling that something dreadful be about to occur must perceive certain dim outline of something looked like framework of timber complete shape be hidden from by figure of who be standing in between masked men appeared to boy to be waiting for something someone before proceeded with whatever be preparing to do a stood there frozen into rigidity silence by dreadful indefinable sensation of horror heard fluttering sigh coming from opposite end of room apparently from somewhere near mysterious framework sigh faint at first suddenly changed into most fearful sound something between moan noise man make when breath be suddenly driven from body sound be so full of horror that felt blood literally curdle within be more terrifying because must not tell who what be that produced in spite of moved few step nearer then sight met eye turned sick what have taken for wooden framework be indeed framework one for terrible use consisted of four piece of timber merely two long two short be fastened together in form of rectangle thus producing article somewhat resembling bed frame only rather narrower wood work be much more massive two iron ring be fixed in centre of of short piece to of be attached stout strap of raw hide there stretched upon framework supported in position solely by hand ankle around be fastened raw hide strip attached to ring lay figure of man body be perfectly naked a boy looked unable to turn eye away through sheer horror at sight held a though fascinated group of cowled men separated seizing lad pushed forward until stood close to framework have full view of whole dreadful scene voice behind uttered word look take warning be very doubtful whether harry roger heard word brain seemed paralysed by sight met eye figure be that of man evidently in prime of life leg be stretched so far apart by framework that be extraordinary that flesh blood must endure strain still hang together arm be also stretched out above man head to extent that seemed to be literally parting from poor body at shoulder muscle have started up seemed to be bursting through skin flesh be stretched so tightly over bone that seemed skeleton rather than human living body upon gazed be not sight of living breathing sentient human body strained stretched to point of being torn asunder excited lad commiseration horror caused inwardly to register solemn awful vow of vengeance upon human fiend around must opportunity ever arise terrible a be that sight there be others horror that only most debased cruel imagination must possibly invent to pen must possibly do justice even be good purpose to be achieved by attempted recital of caused lad soul to revolt at once for ever against people must perpetrate such diabolical cruelty deep groan issued from lip of hapless sufferer opened eye have until now be closed then saw that certain suspicion that for moment have be growing in mind be too well founded yes yes oh horror be de soto noble brave chivalrous spaniard whom have last seen retiring with rest of prisoner into depth of jungle of cuba harry uttered little cry swaying for moment fell heavily into arm of roger who laid gently on stone floor at one of cowled inquisitor stepped forward at moment door opened man entered clad in rich costly vestment identity unconcealed in way by cowl cloak roger looked up must scarcely credit sens where where have seen that sinister evil countenance before a looked so did man who have just entered look at roger new light dawning in evil eye then roger recognised man have seen before be alvarez new comer spoke in spanish have man yet confessed one of masked men replied excellency have not a yet hope that during next torture will speak be now only just recovering from last continue then commanded alvarez first remove two boy to cell charge on life to see that escape not for of whom have ever wished to have in power wanted that one most pointing to roger therefore keep safe keep of safe for will require soon chapter eighteen translation of cryptogram in obedience to command of alvarez two of black cloaked men seized roger of taking by arm led back to cell whilst two more followed with unconscious body of poor harry when arrived in cell men who be carrying harry body simply flung down on stone table with careless violence then without glancing back left apartment closing door locked bolted again on outside roger first thought be for friend whose head have be badly cut owing to force with have be flung on stone table instinctively glanced round cell eye fell upon jug of water with food have be placed there during visit to torture chamber with exclamation of thankfulness seized upon jug stripping off doublet tore away sleeve of undershirt then dipping that in water bound round head of friend over jagged gash sensation of cold produced by soaking bandage restored harry to consciousness heaving sigh opened eye then memory returned gave great shudder a remembered awful scene upon have gazed short time since wandering eye caught sight of roger familiar form called friend to roger assisted to foot harry quickly recovered said that felt rather sick faint after what have seen head be aching rather badly oh roger what fiend in human shape be men exclaimed cut slash burn living body of fellow men until lose semblance of human being surely judgment from heaven will day fall upon for committing such awful deed ay doubtless will though not perhaps in world answered roger now if must find mr cavendish let know what be going on here march up with hundred two of lad from fleet must ourselves visit such judgment upon a must leave room for other harry have somewhat to tell dear lad after have fainted at sight of poor de soto man came in recognised ordered to be taken back here a must require in future that man be alvarez see now suspect de soto of possessing cryptogram have tortured to make confess whereabouts de soto not having can not say where be now be on gloria del mundo before sank know whether alvarez saw did honour of desiring to slay a lay helpless before left ship be frustrated in humane desire however knowing that escaped after from gloria suspicious mind will almost certainly jump to conclusion have paper seeing that de soto have persistently despite most frightful torture evidently denied knowledge of can see that something of kind be in thought because of stringent command for to be kept safe a will require in future ' so know what to look forward to friend if can not make escape same sort of torture a through poor de soto have just passed will be ours god help now what counsel have to offer under circumstance well friend answered harry must say that best plan must be to endeavour to translate cryptogram commit meaning to memory then destroy paper then if be asked for can say that have not allow to search a proof that what say be true also if alvarez find that paper be really not in hand if in addition to that tell that know not where be perhaps may avoid being tortured to make confess hiding place for be sure that poor de soto be tortured for other reason than alvarez thought have cryptogram wished to make confess where be that advice to roger sooner set about trying to translate that cipher sooner will finish be able to destroy safer will be how fortunate be that have not decided to bore out that spy hole again will now be able to work at paper without danger of being seen let then start on matter at once replied roger a food have only recently be brought to will not be interrupted again for hour unless of course alvarez must send for think will want to question to day have not yet finished with poor wretch de soto now harry just rip up seam of jerkin get paper out let start business at once harry took out knife strangely enough have be permitted to retain carefully cutting stitch removed paper unfolded laid open upon stone table then lad leant over document concentrated energy on task before first of said roger what language be most likely to be written in jose leirya be spaniard be true from what must gather from man william evans about whom told crew be invariably made up for most part of englishman so be reasonable to assume that english must be language must have to employ on board ship have be sailing high sea a pirate for good many year so one must imagine that at time when wrote that cipher must know probably more english than spanish what therefore more natural than that must write secret in english at rate think must not be far wrong in assuming that be written in english so will take for granted that such be case if find that be wrong will try other language say spanish language be not important be finding what sign letter figure stand for will be difficulty now let have look at paper there be first line of figure let take first see what can make of must say that first number standing a be by be year in be written be to say year now observe that figure be in group of four will say that figure represents letter be not very likely a not word must possibly consist of four letter might be initial letter of certain word giving sufficient of word to enable one to guess rest now there be letter in alphabet taking a being b a c a so on up to z a let apply to cipher by doing with first group get b b b g if take figure in group of two v something else there be letter corresponding to number so hypothesis fails again b b b g be whole word even beginning of one evidently therefore be not right in surmise now let add together first second pair of figure in group for be only by testing possible combination of exasperating figure that will arrive at meaning by doing get correspond to d now that look more promising so let take next group added make corresponding to j give d j again harry doe not seem to mean very much doe replied harry certainly doe not still let go on may make something out of yet next group be make j j next group make h d now let put together by doing so get d j j h d certainly doe not look like language can make word out of letter whichever way arrange so seems that be wrong again in method never mind friend said roger let still go on will not do to be discouraged so soon there certainly be translation to mass of figure feel certain be determined to find now how can go about next have let take group a representing one letter instead of two four a did before what will then get now have for first line representing in letter m s t l k l m s again conveys meaning can word be formed whichever way arrange letter now instead of adding figure separately let add set of two be then so on see what get then objected harry if do that will get number have corresponding letter mean that by doing a suggest must have number corresponding to letter only go up a far a stand for z so that method can not be right seems to that thing be beyond roger see what can make of such awful jumble of figure gently lad gently remonstrated roger will not give up may a well be worrying over cryptogram a doing nothing better because help to pas time keep thought from from other thing ended rather lamely for few moment remained silent cogitating do what must to distract mind from dwelling upon ghastly scene in torture chamber picture be constantly intruding upon imagination must forget ominous word of alvarez when instructed guard to keep safely a must require in future after little time spent in dreary form of reverie roger started up once more come harry said be of use for to give way to miserable foreboding let get back to cipher again will keep from thinking besides may not have such favourable opportunity in future harry did not reply dismissed gloomy thought though evidently with effort once again two leant over precious paper cudgelled brain in effort to find proper translation now resumed roger seems to that may possibly be on correct track after with last grouping of figure be to say adding first two last two figure in group to one getting certain number look to more likely than of other method tried confess that be unable to see answered harry have already ascertained that by method get first of number a remarked have letter corresponding to number agree with there replied roger how be to know that jose selected number for letter for letter b so on be not very likely that must a method of procedure must make solving of cipher fairly easy matter must have translated by now be much more likely that took other number for letter say number rather than harry retorted well in case be just a far off solution a at first for how can possibly tell except by experiment what number correspond to right letter must take week to discover by method agree with that certainly must be very considerable time in arriving at solution if tried to do simply by experiment said roger propose to set about in way now think harry what letter occurs most frequently in english tongue well replied friend have never given thought to matter so must say immediately must say that letter occurs a often a certainly doe often occur a say agreed roger letter e occurs more often than other letter knowing be going to look for number occurs most often in cipher feel sure that number will be found to correspond to letter e provided always of course that cryptogram be written in english bravo roger shouted harry well thought of now must never have hit upon method if have be worrying at thing for ever s s sh roger whispered be quiet man do want to bring spy jailer upon for assuredly will if make much of row be sorry said harry for moment have forgotten where be felt so sure that have hit upon right method of translating cipher shouted without thinking roger interrupted friend speak for few moment even then thought caught sound of person outside door pray heaven that may not come into cell two listened most intently for minute with ear pressed up against wall door caught sound from outside so after waiting little time longer to make perfectly certain returned to task in hand now let go on where left off just now harry suggested say that want to find out number occurs most often in cryptogram allow to represent e be so replied roger now let have look through again counted up presently harry who have finished first exclaimed time in carefully lowered voice well number occurs oftener than other be if be adding first two last two figure of group together wait moment said roger still busily counting then after pause added yes be right number doe occur most frequently can be sure take a representing letter e now going upon assumption will be represented by b by c by d by so on now believe that have translation in own hand let make experiment ought to write down a go along else will forget part of perhaps ay there be difficulty said harry have writing material nothing can use instead of not so fast not so fast lad friend replied be difficulty must find mean to overcome let have look round first see if there be anything that can use for pen if can find such thing ink will be easy matter afterwards indeed exclaimed harry incredulously pray explain how in world be going to get supply of ink never mind retorted roger with quiet smile leave to get something will serve for pen will find ink quickly enough seeing that roger be not going to divulge secret of ink harry joined in search of cell looking for something must answer purpose just at moment there be click turning quickly round perceived that meal have be pushed in through trap door will leave for time said roger intent upon search food can wait can not delay with what be now doing for can never know when may be interrupted harry agreed search proceeded without very conspicuous success few fragment of straw quantity of woolly dust few tiny splinter of wood small extremely rusty nail be rewarded ah ejaculated harry have forgotten that window sill there be more likely to be something in accumulation of stuff up there than in cell come stand below so that can mount on shoulder roger then can rake about there see if can find anything for purpose now come to think of have never yet have look out of window can only see high wall there may be something to interest below there in courtyard whatever may be roger moved quickly to other end of cell standing below grated opening allowed harry to clamber up body finally to stand upon shoulder harry then grasped bar of grating to take of pressure off friend back began to burrow in heap of dust rubbish have accumulated for year upon year on sill suddenly roger heard name whispered softly roger roger roger became aware of fact that harry be hurriedly preparing to descend from perch roger eased friend to floor then asked what be matter why said harry there be man below who appears to be waiting there for definite purpose when saw at window began to make sign unfortunately must not understand then held out hand a though to catch something expected to throw out can not make out at what be want have better have look roger yes answered roger let get on shoulder at once harry may be important matter perchance may be someone who be willing to help to escape wish to communicate with harry immediately helped chum up to own former position roger stood there for considerable time looking out then whispered to harry to let descend well did see enquired harry when roger have got down yes replied roger just caught glimpse of a vanished seemed to be ragged sort of fellow so far a must make out wish have remained little longer suspect that something must have alarmed so caused to move away wonder what be wanted be certain that be to be making sign quite certain harry answered be looking directly at when saw that have noticed a said held out hand so a though to catch something be to throw out what must have wanted to give there be nothing in cell must fling to except meal by way have not yet touched wonder if expected to write anything throw out to see how must expect said roger if have not chanced to look out must never have be aware that be there so why must have anything to write to individual of whose existence be unaware until few moment ago true responded harry can not make out at did notice way went yes answered roger did notice that know that court below be enclosed by four wall of building well there be small gateway on right hand side looking from here in wall directly opposite be just in time to see vanish through that may be that will return again however if be really person who be anxious to assist to escape can not imagine that must be other will be sure to come back a soon a be safe for to do so must confess that can not understand why seemed to be waiting for message if have be trying to get paper message to must have be different matter for first arrangement for escape must come from outside not from must hing without first learning what arrangement can be made by supposititious friend outside left to ourselves can contrive plan of escape man have disappeared for time being can do naught until get into communication with so let get on with cipher have found something will do nicely for pen while be standing on shoulder after mysterious man have gone have look among stuff on window sill be lucky enough to find feather have be long time there judging by appearance must have be dropped by bird by time be doubtless dead must say that other prisoner be once in habit of feeding bird from grating probably be one of dropped feather will be of so much service to can cut into pen will now tell where can find ink just take knife of yours make small cut in arm there be plenty of ink for although be red doe not matter with knife roger then carefully trimmed quill of small feather down into fairly effective pen then turned attention once more to cipher harry who for time past have be feeling pang of hunger rather severely remonstrated with friend look here roger said let eat dinner before going on with translation be feeling very hungry friend replied roger there be time like present for aught know may never have opportunity to work on cryptogram food can wait will relish more when have time to eat let get finished with matter first harry saw wisdom of chum remark casting one more longing glance at food rejoined roger at stone table lad began to pore over paper again now remarked roger will notice that line of figure be far enough apart to allow to write letter corresponding to group of directly underneath will be great help to will write nothing until be quite certain that have hit upon correct method of solving cryptogram will remember harry that by going over figure deduced that number represented letter e will notice that number be made up of many different group of two figure such a so forth fancy be only done to make solving of cipher more difficult now assuming letter to be b to be c to be d to be e a have reckoned let apply method to figure see what get have already surmised that number stand for particular letter be really what seems most likely to be be year in cryptogram be invented written besides added according to system be now employing must make number have letter corresponding to now take first group of figure be divided into two group of two figure added to one a intend to proceed make now what letter corresponds to number find that letter doe take next group be resolve into h be letter belonging to figure from get letter from come letter s now see harry that by method have already got english word from that must seem that be at last on right track for translating cryptogram from next two group get word be from following three word think now harry that may begin write down translation a go along for feel sure that be right at last must be more than mere coincidence if word be ' be not part of connected intelligible whole so just hand that knife harry boy will produce necessary ink harry did a be requested taking weapon roger made small sufficiently deep incision in left arm to produce necessary amount of blood for ink dipping improvised pen in own blood roger began to write under group of figure letter corresponded to prompted by harry be not long ere have whole translation written down when be completed wiped blood off arm hid pen in lining of jerkin then with much satisfaction read out true meaning of cryptogram have held for so long time in possession alvarez must have sold soul to secure ran a follows be key to treasure of jose leirya treasure be of ' be here understood suppose put in roger great worth be of jewel most part of much price taken by in south sea many emerald took from prince of mejico much gold also buried deep hole under stone iron ring cave lonely inlet degree west degree north north east end island cuba stone pace mouth pace right wall entering there said roger in tone of exultation what do say to method now harry now have treasure in power rather when get free once more yes agreed harry always providing that someone else have not got there before be not at likely answered roger be almost certain that other be only two copy of cryptogram now in existence a soon a have learned by heart translation will destroy paper then nobody will ever come at except by accident be most unlikely why harry continued in excited tone lonely inlet must mean that very identical bay where careened ship where savage attacked just imagine may actually have walked over spot where treasure lie buried see say hole under stone iron ring cave ' may have be very cave that be in when native besieged be rescued by sailor saw iron ring anywhere in did harry answered harry did not that stand for nothing for there might have be hundred stone iron ring in very cave on occasion must never have noticed be otherwise much too fully occupied concluded with smile remember now continued roger old cary told yarn about jose leirya too be present by way night after reached bay said that pirate be known to have frequented part be supposed to have hidden of treasure somewhere about there thought be only old sailor yarn at time remember seems to have be perfectly true yes agreed harry must not reckon on treasure too much if be roger remember be in prison may be for rest of life unless mysterious man saw just now must really be friend who wish to assist to escape besides be sure that alvarez have suspicion that know something about paper can not forget sinister meaning of word when said that must require later know only too well what will happen when time come if must treat a did poor de soto well must never touch that hoard roger heaven preserve from fate like roger ejaculated must give up hope of securing wealth to avoid being tortured a be must not let alvarez know where be even to save from agony must inflict upon must endure even death rather than tell villain that cruel inhuman scoundrel where treasure be for know quite well how must use money might be able to lay hand upon wo talk about may happen alvarez will never know through what say harry be with there roger lad replied too swear will never divulge secret to alvarez whatever may do excuse friend said that after business with paper have be got through with must have dinner a said once before be hungry so come let fall to wait one moment said roger do think know translation by heart thoroughly for have committed to memory if have done same will destroy a be much too dangerous document to keep about now that have incurred suspicion of fiend alvarez yes answered harry know perfectly repeated to friend paper be then at once torn up into most minute particle be on point of throwing out of window refrained not so much because of danger that might be pieced together again a that might attract attention of anybody who chanced to be about at time after while however found deep crack between cell wall floor partly concealed by slime dirt into crack pushed remnant of cryptogram then hid small aperture again by covering with more dirt scraped from cell floor thus hidden be exceedingly unlikely that anybody must ever find piece unless exact spot be pointed out to two lad then turned with much lightened heart to meal be placed upon stone table began to share between there be bunch of banana time delicacy have received once before roger took up to count divide fruit when exclaimed why whatever be what asked harry look at rejoined roger holding something in finger be piece of paper have be skilfully hidden in fruit on few line of writing be to be seen chapter nineteen help from unexpected quarter plan made for escape with wildly beating heart with further thought for food be tumbled unceremoniously on to floor lad tore open folded paper eagerly scanned content ran a follows to two englishman at present imprisoned in inquisition at vera cruz be known through city here that man alvarez who call governor of town viceroy of province intends to have burnt alive at auto da fe in plaza five day from now be intended that must be exhibited tortured in public here sent back to la guayra for final execution news have come that countryman cavendish have captured plate fleet of nineteen ship near acapulco populace demand that must be sacrificed in revenge to alvarez have consented unless can escape before expiry of five day be doomed there be one chance for if can take be here to assist can trust implicitly be english sailor who be made to renounce religion through torture be now in service here have not forgotten country to escape must contrive to lower thin cord from window thinner better so can communicate with send small article to leave cord hanging from window at midnight on third night from now without fail can hing until then have contrived to get message concealed in food on one occasion will never be able to do so again so must somehow manage to lower to ground thin cord of told without can not aid will wait here for time so that can throw down note saying have received message say more besides that if hear from now will return on third night cord must be in place by then for present farewell from true friend be long message man who wrote have done so in such small letter that occupied little space so small indeed be writing that be a much a must do to decipher when have finishing reading remarkable communication lad looked at other for moment in utter amazement suddenly roger ejaculated ah of course now have harry man that saw waiting below window be person who wrote be waiting for answer a said in note be why seemed to expect to throw something why why did not think of looking sooner of course expected nothing of kind anyhow say will return on third night from now where harry be going to get cord that want to hang from window escape hinge upon getting yet where be to come from be utterly impossible for to get hold of cord line of sort so far a can see wonder who fellow be can trust well replied harry saw what wrote in message in five day from now unless can meanwhile escape be doomed to die awful death man must must say have object in betraying because if be already sentenced to death need excuse for executing see what man have to gain by deceiving roger think man be genuine enough in case if be to suffer death may a well die in attempt to escape a wait here for death to come to be not so friend perhaps have better put off further discussion of until have eaten food if when come to put in next supply find still uneaten may suspect that something be amiss remove to cell even separate of happening must put end for good to chance of escape besides can talk a be eating come roger wake up man fall to eat a much a can for will need strength to go through with what be before roger saw wisdom of harry argument replacing food on table whence have fallen in eagerness to read message set to very soon demolished whole of replacing platter a usual when have finished by side of trap to be removed when next meal be put in now remarked harry let resume discussion of strange business roger so far a can see matter stand hullo what be did hear that roger suddenly interjected yes replied roger did what can be wonder there have come slight sound from direction of grating a of hard substance striking against iron bar lad hurried to grating glanced up at must see nothing to account for sound be most remarkable said harry heard sound quite plainly be just like two piece of iron striking together sounded in cell just outside grating jump up on shoulder again roger see if can see anything anybody about harry bent back helped roger to climb up on shoulder roger have just drawn upright with face reaching to level of grating when uttered suppressed exclamation half fell half slid down to floor from perch started vigorously rubbing cheek be matter with roger ejaculated harry somewhat crossly nearly broke back coming down like then a saw roger rubbing face tone changed enquired anxiously what be old fellow be hurt not much that be rejoined friend just a got head up level with grating be going to look out something hit on cheek with considerable force losing balance came tumbling down be sorry if hurt harry old lad a finished speaking caught sound of quick stealthy footstep retreating across courtyard below retiring so far a must judge by sound through gateway by writer of message have disappeared have said harry someone have be below window again wonder what be time be that struck roger must tell answered roger know only that something hit hard on cheek thought for moment that eye be struck have not least idea what must have be must suggested harry have be that fellow whom saw morning come back again with message be trying to attract attention think can not say answered roger certainly heard footstep disappearing just now did not yes did answered harry did not attach very much significance to matter until individual have gone well know what be have time to waste so let give whole attention to matter of message have got paper well when have finished with have better hide away somewhere safely better still destroy altogether for never know when may be searched may take into head to do so at moment ay will do so agreed roger a say be safer go on with what be about to say before interruption came well resumed harry a be saying seems to stand like alvarez must appear have doomed to die at auto da fe five day hence in order to satisfy demand of people of town for revenge desire for have be aroused by capture by mr cavendish of plate fleet off acapulco fact be known by everybody in town consequently have come to ear of man who say be english sailor must say that be probably man one of very few that don have ever taken captured during action tortured to make recant apparently did so in order to spare further pain a men have done on several occasion be now possibly serving man something of kind in employ of spanish grandee have not forgotten fact that be englishman hearing that two of fellow countryman be to be put to painful death at auto da fe in plaza in five day time have made up mind to save life if possible if successful must say that will try to get away with at very considerable risk doubtless with great difficulty have be able to get one message to will not be able to do so again so wish to procure piece of cord thin enough to escape easy detection hang from window so that can communicate with a may be necessary so that can perhaps send up to certain small article for reason can not come again until three day hence when will be waiting below grating at midnight for to lower line to when may expect message probably instruction what to do so that may escape why can not come until midnight on third night can not guess evidently there be something very weighty important to prevent doing so otherwise knowing that there be five day altogether before execution must commence at once to arrange for escape without losing time for delay of three day now may make difference whether be to live die learn from letter opinion be that must just trust man hope that will be able to succeed in effort for until hear again from a to what wish to do to assist can hing absolutely nothing now first difficulty confronts be matter of line of speaks without tell escape be impossible how in world can secure rope cord of sort never even see jailer much le talk to so that have opportunity of attempting to bribe be most unlikely that must do so even if must speak to there be nothing in cell that can possibly turn to account so see at what can do seems very hard to lose life just because be at loss for small thing like piece of cord rope for own part said roger wonder somewhat why man did not make suggestion a to how might secure such thing surely must know that be utterly impossible for to procure anything of kind in prison wonder now whether be not whose footstep heard in yard little time ago what why harry what if thing hit in face must be message wrapped round something to make carry up to window roger exclaimed harry in great jubilation believe have hit upon very thing man said must not get message conveyed for cord be not in position so that can send anything up by what more likely than that must try to throw note up to through bar in fact be only way let look at once must have fallen somewhere in cell must say since struck in face fact show that came between bar must hardly rebound outside again in now fast failing light lad dropped on hand knee began feverish search for what might very easily make difference to between living dying horrible painful death hound round fast darkening cell crawled not sign of anything must find until harry who be searching corner where faint light from grating must not reach suddenly placed hand upon something hard rolled under pressure clasping tight in fist rushed to grating looked at article yes sure enough be piece of paper wrapped round pebble softly called roger to side opening folded missive began to read a read face became several shade paler heart beat thickly note ran a follows waited for time below window in hope that must drop answer from to first letter found be being watched have therefore to leave how will get present note to know if nobody be about will wrap round stone try to throw through window be to tell that alvarez have decided to advance day for execution will take place on day after to morrow therefore must act at once be in great danger through attempt to help if date have not be altered must not have come until third night from now there be time to lose so must endeavour to come to to night may be discovered must risk that now attend well to what be going to write at midnight to night instead of three night hence will be here underneath window must at cost let down thin cord effort will be vain will then attach to cord several small file saw of fine temper if line be not strong enough to bear weight will tie light line will bring with to yours will then haul that up first making fast end can then pull up thing will bring if have more news then will also send up letter to with file saw must cut away bar of grating except one will leave room for to climb through one bar must be left to secure stout rope to so that may slide down work of cutting bar will take to morrow so after visit to night will not come again until time arrives for to make escape be very careful to work silently will be discovered for spy be everywhere when bar be cut put back in place so that if anyone enters cell will not notice change for first line to lower down to unravel hose under jerkin garment can spare without being noticed will give long thin line to end of must secure light weight to prevent from blowing about now until to night farewell will be there at midnight exactly must be quite ready make mistake for be only chance mistake will mean loss of life a well a own ended letter roger immediately took from harry hand concealed with first missive in lining of jerkin now harry said must act at once for a fellow say there be time to lose will take time have left before darkness set in to unravel garment to form line will send up several file say in letter now if can put two stool one on top of other will be able to stand on work together be fortunate thing a will take long time to cut bar so thick be hope noise will not be heard through wall draw attention of jailer must be a silent a can risk rest be more glad than ever now that closed up that spy hole for have not done so must certainly have be discovered already now harry have best begin on under jerkin of mine absence of will not be noticed if keep doublet buttoned well up over begin at one end will start at other corner so that if be pressed for time can break thread off join yours mine together have twice length must get otherwise roger stripped jerkin off replaced doublet set to work by time daylight have nearly gone a fortune must have full moon rode high in sky one shaft of light filtered in through barred window court below however be in darkness a wall be so high that moonbeam never struck lower than about half way down in small patch of light then two lad worked for life when began task considered that about three hour must suffice to complete work a time passed however seemed to a though finger be made of lead so slow did appear to move to lad excited imagination yard by yard silk became unravelled be rolled carefully round roger finger so that when time came there might be hitch in paying out yard that unravelled seemed to take hour in process so occupied be that be few moment before became aware that at least two small pebble have be thrown through window then only noticed because one of stone happened to fall directly upon remnant of garment upon be employed roger roger there be whispered harry in great excitement quick quick unwind silk from finger where can find anything to tie on end for weight added roger unwound silk a fast a knew how harry desperately searched nook cranny of cell for something to secure to end have said roger in low tone a finished unwinding silk coiled carefully on stone table so that might run free without being entangled have will secure knife to end harry will bear that weight must say can haul up again when stouter line be attached very well answered harry producing article in question be soon tied firmly to end of unravelled silk two stool be then dragged to window on roger mounted whilst harry handed up knife with silk tied to god grant that line may bear weight said roger to a took apparatus from harry then leant forward extended arm so far that person standing below must be able to see in moonlight although person in courtyard must be hidden in shadow cast by high wall of prison allowed hand to remain for few moment shining white in moonlight in order to signify to man below be in readiness be prepared to let down line a if in answer small pebble came clattering against wall just below grating roger heart stood still for moment with deadly fear lest unwelcome listener might be about there be sign of such being case lad lowered carefully away until felt knife ground few second later felt gentle vibration of silk a man below fastened something to then came three light pull on line roger rightly took for signal to haul up immediately did so hauled away with utmost care for knew that very life depended upon when have hauled in own line found attached to cord of stouter proportion capable of sustaining very much heavier burden to be on safe side at once secured end of second line to bar of grating in case must slip through finger handed silken line to harry asking to re coil for use again must be required then gave three light tug to line at end a signal that be ready for next operation immediately have done so gentle movement of line began again be followed directly afterward by three signal pull stronger one time up came cord time be evident that there be something quite heavy at other end roger pulled up quickly presently dark bundle made appearance at window grasped carefully handed to harry who placed upon cell table then cord be sent down once more there be longer pause time roger be on point of pulling up cord thinking that unknown friend have finished part of business when three pull came again roger once more hoisted away on line be not so heavy on occasion on taking in through window found that harry knife piece of paper be only article be attached surmised therefore that nothing else be to be sent up read missive before sending down cord again be short to point time ran thus be writing in courtyard below have sent up necessary tool so need not lower cord again to night rest with now to cut bar must be done by midnight to morrow night will be in vain will be here again then will send up rope thick enough to bear weight must climb down will be at bottom to receive guide to safety till to morrow farewell when have be read be placed together with other two missive in lining of roger doublet now harry lad latter whispered quick let see what there be in bundle then set to work at once sleep to night lad when next sleep will either be out of clutch of inquisition will be sleeping last long sleep of chapter twenty how roger effected escape on opening bundle be found to contain three file very thin extremely sharp of wonderful temper there be also two small saw with handle to bottle of very thick oil to make saw file cut faster also to prevent that harsh squeaking sound usually arises when steel cut against steel two lad in eagerness snatched tool from leather bag replacing stool one above other mounted began to work swiftly silently must remember roger whispered harry that will have to listen very carefully for footstep coming along passage hide tool somewhere at first sound of course if be seen working here if tool be discovered might just a well give up at once for there must be hope left be right friend answered roger intend that anybody will catch at work will catch sight of tool at first sound of person approaching must jump down for life remove stool sit down pretend to be asleep will wrap tool up quickly in bag slip into jerkin if be summoned from cell be likely to be searched will endeavour a go to drop parcel behind door where can not be seen unless someone enters cell deliberately look behind door be not very likely unless suspect of having got hold of tool now remember what say more talk now harry will require breath for working slaved away with file saw never ceasing work for moment until muscle utterly refused to allow tired arm to make movement then rested for moment to recover harry roger worked on separate bar of grating so equal have be effort that lad bar be cut through at same time there go two nail drawn from coffin roger said harry attacked second bar with energy born of deserved success roger uttered word saved breath put ounce of strength into arm cutting away with file saw like very madman a bar be cut out be laid carefully on sill in front of so a to be at hand for replacement directly suspicious sound be heard night long worked with such will soon after daybreak next morning two bar remained to be cut through a usual hour two after dawn heard click of trap a food be placed in cell startled only for moment for have not overlooked fact that food be due to arrive moreover knew that aperture be so small that there be just room to pas small platter through that even if jailer must attempt to spy on window be beyond range of vision sound however recalled fact to mind that be very hungry that if wished to keep up strength must eat a harry said have done good work during night so that must spare time tool be therefore packed up hidden away bar already cut be replaced so that anybody chancing to look in must notice nothing out of ordinary then stool be removed from below window lad sat down to morning meal with keener appetite than have known for month past everything in cell presented usual appearance twain be hastily finishing meal when tramp of foot be heard in passage quiet stealthy footstep time clatter of several approaching men there be mistaking roger harry looked at one dismay written over countenance what be to happen now have hour for execution be advanced again be to be led out to death at once be cell to be changed labour rendered useless chance of escape destroyed at very last moment hundred other surmise chased other rapidly through lad mind a listened with bated breath to noise of approaching footstep however pulled together by time that cell door be opened lad presented absolutely expressionless face to enemy door clanged open disclosing to sight number of men in black robe cowl excellency viceroy requires attendance of said one of masked inquisitor in deep voice in remarkably good english follow at once man turned to lead way harry followed close on heel a roger prepared to leave cell pretended to stumble when picking up adroitly deposited little satchel of tool behind open door action be much relieved to notice attracted attention have satisfaction of seeing cell door closed after of knowing therefore that precious implement be safe for time being be led through self same passage corridor by have walked to torture chamber few day before heart sank within for second journey seemed to ominous of evil yes be too true in few minute reached door of chamber of horror passed through heard shut after found once more in presence of arch fiend alvarez viceroy of province governor of city chief of holy inquisition in town of

nearly mad with disappointment in spite of have inward conviction that what harry said be true do what might must never again set eye on paper possession of so earnestly desired revenge however sweet revenge still remained that must must have have worked up to pitch of fury very closely approached madness moreover bitter disappointment demanded alleviation through suffering of who have inflicted

turn next may a well know what be in store for have have laughed again with sardonic fury lad struggled desperately in grip of black cowled inquisitor struggle be fruitless in few minute harry be lying on floor bound while roger be tied in upright position to one of pillar of chamber in fashion do a must must not avoid witnessing torture be to be executed upon body of dear friend bosom companion from boyhood upwards at last moment roger must have intervened to save harry actually offering to yield up coveted secret if alvarez must relent latter refused lust of blood be aroused passion for witnessing agony of others must be satiated at cost moreover be not roger in power must compel lad to witness friend suffering give night wherein to dwell upon next morning first wring secret from under threat of torture afterwards be unnecessary to harrow feeling of reader with description of what next took place in ghastly chamber suffice to say that torture examination of harry lasted until mid day when be seen that sens have left that be no longer conscious of dreadful injury be being inflicted upon be then carried back to cell laid upon floor while roger be unbound allowed to accompany door be closed bolted roger be alone with pitiful scarred torn bleeding wreck of friend fetched water from jug forced few drop down harry throat laved brow bound up seared bleeding wound a best must presently harry opened eye seeing roger bending over smiled even amid pain weep roger old friend said noticing tear running down chum face have done utmost on will not last out long enough

be near have fear breathing now grew rapidly weaker until presently only faint fluttering sigh must be heard then eye opened again said good bye roger be going dear lad faithful comrade good bye god bless remember what said about preparing for to night grieve for for indeed be quite happy good bye head fell back breathing ceased roger knew that be now alone alone in prison still in hand of holy office reverently closed eye of chum covered face after remained seated by side of body of beloved dead lost in bitter thought sorrowful retrospection be aroused by hearing click of trap door in wall a food be thrust in recalled to remembered harry last injunction that be to continue work of cutting through bar of grating in order to be ready to escape when midnight came also remembered that harry have given sister mary into charge enjoined to look after take care of how must do if remained where be lost life even a poor harry have lost no must put away grief melancholy thought until more convenient season if wished to fulfil promise to dead friend must first escape actuated by reflection feverishly seized tool once more set to work on remaining two bar of grating work took longer labouring by eventually one bar be cut through entirely one more remained night be getting on however there be mean of knowing what hour be felt that must be nearing appointed time seized one of saw began work on last bar at last cut through also at top have barely finished that part of task when pebble came clattering up against wall just below grating man be there already then left bar for moment lowered away cord presently felt now familiar jerking at end hauled up there be missive at end unfastening from cord roger took to friendly patch of moonlight read a follows have heard news already be sorry have come to save a be to be turn to morrow come at once if can if have not quite finished can wait little when be ready send down cord will attach rope can haul up fasten securely then climb down a quickly a can be in luck to night before dark fell noticed english vessel in offing be still there if can seize boat will be able to reach will then be safe so hasten roger very quickly glanced through communication prepared to finish work on bar when noticed that be only one remaining in abstraction have already cut through one end of last bar only one to must secure rope luckily have cut at top end so trusted that if rope be fastened securely at bottom must bear weight quickly lowered away cord again in minute felt welcome tug signified that mean of escape be secured at end of cord hauled away slowly for time burden be heavy eventually saw end of good stout rope make appearance at grating gathered in sufficient length secured firmly to one remaining bar a did so dawned upon have rescue come little later must in grief abstraction have destroyed only chance of ever being able to escape by removing last bar altogether being now ready roger went over to harry body tenderly kissing poor white lip said very softly good bye dear lad until meet again will amply avenge thee then with knife cut off lock of friend hair placed securely in bosom cast one more look round cell then hauled up into embrasure forcing body through opening seized rope with fervent prayer in heart for deliverance began descent after what seemed eternity felt pair of strong arm flung round be eased to ground come along sir exclaimed unknown man in whisper have time to lose seem more wakeful than usual to night aloft there pointing upward at building with thumb may find out absence at moment then must be lost unless be well clear of accursed building now speak more on life do a do follow if anybody accosts leave answering to cover face a well a can come along grasped roger hand together set off through darkness rope be obliged to leave a be having mean of removing through little gateway roger have seen same man pas on one occasion went found in much larger courtyard planted with kind of flowering shrub tree must only be dimly seen in darkness roger judged from presence that be now going through part of building where quarter of occupant be situated after short time occupied in fast walking came to alleyway small avenue down hastened at end of be closed door of exceptionally stout strong construction roger believed seeing closed that attempt at escape have met with premature end guide pressed handle gently door swung open a roger stepped out felt cool salt breeze blowing on face knew that be free at last free after month of weary imprisonment torture suffering yes free whole body seemed to expand to grateful influence of gentle sea breeze heart be very very sad for loss of friend two fugitive plunged onward across street down alley up step until come to huge open square at rear of enormous building towered high in middle of square be to be made out dimly pile heap of sort with what looked liked short thick pole standing upright above roger asked guide in whisper what be man replied big square be plaza of vera cruz large building yonder be cathedral that peculiar shaped object see there be heap of wood straw surrounding stake on heap bound to stake friend be doomed to die to morrow roger felt flesh creep hurried forward at increased rate of speed presently after going down very narrow steep street roger perceived that have reached beach heard dull boom of surf a rolled in broke on sand guide now spoke to do see small light out there well away in offing think can see something of kind replied roger well explained man that vessel be old ship elizabeth be aboard last time came out here be captured during one of action be one of mr cavendish vessel hear that left in sea to harry spaniard whilst took rest of fleet round other side where have just captured plate fleet will be right glad to get back aboard again what exclaimed roger in astonishment be that dear old elizabeth why know captain crew well many be time have be aboard be that so sir queried man then will know old cary perhaps who used to be aboard ay replied roger know well be on flag ship stag royal not elizabeth when saw last well said sailor in case must not waste time hark hark there go bell have discovered escape now must be moving for very life way hurried along quay wall formed one of arm of little harbour where small craft might lie bell be indeed clanging wildly noise be deafening voice be to be heard now snout cry though whether people be yet on track not must not tell along wall hastened at run until came to small lateen rigged vessel secured to farthest end of mole with one huge sail roughly furled round yard dashed on board cut rope through sailor swarming up rigging cut lashing foot of lateen sail dropped down on deck roger hauled sheet aft made fast then sprang to tiller little craft began to move away from mole under influence of breeze lucky found one aboard gasped sailor whose name be mathews then did not expect that there must be anybody about never leave watch on little craft roger still grasped helm steered through harbour mouth for tiny point of light be beacon of safety while mathews busied with sail with making snug on deck although town of vera cruz be still in darkness away to eastward first streak of day be already showing light on english man of war lying in offing be growing fainter away behind from direction of mole two fugitive must hear sound a of many people in pursuit presently dark patch detached from darkness appeared to be following soon made out to be sail of vessel very similar to one have so unceremoniously captured be much larger craft after while there must be doubt that be overhauling be now drawing well out toward english vessel although latter have not yet sighted issue so far hung on race between two felucca pursuing vessel crept up closer ever closer roger mathews began to picture a adorning that bonfire in plaza after now english ship seemed to awake to what be going forward to take in situation at once that one felucca be flying other pursuing must see at glance there be puff of white smoke from side shot flew screaming over head plunged into water just in front of pursuing felucca still held on gaining remorselessly crew began to fire at fugitive compelling to steer in crouching position below bulwark by occasional backward glance roger saw gradually creeping up wondered why english ship did not fire again then discovered that own vessel be in line of fire spaniard have cleverly managed to get exactly behind so that english must not fire without hitting foremost vessel therefore roger risked life liberty in desperate manoeuvre with sweep of tiller put helm hard over little vessel bounded away on opposite tack leaving pursuer without shelter english ship crew of be evidently waiting for something of sort to happen took immediate advantage of opportunity let fly whole broadside luckily bringing down pursuer mast after that fugitive be safe hour later be on board old elizabeth roger talking to captain fellow officer mathews below relating marvellous adventure to former mess mate roger gave full graphic account of have happened to harry told of poor friend death luckily turned out that elizabeth be on way from indie to england have only anchored during night in hope of sighting one more prize so be by merest chance that roger escaped after captain now made sail pointed vessel bow for home voyage lasted just three month met with single enemy on whole way ship sailed into plymouth sound one bright summer morning after long absence roger looked once more on country of birth taking leave of captain officer moment that ship be moored be at liberty made way up river a once before to home found people alive well great long continued be rejoicing at safe return poor mary edgwyth remained for long time quite inconsolable at loss of dearly loved brother time heals wound when at length roger asked certain question sorrow have sufficiently abated to admit of saying yes by way of answer prior to however roger fitted out small expedition on own account sailed for lonely inlet in order to secure treasure of jose leirya found strangely enough in identical cave where harry have kept savage at bay value proved to be vastly greater than even have imagined despite that have heard regarding roger remained in sea only long enough to secure treasure upon successfully accomplishing turned bow once again for home arriving in summer even a have done before meanwhile lapse of time have so far ameliorated mary sorrow for loss of brother that there be nothing now to prevent marriage taking place on certain lovely summer morning roger mary be united in plympton church married life be that best friend must desire for with part of treasure roger fitted out few small ship of own sent to indie to harry don avenge death of friend did not go with expedition saying that unless country required service must remain at home take care of mary in due course little son came to whom named harry in remembrance of one who be gone with arrival of little new comer sorrowful memory of past be finally wiped out leaving only future to be looked forward to bright rose coloured thus after deed of horror bloodshed by treasure of jose leirya have be accumulated that same treasure be productive of good at last for by roger judicious use of generous yet discriminative charity healed a many hurt perhaps a have be inflicted in accumulation of story of expedition fitted out by roger against hated enemy spaniard of dire terrible vengeance that wrought upon alvarez constitute in very complete history teeming with adventure present chronicler hope day to place upon record
