retired thereupon escombe individual addressed carefully wiped drawing pen upon duster methodically laid instrument in proper place in instrument case closed latter descending from high stool made way into chief draughtsman room closing door behind did with little trepidation for private interview with chief be more often than not of distinctly unpleasant character having reference to stupid blunder in calculation oversight in preparation of drawing something of similar nature calling for sharp rebuke a lad be seventeen accomplished short journey from one room to other rapidly reviewed most recent work endeavoured to decide in job be most likely to have made mistake before must arrive at decision on point be in presence of mr richards single glance at chief draughtsman face now that must be seen clearly unveiled by pall of smoke sufficed to assure harry escombe that in case at least have nothing in nature of censure to fear for mr richards face be beaming with satisfaction large atlas lay open upon desk at stood sit down remarked dreaded potentate a pointed to chair escombe seated then ensued silence of full minute duration potentate seemed to be meditating how to begin at length how long have be with escombe enquired hoisting onto stool a put question little over two year answered escombe signed article with sir philip on first of september year before last came on duty next day two year ejaculated mr richards did not think have be so long a time fly when one be busy have done lot of work during last two year then have only year of pupilage to serve eh escombe only one year more mr richards answered lad ah commented mr richards paused again characteristically look here escombe resumed have done very well since came here sir philip be very pleased with so be have have eye on have seen that have be studying hard doing best to perfect in detail of profession so far a theory go be pretty well advanced what need now be practical out of door work laying hand upon open atlas have got job here think will just suit be in peru do happen to know anything of peru escombe confessed that knowledge of peru be strictly confined to what have learned about interesting country at school be same with admitted mr richards know about peru be that be very mountainous country be reason suppose why there be considerably le than thousand mile of railway throughout length breadth of what there be be made up principally of short bit scattered about here there there be talk of altering now matter have gone so far that sir philip have be commissioned to prepare scheme for constructing railway from place called palpa be already connected with lima callao to salina be connected with huacho from huacho to cochamarca thence to place called cerro de pasco in turn be connected with nanucaca from nanucaca along shore of lake chinchaycocha to ayacucho cuzco santa rosa last be connected by rail with mollendo on coast there be also scheme afoot will involve taking of complete set of sounding over length breadth of lake titicaca now mean lot of very important careful survey work reckon will take best part of two year to accomplish sir philip have decided to entrust work to mr butler who have already done great deal of survey work for a of course know mr butler will need assistant sir philip after consultation with have decided to offer post to will be splendid opportunity for to acquire experience in branch of profession that know very little of a yet if scheme must be carried out in consequence of familiarity with country will have acquired will stand excellent chance of obtaining good post on job now what do say escombe be willing to go pay during survey will be guinea day seven day week beginning on day sail from england ending on day of return first class passage out home expense paid twenty five pound allowed for special outfit everything in shape of surveying instrument other necessary found after return will of course be retained in office to work out scheme at salary to be agreed upon will to great extent depend upon way in work upon survey while in event of scheme being carried out will a say doubtless get good post on engineering staff at salary will certainly not be le than pay during survey may possibly be good deal more young escombe heart leapt within for here be indeed rosy prospect suddenly opening out before prospect promised to put abrupt permanent end to certain sordid embarrassment that of late have be causing poor widowed vast amount of anxiety trouble sowing beloved head with many premature white hair for harry father have died about four month before story open leaving affair in condition of such hopeless disorder that family lawyer have only just succeeded in disentangling with result that widow have found left almost penniless with apparent resource to allow daughter lucy to go out into cold unsympathetic world to earn own living face many peril lurk in path of young lovely innocent unprotected girl here be way out of difficulty for a harry rapidly bethought if expense be to be paid while engaged upon survey must arrange for at least three hundred pound of yearly salary to be paid to mother at home with economy what little have already must suffice to enable lucy to live in present modest home free from actual want there be one fly in ointment one disturbing item in alluring programme mr richards have sketched out be mr butler man who be to be escombe superior during execution of survey man be well known to occupant of sir philip swinburne drawing office a most tyrannical overbearing man with arrogance of speech offensiveness of manner faculty for finding fault rendered absolutely impossible to work amicably with at same time retain one self respect moreover be asserted that if there be two equally efficient method of accomplishing certain task must invariably insist upon adoption of method involved greatest amount of difficulty discomfort danger then calmly sit down in safety comfort to see done mr richards have said that escombe must upon return to england be retained in office to work out scheme at salary amount of must to great extent depend upon way in worked on survey seemed to harry sir philip estimate of way in worked on survey must be almost entirely based upon mr butler report now be known that in addition to possessing unenviable attribute already mentioned butler be most vindictive man cherishing undying enmity against who have ever presumed to thwart offend seemed to be one of unfortunately constituted individual whom be impossible to avoid offending be therefore not to be wondered at if escombe hesitated moment before accepting mr richards offer well escombe what do say enquired chief draughtsman after somewhat lengthy pause seem to be very keen upon availing of opportunity be offering be climate that be afraid of be told that peru be perfectly healthy country mr richards answered escombe be not thinking of climate be mr butler be troubling must be fully aware of reputation hold in office a man with whom be absolutely impossible to work amicably there be munro who helped in scottish survey declares that nothing must induce to again put in mr butler power will remember what shocking report mr butler gave of munro behaviour during survey yet rest of have found munro to be invariably most good natured obliging in way then there be fielding pierson marwill yes know interrupted mr richards rather impatiently have never be able to rightly understand affair to make up mind be in wrong may be that there be fault on side be that a may mr butler be first rate surveyor have always found work to be absolutely accurate reliable sir philip have given survey to do so be too late for to draw back now even if sir philip must think in least likely so if feel inclined to take on job please mistake hesitation interrupted escombe will take post most gratefully do best in only if mr butler must give in unfavourable report of when be over must like to remember that have done same with everybody else who have gone out under please take for granted without enquiry that report be perfectly just unbiased be rather bold thing for youngster of escombe year to say in relation to man old enough to be father mr richards passed over possibly knew rather more about past episode than cared to admit merely saying very well then dare say will be right now have better go to mitford draw money for special outfit also get from list of what will require to morrow can take necessary time to give order before coming to office must be careful to make sure that everything be supplied in good time for sail for callao day three week enthusiasm caused escombe eye to shine cheek to glow a strode up short garden path to door of trim little villa in west hill sydenham that night be rather damped by reception accorded by mother sister to glorious news began to communicate before even have stepped off doormat where lad saw only immediate increase of pay must suffice to solve problem of family domestic embarrassment two year of assured employment with brilliant prospect beyond long spell of outdoor life in perfect climate in most interesting romantic country during must be perfecting in very important branch of profession lastly possibility of much exciting adventure mr escombe lucy discerned long sea voyage with countless possibility of disaster two year of separation from being who be dearer to than else threat of strange terrible attack of sickness peril innumerable from wild beast venomous reptile insect trackless forest precipitous mountain path fathomless abyss swift rushing torrent fierce tropical storm earthquake worse than else ferocious bloodthirsty savage what be money freedom from care anxiety possession ensured compared with awful danger darling must brave in order to win two gently nurtured woman felt that must infinitely rather beg bread in street than suffer beloved harry to go forth carrying life in hand in order that might be comfortably housed clothed sufficiently fed indeed picture drew be sufficiently alarming to have daunted lad of nervous timid temperament perhaps have turned from purpose harry escombe be youth of very different mould be built of much sterner stuff there be nothing of milksop about danger of mother sister spoke so eloquently have terror for on contrary constituted positive very powerful attraction besides a pointed out to companion must not always be clinging to face of precipice endeavouring to cross impassable mountain torrent storm did not rage incessantly in peru more than did elsewhere mr richards have assured that climate be healthy ferocious animal deadly reptile did not usually attack man unless be interfered with reference to encyclopaedia disclosed fact that peru so far from swarming with untamed savage be country enjoying very fair measure of civilisation talking thus making light of such danger a must actually have to face dwelling very strongly upon splendid opening offer afforded lad gradually brought mother sister into more reasonable frame of mind until at length by time that bedroom candle made appearance two woman knowing how completely harry have set heart upon going recognising also strength of contention a to advantageous character of opening afforded by mr richards proposal have become so far reconciled to prospect of separation that be able to speak of calmly to conceal heartache from be suffering so on following morning mr escombe lucy be enabled to sally forth with cheerful countenance more le sprightly conversation a accompanied lad to town to assist in purchase of special outfit larger portion of be delivered at lime same evening at once unpacked for purpose of being legibly marked having button securely sewn on by two pair of loving hand following three week sped like dream so far a individual chiefly interested be concerned during day be kept continually busy by mr butler in preparation of list of several instrument article thing from theodolite level measuring chain steel tape ranging rod wire line sounding chain drawing tracing paper case of instrument colour box t square steel straight edge drawing pin to tent camp furniture saddlery procuring same evening be spent in packing re packing kit a several article comprising came to hand diversified by little farewell party given in honour by large circle of friend with whom escombes have become acquainted since arrival settlement in sydenham at preparation be complete official impedimenta so to speak have be collected at sir philip swinburne office in victoria street carefully packed in zinc lined case dispatched for shipment in steamer be to take surveyor to south america escombe have sent on baggage to ship in advance morning came when must say good bye to two who be dearest to in world must fain have accompanied to dock remained on board with until moment arrived for steamer to haul out into river proceed upon voyage young escombe have once witnessed departure of liner from southampton have then beheld long drawn out agony of protracted leave taking twitching feature sudden turning aside to hide wipe away unbidden tear heroic futile attempt at cheerful light hearted conversation false alarm when timid people rushed ashore under unfounded apprehension that be about to be carried off across sea return to ship to say goodbye yet once again when found that fear be groundless have seen be quite determined that dear one must not undergo such torture of waiting therefore so contrived that good bye be almost a brief matter of fact a though have be merely going up to westminster for day instead of to peru for two year taking train for london bridge made way thence to fenchurch street so to blackwall arriving on board s rimac with good hour to spare early a be found that not only have mr butler arrived on board before also that impatient individual have already worked into perfect frenzy of irritation lest harry must allow steamer to leave without look here escombe fumed sort of thing wo do at know most distinctly ordered to be on board in good time morning have be searching for over ship now at quarter to eleven o'clock come sauntering on board with a much deliberation a though have day to spare what do mean by being so late eh really mr butler answered harry be awfully sorry if have put out at thought that so long a be on board in time to start with ship must be sufficient a be be more than hour to good for a be aware ship doe not haul out of dock until midday have be wanting for anything in particular have not snapped butler be naturally anxious when arrived on board found that be not here if have happened to miss ship must have be in pretty pickle for peruvian survey be far too big job for to tackle singlehanded of course agreed escombe might have be quite certain must not have be so very foolish a to allow ship to leave without be far too anxious to avail myself of opportunity survey will afford to risk loss of by being late be there anything that want to do mr butler because if not will go below arrange matter in cabin very well assented butler ungraciously now that be on board dare to leave ship go on shore again upon pretence do hear really need not feel slightest apprehension mr butler replied harry have intention desire to go on shore again therewith made way to saloon companion thence below to sleeping cabin cheek tingling with shame anger at having be so hectored in public for several passenger have be within earshot have turned to look curiously at pair upon hearing sound of butler high pitched voice raised in anger word thought lad friend butler be beginning early if be going to talk to in strain on day of departure what will be like when be ready to return home however be not going to allow to exasperate into forgetting so answering a to give excuse for reporting to sir philip for insolence insubordination there be too much depending upon expedition for to risk anything by losing temper with will be perfectly civil to will do duty to very best of ability then nothing very serious can possibly happen upon entering cabin escombe be greatly gratified to learn from steward that be to be sole occupant at once annexed top berth proceeded to unpack trunk containing clothing other matter that must need during voyage arranged book in rack above bunk then returned to deck just in time to witness operation of hauling out of dock found butler pacing deck in state of extreme agitation where have be while demanded man halting abruptly square in escombe path what do mean by keeping out of sight so long be aware sir have spent nearly hour at gangway watching to see that did not slink off ashore have really retorted harry there be not slightest need for to do so know mr butler for distinctly told that did not intend to go ashore again did yes did answered butler how be to know that must keep word always keep word sir a will learn when become better acquainted answered lad hope so for sake returned butler experience of youngster like be that be not to be trusted then glancing round perceiving that several passenger in immediate neighbourhood be regarding with unconcealed amusement hastily retreated below a did so man who have be lounging over rail close at hand smoking cigar a watched traffic upon river turned regarding escombe with good natured smile remarked friend seems to be rather cantankerous chap be will have to take care of keep temper under rather better control will go crazy when get into hot weather be often taken like really know answered fact be that only made acquaintance about three week ago fear that suffers great deal from nervous irritability must be very great affliction be to to others remarked stranger dryly have met sort before find that only way to deal with such people be to leave very severely alone seems to be bit of bully so far a can make out will have to mind p q while be on board ship will be getting into hot water finding thing generally made very unpleasant for be in service suppose yes in way be answered escombe with circumspection be to say be in same service be superior see answered stranger how far be going in ship be going to callao answered harry to peru eh returned stranger so be know country pretty well have lived in lima for last nine year can tell that when friend get among peruvian will have to pull in horn good bit be rather peppery lot be peruvian if attempt to talk to a have talked to to day will stand very good chance of waking up fine morning with long knife between rib oh hope will not come to exclaimed escombe to leave subject of friend temper for present since have lived in peru so long perhaps can tell something about country what be like what be character of climate so on be possible that may have to spend year so in must therefore be glad to learn something about to get such tip a to manner of living so on a can give before land certainly answered stranger will be very pleased indeed to give information that possibly can fancy there be very few people on board ship who know more about peru than do therewith escombe new acquaintance proceeded to hold forth upon good bad point of country to be bound describing in very graphic language extraordinary variety of climate to be met with on journey inland from coast grandeur of mountain scenery astonishing variety of product interesting historical remains character of aboriginal indian belief cherish legend have be preserved handed down by from father to son through many generation character abundance of mineral wealth variety of other interesting information so by time harry went down below to luncheon have already become possessed of feeling to peru be longer strange unknown land chapter two chief officer yarn upon entering saloon searching for place harry found that much to satisfaction have be stationed at second table presided over by chief officer of ship very genial individual named o'toole hailing from emerald isle between important personage recently made peruvian acquaintance whose name now discovered to be john firmin while mr butler appeared have contrived to get placed at captain table be understood to be occupied by elite of passenger with serving of soup escombe be given small printed form examined rather curiously not quite understanding for moment what meant mr firmin volunteered enlightenment that explained be order form upon write particular kind of liquid refreshment apart from pure water with wish to be served fill in hand to own particular table steward who brings what have ordered at end of week present with order have issued be expected to settle up in spot cash very simple be perfectly agreed harry supposing that one doe not wish to order anything what then leave order blank be answered firmin then noticing that lad pushed form away asked be teetotaler by mean answered harry sometimes take glass of wine beer very occasionally when happen to get wet through be very cold take little spirit plain aerated water usually suffices for see remarked firmin remained silent for few second then turning again to harry said wonder if must consider very impertinent if upon strength of extremely brief acquaintance be to offer piece of advice certainly not answered harry be much older more experienced than mr firmin have seen great deal more of world than have advice therefore that may be pleased to give will be most grateful for will endeavour to profit by very well then said firmin will risk for have taken rather fancy to must willingly do good turn advice wish to give be make point of eschewing everything in nature of alcohol have absolutely nothing to do with be young strong evidently in best of health system have therefore need of anything having character of stimulant nay will go farther than say that will be very much better morally physically without even upon occasion mention of getting wet cold cup of scalding hot coffee swallowed a hot a can take will do far more good than spirit be moved to say to young friend because have seen so many lad like insensibly led into habit of taking alcohol when once habit be contracted be more difficult than must believe to break off have known many promising young fellow who have made shipwreck of life simply because have not possessed courage strength of mind to say ' when have be invited to take wine spirit by power misther firmin ye niver spoke thruer word in life than same cut in chief officer who have be listening to what be said whin be youngster of about misther escombe age nearly lost life through dhrink be apprentice at time aboard fine full rigged iron clipper ship called joan of arc be outward bound from london to sydney full up with general cargo carried twenty six passenger in cuddy nearly forty emigrant in 'tween deck have just picked up north east trade blowing fresh old man ' who be rare hand at carrying on be eager to break record be driving along to south'ard under rag that must show to including such fancy fakements a skysail ringtail water sail rest of be fine clear starlit night with just trade cloud driving along overhead there be moon consequently when exceptionally big patch of cloud came sweeping up fell bit dark still there be danger ought to have be none for be well out of regular track of homeward bounder in case with proper look out must have be possible to see craft plenty early enough to give good wide berth after jack have got a far south a then be be apt to get bit careless in matter of keeping look out trust rather too much to officer of watch aft know be not above snatching cat nap in most comfortable corner can find instead of posting on heel of bowsprit with eye skinned searching sea ahead of now happened although none of knew until be too late that chief mate have rather too strong liking for rum not that be exactly what might call drunkard know kept bottle in cabin be in habit of taking nip just whenever felt like especially at night time on particular night be talking about must have taken nip too many for when came on deck at midnight to keep middle watch have be up above hour before coiled down in one of passenger deck chair went to sleep of course under such circumstance a of be speaking weather being fine wind steady with necessity to touch tack sheet watch on deck make pretence of keeping awake be on deck at hand ready for call if be needed be a much a be expected of at night time since there be work to be done consequence be that hand of be sound asleep long before mate there be doubt that look out who lost life poor chap through carelessness fell asleep too a to man at wheel well be not expected to steer ship keep look out at same time if be must do for eye soon grow so dazzled by light of binnacle lamp that can see little nothing except illuminated compass card that gentleman be state of affair aboard joan of arc on night about be telling skipper passenger second mate watch below in bunk rest of who be on deck ought to have be broad awake almost if not quite a sound asleep a who be below be down on main deck sitting on plank with back propping up front of poop arm crossed chin on chest dhreaming be back at school in dear old dublin when be startled broad awake by shock sent sprawling a far for'ard a coaming of after hatch to accompaniment of most awful crunching ripping crashing sound a joan sawed way steadily into vitals of craft that have struck then amid yelling of awakened watch accompanied by muffled shriek shout from below there arose loud twang twanging a backstay shroud parted under terrific strain suddenly thrown upon then ear splitting crash a three mast went over bow found struggling fighting to free from raffle of wrecked mizenmast felt very dazed queer bit sick for be dimly conscious of fact have be struck on head by something when mast fell upon putting up hand found that hair be wet with something warm be soaking trickling down into eye ear then heard voice of old man yelling for mate carpenter a fought clear of raffle became aware of many voice frantically demanding to know what have happened husband calling for wife mother screaming for child sound of ax being desperately used to clear away wreck sudden awful wail from somewhere ahead rushing hissing of water a craft that have struck foundered under forefoot skipper voice again cracked hoarse ordering boat to be cleared away o'toole paused for moment gasped a if for breath soup lay neglected before elbow be on table two hand locked together in grip so tense that knuckle shone white in light came streaming in through scuttle in ship side eye be glassy staring into vacancy with intensity of gaze plainly showed that whole dreadful scene be again unfolding before mental vision perspiration be streaming down forehead cheek then table steward came up removing soup asked whether must take cold beef ham tongue roast chicken sound of man voice seemed to bring dazed chief officer to again sighed heavily a though relieved to find where be considered for moment deciding in favour of cold beef resumed narrative next thing can remember gentleman continued be be on poop with skipper second third mate carpenter few others lighting for life a strove to keep back frantic passenger prevent from interfering with hand who be cutting gripe working furiously to sling boat outboard carried four boat at davit two on quarter be be available for others be buried under raffle wreckage of fallen mast must have taken hour to clear with probability that when got at must have be found smashed to smithereens while blind man must have told by feel of ship that be settling fast might sink under at moment at last one of boat be cleared ready for lowering a many of woman child a must carry be bundled into third mate two able seaman being sent along with by skipper to take care of must willingly have stayed behind for there be other woman child to say nothing of men passenger to be saved knew that certain number of jack must of necessity go in boat to handle navigate there be time to waste in arguing matter so in tumbled just a be next moment be rising falling in water alongside tackle block be cleverly unhooked out oar shoved off pulling to safe distance then lying on oar to wait for rest will never to dying day forget look of ship a pulled away from joan have be a handsome craft a ever left stock when hauled out of dock at three week earlier now bow be crumpled in until be a flat for'ard a end of sea chest deck be lumbered high with wreckage of mast spar standing running rigging be hanging down over side in bight have settled so low in water that channel be already buried while poop be crowded with madly struggling figure from arose confused babel of sound shouting screaming cursing than have never heard anything more awful in life when have pulled off about fifty fathom third mate who be in charge of boat ordered to lie upon oar presently saw that second quarter boat be being lowered reached water right then heard voice of second mate yelling to hand on deck to let run after tackle next moment a sinking ship rolled heavily to starboard saw stern of lowered boat lifted high out of water bow dipped under in second a seemed have swamped whole load of people twenty in number be struggling drowning alongside a strove ineffectually to scramble back into swamped boat have now by chance become released from tackle have held for moment in boat have got safely away sat staring dumb paralysed with horror at dreadful scene be enacting before eye next moment of who be at oar started madly backing pulling to swing boat round pull in to help of poor wretch who be perishing only few fathom away from have hardly got boat round however when mr gibson third mate gave order for to hold water must do ' said boat be already loaded a deep a will swim weight of even one more person must suffice to swamp a be will take time tax seamanship to utmost to keep afloat can see for yourselves that must be impossible for to squeeze more than one additional person in among even if have room must not get that one in over gunnel without swamping craft to attempt thing must therefore only be to throw away uselessly life of of must therefore stay where be endure awful sight a best can ah there have hint of what will happen if be not careful a boat lying broadside on to sea rolled heavily shipped three four bucketful of water pull starboard get round stem on to sea o'toole get hold of baler dish water out of be true word of a child might have have sense to see must do absolutely nothing to help poor wretch who be drowning there before very eye in few minute be over so far a be concerned two three men believe managed to get back aboard sinking ship by climbing up davit tackle rest quickly drowned a likely a not because clung to other pulled other down plight of aboard joan be rapidly becoming desperate must see that knew by observing frantic effort be making to get other two boat into water must distinctly hear voice of skipper rising from time to time above clamour urging people to greater effort encouraging one cautioning entreating maddened passenger to keep back give crew room to work then in very midst of there came dull boom a deck blew up heard loud hissing of compressed air a rushed out between gaping deck plank there arose just one awful wail sound of will haunt to dying day with long sliding plunge joan lurched forward dived bow first to bottom a for must hing just keep boat head on to sea let drift humouring coaxing a best must when extra heavy sea appeared bearing down upon baling for dear life continuously to keep free of water that in spite of persisted in slapping into over bow canary be nearest bit of dry land to mr jellicoe third mate reckoned that be good hundred fifty mile away dead to wind'ard so be useless for to think of reaching in boat with gunnel awash not scrap of food drop of fresh water in only thing that must do be to exert utmost endeavour to keep craft afloat trust providence must send something along soon to pick up must believe although be right in track of outward bound ship although sighted nine sailing craft three steamer nothing came near enough to see lying low in water a be until ninth day when be picked up by barque bound for cape town by time gentleman mr jellicoe one seaman be remained alive of boatload shoved off from stricken joan of arc on fatal night ask by what mean contrived to keep life in for so long time for wo tell thus see that of complete complement of ninety two person who left london in joan of arc eighty nine be drowned to say nothing of aboard craft that have run down because mate must must control love of drink since day gentleman coffee be strongest beverage have ever passed lip be delighted to hear remarked firmin for observation have led to conviction at least tragedy of human life have originated in craving for intoxicant therefore turning to escombe say again young friend have absolutely nothing to do with have doubt that ere have be long in peru will have made discovery that be thirsty country apart of course from pure water there be nothing better for quenching one thirst than fresh sound perfectly ripe fruit failing tea hot cold latter for preference without milk with small quantity of sugar will be found hard to beat now if be anxious for hint there be one of absolutely priceless value for present free gratis for nothing thanks very much returned harry will bear in mind act upon more intoxicant for thank mr o'toole accept thanks for telling that terrible story of shipwreck have brought home to a nothing else have ever done awful danger of tampering with so insidious enemy a alcohol now solemnly abjure for ever meanwhile at captain table mr butler be expressing opinion upon various subject in loud strident tone with disputatiousness of manner caused most of about mentally to dub blatant cad to resolve that must have a little a possible to do with one afternoon when rimac have reached other side of atlantic butler called harry into cabin of former said understand that will be at montevideo day after to morrow now want to understand that will expect not to go on shore at montevideo of other place that rimac will be stopping at will only remain at anchor at of place for few hour if be to go on shore must be easiest thing in world for to get lost to miss passage therefore in order to obviate such possibility have decided not to allow to leave ship do understand yes answered escombe understand perfectly mr butler what mean certainly understand by what authority attempt to interfere with personal liberty to extent of forbidding to go on shore for few hour when opportunity present agreed with sir philip swinburne to accompany to peru a assistant upon survey have engaged to make from moment when survey commences will render obedience deference due to a superior will serve to best of ability be part of contract must surrender liberty to during outward homeward voyage when come to forbidding to leave ship until arrival at callao must permit to say that feel under obligation to defer to wish quite apart from may a well tell have already accepted invitation to accompany mr mr westwood party ashore at montevideo see reason why must withdraw acceptance w h t screamed butler do understand that be daring to disobey defy certainly not sir answered harry because a understand disobedience defiance be impossible where authority exists beg to remind that authority over begin only upon arrival at callao yet purely a matter of courtesy be of course not only prepared perfectly willing to show due deference to such reasonable wish a may choose to express reserve to myself right of determining where line will be drawn very well sir stuttered butler be glad to learn thus early what sort of behaviour may expect from will write home at once to sir philip reporting to what have passed between requesting to send out someone to take place someone who can be depended upon to render implicit obedience at time therewith whirled about marched off to own cabin where with heat of anger still upon sat down penned to sir philip swinburne very strong letter of complaint of what be pleased to term young escombe insolently insubordinate language behaviour a for harry butler threat to report to sir philip furnished with very valuable hint a to wisest thing to do under circumstance too lost time in addressing epistle to sir philip giving own version of affair thenceforward butler pointedly ignored young escombe existence for remainder of voyage by doing so only made matter still more unpleasant for for altercation with harry have be overheard by certain of passenger by repeated to rest with final result that butler be promptly consigned to coventry left there by whole of saloon passenger harry duly went ashore with friend at montevideo having first posted letter to sir philip to mother sister went out with by train to bellavista where enjoyed vastly little change from monotony of life at sea returning in nick of time to witness violent altercation between butler boatman who brought off from shore also harry went ashore for hour two at punta arena in strait of magellan again at valparaiso arica finally arriving at callao something over month from day upon sailed from london chapter three butler tyrant at point escombe acknowledged to be legitimately under butler rule dominion to obey unquestioningly latter order to go where bidden to do whatever might be told even a did soldier of roman centurion butler soon made understand feel that there be heavy score to be wiped off big wound in elder man self esteem to be healed there be thousand way now in butler be able to make power authority over harry felt be careful not to miss single opportunity spared lad in nothing must not even permit harry to land until latter have personally supervised disembarkation of item of somewhat extensive baggage when be at length done insisted that escombe must in like manner oversee loading of into railway wagon for lima make journey thither in same truck with ostensibly to ensure that nothing be stolen on way finally upon arrival in lima compelled harry to remain by truck mount guard over until be coupled to train for palpa then to proceed to town in same truck without seeing anything more of capital city than must be seen from station yard then again at palpa insisted that harry must remain by truck supervise unloading of baggage transference to lock up store giving lad to understand that must be held responsible for loss damage might occur during operation so that by time that be done poor escombe be more dead than alive so utterly exhausted be from long exposure to enervating heat lack of proper food harry breathed word of expostulation complaint regarded everything that now did a in way of duty merely a somewhat unpleasant incident in execution of great task lay before be content if not quite a happy comfortable a might have be under more congenial considerate leader besides be learning something minute of day learning how to do thing also how not to do for very quickly recognised that although butler might possibly be excellent surveyor be very poor hand at organisation then too butler have characteristically neglected acquisition of foreign language consequently have sooner arrived at palpa than found absolutely dependent upon harry knowledge of spanish advantage on escombe part served in great measure to place two upon somewhat more equal footing gradually to suppress act of petty tyranny butler have at first evinced disposition to indulge in palpa be place at labour be to begin here became necessary for to engage complete staff of assistant comprising tent bearer groom bush cutter porter cook other attendant needed for comfort convenience during long spell of camp life in tropical climate in country where civilisation be still elementary except in more important centre luckily for first section of work comprised only stretch of little more than thirty mile of tolerably flat country where serious natural difficulty presented that part of work be soon accomplished yet escombe found even trifling bit of great task before sufficiently arduous for butler not only demanded that must be up at work in open at daybreak that must continue at work so long a daylight lasted that when survey work be no longer possible because of darkness lad must plot day work on paper before retiring to rest thus be generally close upon midnight before escombe be at liberty to retire to camp bed seek hard earned much needed rest be when got upon second section of work between huacho cochamarca cerro de pasco that real trouble difficulty began for here have to find practicable route up face of western cordillera in first instance having found to measure with nicest accuracy not only horizontal distance height of rise depth of declivity in face of country made up to great extent of lofty precipice fathomless ravine whole overgrown with dense vegetation through survey line have to be cut at enormous expense of time labour here be that butler almost fiendish malice ingenuity in art of making thing unpleasant for other people shone forth conspicuously be habit to ride forth morning accompanied by strong band of attendant armed with ax machete well provided with rope to assist in scaling of precipitous slope for purpose of selecting marking out day route task must usually be accomplished in couple of hour then to return supervise work of subordinate made a difficult arduous a possible by insisting upon securing of vast amount of superfluous wholly unnecessary information in obtaining of harry be obliged to risk life at least dozen time day yet lad never complained indeed must not have done so even have be so disposed for be for butler to determine what amount of information of what nature be necessary for proper execution of survey escombe began to understand now mean by superior have acquired reputation of accomplished surveyor be easy for man in authority to stand sit in safety command to perform difficult task at peril of life if butler be tyrannically exacting in treatment of harry be still more so toward unfortunate peon in service especially whom detailed to accompany daily to assist in task of selecting marking out route of survey line people knew language own since harry be always engaged elsewhere with theodolite level chain be therefore not available to play part of interpreter became necessary for butler to secure service of man who understood enough english to translate order into vernacular because unfortunate fellow be necessarily always at butler elbow became scapegoat upon whose unhappy head sin shortcoming of others be visited in form of perpetual virulent abuse until man life positively became burden to to extent indeed that must undoubtedly have deserted for fact that butler suspecting inclination perhaps positively refused to pay farthing of wage until conclusion of engagement can easily be understood therefore under circumstance described element of tragedy be steadily developing in survey camp although overbearing exacting behaviour of chief of expedition be thus making matter particularly unpleasant for everybody concerned nothing of really serious character occurred until second section of survey have be in progress for little over two month by time party have penetrated well into mountain fastness be beginning to encounter of more formidable difficulty of task butler be still limiting share of work to mere marking out of route leaving harry to perform whole of actual labour of survey under watchful eye stirring hand foot to assist young fellow although occasion be frequent when have chosen to give few minute assistance at theodolite level such help must have saved young hour of arduous labour thus expedited survey now happened that certain day work terminated at edge of quebrada butler informed harry that first task of latter upon following morning must be to take complete set of accurate measurement of quebrada before pushing on with survey of route quebrada may be explained be sort of rent chasm in mountain usually with vertical at least precipitous side very frequently of terrific depth impression suggested by appearance being at period of earth history solid rock of mountain have be riven asunder by titanic force sometimes quebrada be several hundred of foot in width of depth so appalling a to unnerve most hardy mountaineer quebrada in question however be of comparatively insignificant dimension being only about forty foot wide at point where survey line crossed four hundred foot deep now although harry be only articled pupil knew quite enough about railway engineering to be perfectly well aware that elaborate measurement butler have instructed to take be absolutely unnecessary accurate determination of width at top where bridge must eventually have to be thrown across being be really required yet made demur for have already seen that must be possible to take a many measurement a might be required with absolute accuracy ease by execution of about quarter of hour preliminary surveying when on following morning commenced bit of preliminary work butler rushed out of tent interrupted what be doing harshly demanded have forgotten that ordered to measure very carefully quebrada morning before doing anything else sir answered harry have not forgotten be doing now rather doing necessary preliminary work doing necessary preliminary work echoed butler what do mean understand then permit to explain said harry suavely have ascertained that by placing theodolite over peg yonder pointing to newly driven peg four hundred foot away to left will be able to get uninterrupted view of quebrada from top to bottom by taking series of vertical horizontal angle from top edge can measure contour of two side at point crossed by survey line with nicest accuracy how do mean demanded butler harry proceeded to elaborate explanation patiently describing step of intended operation making perfectly clear that elaborate series of unnecessary measurement demanded must be secured with most beautiful precision objected butler when have taken angle will have done only part of work will still have to calculate length of vertical horizontal line subtended by matter of about hour work interjected harry possibly agreed butler continued like plan at approve of be amateurish theoretical wo have much simpler more practical way will be for to go down quebrada at end of rope measuring a go be one way certainly assented harry with submission mr butler venture to think that will not be nearly so accurate a mine besides consider danger if rope must happen to be cut in passage over sharp edge of rock look here interrupted butler if be afraid have better say so will do work must like to understand that timid people be of use to taunt be unjust for harry be not afraid be convinced that own plan be far away more expeditious more accurate also involved absolutely danger at while be patent to even dullest comprehension that there be distinct element of danger attaching to other inasmuch a if anything must happen to rope person suspended by must inevitably be precipitated to bottom where mountain stream roared a leaped boiled foamed over bed of enormous boulder have escombe be ten year older than actually be must probably not have hesitated while disclaiming anything in nature of cowardice to express very strongly opinion where there be two method of executing certain task one of perfectly safe other seriously imperilling human life be imperative duty of person with whom decision rested to select safer method of two particularly when method offered equally satisfactory result with other being merely lad a yet scarcely certain of remembering also that future prospect be absolutely at butler mercy to make mar a pleased harry contented with disclaimer of such feeling a fear expressed readiness to perform task in manner butler might choose to approve at same time confessed inability to understand precisely how required measurement be to be taken requested instruction why explained butler impatiently thing be surely simple enough for baby to understand will be lowered over cliff edge let down cliff face exactly five foot at time a happens to be absolutely calm rope by be to be lowered will hang accurately plumb that will have to do therefore will be to measure distance from rope to face of rock at five foot of drop will then have particular necessary to plot contour of cliff face from top to bottom will do on side of quebrada then measure width across at top will enable to produce perfectly correct section of gorge how be to measure distance from rope to cliff face demanded harry for a will have observed rock overhang at top gorge widens considerably a descends can do measuring with ranging rod answered butler tersely if one be not long enough tie two together even so persisted harry fear will not be able to manage will will not do a be told snapped butler if can not manage with two rod will devise other plan very well sir said harry if be quite determined to send over cliff be ready to go what rope be pleasure that will use take tent rope ordered butler will have ample quantity if join together make seat for in end then mark off rest of rope into five foot length so that may know exactly how much to pay out between measurement then lash two ranging rod together will find that will manage splendidly have doubt for to own mind tent rope seemed none too strong for purpose moreover clip upon must render paying out over cliff edge exceedingly awkward still since seemed that choice lay between risking life ruining professional prospect chose former set about making preparation for what must not help regarding a distinctly hazardous experiment did not occupy very long in about twenty minute be standing at cliff edge with padded bight of rope about body two joined ranging rod in hand quite ready to be lowered down face then two peon whom have specially selected for task drew in slack of rope passed complete turn of round iron bar driven deep into rock crevice waited for command of third who now laid prone on ground with head projecting over edge of cliff to watch regulate descent then harry fully realising perhaps for first time perilous nature of enterprise laid down carefully lowered over rocky edge lower gently brother ordered man who be supervising operation rope be carefully eased away until first five foot mark reached cliff edge while butler who now also began at last to recognise appreciate ghastly peril to obstinacy have consigned fellow creature moved off to point about hundred yard distant from must watch entire descent sooner reached than perceived that harry objection to plan be well grounded that even with two joined rod must be impossible for lad to take required measurement over more than first quarter of depth being case be obviously duty at once to put stop to so dangerous attempt especially a knew perfectly well that be a unnecessary a be dangerous to do must have be tantamount to confessing that have made mistake nature be too mean petty to permit so simply sat down watched in ever growing fever of anxiety lest anything untoward must happen for must be blamed meanwhile at very first stoppage harry began to experience of difficulty beset in task have undertaken despite utmost care in lowering rope must persist in oscillating very gently be true still sufficient to render necessary to pause until oscillation have ceased before attempting to take measurement also torsion of rope set up slow revolving movement so even when at oscillation ceased be only with difficulty that correct measurement be taken recorded in book difficulty recurred a additional five foot length of rope be paid out so that measurement cost fully five minute of precious time despite padding of rope harry soon began to find cutting into flesh so unpleasantly that have grave doubt whether must be able to endure hold out until bottom far below must be reached at length when about forty foot of rope have be very cautiously paid out eight measurement taken peon who be superintending operation of lowering be suddenly seen to stiffen body a though something out of common have attracted attention raised one hand a sign to other two to cease lowering gazed intently downward for several second then signed for lowering to be continued to astonishment of others wriggled back from edge of cliff until have room to stand upright when scrambling hastily to foot sprang to two men who be lowering hissed between set teeth lower lower away a quickly a steadily a can brother life of young senor depends upon speed steadiness rope have stranded cut by edge of rock most probably unless can lower muchacho to bottom ere part altogether will be dashed to piece meanwhile harry hanging there swinging revolving in bight of rope be not little astonished when found being lowered without pause save such momentary jerk a be occasioned by passage of clip round bar over cliff edge instinctively glanced upward to see if must discover what be wrong for something have gone amiss felt tolerably certain for few second eye sought vainly for explanation then gaze be arrested by sight of two severed end of one strand of rope standing out at distance of about thirty foot above head knew knew that strength of slender rope have be decreased by one third that life now depended upon holding together of two remaining strand harry must see that two remaining strand be stretched by hanging weight to utmost limit of resistance watched with dull anxiety a one in dream moment expecting to see yarn of be composed part one by one under strain worst of be that strain be not steady one otherwise there might be hope that strand must withstand long enough to permit to reach bottom of quebrada at frequent interval there occurred couple of jerk one a clip passed round bar a slid over cliff edge of course at recurrence of jerk strain be momentarily increased to enormous extent presently that feared happened more than usually severe jerk occurred one of yarn in remaining strand parted escombe dully wondered how far still be from bottom fearful distance believed for seemed to be cruelly close to overhanging edge of cliff although have be hanging suspended for length of time seemed to more like hour than minute did not dare to look down for have feeling that if removed gaze from straining quivering strand for single instant must snap must go plunging downward to destruction then a watched yarn parted catastrophe be now inevitable lad began to speculate curiously from singularly impersonal point of view what sensation must be like when last yarn have snapped have read somewhere that sensation of falling from great height be distinctly pleasurable what about other upon reaching bottom quaint story came into mind about irishman who be said to have fallen off roof of house who upon being picked up be asked whether have be hurt by fall to man replied fall did hurt bit be stoppin ' so quick that did mischief humour of story be not very brilliant yet somehow seemed to escombe at moment to be ineffably amusing laughed aloud at quaintness of conceit a did so remaining yarn of second strand parted with little jerk thrilled through through hung there suspended by single strand still being lowered rapidly from above eye be now fixed intently upon unbroken strand distinctly saw stretching straightening out under weight a seemed to with inconceivable slowness then to such preternatural state of acuteness have sens be wrought by imminence certainty of ghastly disaster saw last strand slowly parting not yarn by yarn fibre by fibre until after what seemed to be veritable eternity of suspense last fibre snapped heard loud twang found floating a seemed to very gently downward so gently indeed that a be swung round facing rocky wall be able to note clearly distinctly inequality projection crack indentation in face of rock nay even felt that be worth while to do so must have have time enough to make sketch of one of a drifted slowly upward next thing of be conscious be loud swishing sound rose even above deafening brawl of water among rock that now remembered with surprise have be thundering in ear for how many month year be then became aware that be somehow among leaf branch again memory reproduced scene upon have looked when standing upon cliff edge at point from must command view of whole depth of gorge have idly noted that at very bottom of few inconsiderable shrub small tree nourished by eternal shower of spray grew here there from interstice of rock realised that have fallen into heart of one of contrived to grasp fairly stout branch with hand be much astonished when bent snapped like twig a body ploughed through thick growth knew that force of fall have be broken for first time since have made discovery of severed strand hope came that after might emerge from adventure with life then alighted on foot on great moss grown boulder felt leg double up collapse under sank into huddled heap upon wet slippery moss shot off into leaping foaming water knew more chapter four mama cachama when young escombe regained sens be night so supposed for be darkness about save for such imperfect illumination a came from small wood fire flickered crackled cheerfully in one corner of apartment in found apartment nay be far too large much too spacious in dimension to be room in ordinary house wall a much a must be seen of in faint ruddy glow of firelight be altogether too rough rugged to have be fashioned by human hand while roof be so high that flickering light of flame be not strong enough to reach be cavern without doubt harry began to wonder vaguely by what mean have come there for upon awakening mind have be in state of most utter confusion be not until have lain patiently waiting for idea to arrange have thereby come to consciousness that be aching in bone fibre of body while latter be almost entirely swathed in bandage that recollection of adventure returned to even then memory of be dreamy one indeed did not feel at certain that entire incident be not dream from beginning to end that must not presently awake to find on cot in tent with cold clear dawn peering in past unfolded flap day arduous work before finally concluded that fire upon eye rested be too real more especially that pain be too acute insistent for to be dreaming then fell to wondering afresh how in name of fortune have found unconscious way into cave upon pallet supported fire be only thing in cavern be distinctly visible certain object there be here there vague suggestion of came went with rise fall of flame what be harry must not determine there be among other matter object on far side of fire looked not unlike bundle of rag when escombe in attempting to turn over into more comfortable position uttered involuntary groan a sharp twinge of pain shot through anatomy bundle stirred instantly resolved into quaintest figure of little old bowed indian woman that be possible to picture notwithstanding extreme age apparent decrepitude extraordinary old creature displayed marvellous activity in instant be on foot beside pallet peering eagerly anxiously into harry wide open eye result of inspection appeared to be satisfactory for presently turned away muttering to herself in tongue be quite incomprehensible to patient disappeared in enveloping darkness only to reappear moment later with small cup in hand containing draught of very dark brown almost black liquid of exceedingly pungent rather agreeable bitter taste placed to lip lad at once swallowed without demur effect of draught be instantaneous a be marvellously stimulating exhilarating must also have possessed very remarkable tonic property for scarcely have escombe swallowed when sensation of absolutely ravenous hunger assailed ah sighed that be good feel ever so much better now mother continued in spanish feel hungry can find something to eat aha feel hungry do responded old woman in same language good be prepared for wait moment caro mio until can heat broth hunger will soon be satisfied with birdlike briskness characterised action moved away into shadow presently returning with three iron rod in hand dexterously arranged in form of tripod over fire from suspended small iron pot then taking few dry stick from bundle heaped up near fire broke into short length carefully introduced one by one here there into flame coaxing into brisk blaze soon caused most savoury appetising steam to rise from pot next from hidden receptacle produced bowl spoon emptied smoking content of pot into former then carefully propping patient into sitting position proceeded to feed stew be delicious to extent indeed that harry felt constrained to compliment hostess upon composition to ask of what be made be much astonished also must be confessed little disgusted when old lady simply answered lagarto lizard there be doubt however that have greatly enjoyed meal felt distinctly better for therefore put squeamishness on one side asked companion to enlighten a to manner in came to be where be be very simple answered old woman while son yupanqui be fishing in river two day ago caught sight of something unusual lying at edge of sandbank upon paddling balsa to spot found insensible body lying stranded there bruised bleeding so like sensible boy took up brought hither a quickly a possible in order might exercise skill in attempt to restore to life managed to do so at last between be caduco crazy must tell nothing of for spoke persistently in language that did not understand so a soon a be seen that must live busied in dressing wound bruise after prepared for certain medicine a expected threw into deep sleep from have at length awakened in right mind now have to lie still allow wound to heal reminds that now be very favourable time to dress afresh two day ago stranded on sandbank repeated escombe in bewilderment understand mother surely have not be lying insensible for two whole day how must possibly have become stranded on sandbank fell into river in quebrada be prepared to avouch that there be sandbank there in quebrada be possible echoed old woman why end of quebrada be more than mile away from where yupanqui found think begin to understand little be not spaniard can tell that by accent therefore must be ingles one of ingenieros who be making new railway among mountain be not so have guessed mother answered escombe yes be taking measurement in quebrada when rope by be hanging broke fell into tree thence on to rock beneath after lost consciousness ah exclaimed old woman a proceeded to remove deftly bandage re dress harry hurt yes be wonderful very wonderful for if have not chanced to fall into tree before striking rock must certainly have be killed can quite understand can not understand how after having fallen into river escaped being dashed to piece upon many rock among flow how having escaped that death afterwards escaped drowning in deep water for must have be swept along quite mile after issuing from quebrada be true that when yupanqui found be lying upon back so that suppose be reason why river did not suffocate hurt be doing famously senor ingles thanks to knowledge of simple there be only one in head be likely to give trouble will soon mend that if can prevail upon to lie still not disturb bandage oh answered harry will do that right now that sens have come back to fear for must get well quickly return to work a soon a possible meanwhile mother where be son must like to send with message to engineer camp if will go to let know that be alive assuredly assuredly assented queer old creature a assiduously bathed wound in harry head with hot fomentation have specially prepared be out hunting now evening be drawing in expect back ere long when return will hear what have to say about doubtless will willingly go if camp be near spot where think must have fallen will take quite day to reach day echoed harry aghast how be must have thought that hour must have be mark nay son answered old woman will have to travel fast to do in day know how difficult be to travel from place to place among mountain even when one know way will have to go long way round to reach spot of be thinking for there be many impassable precipice in course to say nothing of bog in if one be not very careful one can disappear leaving trace behind harry must understand now that have be explained to for have already have experience of impassable precipice bottomless morass spoken of by companion be disconcerting to say least of that must occupy so long to send message to camp for taking into consideration fact that have already be two day absent that must require half day to send message chance be that when yupanqui reached spot must find survey party gone must be obliged to follow up until must overtake also began to wonder how long must be before injury must be sufficiently healed to allow to travel over road of so difficult character a hinted at in companion remark have only to attempt to move on pallet to feel intolerable aching in limb resulted from effort to understand that day probably at least week must elapse ere must be fit to attempt journey meanwhile where must survey party be how must be faring without must butler do must take harry death for granted proceed singlehanded with survey must send out search party to seek for trace of lost assistant must of necessity do one other comforting reflection came to harry that even if first course be adopted party must not get very far away without being overtaken how long do think will be mother before will be able to rise move about again enquired nay son who can tell save good god who hold life in hand answered old woman may be two week may be two month according to whether not fever return much must depend upon if keep quite quiet become impatient may be able to rise go into open for short time in two week possibly even in le must do in thing exactly a say if wish to get well quickly may trust in for have seen many year have always be skilled in art of healing will trust of course answered harry reaching out at cost of pain squeezing old creature clawlike hand get well a quickly a can mother will not find ungrateful have mean of rewarding liberally for trouble a soon a can return to camp reward ejaculated old woman angrily snatching away hand who spoke of reward require reward if by that mean money payment have need of money cave have provided with dry comfortable housing for many year while garden outside son hunting fishing furnish with ample food what need have of money pardon mother exclaimed harry penitently did not mean to offend if need money there be perhaps other thing that son may be glad to have must let show gratitude to in way for can not forget that to son owe life ay ay ay ay be a may be muttered old creature a though speaking to herself there added a having completed dressing of escombe injury secured last bandage be done now more medicine then more sleep therewith bustled away into shadow returning few minute later with generous draught foamed sparkled in goblet like champagne left taste of sickly sweetness upon palate a invalid swallowed dose sensation of great ease comfort permeated entire system next moment be asleep when harry next awoke feeling very much better saw that hostess fine stalwart copper coloured young indian whom took to be son be seated at roughly framed table at little distance from cot taking meal by light of earthenware lamp conversing together in low tone in language with be unfamiliar from manner in pair glanced in direction from time to time rather suspected that be subject of conversation be being conducted with much earnestness especially by old woman that be maintaining very keen watch upon patient be perfectly evident for at harry first movement sprang to foot snatching up lamp rapidly approached bedside peering down into eye with same intense eagerness that have before exhibited muttering mumbling to herself excitedly while ah ah exclaimed in tone of much satisfaction so be awake again at last have slept well long friend slept through night without movement skin be cool too continued laying skinny hand on harry forehead cool moist fever what of pain be still severe a ever pain exclaimed hal moving slightly why seems almost gone what magic be magic at chuckled quaint old creature merely poor old indian woman skill in simple be doing excellently well senor ingles better even than dared hope now be hungry be not so good breakfast be ready will be brought to instantly when have finished there be son yupanqui who be ready to take message that may desire to send to camp excellently roasted bird patient subsequently learned be parrot bread made of indian corn flour cup of delicious chocolate be speedily dispatched then harry having asked for notebook have be found in pocket carefully dried pencilled note to butler briefly informing that individual of escape of hope that must be sufficiently recovered from injury to rejoin camp in about fortnight time dispatched yupanqui with describing to indian probable situation of camp a nearly a must instructing man to give only into hand of englishman to ask for reply be to bring back with next few day passed uneventfully save that invalid progress toward recovery be so rapid satisfactory that about midday of third day harry who began to find bed becoming very wearisome be allowed by nurse to rise clad in trouser remains of shirt go a far a entrance of cave sit there for hour two enjoying magnificent prospect greeted astonished eye found that cave have afforded such perfect shelter during helplessness formed chamber rather series of chamber in enormous mass of rock rose sheer out of little circular basin like valley through flowed stream from quebrada water here spreading out in form of lake measuring about mile across evidently rather willow for here there must see small sandbank showing clear of water be upon one of that have be found stranded by yupanqui quebrada died out in valley about mile from mouth of cave a must be seen when spot be indicated by old indian woman escombe wondered more than ever by what chance senseless body have be carried so far by rushing water without destroying such life a remained in ground sloped rather steeply from cave down to water edge eight ten acre of have be dug up at interval planted with maize vegetable of various kind fruit tree among harry recognised peach orange mulberry cacao be wonder told that queer kind hearted old hostess indignantly disclaimed need of money for with produce of garden what yupanqui must bring in from forest river seemed to that want except perhaps in matter of clothes must be abundantly supplied so far a clothes be concerned doubtless cultivated ground yielded superabundance ample enough to afford mean of bartering for such simple clothing a needed valley be of basin like form side of growing ever steeper a receded from middle until eventually merged into mountain slope hemmed in valley on side went rolling away ridge beyond ridge in interminable perspective until in extreme distance terminated in snow clad peak of andes harry hostess who now mentioned that bore name of cachama appeared to be in singularly communicative mood day for beguiled time by not only pointing out naming principal peak in sight also related several very interesting legend connected with certain of with country generally going back to time before conquest painting in dazzling glory of inca dynasty incredible wealth of ancient ruler of peru appeared to be pretty intimately acquainted with history of conquest of country by pizarro have many bitter thing to say of strange pusillanimity of inca atahuallpa on fatal th of november when went open eyed into trap prepared for at caxamalca suffered to be seized in presence of entire army by mere handful of spaniard gave most emphatic denial to suggestion that country have benefited by civilised condition have followed conquest said be infinitely worse off in way to day than be under rule of inca poverty misery oppression suffering of kind be to be met with on hand wherever one go while four hundred year ago have far higher state of civilisation than now exists in poverty oppression with countless attendant evil be unknown will not last for ever tell brighter happier day be in store for of ancient race perhaps even old a be may live to see yes poor though be compelled to lodge worn out body in cave have royal blood in vein a have husband yupanqui be descended from huayna capac for atahuallpa incredible folly might have be enjoying comfort affluence to day ay possibly husband might also have be living escombe have read prescott conquest of peru during schooldays romantic story have implanted within mind keen interest in everything pertaining to history of country have never waned have received fresh stimulus when learned that be not only to visit spend time in peru also to explore certain part of now to find actually conversing with someone who claimed descent from proud inca who appeared to have lived in regal splendour only to be equalled by of potentate of arabian night seemed to to be rare slice of good luck be therefore careful to say nothing calculated to divert conversation from channel in be so satisfactorily flowing on contrary did everything must to keep there be however very much surprised to find hostess looking forward so confidently to brighter happier time for despised indian race for if one thing seemed absolutely certain be that time be not very far distant when few scattered survivor must perish race vanish from face of earth be therefore in somewhat incredulous tone that turned to cachama said what ground have for hope must call certainty that better day be in store for race to seems that there be very few of left ay answered may so seem to for have a yet seen little of country save terra caliente very few of be now to be found near coast when get farther up among mountain especially when get into neighbourhood of lake titicaca will find that have not perished furthermore be said with what truth know not that when atahuallpa fell into hand of conquistador be strangled by torchlight in great plaza of caxamalca many of noble who have be with fled with family into heart of mountain establishing in certain secret place set to work at bidding of one titucocha priest of sun to build new city of sun beside glory of of cuzco be to be a nothing against time when lord sun must again send manco capac founder of inca dynasty back to earth to restore dynasty in ancient splendour do really believe that restoration be possible asked escombe with smile at old woman credulity ay answered cachama with conviction more than believe know for have gift of foreknowledge to certain extent from earliest childhood have felt convinced that prophecy be true can not explain how why only know that be so with passage of year have ever felt that time for fulfilment be drawing nearer until now know that be so close at hand even old though be may live to see must must feel a sure of continuance of dynasty a be of restoration can not can only see dimly up to certain point beyond everything be misty uncertain with vague suggestion of disaster fill with foreboding chapter five have become of butler on second day after dispatch of yupanqui to surveyor camp have duly returned with curt officially worded note from butler acknowledging receipt of escombe report of accident result requesting latter to rejoin survey party with least possible delay a absence be cause of much inconvenience delay in progress of survey not word of regret at occurrence of accident much le anything must be construed into admission that writer own unreasonable demand order be cause of mishap not even word of congratulation at escombe narrow escape from terrible death simply formal request that must rejoin with least possible delay for certain good sufficient reason poor harry shrugged shoulder with something very like contempt for hidebound creature who be to great extent master of fate who seemed to be absolutely destitute of very smallest shred of good feeling felt that must be quite hopeless to look for praise appreciation from such man foresaw that fellow must appropriate to credit might result from expedition lay upon harry shoulder onus of shortcoming of complete success came to conclusion since chief be not worth putting out for must remain where be until be quite certain that must travel with perfect safety resume duty immediately upon return to camp be young possessed thoroughly sound constitution moreover have miraculously escaped with unbroken bone recovery therefore be rapid on nineteenth day after accident rejoined camp formally reported a prepared to resume duty have be butler custom from commencement of survey to flag out certain length of route daily to insist without very much regard to difficulty of task that amount of work must be done by nightfall length of route usually amounted to from two to three mile escombe have once twice protested when natural difficulty of work be excessive that must not undertake to guarantee accuracy of work if so much be demanded of to butler have retorted that in opinion amount of work demanded be exceedingly moderate that must expect to be done that must hold escombe responsible for inaccuracy yet upon escombe return to camp found that during nineteen day of absence butler have advanced survey by distance of le than four mile explanation elder man condescended to make being that during four day immediately following accident survey work at have be done whole body of peon having be scattered in various direction seeking clue to harry fate for week two after escombe return to camp matter went very much more smoothly whether be that harry accident have given butler wholesome fright that conviction have be forced upon latter that have be outrageously exacting there be nothing to show certain be that for while escombe be allowed to take own time over work do own way with result while state of affair lasted lad actually took pleasure in nay thoroughly enjoyed work on third week after return harry began to detect sign that agreeable condition be drawing to end thenceforth butler allowed to gradually drift back into former exacting autocratic way until at length life in camp again became veritable purgatory for everybody concerned butler included natural result of tyrannical conduct being that everybody harry excepted did everything in power to thwart while even lad ceased to attempt apparently impossible task of pleasing chief in unpleasant unsatisfactory manner railway survey proceeded for two month following escombe return to duty by time butler behaviour have become so unendurable that nearly three fourth of peon originally engaged have deserted notwithstanding fact that desertion involved in loss of sum in wage to humble toiler represented quite little fortune place have be filled by others of much le desirable type in way be more to be regretted since surveyor be now in very heart of mountain where natural difficulty to be contended with be at worst while newcomer being of course utterly strange to such work have to be taught duty down to simplest detail under most adverse condition possible can be readily understood that attempt to instruct set of ignorant stupid sullen lawless half caste under such condition be task of surpassing difficulty resulting in constant acute friction demanding nicest judgment utmost diplomacy upon part of teacher harry met difficulty by bringing to assistance almost sublime patience that in course of time not very long time completely wore down opposition of unwilling pupil brought change in mental attitude be a surprising a be satisfactory butler however knew not meaning of word patience did character contain smallest particle of valuable quality method be what termed rough ready consisted in emphasising order item of construction with kick be not surprising therefore that relation between peon daily grew more strained be when tension between butler on one hand peon on other have developed to extent that labourer have be goaded into state of almost open mutiny that former set out a usual on horseback one morning accompanied by half dozen of new hand to seek for stake out few mile farther of practicable route duty a usually contrived to complete in time to return to camp for lunch after be wont to saunter out along line until encountered harry when must spend remainder of day in making poor lad life burden to by finding fault with everything did frequently insisting upon having particularly awkward difficult piece of work done over again consequently progress of survey be abnormally exasperatingly slow when upon day in question butler failed to put in appearance on scene of operation young escombe first feeling be one of gratification for be just then engaged upon exceptionally difficult task be most anxious to complete without being interfered with so absorbed be lad in work that have not much thought to spare for speculation a to reason for so unusual piece of good luck although be true that a afternoon wore on did once twice permit to wonder whether perchance have to thank slight touch of indisposition possibly sprained ankle for unexpected most welcome freedom from interruption when at length upon arrival in camp at conclusion of day survey work learned to astonishment that butler party of peon have returned impression forced upon that something serious have happened mustering afresh own gang of tired hungry assistant providing with lantern rope other aid to search led forth along survey line in quest of absent one for distance of nearly two mile from camp route of missing party be easily followed being marked by stake at frequent interval indicating line chosen by butler a to be surveyed by escombe ended at foot of precipitous slope of bare rock towering aloft seven eight hundred foot with further height beyond here searcher be brought to abrupt halt for harry be fully aware that sane engineer must for single moment dream of carrying ordinary railway up that rocky acclivity while be well understood that rack system of construction be to be avoided if possible upon score of expense probability be that butler upon reaching point finding confronted by necessity to make wide detour alternatively to consider question of tunnel have struck off to right to left on tour of investigation there be chance that becoming involved in maze like intricacy of surroundings have decided to camp out for night rather than risk accident by attempting to return in darkness over difficult ground be question harry felt ought to be settled forthwith accordingly issued instruction to peon to search for spoor of party follow up to find spoor be very easy matter for last stake have be driven in comparatively soft ground despite fact that be by time almost pitch dark short search aided by light of lantern disclosed hoof print of butler horse led off to left be followed until searcher found on border of extensive pine wood growing on hard steeply rising ground over be impossible to trace further trail in darkness impossibility once realised search be abandoned for night harry very reluctantly gave word for return to camp be reached about nine o'clock at daybreak next morning camp be roused breakfast prepared eaten taking with ration to last until search party again set out upon quest making way direct to spot where trail have be lost on previous night where be again picked up without much trouble led in straight toward heart of wood be followed with ever increasing difficulty for distance of about three quarter of mile until be lost on hard shaley ground be utmost effort of party equal to finding again after carefully considering situation therefore escombe detailed one man indian to accompany placing remainder of peon in charge of man whom believed must trust with instruction to search wood thoroughly returned to outskirt of timber beginning at spot where trail entered proceeded with assistance of indian to encircle wood carefully examining foot of ground a went in hope that if butler party have passed through timber emerged on other side indian must succeed in picking up spoor hope be vain for wood be completely encircled task occupying entire day without discovery of faintest trace sign of passage of missing party be not at surprising for when far side of wood be reached soil proved to be of so stony character thickly interspersed with great outcrop of rock even most skilled keen eyed of tracker might have be excused for failing in search for footprint on so unyielding surface be little puzzling to harry that not even horse have left trace behind be accounted for when upon rejoining party who have be detailed to search interior of wood be discovered that animal have be found by still saddled bridled wandering aimlessly about in search of such scanty herbage a soil there afforded upon horse being brought to young englishman mindful of scarcely concealed hatred butler have almost wantonly a seemed aroused in breast of peon immediately subjected animal trapping to most rigorous examination in search of sign of possible violence nothing of kind must be found only result of examination be conclusion to everything pointed that butler have for reason voluntarily dismounted at least temporarily abandoned animal butler party have now be missing for full twenty four hour harry speedily arrived at two conclusion inexorably led to third first conclusion at arrived be that peon who have accompanied chief accustomed a have be from earliest childhood to make way about country be so little likely to have lost way that theory might be unhesitatingly abandoned second be that butler must certainly not have absented purposely from camp for whole night day therefore be third conclusion something have gone very seriously wrong next problem presented for solution be what be have gone wrong have entire party met with accident be most unlikely there be seven of in event of accident surely at least one of seven must have escaped returned to camp for help have be seized carried off by brigand when harry put question to peon who remained with be laughed at good naturedly assured that in first place there be brigand in peru so far a be aware in second place that if perchance there be must probably not have contented with simply carrying off seven men six of whom must be only encumbrance to must almost certainly have attacked sacked camp time during hour of daylight when be left comparatively unprotected there be one other probable alternative of harry must think be that butler peon exasperated at length beyond endurance by fresh piece of petty tyranny on white man part have deserted carrying off employer with with purpose of being revenged upon in hope that by holding a hostage might be able to secure payment of amount of wage due to when escombe submitted alternative to peon for consideration opinion shook head emphatically declared that did not believe that such thing have happened when further asked for opinion a to what have happened simply answered that did not know what to think to harry seemed that there be certain lack of spontaneity in reply caused to doubt whether speaker be quite sincere in so saying with very heavy load of responsibility thus unexpectedly thrown upon shoulder young englishman spent several anxious hour in camp night pondering upon be proper course for now to pursue finally came to conclusion that having ascertained beyond much possibility of doubt that chief have be abducted next thing to be done be to discover whither under what circumstance have be carried off then to take necessary step to effect rescue on following morning therefore mustered peon who still remained with briefly explaining to theory of abduction dispatched six of in a many different direction to seek for trace of missing party offering substantial reward to one who must bring such information a must lead to recovery of missing white man then taking couple of sure footed mule set off in company with indian tracker to scour entire neighbourhood in hope of obtaining clue to whereabouts of missing party from of people by whom that particular part of country be sparsely inhabited in order to avoid loss of time must be entailed by returning to camp at night took with three day provision for guide intending to carry out a exhaustive search a possible in space of time thus far search have be prosecuted entirely in forward direction at last moment before setting out upon three day quest suddenly occurred to escombe that missing one might possibly have doubled back be making way toward sea coast so in order to test value of theory determined to return few mile along line of survey see whether must discover trace of in direction at time surveyor be in heart of exceptionally difficult tract of country where obstacle to rapid work be such that since harry return to duty after adventure in quebrada have not advanced very much more than twenty mile from spot thus be still early in afternoon of first day when found gazing down into abyss wherein have so narrowly escaped terrible death by natural association of idea sooner beheld scene so indelibly engraven upon memory than thought reverted to cachama kind hearted old indian nurse son yupanqui vaguely wondered whether perhaps of might be able to afford information suggestion must assist in quest more thought of more did idea grow upon mind at length came to decision that might a well prosecute search in direction of cave a in other forthwith communicated decision to guide who somewhat to escombe surprise at once admitted that be well acquainted with cachama son offered to conduct young englishman to cave in two resided by short route if harry must consent to be blindfolded during passage of certain portion of way to lad readily agreed for be by time becoming exceedingly anxious on butler account thereupon indian having hobbled mule demanded harry pocket handkerchief immediately proceeded to blindfold owner therewith after with joined hand pair resumed way travelling for two full hour more over exceedingly broken difficult ground then pocket handkerchief be removed harry found standing in midst of number of enormous fallen boulder at foot of stupendous cliff facing opening in latter have appearance of being mouth of cavern by what route have arrived at spot must not tell for be so completely hemmed in on side by boulder in midst of stood that surrounding landscape be completely shut out nothing being visible save boulder face of cliff with opening in that be correct in surmise that opening be cavern be now demonstrated by indian guide who said be pleased to take hand again senor follow without fear be one of several entrance to cavern in cachama dwells will find ground smooth even for almost entire distance presently will find torch by to light way so a matter of fact did for after traversing ten fifteen yard indian halted releasing escombe hand be heard groping about in darkness moment later rattling of dry branch reached lad ear now senor came voice of indian out of darkness if will graciously condescend to produce fire by mean of small stick call match will soon have light to guide step so said so done a torch kindled blazed up pair found standing in rugged rock passage five foot wide about eight foot high with perfectly smooth floor in flickering uncertain light of torch presented appearance of having be brought into condition by human agency be not only smooth also level at point where stood even a started to resume journey indian bearing torch leading way harry saw that almost immediately began to dip ere have advanced many pace dip became so pronounced that smooth floor gave place to long flight of roughly hewn step at first broad willow rapidly steepening until became so narrow deep a to necessitate considerable amount of care in negotiation of to harry flight seemed interminable there must have be hundred of step for although lad did not time descent appeared to have occupied considerably more than hour at length once more reached level ground leaving step behind proceeded to traverse narrow winding passage air in smelt stale musty while here there be obliged to squeeze painful way between long spiky stalactite stalagmite until came to more step time leading upward harry counted there be only one hundred twenty three of be not nearly so steep a others then ceased pair came to gently rising floor along passed for about mile finally entering spacious chamber cavern where very much to young englishman surprise found cachama awaiting with torch in hand be perfectly evident that old lady be intensely angry for upon appearance of visitor darted toward shaking fist furiously in face of indian whom by way addressed a arima poured out upon torrent of strange word virulence of must be pretty accurately estimated by effect produced upon recipient for poor arima writhed under a though have be lash of whip for fully ten minute old woman stormed relentlessly before be reduced to silence through want of breath then indian got chance to reply apparently vindicate for a proceeded with what appeared to escombe to be explanation cachama wrath gradually subsided until became sufficiently mistress of herself to greet young white man did with more cordiality than previous outburst have led to expect welcome back to poor home senor exclaimed knew that be coming be glad to see that dolt arima enraged for brought by secret way although knew that be forbidden to reveal way even fact of existence to stranger tell however that matter be urgent that adopted precaution of blindfolding so that might not learn secret of approach therefore will let matter pas especially a feel certain have to express wish will forget way exists certainly will mama cachama answered harry cheerfully saved life not long ago must be ingrate indeed if refused to conform to wish in so simple matter a understood to say that knew be coming to how on earth must possibly know did know until few hour ago did not tell posse gift of foreknowledge remarked cachama somewhat impatiently have sooner conceived idea of coming to than became aware of nay even knew way by be coming be that knowledge angered for knew that must not visit cave by secret approach except with help of one of let pas follow to living room where have provided meal for while be partaking of may tell in what manner think can assist ten minute later escombe once more found in cavern knew so well partaking of most excellent stew detailing to hostess between mouthful particular relating to disappearance of butler party of peon brought recital to close by enquiring whether cachama yupanqui have chanced to see of missing one said cachama have not passed near here yupanqui must certainly have seen something of mentioned fact to have done well to come to for will be strange indeed if can not help wish to know what have become of senor whom call butler be not that so very well seat there before hold two hand in yours recall to mind a vividly a possible circumstance be ever so trivial that can remember relating to doings of day upon senor disappeared beginning with moment of awakening now begin for be ready while old creature spoke be arranging matter in such way that escombe must sit facing other knee to knee with hand clasped leaning slightly back in reclining posture with eye upturned toward invisible roof of cavern a finished speaking young englishman directed thought backward to morning of two day ago mentally reproducing incident of day beginning with moment when arose from camp bed intending to continue if need be to that other moment when after long fruitless search in pine wood cast on same bed at end of day completely exhausted sank to sleep when have reached latter point of retrospection mama cachama eye be closed to harry chagrin appeared to have fallen into deep sleep before however disappointment have found time to express in word old indian woman began to speak in low tone a though soliloquising murmured see quite distinctly white tent gleaming in brilliant sunshine of early morning with rope strained tight by dew have fallen heavily during night peon moving hither thither shivering in keen air a make preparation for day work horse mule feeding eagerly fire blazing cheerily blue smoke streaming straight up in still air yes see two

lift whip strike one of savagely with across face at a though blow be signal peon fling from burden whole of hurl upon white man bear to ground one who be struck raising machete a though to split skull of enemy chapter six found at point mama cachama became greatly agitated struggled violently in endeavour to wrench hand out of escombe grasp cry that be going to murder englishman that must not remain to see vision have thus far described be of so extraordinary character impressed young man so strongly with sense of reality truth that be determined to follow up clue a far a possible therefore resolutely retained grip upon old woman hand under impression that if released vision must pas possibly beyond recall suddenly cachama struggle ceased sighed a though relieved of great fear ah exclaimed will not kill after one of peon intervenes pointing out that if englishman be killed none of may dare to again show face in town for information of murder will be given peruvian corporation who have employed englishman to do work for will never rest until one of murderer be brought to justice others understand at once agree that there will be murder be binding englishman hand

from late captor must of chance to awake miss now walk rapidly forward constantly glancing over shoulder in fear lest must be pursued in manner soon place couple of mile between sleeping peon belief that be now returning toward camp over ground have already traversed hastens onward a fast a uneven nature of ground will permit night be dark star be obscured by heavy mass of threatening rain cloud there be therefore beacon by can guide footstep unsuspected by have gradually swung round until be heading south east now gathering storm break rain fall heavily in few minute unhappy fugitive be drenched to skin chilled to marrow by fierce bitter wind come swooping down from snowfield glacier of higher andes yet dare not take shelter from storm even in recess of clump of scrub for fear that by dawn at latest enemy will be on track forgetful ignorant of fact that storm will obliterate trail from dog experienced tracker of peon have none fugitive be madly anxious to put a many mile a possible between pursuer on stagger blindly breathlessly whipped by pelting rain buffeted by furious wind half fainting already from exhaustion yet spurred on by unreasoning terror think that unless be quickly rescued englishman will die escombe shuddered went white to lip man whose wandering footstep have be faithfully traced through mama cachama marvellous clairvoyant gift be remorseless tyrant in petty way so curiously constituted that one idea of pleasure appeared to be making miserable life of about even to going out of way to do so to such extent indeed that men have be heard to say bitterly a in case of noxious animal reptile world must be better for death young englishman must recall without effort many occasion when have be so harassed worried existence so embittered by impish spite of same butler that even gentle kindly a be disposition in general believed must have contemplated demise of other with feeling not far removed from equanimity yet now that man be in actual peril be forgotten generous instinct in lad sprang at once to surface one idea be to hurry to rescue cried eagerly tell exactly where to find will go at once bring in wait muchacho wait exclaimed cachama impatiently let follow first a far a may lest lose for now way be growing erratic mind body be becoming numb with misery of plight no longer have clear knowledge of anything one conviction haunt being that must press onward anywhere no matter where otherwise pursuer will overtake put to terrible death ah now dawn break storm be subsiding englishman take note of seems quite incapable of noticing anything now run on aimlessly panting gasping breath bursting from labouring lung in great sob eye staring unseeingly before limb quivering staggering beneath thin clothing clinging in saturated tatter to body be streaked here there with blood where thorn have torn a burst through in headlong flight aha end must surely now be drawing near for see foam upon lip be tinged with blood rapidly grows deeper crimson reel stumble a run be down yes be up again stagger onwards for few yard now be down again falling with crash rolling over on back with outstretched arm lie motionless eye closed blood trickling out of corner of mouth be dead mama cachama be dead gasped escombe grievance forgotten now sense of pity stirred to uttermost depth by shocking plight of chief so graphically painted by word of old indian woman nay answered cachama still life for chest heave now then gasp for breath flight be ended for present at least if must find with life still in body must surely hasten how will find demanded harry must direct how to go straight to where lie for must be necessary for to pick up trail follow that must be dead long ere must reach where be arima demanded cachama let come to be here answered indian drawing near to old woman then listen attentively arima mark well what say commanded mama spoke to for full minute more in indian tongue of escombe comprehended enough to understand that be describing what might be termed bearing of spot where butler lay exhausted senseless arima nodding head understanding murmuring here there word of comprehension a went on description ended paused for few second then murmured be enough now let awake for be old have wandered afar journey have wearied whereupon after interval of minute two slowly opened eye stared about vacantly for little finally said ah yes remember be to tell something senor have learned what desired to know yes thanks answered harry always provided of course that that be about to say that information be reliable substituted for somewhat ungracious word that arima can find spot have described to think that can find arima demanded old woman yes mama cachama answered arima will find without doubt for have listened attentively to that have said already know direction generally in to seek while particular have given be so explicit that can scarcely miss exact spot be well approved cachama then turning to escombe said now senor if will remain with for rest of day coming night will give pleasure will do best for comfort afternoon be wellnigh spent if a understood to say started from camp shortly after daybreak morning can scarcely return to ere nightfall way be rough dangerous one to travel in darkness nevertheless with many thanks for hospitable offer must go answered harry for matter be urgent a must know for last word to be that if must find friend with life still in must hasten nay amigo know nothing of what told while in state of trance answered old woman whatever may have be may depend that be true therefore if bade hasten be certain that hasten must in case must be kindness in to urge to stay yet will not go until have again eaten drank thanks again mama answered harry fear must a have said afternoon be far advanced there be therefore more reason why must make best possible use of remaining moment of daylight if will excuse therefore will bid adios go forthwith have rendered inestimable service mama for mere word of thanks seem very inadequate recompense yet will not offend by offering other reward still if there be way there be none at present amigo mio interrupted old woman do wish recompense beyond thanks if a say have be able to help be glad will be glad to help again whenever a often a may need assistance nevertheless looking with sudden intentness into young englishman eye think nay be certain that time be coming when if care to remember mama cachama yupanqui will be glad that befriended rest assured then mama that when time arrives will not be forgotten answered harry now adios until meet again remember to yupanqui say that be sorry must not stay to see be ready arima then march be close upon midnight when escombe indian guide rode into camp after fatiguing somewhat adventurous journey for a mama cachama have said way be rough by mean devoid of danger even in daytime while at night danger be multiplied hundredfold enquiry revealed that none of six peon whom harry have that morning despatched to seek for trace of missing party have returned young man therefore gave arima instruction to make necessary preparation to start with at daybreak in search of spot at cachama have described butler a falling exhausted after terrible flight through night storm of course harry scarcely expected to find butler there still le did hope for in event must only too probably mean that missing man be dead whereas harry hoped that after lying exhausted for perhaps hour chief must recover strength enough to make further effort to return to camp knew that in case search must necessarily start from spot indicated by cachama for spot therefore must make in first instance be broad daylight sun have not yet risen above snow capped andes when escombe accompanied by arima of mounted upon sturdy mule indian leading butler saddled bridled horse rode out of camp next morning on quest for missing man taking with week ration for similar quantity for butler use must be fortunate enough to find a well a small supply of medical comfort whole contained in pack securely strapped upon saddle of led horse for first hour route followed by arima be identical with described by mama cachama while in clairvoyant state when reached wood wherein butler horse have be found straying indian bore away to right skirting belt of timber for distance cut through near southern extremity emerging upon mountain spur three mile from much higher than spot where first search party have come out crest of spur now lay about mile in front of upon reaching traveller beheld magnificent prospect before mountain spur sloped away steeply from foot plunging down until be lost in wide densely wooded ravine about mile in width beyond ground again rose somewhat irregularly in wide sweep of upland gradually merging into foothill viewed from distance appeared to be advance guard of towering andes atmosphere be exquisitely clear revealing object in landscape with photographic sharpness arima paused for few minute with double object of breathing animal taking good long comprehensive view of scene before for minute gazed intently at many landmark that stretched away before on hand at length turned to escombe said pointing see twin peak yonder senor assuredly assented harry also see that hill between one mean with cloud shadow resting upon cause to tell up dark against sunlit mountain slope beyond certainly again assented harry be few mile on other side of hill that will find spot of mama cachama spoke explained arima then recognise various mark described for guidance do believe that actually saw in trance without doubt senor answered indian in tone of surprise a though wondered at slight hint of incredulity suggested by question do think that when arrive will find chief there asked harry nay senor can not say answered arima know that if be still there when reach spot will be dead yes assented escombe fear be right how long will take to reach spot will do well if get there before sun sink way down heaven to morrow be answer to morrow ejaculated harry incredulously how far then be from where now stand if must ride straight to might reach to day two hour before sunset answered arima be impossible senor road lie off yonder to right along slope of mountain to nearest point at will be possible for to cross ravine when have accomplished that there will still be toilsome ride of three hour before ere can hope to emerge from ravine on other side will be fortunate if accomplish so much before be overtaken by darkness be that so questioned harry then in case have better press forward without further delay digging heel into rib of mule young englishman resumed march be shortly after three o'clock on following afternoon when arima who for previous half hour have be riding slowly studying ground intently suddenly reined up mule leaping lightly to ground knelt down carefully examined long coarse grass thickly carpeted soil for full minute remained thus delicately fingering blade gently pushing aside then rose to foot with sigh of satisfaction pointed with finger saying here be trail of chief senor came from yonder went in direction be sure arima demanded harry can see sign of passage of man through grass very possibly not senor answered arima dryly because see be not accustomed to tracking moreover trail be day old be made while grass be wet beaten down by rain be there nevertheless for practised eye to read being found can now be easily followed when chief passed here be in terribly exhausted state staggered a ran exactly a mama cachama described for just here stumbled if honour will take trouble to dismount can see mark where toe of boot dug into soil think spot where fell finally can not be very far from here in case said harry let press on a quickly a possible for even minute may be of inestimable value now a to dismounting examining mark for have time for at present arima be quite content to take word for that matter be a say can follow trail mounted must proceed on foot can follow mounted senor seeing be mounted when found answered arima will be well that must ride few yard behind lest trail must swerve suddenly to right left be crossed by mule so saying indian sprang into saddle turning head of animal rode forward at foot pace eye intently searching sea of waving grass before for quarter of hour rode on thus with harry leading butler horse following yard two in rear then suddenly reined mule aside pointing to barely perceptible depression in grass said see senor there be where chief first fell a described by mama cachama yes a keen eye roved hither thither yonder be spot where fell lay few pace brought to spot indicated here sign be clear enough for even escombe untrained eye to read grass being still depressed sufficiently to show that human form have lain there motionless stretched at length for several hour moreover at part of depression where man head have rested grass blade be still flecked here there with dried ruddy beneath lay little patch of coagulated blood from swarm of fly arose a arima bent over pointed out to harry fugitive have disappeared indian gave a opinion that chief have revived after lying insensible for about six hour have immediately resumed interrupted flight a to direction in have gone there be difficulty in determining that for leading away toward eastward there be two wavering line close together traced through long grass by foot of wanderer still distinct enough to be followed by even so inexperienced tracker a young englishman now arima exclaimed harry be there anything worth knowing to be gained by prolonged examination of form ' because if not will press on at once since time be precious chief went in direction of course even can see trail be so clear that ought to be able to follow at canter yes quite easily senor acquiesced arima there be nothing to be learned here beyond fact that senor butler fell at spot lay absolutely motionless for so long time that must have be in swoon then revived sat up rose to knee see there be impression of two knee of toe of boot behind then stood for several minute a though uncertain whither must go finally struck off to eastward see how trail waver way way even in short length of that can trace from here moved quite aimlessly not knowing whither must go think that if be still alive when find senor will be quite crazy so much greater reason for finding a quickly a possible mount ride arima exclaimed harry pressing heel into mule side urging animal into canter along plainly marked trail until be taught better by indian never ride immediately over trail be following senor close beside on one side other of so that trail be left quite undisturbed one never can tell when may be necessary to study trail carefully in search of bit of information might easily be obliterated if be ridden walked over harry at once pulled mule to one side of trail arima following on opposite side pair pushed on winding hither thither a track of fugitive swerved way that until have travelled further distance of nine ten mile when came upon form where butler have laid down to rest for a arima estimated space of about two hour there be nothing of importance to be learned here therefore pushed forward again with possible speed for sun be now rapidly declining toward western horizon escombe be anxious to find wanderer before if possible since night exposure in keen air of elevated plain might very well prove fatal to man in butler terribly exhausted condition for last hour of pursuit track have led over rising ground soon became pretty evident that fugitive have be making uncertain way toward gorge between two mountain have gradually be opening out ahead of pursuer meanwhile spoor have be growing fresher with stride of cantering mule showing that tracker be rapidly gaining upon chase that latter be now in very last stage of exhaustion for form where have paused to rest be ever becoming more frequent closer together indian therefore after attentively studying last form be encountered gave a opinion that hunted man must not now be more than mile two ahead suggested that harry must push straight on for entrance of gorge in hope of sighting fugitive running down while arima with led horse must continue to follow trail for if butler must gain gorge before being overtaken pursuit over rocky ground might be slow difficult accordingly harry turned mule slightly aside from trail made straight for landmark indicated by indian pressing beast forward at best pace have ridden thus about quarter of hour be rapidly approaching entrance of gorge when suddenly caught sight of moving object ahead winding way among number of mass of granite outcrop urging exhausted mule to final effort escombe presently have satisfaction of identifying moving object a man white man attired in few tattered remnant of what have once be civilised clothing that man be butler there must be shadow of doubt few stride farther enabled harry to recognise a did so stumbling staggering figure paused for moment glanced behind saw that be pursued whereupon flung arm above head emitted most horrible eldritch scream started to run forward again staggered few pace fell forward prone upon ground where lay motionless chapter seven jewel reining up mule escombe at once glanced behind to ascertain whether arima happened to be within sight yes there be about mile distant pushing along at trot winding hither thither a persistently followed erratic twisting turning of pursued man spoor harry therefore drew revolver from belt pointing muzzle of weapon upward discharged two shot in rapid succession to attract indian attention then waved white pocket handkerchief in air a sign that lost man have be found that pursuit be at end indian immediately uttered peculiar shrill whoop by way of reply turned beast head directly toward spot where young englishman must be seen sitting motionless in saddle whereupon harry at once sprang to ground throwing mule bridle upon grass sign animal have be trained to obey by standing perfectly still rushed toward prostrate figure turning gently over raised to sitting posture passing arm round neck a support to drooping head yes man be butler there must be doubt about oh what dreadful change have be wrought by few day of flight exposure butler have always be man of somewhat spare build now be emaciated to extent almost past belief cheek be so hollow that seemed a though incautiously rough touch must cause protruding cheek bone to burst through skin closed eye be sunk so deep in socket that eyeball appeared to have dwindled to size of small marble while lip have contracted to extent a to leave tightly clenched teeth clearly visible general effect being that of grinning fleshless skull with covering of shrivelled skin drawn tightly over once immaculate suit of white clothing be now deeply soiled stained by contact with earth grass be mere wrapping of scarcely recognisable rag coat being missing altogether while great rent in remaining garment revealed protruding rib shrunken limb colour of yellowish brown skin being almost completely obscured by latticing of long deep blood smeared scratch mutely told how desperately man have fought way through obstacle in headlong panic stricken flight finger nail be broken ragged boot be cut torn to piece to extent that afforded scarcely protection to foot once iron grey hair moustache a well a short growth of stubbly beard be almost perfectly white with quick slash of knife escombe severed filthy wisp of silk have once be smart necktie a have somehow become tightly knotted round unconscious man throat then impatiently awaited coming of arima who be leading horse on saddle of be strapped small supply of medical comfort have be brought along to meet just contingency a few minute later indian cantered up flinging from back of mule came forward to render assistance bidding man kneel down support unconscious butler head harry sprang to saddle bag drew forth flask of brandy held to sick man lip allowing few drop of liquid to find way between clenched teeth for fully ten minute strove to coax small quantity of spirit down chief throat at length have satisfaction of seeing that at least have be swallowed almost immediate result of be groan slight spasmodic movement of emaciated limb presently after few minute of further persistent effort butler opened eye ah be better ejaculated amateur physician with sigh of extreme satisfaction will soon be right now sir let give just spoonful will feel like new man please keep teeth clenched like open mouth mr butler let pour little more down throat do please in most insinuating tone of voice will do end of good arima take hold of chin see if can force lower jaw open be a gentle a can there be right now then with deft touch apparent violence indian succeeded in getting locked jaw apart escombe promptly availed of opportunity to pour about tablespoonful of spirit into partially open mouth for moment there be result then cough splutter on part of sick man showed that potent elixir be making way down throat with groan patient made feeble effort to struggle to foot attempt be failure last particle of strength have already be spent sighing heavily butler subsided back upon supporting arm of indian lay staring vacantly at rich sapphire sky arched above then harry took by hand calling by name endeavoured to win sign of recognition from in vain utmost that must accomplish be to extract from patient few meaningless incoherent mumbling conveyed nothing save fact that speaker mind be at least for moment perfect blank at length convinced that must do more until have got patient settled in camp called upon arima to help between two soon have unfortunate man comfortably stretched upon blanket under lee of enormous granite rock must at least partially shield from keen wind of fast approaching night then with help of few stout sapling cut from clump of bush close at hand contrived to rig small makeshift kind of tent over upper half of body a further protection from cold lighted camp fire close to foot then while indian with gentle touch cut away soiled rag of clothing from wasted body limb swathed in waterproof rug escombe unsaddled hobbled horse mule turned loose to graze next unpacked saddle bag camp equipage proceeded to prepare small quantity of hot nourishing soup with infinite difficulty at length induced patient to swallow few drop at time finally with makeshift pillow beneath head invalid be gently laid down in comfortable posture when soon sank into refreshing sleep weary pair seized opportunity thus afforded to attend to own most pressing need of closed eye in sleep night for have scarcely finished supper when butler awoke again demanded most unremitting care attention a evinced great uneasiness perturbation of mind speedily developed into state of such violent delirium that be only with utmost difficulty combined effort of pair be able to restrain from doing serious injury for more than forty hour did that dreadful delirium continue patient being extraordinarily violent during almost entire period then unnatural strength suddenly collapsed leaving weak a infant in almost continuous state of lethargy so profound that be with great difficulty that two nurse be able to arouse sufficiently to administer small quantity of liquid nourishment be by time evident even to harry inexperienced eye that butler condition be desperate even if not altogether hopeless consulted arima a to possibility of procuring service of qualified physician indian have encouragement to offer cerro de pasco nearest town in one might hope to find doctor be fifty mile distant a crow fly difficulty of way be such that using utmost expedition must take messenger at least four day to reach place a many to return assuming that messenger be fortunate enough to find doctor who must be persuaded to set out forthwith by time harry knew instinctively patient must be long past human aid besides there be messenger to send save arima in view of possible recurrence of delirium lad felt that must not be justified in sending indian away while two be still engaged in debating question of what be best to be done under distressing circumstance butler ended difficulty by quietly breathing last crossing borderland between life death without struggle without recovering consciousness indeed so perfectly quiet peaceful be end that be time before young escombe must convince that chief be really dead when at length there must no longer be question a to fact body be at once wrapped in waterproof sheet have formed makeshift tent for shelter of sick man packed with a much reverence a circumstance must allow upon deceased man horse for conveyance back to camp for interment pair having with implement wherewith to dig grave moreover harry considered that taking somewhat peculiar circumstance of case into consideration be very desirable that body must be seen identified by other member of survey party before burial took place event occurred on evening of third day after death escombe reading burial service afterwards fashioned with own hand placed at head of grave wooden cross upon roughly deeply cut with pocket knife name of dead man date of death also a matter of precaution took very careful set of astronomical observation for determination of exact position of grave recording result in diary at end of long entry detailing circumstance connected with sad event escombe now suddenly found young shoulder burdened with heavy load of responsibility for not only did butler death leave lad in sole charge of survey party with task of carrying on unaided exceedingly important work upon that party be engaged until assistance must be sent out to from england also became immediate duty to report circumstance of death of leader to british consul at lima who must doubtless put in motion necessary machinery for capture punishment of men who be responsible for event have brought about butler death also to sir philip swinburne who must of course in turn communicate sad intelligence to deceased man family there be also butler private effect to be packed up sent home forthwith yet taking everything into consideration death of chief be relief rather than otherwise to lad unfeeling though statement may appear at first blush butler be man for whom be quite impossible for anyone to acquire friendly feeling harry therefore felt that when have committed chief body to earth with a much respectful observance a circumstance permitted have carefully scrupulously collected together dispatched to england dead man personal belonging have taken such step a be possible for capture punishment of men who be primarily responsible for butler death have done everything that strict sense of duty claimed from be not called upon to feign outwardly manifest sorrow have place in heart besides be now responsible head of survey party upon depended for at least next three month conduct of important highly scientific operation upon manner in conducted depended very serious issue involving expenditure of exceedingly large sum of money be opportunity to demonstrate to concerned stuff of be made be opportunity so splendid that many young fellow of age must cheerfully give half dozen year of life to obtain such for harry fully realised that if must carry task to successful conclusion fortune from professional point of view be made felt that must ay must do experience have already gained since arrival in peru have be of inestimable value to have made very utmost of therefore felt confident of ability to carry through task to satisfaction of employer with credit to entered upon with avidity keen enjoyment moreover be tactful possessed happy knack of managing under in way that be able to extract very last ounce of work from without offending susceptibility causing to feel that be making undue demand upon under circumstance with perpetual galling irritation of butler presence influence removed survey made rapid very satisfactory progress party arriving at cerro de pasco in trifle under six week from date of butler death thus completing second section of survey third section be very much longer more difficult in respect than of two completed since extended from nanucaca already connected by rail with cerro de pasco along shore of lake chinchaycocha to ayacucho cuzco thence on to santa rosa distance being four hundred seventy mile a crow fly while difficulty of route might possibly increase distance by nearly one third escombe be by mean dismayed by formidable character of obstacle lay before have come to realise to man who must achieve success obstacle exist only that may be overcome be gaining experience daily in overcoming of obstacle therefore attacked third very formidable section not only without anxiety fear with keen zest instantly communicated to little band of follower welding together into perfectly harmonious smooth working whole must not be thought however that escombe allowed to become so completely absorbed in work that must think of nothing else on contrary understood perfectly meaning of word recreation value of thing knew that man can work for ever without wearing out looked upon recreation a what name implied re creation rebuilding of force mental physical labour wear away valued accordingly taking whenever felt that really needed even a took food medicine now chanced that fishing be one of escombe favourite recreation sooner have started third section of survey began by skirting eastern shore of lake chinchaycocha than made practice of indulging in hour two fishing whenever opportunity offered be practice led to occurrence be destined to culminate in adventure so startling extraordinary a to be scarcely credible in prosaic twentieth century day happened on saturday afternoon on day in question survey party being then encamped on shore of lake chinchaycocha a soon a have squared up week work snatched hasty luncheon young englishman brought forth fishing tackle getting aboard balsa light raft arima have constructed for proceeded to paddle distance out from shore to spot have already ascertained afforded fair prospect of sport arrived there dropped keeleg large stone serving purpose of anchor overboard settled down comfortably to enjoy favourite pastime also provide exceedingly welcome addition to somewhat monotonous fare of camp life sport that afternoon be not so good a harry have expected be drawing well on toward evening before fish began to bite at freely be trying especially for certain particularly delicious kind of fish something between trout mullet be only to be captured by allowing hook to rest at very bottom of lake suddenly felt smart tug at line at once began to haul in have scarcely got fairly taut when tremulous jerk denoted presence of fish at other end be exchanged for steady strain soon became perfectly evident that hook have become entangled in something at bottom now escombe stock of fishing tackle be of exceedingly modest proportion so much so indeed that loss of even solitary hook be matter not to be contemplated with indifference therefore brought skill to bear upon delicate task of releasing hook from entanglement at end of hour be nearer to success than at beginning of endeavour while sun be within hand breadth of horizon have fancy for being caught by darkness while on lake therefore adopted other tactic strove to bring object whatever might be to surface by mean of steady yet not dangerously powerful strain ah be better at very first tug escombe felt resistance yield by merest hair breadth presently faint jerk told that have gained fraction of inch success be repeated few second until be able to lift drop line clear foot then sun lower limb touched rested for instant upon ridge of western cordilleras before began to sink behind harry realised that moment for energetic measure have arrived for be good two mile from shore must take best part of hour to paddle clumsy craft distance therefore steadily increased strain upon line determined to release one way even though at cost of hook proved unnecessary for to make so great sacrifice be unknown object yielded with little momentary jerk ever decreasing resistance until finally let go hold of bottom altogether came to surface securely entangled with hook upon emergence from water harry gazed at catch in astonishment have expected to see water logged branch of tree bunch of weed something of sort a dangled dripping with sandy ooze in last ray of setting sun certain ruddy yellow gleam flashed from told finder that have fished up something metallic from bottom of lake next moment escombe be busily engaged in disentangling find from fish hook long ere have succeeded in doing so young man have made interesting discovery that have be fortunate enough to retrieve most remarkable jewel in form of gold emerald collar from depth of lake methodical even in midst of excitement at having made so valuable find young englishman carefully disentangled hook line from jewel neatly wound up former then proceeded patiently to wash away from latter ooze with be thickly coated having done found in possession of ornament so massive in material so elaborate unique in workmanship that felt certain must be worth quite little fortune to curio collector be appeared to be collar necklace trifle over two foot in length end united by massive ring supporting medallion link so to speak of necklace consisted of twelve magnificent emerald engraved upon one side with certain cabalistic character meaning of escombe must not guess at upon other with symbol be easily identifiable a of sun emerald be massively set framed must be almost more appropriate word in most elaborately sculptured gold joined together by heavy gold link also very elaborately cut pendant be likewise composed of superb emerald of fully three inch diameter set in gold frame chiselled to represent ray of sun emerald being engraved with representation of human face oddly enough harry recognised even at first glance to be extraordinarily astoundingly like own be find worth having young man told might prove worth several hundred of pound if judiciously advertised offered for sale at christie upon return home for safety sake therefore put round neck tucking inside shirt snugly out of sight heaving up keeleg proceeded to paddle thoughtfully back to shore be three month after occurrence in interim young escombe have pushed forward survey so rapidly despite difficulty that have covered more than distance between nanucaca ayacucho when a returned to camp at end of day work observed two strange mule tethered near tent presently stranger emerged from tent advanced toward stranger although deeply tanned by sun be unmistakably englishman twenty eight year of age rather above middle height with pleasant though resolute expression stamped upon good looking feature approaching harry held out hand smilingly remarked mr escombe presume name be bannister john bannister come from sir philip swinburne to act a colleague in completion of survey upon be engaged producing packet of paper be credential grand country casting admiring glance at magnificent scenery amid camp be pitched word must have have tough bit of work even before reaching spot be right have answered harry a cordially returned bannister grasp be right glad to see to bid welcome to camp for have be pretty badly in want of intelligent help lately fellow indicating native helper who be now scattered about camp busily preparing for evening meal be well enough in way since poor butler death have managed to drill into something like decent useful shape have often be badly hampered for want of surveyor who must work with in surmounting of especially bad place now that have come will be able to get ahead nearly twice a fast suppose came out by last mail eh how be thing going in dear old country harry led new arrival into tent proceeded forthwith to discard working clothes divest of stain of day toil a chatted animatedly asking question for most part a be wont of old hand escombe have by time grown to quite regard a such when foregathers with somebody fresh from home bannister having arrived at camp pretty early in afternoon have already bathed changed therefore have nothing to do to sit still answer harry question jerking in one two occasionally until younger man toilet be completed when sat down to dinner together by time that meal be over felt perfectly satisfied that must be able to get on well with other be looking forward to quite pleasant time up there among stupendous mountain upon first seeing bannister learning that have come out from sir philip harry naturally thought that new arrival have be dispatched to fill position of chief of survey party rendered vacant by death of unfortunate butler upon opening credential bannister have presented found that be actually a bearer have stated that harry be to act a colleague not a chief subordinate in completion of survey thus making pair jointly responsible for work while must share equally credit upon completion spent exceedingly pleasant evening together chatting mostly over work still lay before harry producing plan explaining what have already be done while bannister sat listening gravely to recital of sundry hairbreadth escape from death in execution of duty of manner in few of more than ordinarily difficult bit of work have be accomplished when pair again sat chatting together twenty four hour later at end of first day together felt absolutely satisfied with comrade with fortune have brought into touch under agreeable circumstance survey progressed with greater rapidity than ever two englishman conquering obstacle after obstacle meeting with plenty of thrilling adventure in process until in fullness of time reached first ayacucho then cuzco when worst of trouble be over for there be road of sort between ancient capital santa rosa two englishman after riding over in company agreed that for considerable part of way at least best route for railway must be found contiguous to highroad by following surveyor must derive many substantial advantage in addition to finding comparatively easy route to survey chapter eight abduction survey party have traversed about distance between cuzco santa rosa when two englishman following invariable custom of indulging in swim a often a opportunity afforded made way at end of hard day work to most romantic spot have encountered here small stream flowing through rocky gorge fell over granite ledge on to large flat slab of rock nine foot below from in turn poured into noble basin almost perfectly circular in shape about twenty foot deep nearly quite hundred foot in diameter ere continued course down ravine to stand on slab of rock beneath fall be to enjoy ideal shower bath to dive from same slab into deep pellucid pool thereafter swim across pool back three four time be luxury worth riding several mile to enjoy small wonder therefore be that two englishman resolved to make most of opportunity continue to use perfect natural swimming bath so long a work kept within reach of camp be situated two mile back from pool bather therefore fatigued with long day work decided to ride to from spot instead of walking arima indian who have by time constituted escombe especial henchman be directed to accompany to look after horse while rider be enjoying dip arrived at pool two friend dismounted proceeded to undress on small space of rich lush grass in close proximity to basin indian meanwhile squatting upon heel holding horse bridle while animal eagerly grazed now arima devotion to harry originating at time when two have made memorable journey together to mama cachama cave very greatly strengthened during adventurous hunt for missing butler have steadily developed until have become almost if not quite a strong a of parent for idolised child indian must not bear young master to be out of sight for moment be always most unhappy whenever exigency of work necessitated separation of two have be known to resort to most extraordinary device to prevent such occurrence when two be together arima never allowed gaze to wander for moment from master form if must help yet singularly enough be not until particular evening that indian have become aware of escombe possession of jewel so strangely fished up from depth of lake chinchaycocha have ever caught sight of saw now a escombe undressed at few yard distance light falling strongly upon dull red gold emerald a lad carefully removed from neck laid upon top of clothes ere rushed with joyous shout placed immediately beneath foaming water of fall sight appeared to arouse feeling of very powerful curiosity in breast of indian for be only with utmost difficulty that contrived to retain attitude of passivity until more deliberately moving bannister have joined friend upon slab beneath fall sooner have happened than abandoning horse to own device arima crept cautiously forward until reached escombe heap of clothing availing of preoccupation of bather took jewel in hand examined with most rapt attention care for space of nearly five minute continued examination after slowly thoughtfully made way back to horse be too busily feeding upon luscious grass to stray far for remainder of evening indian seemed to be plunged in state of meditation so profound a to be quite oblivious of outward thing save young master conduct toward whom be marked by new yet subtle attitude of almost worshipping reverence when hand be mustered for work on following morning arima be nowhere to be found have vanished time during night saying nothing to anyone leaving trace behind harry be very much upset at sudden inexplicable disappearance of servant who in thousand little unobtrusive way have ministered so effectually to comfort that loss be at once felt a serious misfortune devoted two whole day to search for missing man fearing that fellow have strayed away from camp that something untoward have befallen search be quite unavailing on third day be abandoned only conclusion at escombe must arrive being that indian have deserted under influence of pique at unintentional affront gone back to own people be two month later by time party be drawing near to santa rosa great railway survey be approaching completion that in dead of dark starless night three indian stealthily approached surveyor camp having first reconnoitred ground a carefully a pitch darkness must permit made way noiseless a shadow to tent occupied by young escombe leading indian be arima two who followed be very old men scanty lock white a snow hanging to shoulder ascetic clean cut feature sharp shrunken yet carried a upright a though have be in heyday of youth sunken eye glowed sparkled with undiminished fire wore sleeveless shirt of pure white finely woven of vicuna wool reaching to knee opening at throat arm also hem of garment being richly ornamented with embroidery in heavy gold thread garment be confined at waist by massive belt of solid gold composed of square placques hinged together elaborately sculptured with conventional representation of sun over be worn long cloak dyed blue also woven of vicuna wool without ornament of description head be bare lobe of ear be pierced distended to receive gold medallion nearly four inch in diameter also heavily sculptured with representation of sun leg be bare wore sandal bound to foot ankle by thong of leather to judge from travel stained appearance of garment must have come considerable distance have be exposed to many vicissitude of weather entering escombe tent be dimly lighted by hanging lamp turned low arima noiselessly moved aside silently with outstretched hand indicated to two companion form of sleeping lad who lay stretched at length upon camp bed breathing long deep breath of profound slumber nodding silently one of two withdrew from pouch hung suspended from belt soft cloth small phial extracting stopper from latter emptied content of phial upon cloth then very gradually approached to nostril of sleeper until be within inch of held cloth thus for about five minute allowing fume of liquid to enter sleeper nostril while companion very gently laid finger upon pulse of escombe right hand happened to be lying outside coverlet at second indian who held harry wrist nodded to first saying in low voice in ancient quichua language be enough nothing will now awaken whereupon holder of cloth returned phial to pouch stepped back from side of bed then turning to arima said in same language say arima that youth always wear collar upon person night day even so lord answered arima at least modified statement so surmise for have never seen jewel save once whereof told again on same night when stole into tent while slept found that be wearing then whereupon hastened to with momentous news have done well friend answered first speaker must prove to be a say will be richly rewarded now caught breath with sudden excitement to settle question then turning to companion said approach brother look with be meet that must gaze upon sacred emblem if so must prove at self same moment signed to arima who turned up flame of lamp whereupon two inca priest for such stranger actually be bent over escombe sleeping figure one on side of bed while one drew down coverlet other unbuttoned lad sleeping jacket exposing to view jewel have fished up from lake chinchaycocha for safety always wore round neck eagerly two priest bent down scrutinised magnificent ornament a lay upon gently heaving breast of sleeper a eye hungrily took in several peculiarity of jewel thrill of excitement visibly swept over finally who appeared to be elder of two said to other there can scarcely be doubt that arima surmise be correct nevertheless brother pas hand beneath young man shoulder raise slightly may remove collar examine priest addressed at once obeyed request of other who thereupon gently passed ornament over sleeper head taking immediately beneath lamp proceeded to examine part of with closest scrutiny companion allowing escombe limp body to subside back on pillow before too joined in inspection link almost mark of chisel be subjected to most careful examination apparently certain of engraved mark be recognised a bearing definite meaning for on more than one occasion elder of two priest pointed to such mark saying behold motahuana here be unmistakably secret sign while other must nod head solemnly respond even so tiahuana see finally who have be addressed by other a tiahuana turned jewel over in hand examined back of gaze instantly fell upon cabalistic character engraved upon back of emerald have puzzled escombe laying jewel gently down upon bed prostrated before motahuana immediately following example a also did arima for space of three four minute trio appeared to be absorbed in act of silent devotion then tiahuana rose to foot fixed gaze on jewel lay upon coverlet of escombe bed meditatively eye rested upon great emerald pendant with engraved representation of human face from thence wandered to calm feature of sleeping lad suddenly started gaze became alert almost startled bent down scrutinised engraved feature intently then quickly diverted gaze to on pillow be trick of light asked be two set of feature identical look motahuana look whispered in tense accent see resemblance have observed instant nay man can scarcely see from where stand for side of face be in shadow come to side of couch stay will move lamp did so holding lamp so that light fell full upon sleeper face while with other hand rearranged collar so that pendant lay upright upon escombe breast in position in stronger light likeness be even more startlingly striking than before for two long minute aged pair bent intently over object of scrutiny with ever growing expression of wonder awe upon attenuated feature well brother at length demanded tiahuana somewhat sharply see what mean be merely fancy figment of over heated imagination nay lord answered motahuana in awestruck whisper be figment fancy likeness be wonderful marvellous perfect feature be identical curve for curve line for line save that engraved on emerald bear impress of few more year of life that however be immaterial in wise affect fact that in sleeping youth behold reincarnation of who first wore sacred jewel lord father of people manco capac even so say truly motahuana agreed tiahuana in tone of exultation revelation be complete indisputable past doubt mighty manco capac have returned to earth from home among star soon now will peru resume former glorious position a greatest most powerful nation in world be true that great manco return to in guise of young englishman for circumstance be scarcely prepared what of be better so for england be to day wisest most mighty nation on face of earth doubtless inca brings with with rich store of knowledge of england come there be occasion for further delay let be going for must be far hence beyond reach of pursuit ere father sun awakens child discloses fact of lord disappearance go thou arima summon hither litter bearer others in perfect ecstasy of pride delight that must have fallen to lot to become humble instrument whereby have be made known to people glorious fact of great inca reincarnation in person of escombe a never for moment doubted be case arima hurried out to where remainder of party lay patiently in ambush briefly announced to that be well bade follow in perfect silence to tent in harry still lay plunged in deathlike yet quite harmless sleep litter light strong structure framed of bamboo covered with vicuna cloth so arranged that must be completely closed be carried right into tent covering thrown back escombe be lifted on mattress still covered with bedclothes off little iron camp bedstead carefully placed in litter jewel be replaced about neck pillow under head be comfortably arranged by arima litter be closed then little procession consisting of litter four bearer with eight other men who acted a relief headed by two priest filed silently out into darkness leaving arima with six men armed to teeth with bow arrow latter tipped with copper lance of hardwood sharpened by fire short sword copper blade of be hardened tempered almost to consistency of steel by process known only to peruvian duty of men be to collect together pack under arima supervision whole of escombe private personal belonging did with such expedition that in le than hour from involuntary departure of owner tent be almost entirely stripped of content left deserted under anaesthetic influence of vapour have unconsciously inhaled escombe continued to sleep soundly until close upon midday by time effect have almost entirely passed off began to awake very gradually to consciousness that something very much out of ordinary course of thing be happening first thing to impress upon slowly awakening sens be fact that bed upon be lying be in motion gentle easy rhythmic swaying motion unlike movement that have ever before experienced yet bed seemed to be same a upon have retired to rest upon preceding night so far a must judge mattress have old familiar feel yes certainly be still under shelter of bedclothes head still rested upon familiar pillow must feel lump in where flock filling have become matted together why mysterious motion must be that be experiencing for first time effect of peruvian earthquake slowly reluctantly opened eye saw that bed be indeed same yet with certain difference precise nature of be at first unable to define presently saw that bed couch upon be lying be closely encompassed by soft blanket like tightly strained over light bamboo framework forming sort of canopy motion be by time sufficiently awake to understand that be real be due to earthquake a have at first be inclined to think might be be regular rhythmic movement of men marching keeping step be being carried with rush sens came fully back to started up into sitting posture be high time for to get to bottom of mystery told saw that midway in length side curtain enclosed be divided overlapped stretching out hand wrenched apart at same time in forgetfulness calling loudly for arima in instant indian be by side of litter peering in through opening between parted curtain to master intense astonishment called senor lord mean exclaimed man submissively did answered escombe incisively what have happened arima where have be where be why be being carried off in outrageous manner answer quickly lord answered indian deprecatingly implore not to be disturbed alarmed in least be slave be prepared to lay down life in service harm be intended be necessary that accompany to place whither be going here be lord tiahuana will perhaps explain further meanwhile during brief colloquy cortege have come to halt now elder of two priest presented a arima retired with profound obeisance said let lord pardon servant let not anger be kindled against what have done have be done of necessity because there seemed to be other way lord need have fear that evil be meditated against on contrary position of great power glory will be at end of journey meanwhile possible provision have be made for comfort wellbeing of lord during passage through mountain understand stammered harry who be why do address a lord what do mean by talking about passage through mountain there be ridiculous mistake nay lord be assured that there be mistake answered tiahuana impressively matter have be most carefully investigated fact have be conclusively established that lord be whom want jewel lord even now wear about neck prof further than that jewel be wearing about neck thing exclaimed harry drawing forth why man fished up from bottom of lake chinchaycocha be simply wearing because appeared valuable did not wish to lose even so lord answered tiahuana soothingly with even increased reverence if be possible circumstance that lord drew collar of great manco capac from depth of chinchaycocha be added proof if such be needed that lord be whom have believed to be that mistake have be made good man tell that mistake have be made very stupid mistake must insist that rectify at once exclaimed escombe who be beginning to grow trifle exasperated at what inwardly termed fellow stupid persistence look here continued in least know whom suppose to be will tell who be name be escombe henry escombe be englishman only came to peru lord interposed tiahuana with deep humility yet with certain inflection of firmness in voice that must say be perfectly well known to servant have be told to by man arima nothing can alter fact that lord be man referred to in prophecy pronounced by great high priest titucocha on awful night when inca atahuallpa be strangled by spaniard in great square of caxamalca from moment ancient peruvian people have looked for coming of lord to free from yoke of foreign oppressor to give back country to restore to proud position occupied ere coming of cruel spaniard now that lord have deigned to appear must be foolish indeed to permit anything anything lord to stand in way of realisation of long deferred hope harry began to realise that misunderstanding be more serious than have at first thought must be put right without further delay must not sit there in ridiculous palankeen affair argue with man who stood with head thrust between curtain must get up dress moreover be ravenously hungry felt certain that breakfast hour must have long gone past so instead of replying to tiahuana last remark simply said send arima to old priest instantly withdrew in place appeared arima again who have be standing within earshot quite expecting summons at moment behold be here lord remarked indian with deep obeisance what be lord will with least of servant will answered harry be to dress have breakfast at once when friend kidnapped last night did by chance have sense to bring clothes along have brought everything with lord answered arima nothing know to be lord property have be left behind um thought harry beggar have be altogether too faithful for liking have brought everything of mine have mean that if can not persuade idiot to take back to camp becomes necessary for to make escape will have to go off with just what stand up in leaving rest of belonging in hand aloud said very well then please bring clothes wore while at work yesterday with breathless haste clothes required be brought forth from bundle into have be hastily thrust presented to owner litter be gently deposited upon ground harry lightly clad in pyjama suit scrambled out to find in midst of extensive pine wood with escort consisting of twenty one person told prostrate on face around evidently told be personage of such dignity consequence that must not be looked at by profane eye while dressing smiling to at absurdity of whole adventure quickly proceeded with toilet obsequiously assisted by faithful arima when at length be dressed word from arima caused escort to rise to foot then while of proceeded to gather branch light fire others set to work to open certain bundle from rapidly extracted bread chocolate sugar in short ingredient required to furnish forth appetising satisfying breakfast finally about hour later young englishman in frame of mind about equally divided between annoyance at abduction amazement at unaccountable behaviour of abductor found partaking of said breakfast presented to in service of solid gold of curious most elaborate design workmanship waited upon by entire suite with a much ceremony obsequiousness a though be king chapter nine tiahuana tell strange story escombe appetite be good food delicious cooking perfection service irreproachable if somewhat elaborate be not to be wondered at therefore that young man made excellent meal at conclusion must feel in admirable form for tackling captor upon subject of outrageous abduction of therefore after performing post prandial ablution in basin of solid gold held before by kneeling man drying upon immaculate towel woven of cotton be perfect miracle of absorbent softness tendered to by kneeling man resolutely seated upon moss grown rock happened to conveniently protrude from soil close at hand proceeded to deal with matter have difficulty in recognising that tiahuana motahuana be two wielders of authority in escort by way noticed have persistent trick of arranging about in tolerably close circle of be centre therefore opened proceeding by remarking now before go step insist upon having full explicit explanation of unwarrantable behaviour in entering camp last night abducting to serious detriment of exceedingly important work upon be engaged have assured have nothing to fear at hand appear to be quite satisfied that in abducting have got man want be a far a ever from understanding what motive can be of two men be responsible for outrage be responsible one lord answered tiahuana high priest of remnant of ancient peruvian race now for many long year established in city of sun unknown to lie hidden far away among mountain demand explanation of what have termed unwarrantable action in taking possession of august person be just reasonable demand lord moreover be necessary that must have therefore let lord deign to listen to what to may seem wild incredible story be strictly true in particular when in dim remote past lord father sun took compassion upon people sent two of child manco capac mama oello huaco to earth in order that might form into united consolidated nation two established in certain spot locality of have be divinely revealed to by certain sign even a identity lord have be revealed to forefather gathering about ancient royal city of cuzco be built wherein manco capac took up abode a first inca now manco capac being of divine origin be endowed with marvellous wisdom knowledge even to foreseeing of future event among event foretold be that of conquest of country by spaniard also formulated many wise righteous law for government of people law be further added to by successor now with building of city of cuzco establishment therein a inca manco assumed royal dignity inaugurated code of stately ceremonial for who formed court might have occasion to come to also arrayed in regal garment adorned person with certain regal ornament of collar now worn by lord be most important next to imperial borla tasselled fringe of scarlet adorned with coraquenque feather be distinguishing insignia of royalty when in fullness of time manco be called home to mansion of father sun gave minute instruction before departure a to disposal of everything belonging to including royal jewel of ordained be to be deposited with body in great temple of sun at cuzco jewel be now wearing lord decreed be to be handed down from inca to inca even unto last of race be so atahuallpa wore a entered city of caxamalca at head of vassal retinue on afternoon of fatal day when fell into hand of treacherous spaniard helpless to prevent beheld thousand of unarmed follower slaughtered like sheep in great square did not wear on night when at command of false treacherous pizarro be haled forth to die in great square where so many of follower have previously perished did fall into hand of captor thus much be ascertained beyond possibility of doubt what became of nobody must must say on night of atahuallpa murder high priest titucocha suddenly emerged from great temple of sun in cuzco standing before entrance summoned inhabitant of city to assemble before then told that atahuallpa be dead that inca dynasty be at end that great peruvian nation be doomed to pas under rule of conquistador be swallowed up by descendant not for time child cried have sinned in have permitted spaniard to overrun country without opposition instead of utterly destroying a might have done be punishment for not defending land father sun gave for sustenance enjoyment be not dismayed remnant of will survive under leadership will retire to certain place locality of have be revealed to there will build new city of sun glory of will exceed that of cuzco even a glory of lord father sun exceeds that of consort moon in fullness of time will come to pas that manco capac founder of nation will be reincarnated will appear among will become inca to reign over a aforetime restore peruvian nation to pristine power glory by virtue of own wisdom power of wealth will accumulate for use when appears ye will know from fact that will wear about neck great emerald collar worn first by afterward by inca behold lord a titucocha spake so hath happened remnant of ancient peruvian race survives to day untainted by admixture with blood of alien while many of be scattered abroad over face of country watching ever for reappearance of manco capac lesser part be gathered together in city of sun founded by titucocha now in very zenith of magnificence awaiting coming of lord so be yarn be exclaimed harry a tiahuana came to halt in narrative very extraordinary story be never heard anything like in life suppose friend tiahuana because happen to have fished up collar out of lake chinchaycocha be wearing round neck because wish to lose identify a reincarnated manco capac eh assuredly lord answered tiahuana must indeed be sceptic who must venture to entertain shadow of doubt in face of proof so complete in respect a have be vouchsafed to ah ejaculated harry bracing to demolish absurd fable secure release at stroke now understand very much about doctrine of reincarnation suppose if be really manco capac come to earth again must have recollection of former state of existence must well will surprise to learn have nothing of sort not feeblest glimmer nay lord answered tiahuana be not in least surprising often happens that reincarnated one have recollection of former existence until find amid surroundings similar to with be familiar in past state even then remembrance often come slowly lack of recollection doe not in least alter fact of fact have proof can possibly be required now lord will please that resume journey there be many difficulty to be surmounted before reach spot at must encamp to night be high time that march must be resumed answered harry doe not please that resume journey on contrary refuse to accompany step unless will undertake to convey back to camp whence brought if will do be willing to overlook outrage have perpetrated in abducting promise that will hear nothing more about if persist in keeping prisoner warn that british consul will be speedily made acquainted with fact will never rest until have be released one of severely punished that punishment let tell will be joke for will take care that be adequate to offence will be made to understand that even solitary young englishman like can not be kidnapped with impunity pardon lord answered tiahuana with deprecatory gesture be overwhelmed with distress at having incurred lord displeasure must not permit even to interfere with discharge of duty be imperative that lord must accompany be to fail to convey to hidden city of sun must be justly put to death lord will therefore see that have choice in matter only one who have choice be lord who can choose whether will accompany willingly whether must resort to something in nature of coercion a tiahuana spoke last word made sign with hand upon little band of attendant contracted into circle of considerably smaller diameter than before yet still preserving attitude of most profound respect escombe saw at once that moment be by mean favourable for attempt to escape therefore quickly decided to make best of thing to submit pro tem with good grace to what be unavoidable accordingly said very well since be absolutely determined to carry off prefer to accompany voluntarily warn that will suffer severely for outrage be most regrettable to be obliged to record be threatened invocation of britain might majesty seemed to discompose obstinate indian not at to use own expression when talking of afterwards threat glanced off a harmlessly a water off duck back that seemed in least concerned about be welfare comfort during journey with much solicitude tiahuana enquired whether must please to walk to be carried in litter must have brought horse with for use lord high priest explained apologetically much of road

thought fit to bring horse for felt that mounted must have have much better chance of escape than on foot conviction be greatly strengthened when a day wore on toward evening stiff ascent be frequently obliged to negotiate began to tell upon observed how indian with short quick step covered mile after mile of uneven rocky road without slightest apparent effort visible sign of distress then began to dawn upon gradually that even must find suitable opportunity to give custodian slip must easily run down recapture besides be by mean certain that must now find way back to camp have not remotest notion of direction in camp lay for during many hour of journey have be asleep indian be not only continually changing direction of travel be apparently taking constant succession of short cut across country now winding way for mile two along face of dizzy precipice by mean of ledge only foot two in width anon clambering hundred of foot up down almost vertical rock face where slip false step meant instant death now crossing ghastly chasm by mean of frail dilapidated suspension bridge constructed of cable of maguey fibre floored with rotten planking swung to tread until oscillation threatened to precipitate entire party into terrible abyss yawned beneath perhaps hour later forcing way slowly with infinite labour difficulty up boulder strewn bed of half dry mountain stream be liable at moment if there happened to be rain higher up among hill to become swollen into raging foaming irresistible torrent against impetuous fury of man must stand for instant to do indian more than barest justice be to last degree solicitous to spare prisoner least fatigue repeatedly assured that there be not slightest necessity for to walk single step of way while whenever there be barest possibility of danger there be always sufficient number of within arm reach to render required assistance to ensure that harm must possibly befall although continuous travelling hour after hour over such very difficult ground became at last most horribly fatiguing harry set teeth plodded grimly on be not going to let copper coloured chap suppose that must tire englishman out not besides wished to

especially at existing state of survey must be in least inimical to sir philip interest must be nothing of kind bannister must finish work a satisfactorily a escombe must probably much more so will be seen from argument be in main perfectly sound that mr henry escombe having conceived idea that must like to have peep at mysterious city of sun be now endeavouring to reconcile a thoroughly a might be to what be rapidly assuming to appearance of inevitable for with step that party took be being borne with increasing clearness upon inner consciousness to escape be already impossible for first of route have be over such trackless waste that despite keenness with have noted appearance of conspicuous object passed be so very much alike that have gravest doubt a to ability to find way back to camp without guide if be to attempt must lose way there must be very little doubt that must perish miserably of exposure starvation in wilderness where not even so much a solitary hut have be sighted throughout day apart from granting for moment that memory might be trusted to guided aright there be place to be passed obstacle to be overcome admitted to must not care to attempt unaided unless be in actual peril of life assurance of tiahuana have completely set mind at rest on score thought of invoking arima assistance came to for moment only to be dismissed next however for faithful devoted a indian have proved in past harry remembered that be through instrumentality direct intervention that pother have arisen arima seemed to be a completely convinced a of others that harry be person foreordained to restore ancient peruvian nation to former power splendour escombe knew enough of fellow character to feel certain that must not permit personal feeling to interfere with so glorious consummation seemed then a though fate destiny one pleased to call willed that harry escombe must see mysterious city finally concluded that taking everything into consideration perhaps wisest thing must be to go quietly with a much semblance of goodwill a possible since appeared that other course be open to thought naturally suggested others more wild extravagant than last until by time that party at length reached camping ground have be objective through day young englishman discovered to unqualified amazement that not only did there exist within strong vein of hitherto entirely unsuspected romance awakened brought to light by extraordinary nature of adventure of be hero also that quite unconsciously to view relative to exigency binding character of engagement to sir philip swinburne have become so far modified that no longer appeared imperatively necessary for to jeopardise life in practically hopeless endeavour to escape journey have be up down one day be to say party have be either climbing descending almost whole of time general tendency however have be distinctly upward when at length bare rocky plateau be reached about sunset affording ample space upon to camp greatly increased keenness of atmosphere indicated net rise of probably two three thousand foot scene be one of almost indescribable dreary grandeur titanic peak crowned with snow ice towering high on hand divided by gorge of immeasurable depth side for most part shaggy with pine forest never sign of human habitation to be seen indeed sign of life in form save where here there small moving blotch on distant landscape indicated presence of flock of huanacos vicuna even be few for traveller have not yet reached lofty frozen waste where alone ychu grass be found be therefore favoured habitat of animal escombe now have fresh evidence of foresight exercised by escort in providing for comfort welfare for sooner have precise spot be selected upon to camp than from among baggage borne by attendant small tent made of cloth woven from vicuna wool be produced erected upon jointed bamboo pole in few minute with litter placed inside to serve a bed lighted talc lantern suspended from ridge

condition a to toughness wiriness past day journey have be revelation to in matter of endurance have never before in life experienced anything like intense fatigue now racked joint in body ravenously hungry a be felt that must scarcely be possible for to remain awake long enough to get meal wonderful indian appeared to have foreseen everything loaded a most of be with heavy burden in addition to weapon have gradually accumulated very respectable bundle of firewood during progress of march while one party have be erecting tent arranging interior for harry occupation second have be busily engaged in lighting roaring fire while third have be still more busily occupied in preparing wherewithal to furnish forth most appetising acceptable evening meal when placed before prospective inca be found to consist of broiled vicuna chop delicious bread mountain honey fruit chocolate by time that meal be ready night have completely fallen bitterly keen piercing wind from eastward have arisen came swooping down from frozen waste above in savage gust momentarily threatened to whirl frail tent occupant into space hurl into one of many unfathomable abyss yawned around party while to add to general discomfort wind brought with dank chilling fog thick a blanket penetrated everywhere left on everything great bead of icy moisture like copious dew escombe be too unutterably weary to let of thing trouble sleep be what fibre of body be cry aloud for have sooner finished meal than leaving responsibility for safety welfare of party in hand of two priest hurriedly divested of clothing snuggling into warm comfortable bed litter instantly sank into absolute unconsciousness last coherent thought being vague wonder how must fare in such place on night if instead of being under care protection of indian have chanced to be lonely houseless fugitive from chapter ten valley of mystery when young escombe next morning awoke from soundest sleep that have ever enjoyed in life at once became aware from motion of litter that indian friend be already on move when in obedience to command halted to enable to dress partake of breakfast single glance a stepped forth from litter into keen air sufficed to assure that must have be in motion for at least three four hour for sun have already topped peak of andes aspect of landscape surrounding be entirely unfamiliar not trace of spot where have camped during preceding night be to be seen there be indication of direction in lay fact tended still further to drive home to young man conviction of folly of attempting to find way back to survey party alone unaided journey that day be in essential respect counterpart of of day before tiahuana who be evidently leader of expedition in double sense chose own route making use of regular road only at very infrequent interval then for comparatively short distance soon abandoning again for long stretch across country where semblance of path of description be to be found a on preceding day skirted climbed descended precipice without hesitation crossing ravine ascending gorge in fact took country pretty much a came guiding party apparently by mean of landmark known only to on whole steadily ascending steadily forcing way ever deeper into heart of stupendous mountain labyrinth lay to eastward ever a went air grew keener more biting aspect of country wilder more desolate quebradas more appalling in fathomless depth precipice became more lofty difficult to scale mountain torrent more impetuous dangerous to cross primitive suspension bridge more dilapidated precarious patch of timber vegetation more tenuous flock of huanaco vicuna larger more frequent way more savage forbidding storm more frequent terrible until at length began to appear to escombe a though party have become entangled in wilderness from escape in direction be impossible wherein must quickly perish in consequence of unendurable rigour of climate yet tiahuana still pushed indomitably forward overcoming obstacle after obstacle that to anyone le experienced than in peculiarity of country mode of travel in must have seemed unconquerable for ten more day to indian must have seemed endless by reason of awful toil frightful suffering intense misery be concentrated in although thanks to sublime self sacrifice of escort escombe be permitted to feel very little of priest led way over vast glacier across unfathomable crevasse up apparently unscalable height battling time with whirling snow storm darkened air blinded eye obliterated landmark buffeted by furious wind came roaring shrieking along mountain side momentarily threatened to snatch party from precarious hold hurl to destruction on great gaunt rock far below while cold be at time so terrible that to continue to live in seemed impossible about middle of afternoon of twelfth day after leaving survey camp party topped ridge saw before long steep smooth slope of snow frozen hard by night of almost deadly frost sigh of intense relief thankfulness broke from breast of utterly exhausted indian without wasting moment proceeded to open unpack certain bale formed part of baggage have brought with drew from number of llama skin spread out flat on crest of snow slope with hair side upward then entire party carefully seated upon two men to skin one behind other when with little assistance from hand of occupant skin started to glide smoothly over surface of snow slowly at first with swiftly increasing velocity until descent of party became sweeping breathless exhilarating flight speedy a of falcon swooping upon prey rider sat cross legged upon skin to escombe who be piloted by tiahuana seemed that slightest inclination right left a case might be throwing trifle more weight on one knee than other thus causing one part of skin to press more hardly than upon snow be be needed for steering purpose for toboggan like skin swept downward straight a flight of arrow save when black fang of rock protruded through snow fair in track when slight slope of body sufficed to cause swerve carried adventurous rider safely clear of obstacle to escombe headlong breathless swoop down slope seemed to last few second yet during few second party have travelled nearly three mile descended three thousand foot slide terminated at last upon very edge of snow line where met mile wide meadow thickly clothed with lush grass bountifully spangled with lovely flower many of be quite new to young englishman for minute entire party a with one consent remained sitting motionless just where impromptu toboggan have come to halt for felt that needed certain amount of time in to become accustomed to glorious change have be wrought by three mile glissade above behind be furious tempest deadly cold never ceasing danger while here be perfect safety cloudless sunshine grateful warmth surroundings of surpassing beauty meadow upon rested sloped gently away before for about mile where appeared to plunge abruptly down into thickly wooded ravine beyond shot up long rocky ridge slope of appeared to be absolutely inaccessible for search a escombe might with aid of telescope nowhere must detect so much a single speck of snow to indicate presence of even smallest ledge inequality in face of rock ridge range stretched away to right left of spot where party have come to halt retiring to eastward a went in tolerably regular curve until cusp if such there be swept out of sight behind nearer ridge at length escombe rose from llama skin with ejaculation of inexpressible relief began to slap still benumbed hand together vigorously rub stiffened limb in order to restore feeling warmth to whereupon tiahuana also rose gave order to re pack skin prior to resuming journey few minute later entire party be once more on march moving rapidly athwart meadow toward ravine within quarter of hour be in ravine clambering down steep slope of hither side toward where sound of rushing water began to make heard with increasing distinctness ten minute after wild breathless downward scramble among trunk of thick growing pine tree brought to margin of wide turbulent mountain torrent that in course of age have scored deep channel for right down centre of ravine bed of stream be thickly strewed with enormous boulder moss grown upon upper surface where drenched with everlasting spray between turbid water from melting snow on height above leapt foamed with clamour fury rendered conversation impossible threatened instant death to foolhardy adventurer who must attempt to cross yet indomitable indian somehow contrived to win passage across hour later entire party stood safely on opposite side then followed long toilsome scramble up other side of ravine top of be not reached until sun have set darkness have fallen upon scene at top of ravine clear of tree found on grassy slope very similar in character to have encountered on other side of stream there fatigued to point of exhaustion by long arduous day travel went into camp prepared partook of evening meal at once resigned to long night of repose under condition of infinitely greater comfort than have enjoyed for many day past escombe sleep that night be unusually sound even after making allowance for excessive fatigue of past day in fact have not slept so soundly so long since night of abduction from survey camp when at length awoke found labouring under same feeling of puzzlement have oppressed on eventful morning for when consciousness again returned to opening eye looked about at once became aware that surroundings be very different from what have expected be true that still occupied litter in have retired to rest on previous evening single glance be sufficient to show that litter be longer in little tent have then sheltered tent be gone litter couch upon lay comfortably stretched now stood in room lighted by single window in wall facing foot of couch window be unglazed apparently have window frame seemed in fact to be no more than mere rectangular aperture in thick stone wall through sun already hour high in sky be pouring genial ray into room couch stood so low on floor that from nothing must be seen of landscape outside save glimpse of range of serrated peak touched here there with snow gleamed dazzlingly white in brilliant sunshine urged therefore by surprise at mysterious change have be wrought in surroundings while slept curious to ascertain where now be harry sprang from couch went to open window out of gazed in ecstasy of astonishment admiration for eye rested upon most glorious landscape that have ever beheld discovered that building in so strangely found stood at one extremity of enormous basin like valley roughly oval in shape thirty mile long by twenty mile in width completely hemmed in on side by range of lofty hill averaging according to estimate from three to four thousand foot in height centre of valley be occupied by most lovely lake about fifteen mile long by perhaps ten mile wide dotted here there with fairy like islet of be crowned by little clump of tree while others appeared to be covered with handsome building be only part of wonder at far end of lake must distinctly see so exquisitely clear transparent be that crystalline atmosphere general outline formation of large doubtless populous town built on margin of lake attention being at once attracted to by strong flash gleam of sun upon several of roof of building have appearance of being covered with sheet of gold from city broad white road shaded by handsome tree ran right round margin of lake for mile two on side of city glimpse must be have of detached building embosomed in spacious garden forming kind of suburb of city while entire remainder of valley side of hill for distance of about one third of height be entirely laid out a orchard pasture cultivated land appearance of whole strongly suggesting that utmost have be made of inch of available space a escombe stood gazing enraptured at surpassing beauty of panorama thus spread out before sound of approaching footstep reached ear turning round beheld arima entering room indian made profound obeisance usual with upon entering harry presence enquired be will of lord that now bathe dress partake of breakfast yes by mean answered harry for have somehow managed to oversleep again be ravenously hungry arima what mean how do come to be here what town be that see yonder at far end of lake a lord have truly said slept long morning being doubtless greatly fatigued with toilsome journey of yesterday answered arima smoothly with profound bow therefore when hour arrived to break camp resume march be be order that lord must not be disturbed must be allowed to sleep on take full measure of rest therefore be lord brought hither to house there to sojourn recruit after fatigue hardship of long journey while tiahuana went forward to city of sun lord see yonder at head of valley to acquaint council with success of expedition to make necessary arrangement for lord reception by inhabitant of city if be lord will will now conduct to bath have made ready for so that be city of sun be remarked harry still gazing admiringly at enchanting view from window guessed a much appears to be fully worthy of name right arima continued tearing reluctantly away yes will have bath now where be if lord will be pleased to follow will show answered indian with inevitable bow a led way out of room passed into long stone corridor lighted at end by unglazed window traversing length of entered room much larger than first stone paved having large plunge bath full of crystal clear water sunk into floor at one end room be unfurnished save for plain wooden bench seat soft woollen mat for bather to stand on when emerging from bath few peg along wall from harry own clothes three four very large bath towel depended room also be illuminated by large unglazed window through sun ray streamed warming atmosphere of apartment to most delightful temperature harry therefore made delay forthwith discarded pyjama suit at once plunged headlong into cool refreshing water to dress take breakfast be next thing in order hour later escombe rose from table like giant refreshed amid obsequious bow of attendant then motahuana stepped forward prefacing speech with bow said lord have be commanded by tiahuana to say that knowing well how anxious inhabitant of city of sun will be to learn issue of expedition have presumed to hasten forward to apprise that be well without waiting until lord awoke to mention intention crave lord permission to absent for way be long lord slept late morning high priest also bade say that will probably be absent at least four day for there be many preparation to be made in connection with lord triumphal entrance into city reception by rejoicing people lord will therefore have time to rest recover strength after fatigue of arduous journey be prayer of tiahuana that will do so since there will be much to fatigue lord in various ceremony attendant upon ascent of throne of ancient inca thanks motahuana answered harry be not in least fatigued by what have gone through during last twelve day if anyone be suffering from fatigue must be tiahuana for be well advanced in year while be young strong so far from being fatigued feel quite fresh after long refreshing night sleep so much so indeed be just thinking how much must enjoy walk down into lovely valley suppose there be objection to doing so lord be monarch of valley within answered motahuana with bow expressive throwing apart of hand be will be absolute in thing have to express wish slave will gladly do best to gratify if lord desire to go forth into open on foot in litter have to say so slave will make path smooth for bear upon shoulder a may seem best to will be well that lord must not venture too far into valley for be stranger be undesirable on many account that must be seen by inhabitant of valley until preparation have be made for public reception oh very well returned escombe have desire to go very far walk of mile two from house back with arima a only attendant to show way answer question will satisfy whereupon motahuana with bow turned away addressed few quick word to arima in tongue be strange to escombe after indian fetched young englishman hat signified readiness to attend latter whithersoever might be pleased to go harry first act upon getting outside house be to walk away from fifty foot then turn round stare at building to have be so mysteriously conveyed while asleep saw before simply solid rectangular stone built structure plain almost to point of ugliness for have not single projection of kind to mitigate severity of simplicity not even so much a window sill be thatched not with trim neatness characteristic of of charmingly picturesque country cottage in england in slovenly happy go lucky style seemed to convey idea so long a roof be weather proof did not in least matter what looked like window be simply rectangular hole in thick stone wall unglazed without even frame now that escombe be outside be able to see that window be provided with shutter something like jalousie fitted to house in most tropical sub tropical country to keep out rain only thing remarkable about house apart from extreme plainness be fact that appeared to be cut out of single enormous block of stone be not until went close up to examined minutely that discovered to be built of block of stone dressed to fit other with such marvellous precision that joint be practically invisible having satisfied curiosity thus far escombe looked about at surroundings generally found that house to have be brought stood at extreme end of extraordinary basin like valley immediately opposite to city of sun occupied other end naturally concluded that entrance to valley must be somewhere not very far distant from spot on stood look a must must see nothing in remotest degree resembling pas through encircling sierra upper portion of side of appeared to be everywhere practically vertical without even a much projection ledge anywhere a must afford foothold to goat be there least semblance of road path of description leading to house save narrow scarcely perceptible footpath leading down to great road encompassed lake harry turned to indian hill appear to be everywhere quite impassable arima said where be road by came over be not permitted to to say lord answered arima with deprecatory bow there be one known way of passing to from outside world way be jealously guarded secret communicated to few who be solemnly sworn to secrecy be regarded by council a of first importance that secret must be preserved intact a be known that rumour of existence of city of sun have reached outer world more than one attempt have be made to find be pure blooded peruvian of ancient race here be tradition with to keep ourselves uncontaminated by admixture of alien blood therefore possible precaution be taken to maintain most absolute secrecy a to way by valley of sun be entered left if be so why have tiahuana brought here demanded harry be alien know yet a understand have be brought here to rule over yes be even so lord answered arima lord be alien only by accident of birth must not be allowed to interfere with fact that lord be in very truth reincarnation of manco capac first inca founder of peruvian nation in case said harry be meet right must know secret way into outer world surely what be known to several of subject must also be known to undoubtedly lord answered indian information will certainly be imparted to lord in due time when have be accepted proclaimed inca by council of seven have authority to impart information implore lord that will not urge to do so thus break solemn oath of secrecy have sworn very well arima let be so answered harry doubtless a say will be informed in due time meanwhile be perfectly right to remain true to oath have sworn now let get down into valley after scrambling up down mountain side for so many day have longing to walk on smooth level road once more footpath from house to main road sloped obliquely along face of hill descending by tolerably easy gradient for distance of about mile before joined road at depth of three hundred foot below level of house upon reaching road be remembered completely encircled lake escombe have yet opportunity to note thoroughness with peruvian did work inexhaustible patience brought to bear upon for road approximating to one hundred mile in length be constructed of uniform width of about one hundred foot apparently also of uniform gradient for in part be raised on low embankment while in others passed through more le willow cutting with just right amount of camber to quickly throw off rainwater into broad gutter watercourse be built on side of most remarkable feature of road however be that be paved throughout with broad flag of stone like block of house be built be so accurately fitted together that joint must only be found with difficulty young englishman spent three hour sauntering along magnificent road enjoying pure air genial temperature sight of superb panorama hemmed in on side pausing often to note clever system of irrigation adopted by inhabitant whereby square inch of cultivable soil must at moment receive precisely right quantity of water to satisfy requirement admiring with eye of engineer workmanship displayed in construction of ample culvert whereby excess of water be promptly discharged into lake marvelling at varied nature of agricultural product of valley for seemed to that in comparatively circumscribed space between margin of lake highest point on mountain slope to barest handful of soil must be induced to cling there be to be found example of vegetable product known to sub tropical temperate zone while be never ceasing source of astonishment to that such enormous number of cattle sheep be apparently able to find ample sustenance on proportionately small quantity of land allotted to pasture what seemed to somewhat remarkable be that while cattle sheep even horse be apparently plentiful in valley saw llama be afterwards explained to that climate there be altogether too mild for that enormous herd owned by inhabitant be kept in highland on other side of encircling mountain chapter eleven city of sun on afternoon of fourth day following tiahuana departure about hour before sunset a escombe be about to enter house after somewhat longer walk than usual in valley paused for moment at head of footpath to take last long look at lovely landscape with leading feature of be now becoming tolerably familiar when wandering gaze be arrested by glint of sunlight upon what have appearance of number of rapidly moving object indistinctly seen about mile distant among low spreading branch of tree lined great road leading from city of sun hillo arima said to indian who be sole attendant who come here be soldier do see that flash glitter yonder among tree to have appearance of sun glint upon spear point military accoutrement arima looked for moment then replied without question be so lord doubtless be tiahuana returning with bodyguard be to escort lord inca on occasion of triumphal entry into city of sun fellow be surely mounted arima said movement be that of cavalry listen unless be greatly mistaken can hear clatter of hoof on stone pavement of road be even so lord answered indian bodyguard of lord inca consists of thousand picked men mounted on finest horse that be possible to breed in valley have always understood said harry that peruvian did not believe in mounted men that be in fact a much due to terror of mounted spaniard a anything else that be vanquished in old day be forgetting knew nothing of horse then did lord say truth answered arima have horse in peru until spaniard brought since then have learned value of horse understand that inhabitant of valley have devoted especial attention to breeding of even from date of foundation of city with marvellous success must say if one may judge from appearance of animal yonder remarked harry enthusiastically a watched approaching horseman cavalcade have by time reached junction of footpath with road debouching on to former rather on to hillside traversed breasted slope at gallop presenting a did so superb inspiriting picture of eager prancing satin skinned gaily caparisoned foam flecked horse bestridden by lithe sinewy form gorgeous in blue gold uniform glitter with burnished copper shield sword mace lance head at head rode tiahuana in long white gold embroidered robe mitre like head dress a chief priest gallantly holding own with magnificently attired commander of regiment in centre of cortege there appeared open litter somewhat similar to sedan chair with top part removed entirely covered with burnished plate of gold silver hammered into bold very intricate pattern while interior be lined with richly coloured feather also arranged in very elaborate design structure be supported before behind by pair of long springy pole shaft to be harnessed six white horse three abreast harness trapping of animal being blue elaborately embroidered with gold while headstall of horse be decorated with plume of dozen long blue feather middle horse of trio that ran between shaft be ridden by postilion who guided controlled three of horse under charge while gorgeous cavalcade be still distance away motahuana came running out of house babbling most earnest urgent entreaty harry must be graciously pleased to enter house forthwith a be not meet that member of inca bodyguard must set eye upon sovereign lord until latter must be attired in robe of regal rank harry already painfully aware of dilapidated condition of jacket knickers in have accomplished march from survey camp fully agreeing with hastily retreated to interior of building standing well back from window where be concealed in deep shadow interestedly watched movement of regiment a went into camp on little plateau at rear of house trooper have scarcely begun to unsaddle before tiahuana still hot dusty from long ride entered house followed by servant bearing large bundle few minute later old fellow entered room where harry be standing having first made obeisance respectfully invited young englishman to retire to sleeping room there to don certain garment more suitable to rank state than be wearing in order that might be ready to receive lord umu commander of royal bodyguard who be represented to be dying of impatience to do homage to sovereign lord with glance at ragged disreputable garment harry smilingly admitted desirability of change followed tiahuana into chamber where arima now formally confirmed in rank position of chief valet body servant of new inca awaited master ten minute later attired in white skin tight pantaloon be also stocking shirt of white wool of so marvellously fine texture that be thin soft light a silk fine white wool sleeveless tunic material of be stiff almost completely hidden by elaborately embroidered pattern in heavy gold thread be confined to waist by broad white leather belt also heavily embroidered in gold fastened by massive exquisitely chased gold clasp with soft white gold embroidered boot on foot reaching halfway up to knee with royal borla tasselled fringe of scarlet adorned with two feather from coraquenque bound round temple emerald collar of manco capac have fished up from mud of lake chinchaycocha round neck hanging down over breast of tunic young escombe be led by tiahuana into largest room in house here seated upon extemporised throne with foot resting upon footstool of solid gold massively chiselled in elaborate particularly graceful scroll work pattern hastily brought in from imperial litter presently received not only umu captain of royal bodyguard also half dozen other noble who have come from city of sun to pay homage to re incarnated lord sovereign manco capac individual be introduced one by one by tiahuana who a person presented in doorway loudly proclaimed rank title of visitor who then barefooted carrying light burden upon shoulder a act of humility in presence of sovereign slowly advanced with head body humbly bent until reached footstool when knelt down on bare stone floor kissed first hand then foot of young inca after still kneeling murmured few word expressive of joy gratitude devotion at condescension of great manco in deigning to return to earth for purpose of regenerating ancient peruvian nation then rose to foot with more bow retired to make way for next whole ceremony be exceedingly brief not occupying much more than quarter of hour altogether brief a be constituted in education for harry who a witnessed almost slavish humility of demeanour of proud haughty noble toward now began to realise for first time tremendous power to have be raised by most unique extravagant freak of fortune did good for set to think seriously of enormous responsibility have almost unwittingly incurred when so light heartedly allowed to become enmeshed in toil of adventure caused to make many very excellent resolution a to manner in must discharge that responsibility with coming of dawn on following morning camp of royal bodyguard suddenly awoke to strenuous life activity trooper attired only in thin shirt riding barebacked horse down to lake where animal be watered bathed in preparation for return journey to city of sun then having returned to camp horse be carefully groomed fed after trooper spent busy hour in examining burnishing arm accoutrement for be great day upon re incarnated inca be to make triumphal entry into capital new holy royal city during period of over three hundred fifty year people have be patiently building extending decorating enriching in order that might be worthy reception of monarch when must please to return to earth be to be day of day first day in history of great glorious regenerated nation in much be to be done that in manner must becomingly adorn first page of history then everybody including harry who meanwhile have bathed dressed partook of breakfast after final preparation for journey be completed then tiahuana umu having first craved audience of lord presented before harry to intimate respectfully that there be two alternative method of travel open to namely by horse litter on horseback to crave humbly that must be pleased to indicate of two must choose to harry who be by time beginning to enter thoroughly into spirit of adventure replied that since task have be laid upon of restoring ancient peruvian race to former power splendour before must be accomplished must be necessary for to lead troop many time to battle be will to make first appearance among subject on horseback a warrior at head of own bodyguard reply created perfect furore of enthusiasm among other noble trooper of royal bodyguard when be communicated to by tiahuana umu that possibility of such choice on part of new inca have not be altogether unanticipated be soon apparent for umu presently returned to house bearing on cushion of azure blue appeared be royal colour trimmed with heavy cord of bullion with bullion tassel at corner sword of hardened burnished copper with hilt of solid gold elaborately chased encased in scabbard of solid gold also most magnificently chased presented on bended knee to tiahuana who in capacity of high priest then knelt before harry girded weapon to side after arima came forward with long roll of extraordinarily fine silk like woven in band of many different colour in however scarlet azure predominated be llautu turban indian at once proceeded with deft finger to bind about royal master head in such manner a to afford complete protection from ardent ray of sun while leaving borla tasselled fringe of scarlet be really royal diadem fully exposed to view woollen mantle of almost silken texture azure blue in colour with very broad border of gold embroidery with more gold embroidery on shoulder halfway down back be next laid upon shoulder secured at throat by pair of massive gold clasp chain escombe be fully equipped for road very handsome gallant figure looked a tall lithe slim clad in barbaric finery stepped out of house into dazzling sunshine to be greeted with deafening shout of welcome from officer trooper of bodyguard who be already mounted drawn up in double line for inspection so obviously be expected of that harry needed hint to effect vaulting lightly into saddle of magnificent white stallion gorgeously caparisoned chafed fretted under restraint of bridle held by two of noble while two more held heavy gold stirrup for royal rider foot wheeled steed cantered gaily off to where umu sitting bolt upright in saddle with drawn sword waited in centre few pace in front of regiment to receive that military usage of more civilised nation have not be permitted to pas altogether unnoticed now became apparent for a harry approached umu uttered loud shout of command at word sword flashed up in salute in most approved fashion while band of mounted musician blared forth certain weird strain young inca subsequently learned be national anthem of ancient peruvian accompanied by umu harry now rode to right flank of regiment from whence proceeded slowly along front rank finally rear noting critically appearance bearing of men gauging breed quality of horse a went horse be without exception splendid animal while men be for most part fine stalwart fellow well set up accustomed a escombe have be to sight of life guard other crack cavalry regiment in london must not avoid seeing that there be plenty of room for improvement in appearance discipline generally of own bodyguard yet be glaringly apparent to that umu captain be inordinately proud of regiment new inca be by mean untactful wherefore having completed inspection harry spoke few well considered word of praise rang sufficiently true to make umu devoted slave henceforward while faint suggestion conveyed that praise be not quite unqualified impressed indian noble with sense of high standard of perfection must exist in young monarch mind caused there then to register silent vow that regiment must be brought up to standard even though must be obliged to kill man of in process by time that inspection be completed priest noble have climbed into saddle everything be ready for commencement of march harry therefore gave word to umu who in turn uttered few sharp order to men whereupon rank closed up horse pranced tossed head a wheeled into line cavalcade proceeded band leading way followed by solitary horseman in gorgeous array who bore proudly aloft inca banner blue silk flag embroidered in gold coloured thread with image of rainbow be symbol sacred to inca trimmed with heavy gold fringe round three free edge harry rode immediately behind surrounded by little group consisting of two priest noble who have come out to meet followed by umu who led glittering imposing regiment be rather trying ride in respect for young inca at least at outset for escombe knowledge of quichua ancient peruvian language be extremely restricted while noble with exception of tiahuana umu be apparently ignorant of spanish anything in nature of conversation be therefore extremely difficult quite apart from fact that everybody excepting tiahuana seemed altogether too shy to address inca unless first spoken to by harry very quickly realised that ignorance of quichua be likely to handicap most seriously there then ordered tiahuana to make necessary arrangement to have taught without delay although for first few mile of journey young inca suffered from certain feeling of constraint did not allow to trouble long for if conversation lagged there be plenty apart from to interest delight there be horse for instance harry have alway be particularly fond of horse be excellent rider a boy indeed have often followed staghound over dartmoor therefore have very fair idea of what horse ought to be have not be in saddle more than five minute on particular morning before realised that at length have come into possession of rarest of good thing perfect horse perfect in temper shape action full of fire courage yet with mouth so sensitive that must be quite possible to control with thread for bridle while one have to glance at great hard muscle sliding so smoothly beneath satin skin to be assured of indomitable endurance insensibility to fatigue then there be plenty to interest occupy attention a swept along great smooth road at hand gallop first of there be road be in way masterpiece of engineering apart from harry must not marvel at perfect cleanliness of until learned that have be traversed throughout entire length of route by whole army of sweeper during early hour of morning since when living thing have be allowed upon then there be noble endless avenue of shade tree bordered road on hand dividing from wide footpath in turn be shaded by le lofty tree fruit bearing for most part fruit being intended for refreshment of wayfarer then there be neat orderly perfectly cultivated field of sugar cane maize tobacco indigo cotton rice coca tree cacao other tropical product on flat immediately adjoining road while farther back toward hill be grain of sort interspersed with vast orchard at interval stretch of pasture land with low squat farmhouse outbuilding dotted about in midst farmer helper be busily engaged upon various kind of labour in field who be near enough to road to do so sooner heard distant hoof beat of approaching cavalcade beheld royal banner flaunting blue gold in wind than flung down implement rushed helter skelter to roadside to watch inca go by acclaim a passed with mile of exhilarating ride towards city of sun aspect of landscape became subtly modified farm became more extensive farmhouse larger more elaborate in style of architecture ornamental decorative feature became increasingly conspicuous in building encountered until finally aspect became distinctly suburban farmhouse gave place to country residence farm gradually merged into pleasure garden gay with flower rich in carefully cultivated fruit tree house drew closer together little group of people in gala attire be encountered gradually increasing in number until footpath on hand be lined with joyous crowd of cheering people then white building of city swung into view gleaming like alabaster between bole of bordering tree with here there flash of sunlight from golden roof of principal building finally great archway pierced through lofty massive wall enclosed city came into view spanning road at same moment great blare of horn stifled sound of trampling hoof beat jingle of accoutrement frantic shout of cheering multitude then umu flung flashing sword blade aloft shouted word of command whereupon panting sweating horse be pulled into walking pace rider straightened in saddle band of musician led way struck up weird barbaric air great bronze gate have be closed be flung open cavalcade passed through into principal street of city of sun if escombe have be questioned ten minute earlier must in reply have expressed confident opinion that man woman child have left city in order to line road outside gate by be known that must pas have sooner traversed echoing archway in immensely thick city wall than saw how greatly mistaken such opinion must have be for starting from very wall pavement on hand all along line of route be simply packed with people child in front woman next men in rear frantic with enthusiasm shouting hoarse in eagerness to afford adequate welcome to inca whose coming have be looked forward to by ancestor for more than three hundred year did not confine demonstration of welcome to mere acclamation at frequent interval triumphal arch of elaborate character of great beauty decorated with banner flag profusely wreathed with flower be thrown across roadway being connected with next by line of pole painted blue surmounted by banner flag twined with flower supporting heavy festoon of flower formed unbroken floral chain from one triumphal arch to next house on hand be also decorated with flower banner long streamer of many tinted cloth hung from eaves window whole scene strongly reminding young englishman of aspect of london street on occasion of own gracious king coronation what impressed escombe more than anything else be fact that along line of route child young girl provided with large basket of flower be stationed a procession approached young people stepped forward strewed road with content of basket thus carpeting hard pavement with freshly gathered flower exhaled delightful fragrance a be trampled under foot by horse young monarch bowing right left in response to enthusiastic greeting of subject now have opportunity to observe few of more striking characteristic of people among whom have be thrown in so extraordinary fashion be considerably surprised to see how widely different type varied lower order what deemed to be such from fact that be compelled to take a viewpoint pavement of open street be a rule of merely medium stature sturdily built not particularly intellectual in expression while colour of skin be something very nearly approaching to ruddy copper very few even of womenkind having pretentions to comeliness to say nothing of beauty occupant of building however who viewed procession from window flat roof of house who might be taken to represent somewhat better class be not only lighter in colour more intelligent in expression of be distinctly good looking a general rule larger more important building presumably therefore higher rank of owner more strongly marked be difference at length in case of noble became so accentuated that might very easily have be taken to be member of distinct race men being much fairer of complexion of greater stature more finely proportioned a well a much more intellectual in appearance than humbler brother while woman of higher class nobility be in many case a fair a lovely a say spanish italian woman winding way slowly through two mile of wide handsome street building in became ever more imposing a advanced cavalcade at length arrived before very large building of two story in height a against single story appeared to be vogue in city of sun planned to form three side of square standing in midst of magnificent garden of thirty acre in extent escombe rightly judged to be royal palace be not particularly handsome structure indeed builder of city seemed to be singularly devoid of architectural taste a be understood elsewhere be imposing on account of size solidity bold massive character of such ornamentation a displayed contrary to usual custom appeared to favour white marble a building material palace be built throughout of massive block of greyish green granite so accurately joined together that joint be almost indistinguishable stood upon solid base of much darker granite six foot high access to interior be gained by mean of very wide flight of eighteen step about four inch high eighteen inch wide from back to front door window opening be surrounded by broad band frame of granite projecting six inch beyond general face of wall in band be set several large elaborately sculptured medallion have appearance of a matter of fact actually be solid gold round building between upper lower tier of window ran flat band string course of solid gold about two foot in depth upon graceful pattern of scroll work be boldly chased finally above upper row of window in place usually occupied by cornice in european building there be massive bull nose moulding quite three foot deep also of solid gold surmounted by parapet guarded flat roof of building facade of building be middle of three side faced toward road while two wing ran from at right angle back toward lake so much escombe be able to note with regard to new home a cavalcade swung in through magnificent gate of wrought copper gave access to ground made way up wide path drive to main entrance before halted in instant two noble who have held horse for while mounted hour earlier be again at animal head harry swung somewhat stiffly out of saddle for ride have be long hot one be now full fortnight since have last be on horseback a foot touched ground band of bodyguard again struck up national anthem officer man raised sword in salute after a harry ascended step passed through wide doorway of palace umu shouted command sword flashed in glaring afternoon sunshine a be returned to scabbard weary horse rider trotted soberly off to cavalry stable noble who have accompanied harry on ride also tiahuana entered palace with young inca doing honour of building indicating character of various apartment passed a conducted to superb bathroom where assisted to disrobe where enjoyed most welcome tub in tepid water made additionally refreshing by mingling with of certain liquid imparted to most exquisite fragrance then attired in fresh costume conducted to small very handsome room chair table in be made of solid silver where waited on by small army of servant in royal livery partook of light meal tiahuana who at harry special invitation joined at repast explaining that there be still much to be done day since in little more than hour solemn service of thanksgiving be to be held in great temple of sun to commemorate return of great manco to long expectant people to inaugurate suitably commencement of new glorious era in people history chapter twelve huanacocha be unconvinced meal over became necessary for escombe to effect change of attire simple garb that have assumed upon emerging from bath being discarded in favour of certain gorgeous garment have be especially prepared for solemn service in great temple of sun there be only one item in costume harry have worn before be borla tasselled fringe of scarlet round temple proclaimed royal rank on occasion also ceremony in be about to take part being strictly religious one wore weapon great temple of sun being most important building in city not even excepting royal palace be built on crest of hill dominated entire city be situated about mile from palace journey thither therefore afforded opportunity for royal procession in harry be to figure in sort of litter borne aloft on shoulder of eight men litter consisted of platform covered with magnificent carpet woven in pattern composed of many rich colour supported by two pair of shaft made of tough springy wood end of shaft being attached to kind of yoke rested upon shoulder of two of bearer upon platform be carried shoulder high be mounted throne woodwork of be entirely enclosed in gold plate richly wrought thickly studded with emerald seated on throne surrounded by escort of five hundred foot soldier gorgeously attired armed with bow spear mace with heavy spiked head young inca presently found being borne at rapid trot through wide handsome street judging from character of building bordering evidently formed aristocratic quarter of town street like have already passed through be lined on side by gaily attired people of sex age who rent air with enthusiastic acclamation a cortege swept past only difference being that majority at least of folk be like hurrying in direction of temple be with somewhat abstracted air harry acknowledged salutation of people for truth to tell mind conscience be being rather severely exercised upon subject of function in be about to take part one great outstanding fact in relation to be that be pagan rite felt that regarded from abstract point of view be distinctly wrong for professed christian to countenance abet idolatry in form yet have not be month in peru without having acquired certain elementary knowledge of early history of country much of by way have be gained through conversation with arima long before individual have so much a dreamed of brilliant destiny awaited pleasant mannered young english master thus for instance knew that peruvian indian recognised existence of supreme being creator ruler of universe whom sometimes named pachacamac at others viracocha also knew that attribute of being be believed to be of so superlatively divine character that simple indian have never dared to rear more than one temple in honour have long since be destroyed be aware also that inca be not only absolute monarch autocrat invested with greater power than other earthly monarch that be implicitly believed to be of divine origin that of attribute of divinity still clung to be therefore not only monarch who wielded absolute power whose will be law be also head of priesthood taking two fact in conjunction escombe with extreme assurance of youth perhaps not attaching quite enough importance to fact that sun be deity whose worship have be especially inculcated carefully handed down from generation to generation thought a considered matter that must see way first to divert adoration of subject from sun to pachacamac afterwards to explain that pachacamac god of christian be one same thus insensibly leading from path of paganism into of christianity resolved to do be grand ambition spoke well for that must be first definite resolution that have taken in connection with tremendous power with have become so strangely invested for singularly enough have never occurred to until within last hour that must be called upon to take part in function ceremony of pagan worship moreover swept away one of scruple have be worrying a to whether not be justified in being present at impending function for felt that having come to above resolution be justified in being present otherwise how must offer suggestion a to change in ceremonial by time that have thought matter out thus far have arrived at conclusion that believed must see way pretty clearly before have reached great open space in centre of stood temple have time only to run eye hastily over enormous building gather in general idea of aspect before litter be deposited at foot of magnificent flight of forty five broad willow step ran round building gave access to spacious platform upon edifice be raised a harry leisurely dismounted from litter escort ran nimbly up step arranged four deep on step remainder on platform above into wide avenue of spearmen to keep back crowd thronged step thus afford young inca clear space in to accomplish ascent to great main doorway of building at same moment tiahuana gorgeously attired in long flowing robe of white be stiff with heavy gold embroidery almost covered with mitre like headdress similarly embroidered on head gold wand surmounted by golden image of sun in right hand emerged from doorway followed by apparently entire staff of priesthood stood at head of long flight of step to receive inca contrary to expectation instead of being conducted directly into main body of building escombe surrounded by fully hundred priest be led by tiahuana into anteroom where found assembled council of seven under leadership of one huanacocha who tiahuana whisperingly mentioned be chief most powerful noble of entire nation five hundred other noble to whom be now to be presented who be thus to be afforded opportunity of thoroughly satisfying before matter be allowed to proceed further that young man be indeed re incarnated manco for whose return to earth nation have be looking forward for over three hundred year upon entering anteroom escombe found upon dais occupying one end of reaching across entire width of apartment in centre of dais close up to front of be throne of solid silver with footstool before upon throne harry be directed by tiahuana to seat body of priest immediately arranging behind on side of before on main floor of room be eighteen inch below level of dais be arranged several row of bench upon noble be seated council of seven have governed in absence of inca with huanacocha occupying middle place being seated on front bench that nearest dais little stir have be occasioned by entrance of harry priest having subsided arima to escombe amazement be mysteriously produced by tiahuana led forward to front of dais from standpoint be ordered to relate circumstance under first came into contact with young englishman how suspicion a to identity of employer with expected inca be first aroused what step took to verify suspicion how proceeded after suspicion be confirmed of told in quichua language not only with total absence of embarrassment with certain undertone of pride exultation running through narrative for felt that a first discoverer of returned manco be person of very great consequence then harry be requested to state where in what manner came into possession of long lost emerald collar of manco capac did in spanish tiahuana afterwards interpreting brief statement into quichua then came own turn began by reminding hearer of terrible happening of dreadful day when atahuallpa deceived by treacherous spaniard unsuspectingly entered city of caxamalca only to see follower ruthlessly slaughtered to find captive in hand of conquistador then drew graphic word picture of still more awful night when atahuallpa chained hand foot be led out into great square of city ignominiously strangled by unscrupulous bloodthirsty betrayer warming to subject next very briefly sketched untoward fate of inca manco son of huayna capac whom spaniard have installed a tool puppet on throne vacated by murder of atahuallpa concluded portion of address by briefly reminding hearer of sudden dramatic appearance of prophet priest titucocha on night of atahuallpa murder of prophecy then uttered by tiahuana repeated word for word then gathering fresh energy fire a proceeded high priest told how after waiting impatiently life long for reappearance of great manco foretold by titucocha until have begun to despair of living to see happy day have be suddenly startled into new life hope by arrival of arima in city with glad news that divine manco have actually returned to earth be even then among mountain of beloved peru reminded of how tiahuana have conducted arima into presence of council of seven caused to relate story to of scepticism with story have be received of difficulty have encountered in persuading council that be duty to permit a high priest to sift story ascertain how far be true how having at length secured somewhat reluctant consent have triumphantly accomplished mission now have duty pleasure to present to divine manco promised of heaven a deliverer restorer of peruvian nation how be to be assured beyond possibility of doubt that young man be in very deed reincarnated manco whose return be foretold by prophet titucocha for whom nation have looked three hundred year more demanded huanacocha head of council of seven be white man to begin with for part have always be in mind that when divine manco must deign to return to must come in form of full blooded peruvian indian even a be low murmur of concurrence approval filled room at bold word of huanacocha eye be at once turned upon tiahuana to see what reply must give to apparently unanswerable objection why must suppose such thing demanded tiahuana in cold level voice there be word in titucocha prophecy a handed down to in record to justify such belief be prepared to admit if like that expectation be natural further than can not go nay rather let say that taking into consideration careful minuteness with titucocha particularised several mean of identification one of have be literally fulfilled in whom now see before be convinced that if lord sun have intended that child must return to a indian born of among must have specifically said so a have already reminded did not what said be that re incarnated manco be to be deliverer restorer of ancient peruvian nation who so fit to undertake successfully carry through stupendous task a one born who have lived life in england that great nation of have heard whose empire extends north south east west to uttermost part of earth so that have be said of that be empire upon sun never set lord who be full of year of wisdom come with many year tell that if ever be to free from yoke of oppressor to restore peru to ancient position of power glory must be helped guided in great that almost impossible task by one who unites within superlative wisdom superlative courage crowning proof to mind that heaven have now at last fulfilled glorious promise be to be found in fact that have ordained new inca to be born englishman possessed of courage wisdom that knowledge for englishman be famed throughout world have spoken now pray come forward one of from first unto last see with own eye final proof that great manco have indeed returned to thus far have merely be called upon to believe testimony of arima now be for to look with own eye upon collar young man wear to say whether in very truth be be not emerald collar of divine manco of have so perfect complete description by wearing of be to be recognised in re incarnated form a tiahuana ceased speaking low murmur ran round assembly whether of approval of dissent be not easy to judge then huanacocha a chief of council of seven arose stepping forward to dais took in hand emerald collar tiahuana handed to having removed from harry neck for purpose of inspection examined with most scrupulous care be about to return to tiahuana when latter said have lord huanacocha compared feature delineated on pendant with of whom be offering to nation a long looked for deliverer huanacocha have not seemed for taking pendant in hand studied intently then gazed long steadily at harry feature admit that there certainly be resemblance said coldly a handed back jewel then one after other remaining member of assembly came forward one by one scrutinised jewel with more le deliberation returned to seat until one in room have obeyed tiahuana summons then high priest stepped forward to edge of dais said noble of ancient peruvian blood royal have now submitted to last piece of evidence upon base contention that young man whom have brought into midst of whose existence became aware through sequence of event can only be described a miraculous be in very truth for whose appearance forefather have be anxiously looking during period of more than three hundred year be perfectly acquainted with word of prophecy foretold appearance for so important so vital to interest of nation be word regarded that have be rule throughout age to teach to child until child can repeat by heart be therefore perfectly cognisant of sign token of identification by re incarnated manco be to be recognised when in fulness of time must again come to to execute great mission of regeneration now rest with to decide whether sign token have be fulfilled in case of young man so clearly unmistakably a to justify acceptance of a being whom claim to be although be perhaps hardly necessary for to do so be duty to remind that never in history of nation have peruvian nobility be called upon to decide more momentous question now ask to rise in place one by one beginning with lord huanacocha say whether not be satisfied that young man be in very truth divine manco returned to earth very perceptible pause followed appeal then huanacocha rose to foot before replying to question lord tiahuana said must like young man to tell what can remember of former existence history of manco capac first inca founder of nation be well known to of if claim be indeed justified there must be many incident in career well known to quite unknown to outer world claimant can recall let mention few of incident most doubting among will be satisfied speech be delivered in quichua language be necessary for tiahuana to translate to harry who at once replied have already told believe have recollection whatever of former state of existence lord said tiahuana young man asserts with perfect candour that have recollection whatever of former state of existence therefore be unable to furnish further proof demanded by lord huanacocha what of doe absence of recollection invalidate other proof have be given how many of remember of former state of existence distinctly enough to recall of happening confess doe lord huanacocha do of long profound silence followed pointed question so prolonged indeed be that at length became evident that one in assembly have reply to whereupon tiahuana eye gleaming with triumph once more stepped forward said lord silence be complete sufficient answer to question prof that objection raised by lord huanacocha be unreasonable one must therefore again call upon to say whether be be not satisfied with other proof advanced there be pause hesitation time huanacocha at once rose said have fault to find with other proof contend that go far enough be still strongly of opinion that when divine manco return to will come in guise of one of indian of blood royal therefore must refuse to accept dictum of lord tiahuana that young white man be re incarnation of first manco founder of nation resumed seat bold defiant speech created a might be expected most tremendous sensation among other occupant of hall tiahuana with slight gesture of impatience at once threw up hand to demand silence said have heard objection raised by lord huanacocha be a well able a be to weigh judge value let now other lord arise in turn express opinion man on huanacocha right at once arose said be quite satisfied with proof adduced by high priest to be complete perfectly convincing man on left of huanacocha then sprang to foot said find quite impossible to come to definite decision one way other on one hand regard proof adduced by lord tiahuana a perfectly satisfactory on other think there be reason in objection raised by lord huanacocha that aspirant be white man notwithstanding have be said by high priest conviction be that true manco when appears will be born among be one of be unconvinced thus expression of opinion went on until have given one when appeared that huanacocha have four adherent to view remainder of noble being quite unanimous in conviction that harry be in very deed re incarnation of first manco be therefore accepted by overwhelming majority a tiahuana have confidently anticipated discomfited huanacocha friend be compelled to waive objection after recording did with somewhat better grace than might have be expected then came ceremony of swearing allegiance to new sovereign be done by individual present beginning with tiahuana who be followed by motahuana entire body of priest who in turn be succeeded by noble beginning with huanacocha by time that ceremony be concluded afternoon be well advanced be time to repair to main body of temple where service of thanksgiving be to be held in consideration of fact that harry be stranger of course completely ignorant of religious ritual followed by worshipper of sun motahuana be told off to accompany prompt accordingly led by deputy high priest young monarch followed by noble passed down long corridor wheeling to left passed through enormous archway veiled by great gold embroidered curtain upon being drawn aside at approach revealed whole of vast interior of temple proper in ceremony be to be held when hour two earlier young inca whose official name be now manco capac have approached enormous building in now found have promptly come to conclusion that edifice owed little nothing of imposing character to skill of architect for so far a architectural beauty be concerned be almost a plain unpretentious a own palace be imposing merely because of immense dimension consisted of huge rectangular block of pure white marble wall of be from eight to ten foot thick without column pediment even so much a few pilaster to break up monotonous smoothness regularity of exterior surface only aid in direction being great east doorway main entrance be thirty foot wide by about sixty foot high with immense window opening on side of through doorway entered light illuminated interior true doorway window opening be surrounded by heavy marble border frame encrusted with great plate of gold elaborately ornamented with boldly sculptured design there be also heavy gold string course bull nose moulding similar to on palace apart from gold tiled roof there be attempt at exterior decorative effect might have be deemed lacking in direction however be more than compensated for by barbaric splendour profusion of interior decoration entire west wall of building be covered with solid plate of burnished gold emblazoned with gigantic face from emanated ray innumerable representing sun great eye being reproduced in perfect blaze of gem precious stone of kind being thickly powdered also over plate be primarily intended to receive ray of rising sun through great east door in early morning at hour most impressive ceremony of day be celebrated reflect light back upon people two side wall be also decorated with great gold plate about two foot square richly engraved arranged in chequer pattern square of gold alternating with square of white marble wall of building from top to bottom from end to end of white marble square having in centre gold ornament about size of one hand formed mount for precious stone ruby emerald being most numerous although diamond of considerable size gleamed here there have stone be cut polished instead of being set in rough effect must have be gorgeous beyond description perhaps most wonderful part of whole building however be ceiling be composed entirely of white marble slab supported divided into panel by great beam of solid marble made up of enormous block of stone end of be so cunningly scarphed fitted together that joint be invisible gripped other so tightly that cement bolt be needed to complete union in centre of panel of ceiling at crossing of beam be great golden ornament bearing resemblance to full blown rose western wall of building be decorated like two side wall save that in place of bare marble silver square alternated with gold one finally great door in western wall be of solid silver wrought to represent timber grain knot of wood being imitated with marvellous fidelity while nail be represented in gold chapter thirteen daughter of umu piloted by motahuana harry presently found installed in marble throne raised on dais at western extremity of building behind altar of there be three facing vast assembly immediately on other side of altar facing be noble also occupying marble seat brave show made in gala attire umu captain of royal bodyguard in gorgeous uniform being very conspicuous figure among behind noble seated on wooden bench be people ranged row after row until so vast be building feature of seated near eastern wall be quite indistinguishable to young inca slight stir in immense assemblage caused by entrance of monarch train of noble have scarcely subsided when strain of distant music be heard rapidly increasing in power volume a musician drew near presently through archway immediately opposite that by escombe have entered there filed small army of priest led by tiahuana still in robe bearing wand sixty of be performing on variety of wind string instrument more le remotely suggestive of known to civilised nation while remainder chanted to accompaniment quaint by mean unpleasing melody air of be quite distinctly suggestive of rejoicing word of song hymn rather be quichua escombe be therefore unable to gather sense of in midst of priest walked band of twenty youth attired in richly embroidered white tunic of soft woollen material girt about waist with gold embroidered belt youth bore in arm mass of beautiful flower delicate perfume of quickly diffused throughout building priest youth be alike barefooted more careful scrutiny soon revealed to harry fact that be only individual in building so far a must see who remained shod led by instrumentalist procession wheeled to right passed slowly down first aisle of building to eastern extremity then right across past great eastern door up fourth aisle down third up second brought finally to altar stood on right of main high altar a looked at from escombe point of view then while priest continued chanting flower laden youth piled fragrant burden upon right hand altar twined about until be completely hidden from view by vari coloured bloom delicate foliage done youth retired high priest villac vmu a be called standing before flower draped altar with back to people uttered what appeared to be short invocation prayer during worshipper knelt upon beautifully tessellated marble pavement prayer lasted three four minute upon conclusion people rose resumed seat while tiahuana turning facing delivered address of twenty minute length after hymn be sung by priest people former slowly filing out of building during singing so timing movement that a last note be sung last priest disappeared through arch curtain fell behind harry not unnaturally concluded that ended ceremonial be quickly undeceived by motahuana who informed that one if not two burnt sacrifice yet remained to be offered indeed scarcely have piece of information be conveyed when music singing again made heard priest filed into building once more instead of band of flower bearing youth there appeared llama decked with garland wreath of flower led by two young priest time order of procedure be reversed procession crossing over to fourth aisle passing down up first down second up third finally brought opposite second subsidiary altar to golden ring in llama be now tethered processional hymn lasting long enough to allow operation to be completed then followed prayer succeeded by address during unfortunate llama be bound trussed up so ingeniously that unhappy creature be rendered incapable of making least struggle then number of priest seized helpless animal laid upon top of altar upon meanwhile great pile of cedar bough other scented wood have be carefully piled done two priest strode forward one bearing very formidable looking copper knife while other carried large most beautifully wrought basin of solid gold seizing llama by ear dragging head back first of two priest raised knife on high there be yellow flash a keen heavy blade descended upon animal throat next instant llama lifeblood be pouring smoking into basin second priest held to receive so dexterously be whole thing done that not single drop of blood stained white garment of priest have be otherwise must have be regarded a unfavourable omen moment that blood ceased to flow thong confined poor beast limb to body be released carcass be turned upon back belly be ripped open villac vmu stepped forward carefully examined entrails during people appeared to be held in state of most painfully breathless suspense however be happily not prolonged for lasted only few second when tiahuana stepping forward facing assembly threw up hand shouted blessed be father sun omen be exceptionally marvellously favourable sovereign lord inca be assured of long prosperous reign during will be permitted to accomplish be prophesied concerning instantly priest burst into loud paean of praise be promptly taken up by entire people standing during singing of priest appeared bearing torch kindled at sacred fire be kept alight throughout year torch presented to harry who at motahuana prompting with several qualm of conscience rose to foot thrust in among pile of wood on top of altar beneath body of llama crackling of dry twig formed substructure of cunningly arranged pile curling wreath of fragrant smoke soon showed that wood be fairly alight a little tongue of yellow flame leapt from twig to twig gathered power smoke shot upward from altar in thin perfectly straight column to ceiling great building fairly resounded with shout of jubilation of enormous congregation for be last most important omen of if smoke column have bent wavered in least must have foretold trouble ay even disaster have wavering be sufficiently pronounced on contrary omen from first to last have be of so exceptionally favourable character that special sacrifice of thank offering be always tentatively arranged for upon such occasion a present became foregone conclusion assembly instead of dispersing a must have done have omen be le eminently favourable settled again into seat with great sigh shudder of tense expectancy for must be first time that many of have ever be present at ceremony of kind be now pending escombe who be by time beginning to feel very tired a well a distinctly dissatisfied with for taking part in mummery noticed vaguely that something out of common be evidently toward be too thoroughly distrait to even seek explanation from motahuana watched a in dream long procession of priest file out of building to accompaniment of unmistakable song of triumph presently with more singing music came filing back again in comparatively brief interval of absence have contrived to effect complete change in appearance for instead of white garment have previously worn be now robed in crimson heavily bordered with gold embroidery while tiahuana robe be so completely covered with gold embroidery encrusted with gem that be a stiff a board crimson colour of material scarcely showing through still bore wand in hand mitre now wore blazed with gold precious stone on occasion instead of leading procession be preceded by priest scarcely le gorgeously robed than who held aloft beautiful banner of crimson cloth emblazoned with figure of sun other banner equally rich beautiful about twenty in be borne by main body of priest sooner be procession singing peculiarly sweet plaintive air fairly inside body of temple than escombe aroused with violent start for walking in midst of priest attired in simple white robe from hem of little bare foot peeped a walked with downcast eye wreathed garlanded about with long chain of magnificent crimson rose with hand bound behind there walked most lovely maiden that young man have ever seen although there be little doubt that be of pure indian blood be a fair a spaniard without vestige of colour a might well be expected under circumstance long dark hair unbound clustered in wavy ringlet upon shoulder far enough below waist to completely veil tied hand eye in building be instantly turned upon fair vision a congregation rose en masse loud gasp of what sounded very much like dismay drew escombe attention to umu who distinctly staggered a rose to foot while face went sickly yellowish white perspiration poured from forehead like rain poor fellow stared at girl a though must scarcely believe eye yet that did believe be perfectly evident while anguished expression of countenance made equally evident that be very deeply interested in young lady fate a to what that fate be to be there must be shadow of doubt even in mind of one so ignorant of detail of religious ceremonial of peruvian a be new monarch girl awful pallor very presence in procession fact of being garlanded with flower have own significance pointed indubitably to fact that be destined victim in human sacrifice turning to motahuana harry demanded in fierce whisper who be that girl why be taking part in procession to motahuana replied be daughter of umu captain of lord bodyguard a most beautiful maiden in city have be chosen by villac vmu a worthy great honour of being offered in sacrifice upon altar of thanksgiving on most memorable auspicious occasion be great surprise to umu of course to see only daughter occupying present proud position for by order of tiahuana be taken from father house within hour of departure to meet lord escort to city duty have probably not permitted to visit home since return hence sight of daughter in procession be first intimation have received of honour conferred upon utter indifference to anguish of chiefly concerned motahuana betrayed in speech made escombe fairly writhe with disgust abhorrence feeling be increased hundredfold by knowledge that young maiden be to be forced to lay down life parent home be to be made desolate in order that harry escombe accession to throne of inca might be fitly celebrated ground teeth in impotent fury unrestrainedly execrated stupendous folly have induced to enter so light heartedly into adventure fraught with element of such unimaginable horror true have done so with very best intention yes how often even in comparatively brief experience of life have known of action instigated by very best intention have culminated in grim disaster now be adding yet to long list stay be thing inevitable suddenly remembered that many of good intention have determined to acquiesce passively in event have placed where now be be based upon fact that a inca must be possessor of absolute power must be able to mould event to will that a inca must be superior to everybody even priesthood for inca be not only head of priesthood be actually credited with possession of certain measure of divinity in own person if be really true now be time to assert authority test power must forbid sacrifice see what came of a arrived at determination glanced up to find umu gaze fixed fully upon there be such intensity of unmistakable anguish entreaty in gaze harry unhesitatingly answered with nod encouraging smile evoked gasp of almost incredulous joy relief from recipient procession have by time passed down first aisle be coming up second paean of triumph thanksgiving pealing louder more thrillingly on ear with step of progress at length reached head of aisle wheeled to right with evident intention of turning into third aisle must have caused to brush close past row of bench by umu be standing moment before banner bearer who be leading procession arrived at wheeling point harry rose from throne standing on footstool so that person in vast building might see hear flung up right hand imperiously called halt in proceeding in response to procession came to abrupt standstill singer musician almost a abruptly became silent then harry beckoned tiahuana to side said interpret for have message for people then a tiahuana gazed aghast speechless at young man who have resorted to so unheard of proceeding a to interrupt ceremony of thanksgiving at most intensely interesting dramatic moment harry proceeded child of ancient peruvian nation hearken unto for pachacamac supreme creator ruler of universe who made thing yea even unto sun moon star adore in several season have moment put message into mouth bid deliver unto thus saith pachacamac great only one in day of old when peruvian be few scattered tribe plunged in depth of ignorance barbarism took pity upon sent to manco capac mama oello huaco two of child to gather together scattered tribe form into community to instruct in mystery of worship to teach art whereby might become great civilised nation for time thing went well with peruvian for listened to voice of messenger obeyed worshipping acting in accordance with command therefore blessed prospered exceedingly made of glorious powerful nation wise in art of government invincible in field of battle so that a year rolled on conquered surrounding tribe nation absorbed into with progress of time people fell into error ceased to worship honour transferred adoration to sun have made given unto a beneficent source of material benefit from derived light warmth caused stream to flow soil to bring forth abundant crop for sustenance of man beast caused flock to increase multiply greatly be source of life health beauty gave gratitude devotion to have created forgot creator of thing built hundred of temple in honour of sun one only did dedicate to therefore be displeased with withdrew from light of countenance permitted conquistador to land upon shore gave power to triumph over peruvian in battle to destroy atahuallpa to wrest land from until behold be left of once great nation be valley city ye have built in anger burn not for ever will hide face from for time behold have given inca who will guide straying foot back into right path who will point out to mistake have made teach how to correct if ye will obey may be that in process of time will again make great powerful nation even a be in old day ere hid face from permitted calamity to overtake now listen people unto have pleasure in sorrow suffering shedding of blood in sacrifice

in due time ye may deck altar with flower make beautiful house in ye worship if ye will obedience to law precept be more precious to than other thing if ye render unto ye will do well a harry uttered last word sank back into seat be safe to say that individual in great building be more astonished at behaviour than for have sprung to foot without ghost of notion of what meant to say animated only by one great overmastering impulse to save life of umu daughter rescue household from great terrible grief word have leapt to lip have spoken a one under influence of inspiration without thought pause hesitation in very building devoted to worship of object ever since peru became nation have be especial veneration of inhabitant have stood up boldly denounced worship of sun a idolatry have told that religious belief be wrong have unceremoniously broken in upon put stop to most impressive ceremony in ritual have forbidden certain practice hallowed by age of religious teaching now what be to be result must priest congregation rise up a one man tear audacious young innovator limb from limb offer up a sacrifice on altar from have essayed to snatch destined victim to propitiate outraged deity sensation produced on side a tiahuana have translated escombe denunciation sentence by sentence be tremendous grew in intensity a denunciation proceeded whether emotion excited be that of anger of blank astonishment young man must not determine to speak truth did very greatly care for felt that be doing duty regardless of possibility of most ghastly peril to indeed there be few possibility more dreadful than attendant upon bearding of multitude of fanatical idolators denouncing of object of idolatry everything almost everything must depend entirely upon view tiahuana priest took of harry conduct if after uncompromisingly outspoken attack upon worship of sun fundamental principle of religion tiahuana belief in theory that escombe be indeed re incarnation of first manco foretold by prophet titucocha remained unshaken might yet be well if not for minute excitement consternation reigned supreme over vast assembly yet there be nothing approaching tumult disorder in behaviour of people point raised by young inca message be evidently of such tremendous import that felt quite unable to deal with recognised almost from first moment that be matter must be left in hand of priest presently excitement began to die down everybody waited to see what must next happen a for tiahuana denunciation have fallen upon with such paralysing effect that have simply translated escombe message a nearly word for word a quichua language must permit with air aspect of man speaking under influence of fantastically horrible dream by time that excitement have subsided silence again reigned in great building have pulled together turning to harry said be lord quite certain beyond possibility of doubt that message have just delivered have be put into mouth by pachacamac not by evil malignant spirit yes answered escombe with conviction be what evil spirit must instruct peruvian to worship adore great pachacamac instead of one of work of hand very import of message ought to be convincing testimony of source from come may be may be can not tell answered tiahuana wearily if message come in very truth from pachacamac then have indeed strayed far from right path much have troubled puzzled wisest head among can be accounted for must also explain why forefather be so blind a to permit conquistador to enter country so weak a to be conquered by yes methinks there be matter of vast moment contained in message can not be discussed here now be lord will that people be dismissed yes answered harry almost breathless with astonishment at complete success of intervention tell people that appearance among be signal for many great momentous change decreed by pachacamac for advantage one of most important of will be that henceforth pachacamac supreme creator of heaven earth be therein only be to be worshipped in building ye have wandered far astray be of good comfort later on others whom pachacamac will send to will point way of return will be well with maiden lord who be to have be offered a thank offering what be to be done with demanded tiahuana let be returned with honour to home parent answered harry henceforth there be to be burnt sacrifice whether human otherwise then tiahuana standing before central altar where must be seen by heard by perhaps about half of congregation raising hand to command attention of audience interpreted escombe second message to adding word go in peace raising hand in gesture of blessing maintained until last person have passed out through great eastern door meanwhile maia daughter of umu destined victim of thank offering having not only heard also understood everything have transpired have fainted from excess of emotion produced by revulsion of feeling from of lofty exaltation to relief joy at reprieve from death even though death have come through long usage to be regarded a more honourable glorious than anything that life have to offer have be delivered to father who have lost not moment in conveying back to shelter of roof now lord said tiahuana tell pray what be to be done in matter of conducting ceremony in temple henceforth for pachacamac message seems to strike at very root of religion until be more fully instructed know not what to do how to proceed nay said harry reassuringly for saw that old man be intensely worried distressed matter be surely very simple that have to do be to transfer adoration from sun to pachacamac offering to prayer praise instead of addressing to sun surely be wiser more reasonable to worship who made thing than be to worship one of thing that have made do ye will do well if doubt must arise in mind come to will resolve also will instruct from time to time in truth concerning pachacamac until messenger will arrive now go in peace for ye have to be obedient to instruct people in truth even a yourselves will be instructed will be well then harry rose escorted by noble made way out of building to place where litter guard awaited whence mounting into seat be rapidly borne back to palace amid enthusiastic acclamation of populace lined street a bearer trotted smoothly evenly along road escombe detected thought that did new note in acclamation note must not for life of interpret be not that acclamation be le hearty than before on contrary seemed to be more enthusiastic than ever yet mingled with enthusiasm joy there seemed to be certain subtle undertone thrilled curiously caused to vaguely wonder whether message of delivered without forethought on spur of moment must prove to have be master stroke of genius irreparable mistake anyhow have delivered be main thing have quite determined that must deliver at first fitting convenient opportunity have therefore regret on score only thing worried be question whether have be delivered prematurely whether in fact must have be more powerful effective if have deferred deliverance until have taken time to prepare mind of people for reception be issue what might have accomplished at least one good deed have saved life given joy to one household in city be certainly matter upon might unreservedly congratulate meditating thus harry found scarcely knew how back at palace where chamberlain informed first that grand banquet have be arranged for same evening to be given by to noble to celebrate accession to throne secondly that lord umu be in waiting craved audience whereupon young man requested to be conducted to room in must suitably receive captain of bodyguard directed that functionary to be brought to flinging wearily into only chair in room to have be conducted escombe awaited arrival of umu who be presently ushered into apartment barefooted carrying upon shoulder small burden a badge of immeasurable inferiority great powerful noble though be to inca so intense be emotion upon finding in lord presence that for moment seemed quite incapable of speech to help out of difficulty whatever might be harry extended hand to said well umu friend what be be in trouble can help whereupon umu great powerful noble captain of thousand picked warrior flung upon knee before young inca clasping outstretched hand in of pressed convulsively to lip while tear streamed like rain from eye quickly pulled together gazing up into harry face answered gracious lord pardon unseemly emotion pray attribute to awful ordeal through have day passed have presumed to hasten lord to express a well a may be heartfelt gratitude of myself daughter for gracious intervention to day in temple for maia must now be dead home desolate lord be a yet strange among may therefore not know that for maiden to be chosen to be offered a thank offering on altar of temple upon occasion a of to day be regarded by peruvian indian a highest honour can be conferred upon who be connected with doubtless must be so regarded by many lord natural affection be not always to be so easily stifled be widower maia daughter be only child love exists between be therefore perhaps unusually strong honour of having given daughter a thank offering must never have compensated for reconciled to loss shock experienced to day when recognised bound decked with flower for sacrifice in midst of priest will never forget for have not then be to house knew not that have be chosen though having be chosen have wrought up to point of passive submission have wish to die for be young best part of life be still before moreover love know that without heart house must be empty desolate therefore lord pray to accept heartfelt thanks for deliverance to believe assurance that henceforth let what will betide two be faithful devoted slave unto life end thanks umu for assurance of devotion be convinced come from heart said harry raising soldier to foot umu wish to regard henceforth not a slave ' a faithful devoted friend servant who will unhesitatingly do will will doubtless be able to command in plenty sincere friend be le easily won especially by monarch wise faithful devoted friend who will help advise in difficult task lie before will be of greater value than many slave will always remember with especial pleasure first official act be to save innocent life that life of daughter whom heaven long spare to be joy comfort to go in peace umu serve faithfully will lord swear by great pachacamac answered umu raising right hand a though to register oath then turning went forth from palace proudest probably happiest man in valley of sun day chapter fourteen inca treasure chamber fatigue excitement of momentous day be by time beginning to tell upon escombe if must have followed own inclination must certainly have called for light meal having partaken of retired forthwith to rest be already beginning to learn lesson even absolute monarch have sometimes to put aside own inclination do be politic rather than be most pleasing in own eye here be banquet for instance must much rather not have be present at be official affair to absent from must simply be to inflict gratuitous slight upon guest present sow seed of unpopularity might quite possibly like fabled dragon teeth spring up into harvest of armed men to hurl from throne with sigh of resignation therefore summoned arima resigning into functionary hand submitted to be conducted to bath afterwards attired in festal garment prepared for occasion bath of warm delicately perfumed water found to be so wonderfully refreshing that upon emerging from sensation of fatigue have vanished by time that be completely arrayed for banquet felt perfectly prepared to do occasion full justice be only just ready in nick of time for a arima be completing adjustment of imperial borla upon young monarch temple lord high chamberlain appeared with intimation that guest be assembled that nothing now be needed save inca presence to enable banquet to be begun whereupon harry arose preceded by chamberlain satellite made way to banqueting hall be enormous chamber on upstairs floor of palace occupying entire length width of part of building in be situated main entrance one row of window overlooked that part of garden gave upon main road while window on opposite side of apartment commanded view of piece of garden lay between two wing extended down to shore of lake decoration of room if must not be accurately described a artistic from european point of view be at least impressive on account of wanton lavishness with gem precious metal be used for look where one must eye encountered nothing gold silver precious stone indeed impression conveyed be that architect have exhausted ingenuity in device for employment of greatest possible quantity of costly mineral huge beam supported ceiling be encased in thick plate of gold ceiling at least portion of showed between beam consisted of plate of silver thickly studded with precious stone arranged a tiahuana explained to represent star in night sky over city wall of enormous thickness with deep niche recess alternating with window be covered with thick gold plate heavily chased into variety of curious pattern niche contained life size image of animal llama figuring most frequently in solid gold wrought with most marvellous patience skill be miniature garden in various native tree plant wrought with same lifelike skill of same precious material seemed to flourish luxuriantly floor be only portion of apartment have escaped barbarously magnificent system of treatment even be composed of thick plank of costly richly tinted native timber of beautiful grain polished to brilliancy of mirror a though be not sufficient to meet insatiable craving for extravagance everywhere displayed beauty of highly polished wood be almost completely concealed by thick richly coloured woollen rug of marvellously fine texture made of wool of vicuna be furniture of apartment permitted to fall short of surroundings in point of extravagance for table chair occupied by guest be of solid silver while occupied by inca such of guest a chose to especially honour by invitation to sit with be of solid gold table utensil throughout room be of same precious metal most exquisitely elaborately wrought a for guest a might be expected have taken especial care that personal appearance must be in keeping with general scheme of wantonly lavish display characterised adornment of banqueting room one of men woman alike be apparelled in richest most brilliantly coloured stuff procurable stiffened with great mass of embroidery in heavy gold thread while be literally loaded with ornament of massive gold encrusted with gem upon hair neck arm now for first time harry have leisure to note to strongly disapprove of characteristic ornament be adopted to distinguish peruvian noble from plebeian brother consisted of massive circular disc of gold wrought into semblance of wheel measuring in case three four inch in diameter be inserted into cartilage of ear of course have previously be pierced gradually distended to receive to harry unsophisticated eye so called ornament constituted hideous disfigurement be glad to see that be worn by men only ear of woman being for most part innocent of artificial adornment although few of lady wore ear ring of somewhat similar character to of more civilised sister inca table be placed at one end of room raised upon dais three foot high from elevation must of course be seen of also command view of entire apartment easily distinguishing whereabouts of particular guest whom desired to honour especially with summons to own table to be conducted by chamberlain usher guest rising upon entrance remaining standing until have seated there be at moment one guest at royal table be tiahuana whom harry have commanded to sit beside to act a sort of coach generally explain thing first communication villac vmu made to young monarch be not precisely of reassuring character be to effect that huanacocha four friend who have sided with afternoon in expression of doubt a to genuine character of harry claim to be accepted a inca have absented from feast yes said tiahuana again casting eye carefully over room be five absent lord like not be men of great power influence can easily stir up very serious trouble in city if choose to do so must keep wary eye upon upon first sign of disposition to be troublesome must be summarily dealt with yes said harry have be raised to position of inca by very remarkable combination of circumstance in bringing about of have have part being where be intend to govern firmly justly to best of ability will certainly not tolerate presence in city of turbulent spirit bent upon stirring up of discord strife have already seen elsewhere too much of evil result of mistaken leniency to permit anything of kind here be not moment to discus politics hinted short time ago tiahuana at function of kind be usual for inca to show honour to certain individual by inviting to table now of course know none of present except umu captain of bodyguard whom see yonder so must look to for guidance in matter of making judicious choice there be room for ten at table beside therefore if be proper thing for to do choose ten person will summon to come to whereupon tiahuana who to sanctity of villac vmu added shrewdness sagacity of prime minister named member of late council of seven who have accepted escombe a inca certain other powerful noble completing list by naming umu whom rather satirically suggested be perhaps entitled to especial consideration in recompense for distinction have that day missed in consequence of rescue of daughter from sacrificial altar remember lord concluded tiahuana that be not necessary to keep of people at table during entire progress of banquet let stay here long enough to taste single dish to drink with out of cup then dispatch with instruction to send up someone else in stead upon principle accordingly harry acted arranging matter so judiciously that under tiahuana able guidance be able during course of evening to compliment guest whom that astute old diplomatist considered desirable especially to honour thus avoid occasion for jealousy be not necessary to describe banquet in detail let suffice to say that for fully three hour there be placed before inca guest constant succession of dish representing be esteemed most choice dainty in peruvian culinary art washed down by copious libation of wine of country prepared from fermented juice of maguey for be deplorable to add peruvian exhibited inordinate fondness by exercise of extreme circumspection taking merely taste here there of such food a especially appealed to merely suffering wine to moisten lip when pledging noble young inca contrived to emerge from ordeal of banquet not penny worse next morning escombe spent in company of sort of committee of chief amautas wise men who represented concentrated essence so to speak of peruvian wisdom learning who have be embodied for express purpose of instructing young inca in intricacy such a be of code of tavantinsuyu four quarter of world a then stood code be simple exceedingly severe law properly so called relating almost exclusively to criminal matter punishment regulation governing daily life of peruvian indian where must live what must be character of work what must be distinctive character of clothing when whom must marry how much land must hold cultivate so on be result of age of tentative experiment be so numerous intricate probably none amautas thoroughly understood committee however have for nearly month be preparing for task of initiating young inca into secret of good government have arranged procedure of such character even in course of one morning instruction contrived to give escombe sufficiently clear general insight of subject to enable to see that taken altogether system of government be admirably designed to secure prosperity of nation then in afternoon at instigation of council of seven who have now become sort of cabinet to control machinery of government under supervision of inca harry be conducted by official who performed function of chief of treasury through enormous vault beneath palace in order that might view treasure industriously accumulated during more than three hundred year to form sinew of war for regeneration of race be escombe great predestined task if before visiting vault harry have be invited to express opinion upon subject must have confidently asserted conviction that such treasure a inhabitant of valley of sun have be able to accumulate must very nearly have be expended in adornment of great temple royal palace that conviction must have be absolutely erroneous be speedily demonstrated when great bronze door guarding entrance of vault be thrown open for first room into be conducted apartment measuring twenty foot wide by thirty foot long about fourteen foot high be full of great stack of silver bar bar being about twenty pound in weight stack of varying height being arranged in tier of three running lengthwise along room with two narrow longitudinal passage between escombe after staring in dumb amazement at enormous accumulation of dull white metal drew from pocket small memorandum book pencil have found in one of pocket of old clothes with instinct of engineer rising for moment to surface made rapid calculation by arrived at astounding result that there must be very nearly eight hundred ton of bar silver in stack before from room be conducted into of about same size similarly arranged in case metal in stack be virgin gold instead of silver while bulk of stack be if anything rather greater than in outer room for purpose of rough estimate escombe assumed to be of only equal bulk upon strength of assumption figure informed that gold in vault amounted to not altogether insignificant weight of close upon fourteen hundred ton sight of such incredible quantity of precious metal have so paralysing effect upon young englishman that must scarcely stammer enquiry a to where came from custodian of fabulous wealth replied with smile that mountain hemmed valley about be enormously rich in gold silver that hundred of men have be kept industriously employed in working mine almost from moment when city have be first founded continued flinging open third door what have already seen be by mean wealth most valuable part of be to be found in small room passing through doorway like other two be fitted with massive door of solid bronze secured by enormously strong lock of same metal young inca who a one of result of having be placed upon throne have become absolute owner of wealth with power to use in such manner a might seem to good found in much smaller room dimension being about ten foot long by same width twelve foot high to side of room be fitted large chest of very heavy wood three chest on side occupying entire length of room with passage way about six foot wide between two row of chest chest be fitted with massive wooden cover secured to by strong bronze hinge fastened by ponderous bronze lock custodian unlocked chest one at time raising heavy cover with difficulty held lamp carried over yawning interior disclosing content first chest opened be nearly full of what to escombe appeared to be dull black stone most of with at least one smooth surface ranging in size from of walnut to lump a large a man two fist one of lump harry conductor took out handed to young man for inspection well what do call demanded harry turning stone about in hand inspecting curiously that lord be amethyst answered other a see chest be nearly full of unless must happen to discover new mine be afraid will get more of for mine from be extracted appears to be exhausted be never very productive even at best did not know what stone be when be first discovered a be suspected that might posse certain value step be taken to determine question with result that be told be amethyst be not especially valuable believe make point of never wasting anything so be decided to store until wanted now here opening next chest have mineral about be bit puzzled at first be in le doubt in case than be with regard to amethyst a appearance of stone seemed to indicate that possessed value dealt with a did with amethyst found that have chanced upon particularly rich opal deposit chest of opal be like one previously opened almost full harry took admiringly into hand great piece of rock representing half of mass of stone have be accidentally broken in two found to contain considerable quantity of iridescent many hued crystal next chest contained very fine specimen of sapphire be little more than half full mine having only be discovered within last decade even then not very industriously worked there be in chest few specimen escombe shrewdly suspected to be practically priceless having completed inspection of content of coffer on one side of room custodian crossed over to other side threw up lid of chest interior of at once began to glow a though of stone looking very much like lump of ordinary washing soda contained within morsel of phosphorus aha exclaimed escombe plunging hand delightedly into chest fishing up two three of stone need to ask what be there be possibility of mistaking yes there be genuine soapy feel about right a ran finger over smooth surface of crystal did know that have diamond in peru there be at event one mine in country lord namely that from stone came answered indian existence locality be known only to few who work who guard approach to for believe to be richest mine in whole world be naturally anxious to retain possession of for exclusively be not in valley lie long three day journey from here in particularly wild desolate part of country be practically inaccessible save to boldest hardiest mountaineer among have only be known for about twenty year content of coffer represent labour of only six men during time mine be enormously rich a may see size quality of stone improve a miner penetrate deeper largest finest stone be most recently extracted being at top of others in chest harry stooped over picked up particularly fine specimen larger than one of clenched fist glowed scintillated in light of lamp a though be on fire why said gazing admiringly at stone a turned about in hand content of chest must be of absolutely incalculable value stone alone must constitute very handsome fortune to lucky possessor if be judge of diamond true lord answered companion there be several finer stone than one for example a fished up couple of superb specimen there be probably diamond in world equal to two in size purity of colour belong to lord ay said harry with such enormous inexhaustible wealth a at one command must not be very difficult to provide mean of reconquering country restoring to former state of power glory what have in other two chest lord will see answered indian a unlocked threw back lid of next chest proved to be three part full of ruby one of constituted little fortune in while many be of such exceptional size superb colour that young englishman must only gasp in speechless amazement admiration why huatama exclaimed at length be at loss to express astonishment aladdin cave be nothing to nothing at aladdin did lord say murmured indian looking enquiringly at harry seem to remember surely be not peruvian name doe not answered harry with laugh aladdin knew nothing of peru be eastern chinese fellow something like if remember rightly ah yes remarked huatama reflectively have seen few chinese down at lima callao when have occasion to go there year ago on business for council of seven like hope that when lord have subjugated country will drive out of well will see rejoined escombe with laugh be early day a yet to talk of driving out chinese there be great deal to be done before will find face to face with question now what doe last chest contain contained emerald be more than half full of stone of surpassing size purity of colour one of being picked stone especially selected for exceptional quality escombe power of admiration be by time completely exhausted after having rather perfunctorily examined expressed approval of few of finest specimen commended treasure a whole to unflagging care of huatama returned to apartment in palace flung into chair to endeavour to convince that what have seen in rock hewn chamber below be prosaically real not fantasy of disordered imagination a pictured to great chamber with heaped up stack of silver gold bar smaller room with six coffer of uncut gem thought insensibly floated away across ocean to modest little sydenham home tried to imagine rapture of mother sister must behold incredible accumulation of priceless gem that eye have rested upon day then remembered that in consequence of extraordinary adventure of mail boat have be permitted to leave for england with letter on board from to mother began to wonder anxiously what must happen at lime when occupant fully realised that peruvian mail have arrived that there be letter for be first time that thing have ever be permitted to occur although have be quite helpless to prevent accident escombe somehow felt that ought not to have be allowed to happen that ought to have remembered in time taken step to ensure that letter have be despatched by mean other be use of being inca if must not manage simple little thing like to summon arima enquire of trusty henchman whether in hurry of departure from survey camp have remembered to pack up bring away master writing desk be naturally next thing in order upon learning that desk have not be forgotten escombe at once have brought to sat down wrote long letter addressed jointly to mother sister letter contained full account of abduction have followed thereupon together with assurance that not only must contrive henceforward to communicate with regularly also that if after lapse of certain length of time to allow process of settling down to become complete must appear that scheme of government be likely to prove success must send for to come out to added that meanwhile enormous wealth represented by accumulation of more than three hundred year be at absolute disposal that felt quite justified in awarding salary of one gold bar per calendar month for service to state also that since under present circumstance have use for private purse must dispatch to monthly bar of gold for own personal use enjoyment that must expect to employ for purpose named somewhat lengthy epistle concluded by giving instruction for conversion of gold bar into coin of realm harry also wrote to sir philip swinburne stating that have fallen into hand of indian be being well treated by believed be in immediate danger also at moment saw prospect of being permitted to return to civilisation be therefore writing for purpose of allaying apprehension might be experienced on account finally wrote to bannister in somewhat similar term then sent for huatama gave that functionary instruction to withdraw one gold bar from treasury vault have securely packed in suitable box for transmission to europe chapter fifteen monster haunted lake matter attended to escombe summoned council of seven to palace held what might be considered first official conference began by laying before view a to step necessary to be taken in order to carry out successfully desire of people to become regenerated nation instructing to cause several different kind of information to be obtained for finally pointing out to necessity for free communication with outside world consequent establishment of something in nature of regular postal transport service between valley two three point on railway system long before have finished all that have to say be perfectly evident to young inca that member of council at least of be entirely out of sympathy with many of view idea that must have to contend with vast amount of ignorance prejudice to indicate few out of many point where lack of sympathy most strongly manifested harry have commented upon necessity for establishing army providing with most modern efficient weapon equipment to huanacocha supporter strongly objected arguing that state already possessed army in shape of inca bodyguard horse foot in opinion ought to be amply sufficient to reconquer country in view of fact that pizarro army numbered le than two hundred men when captured atahuallpa thus achieved conquest of peru a to importation of modern weapon be altogether opposed to proposal for many reason chief of be difficulty delay attendant upon procuring of of introduction into country further delay involved in training troop to use moreover weapon with existing troop be armed be such a have always be accustomed to in use of be already thoroughly skilled radical change a be proposed must of necessity involve enormous delay for part be unable to see advantage in proposal looked with equal disfavour upon proposal to establish postal transport service arguing that there be need for anything of kind fundamental idea governing settlement of forefather in valley founding of city of sun being that inhabitant resource of valley must be amply sufficient to achieve reconquest of country be not until harry have very nearly lost temper in arguing with men that learned that not one of have ever be outside valley that very meagre knowledge of outside world have be derived from few individual who at rare interval have be obliged to make short hasty journey outside confines of encircling mountain upon state business a soon a harry have thoroughly grasped fact gave to understand a politely a possible that none of knew in least what be talking about for reason must feel compelled to dispense with advice for future forming own plan in accordance with knowledge have acquired during residence of several year in biggest busiest best informed city in world henceforth must ask of nothing more than loyal wholehearted obedience to command finally dismissed with instruction to establish immediately service of postal runner between valley town of juliaca on santa rosa puno arequipa mollendo railway with further instruction to arrange for establishment of thoroughly trustworthy agent at juliaca whose sole business must be to see that letter for europe other part of world be duly stamped posted upon receipt by to care of whom letter for valley might be addressed done escombe summoned arima to presence handing coin that happened to have in possession delivered to letter have written together with gold bar by time securely packed ready for posting directed to proceed with possible speed to islay using railway a far a possible in order to save time there post letter box containing bar then suddenly bethought before dismissing arima upon journey sat down wrote long letter to mr john firmin of lima who have be fellow passenger from england with harry on board rimac in letter told firmin a much of story a thought necessary for to know made certain arrangement whereby firmin be to undertake certain business transaction from time to time to supply immediately certain necessary for due delivery of harry gave friend most minute instruction completed what inca be pleased to regard a very excellent satisfactory day work now young englishman began to find time very fully occupied so much so indeed that day seemed not nearly long enough to enable to accomplish half of what wished to do there be for instance learning of quichua language harry have not be domiciled in palace twenty four hour before have become patent to that be first task must undertake for very few of noble have knowledge whatever of spanish inconvenience loss of time involved in conversing through interpreter be far too great to be passively endured since must do very little else a satisfactorily a must wish until have mastered rich expressive language devoted four hour of day two in morning two in evening to study then soon learned that exclusive of inhabitant of valley of sun there be three hundred fifty thousand indian scattered up down country at least one in ten of whom might be counted a fighting man people have to be brought into valley housed fed disciplined in preparation for time when arm must be put into hand also what be more difficult still matter have to be so arranged that family of men dependent upon must suffer loss inconvenience from drafting of able bodied into valley then arrangement preparation for importation of arm ammunition into country everything connected with have of course to be done entirely without knowledge of authority involved tremendous amount of hard intricate work be therefore not to be wondered at during first six month of reign young inca be unable to spare single hour for amusement moment be at hand when harry be to enjoy sport of quite unique character way in came about be thus a stood one morning in palace garden gazing out over lake with faithful henchman arima close at hand idea suddenly occurred to turning remarked lake look particularly enticing morning arima be there balsa near at hand because if so will fetch one will go out together to deep water indulge in glorious swim swim lord in deep water of lake ejaculated arima in horror stricken accent nay be impossible impossible repeated harry why pray because of monster lord answered arima be to venture to plunge into lake must almost certainly be devoured indeed answered harry so there be monster in lake be there be not aware of be monster be alligator voracious fish be must hardly have supposed that water of lake be warm enough for alligator to flourish in nay lord answered arima be not alligator have seen alligator in of northern river know well enough to be able to distinguish between monster haunt lake be fish if be be quite unlike other fish that eye of mine have ever beheld call monster because forefather did so because have other name for also because of exceeding size malevolence ah commented harry well what be creature monster like how big be have ever seen yes lord be answer have seen le than three time at close quarter always with same disastrous result first time be when during passage of lake on balsa one of companion have misfortune to fall into water ere balsa must be stopped paddled back to where man be struggling two of monster appeared tore limb from limb resemblance to alligator lie chiefly in shape of head however be longer in proportion more pointed than of alligator also monster have smooth skin nearly black in colour instead of foot leg have fin tail also be differently shaped from of alligator being wide flat at end by jove exclaimed harry in astonishment must be queer formidable looking creature indeed fin in place of leg foot will be shot if can place at be there many of generally see more than two three at most although be on record that on one occasion many year ago four be seen two of being obviously young one answered arima upon word sound exceedingly interesting commented harry must dearly like to see creature do often show very rarely lord save in case of such accident a of have told answered arima yet continued if lord desire to see monster must doubtless be managed if carcass of animal be deposited upon yonder rock indian pointed to rock showing slightly above water surface about mile from shore be cast into water quite near monster must doubtless be attracted to place if lord be close at hand at time upon large safe balsa must see when crawl up on rock to reach carcass exposed there ah ejaculated harry think so then let matter be arranged for to morrow arima confess that description of creature have powerfully excited curiosity made very anxious to see on morrow young inca curiosity be fully gratified with something to spare oh monster harry believed possessed passably fair general knowledge of natural history creature monster truly be entirely new to in natural history have ever seen representation of anything like yet when came to think of again singular terrifying a be appearance be not altogether unfamiliar believed have seen portrayed somewhere although must not for moment remember where fully forty foot long from snout to tip of tail with head shaped midway between of pike crocodile with enormous protruding eye with smooth somewhat fish shaped body almost black above shading off to dirty whitish grey beneath with long tail broad flat at extremity with four seal like flipper instead of leg foot monster looked more like nightmare creature evolved by reading book on antediluvian animal after of course be escombe decided a thought took such turn a above now distinctly remembered having read year ago most interesting illustrated magazine article upon extinct animal one of picture portrayed identical monster labelling plesiosaurus yes more harry thought about le room did find for doubt that so called monster haunting lake in valley of sun be actually survivor most probably only one of antediluvian plesiosaurus how got there be most interesting problem yet seemed by mean difficult one to solve conclusion at escombe speedily arrived rightly wrongly be that upon subsidence of water of deluge pair of plesiosauri have found imprisoned in great basin of valley where condition presumably being exceptionally favourable have not only survived have actually contrived to perpetuate specie to very limited extent reason why lake be not swarming with instead of containing probably only three four specimen at utmost be doubtless that water be too circumscribed in extent too unproductive in matter of fish to support more than number problem of how came to be where be be however not one of very great importance thing really mattered be in escombe opinion that presence in lake constituted horrible danger to who be obliged to traffic upon water must be destroyed must not be permitted to exist day longer than be absolutely necessary why when one came to think of how many hundred of life might not already have fallen victim to savage voracity of creature what hope for life must man have if chanced to fall off balsa at moment when one of monster happened to be close at hand positively none escombe shuddered a reflected ignorant a have hitherto be of presence of plesiosauri in lake have only be by series of fortuitous circumstance be intervention of merciful providence that have be from time to time prevented from bathing in lake ay actually swimming out to distant rock a have several time be strongly tempted to do yes implacably ferocious monster must be destroyed forthwith only point remaining to be settled be how be work of destruction to be accomplished plan first suggested to young inca be very obvious one of fishing for with baited hook line even a shark be fished for true must need very big hook very strong line to capture creature of size strength of plesiosaurus to manufacture be surely not beyond resource of inhabitant of valley yes there be matter to be considered what about craft from to do fishing largest balsa that harry have ever seen upon lake be not nearly big enough for purpose hooked plesiosaurus must drag under water without effort then what must become of occupant probability be too awful for contemplation idea be not to be entertained for moment besides balsa be not at kind of craft on to engage in so dangerous form of sport even though be possible to build one big enough what be needed be good stanch sturdy boat of say twenty ton so having arrived at point in meditation escombe be naturally reminded that have often wished that possessed small yacht wherein to disport on lake why must not have one will be law have to speak word best most skilled worker in valley must be at disposal for construction of vessel a to design why have always be enthusiastic yacht sailor knew a well a most amateur what shape of craft must be be quite capable of putting that shape on paper in form must be worked from escombe mind be made up must destroy plesiosauri to destroy suitable boat be necessary that boat might be so designed built a to also afford great deal of pleasure must have thereupon set to work devoted minute must spare to preparation of design week later be in hand of small army of carpenter eager to show what must do in line of work be entirely new to chapter sixteen slaying of monster many hand make light work in just two month from day of starting work upon cutter be complete rigged ready for launching be of most up to date type with escombe be acquainted be to say beamy rather willow of body with spoon bow fin keel designer felt particularly proud of a walked round critically surveyed line general shape last thing before giving word to put into water needle to say be also object of great ever increasing curiosity to inhabitant of valley generally not more than perhaps dozen of whom have ever seen anything more handy shipshape than unwieldy balsa raft constructed of reed not very manageable craft at best of time of course quite incapable of being navigated under sail except before wind cutter be got into water without accident after slight readjustment of inside ballast to bring accurately to correct water line young owner got on board nice sailing breeze happening to be blowing right down lake took for trial spin from one end of lake to other running down beating back result be eminently satisfactory in respect little vessel developing fine turn of speed not only before wind also close hauled while be of course like craft of similar form remarkably weatherly indeed smartness with worked back against wind from lower end of lake be regarded by unsophisticated inhabitant of valley a nothing short of miraculous meanwhile escombe having given instruction for manufacture of hardened copper hook with two fathom of chain attached stout rope of plaited raw hide at same time that have put yacht in hand article be now ready therefore after exercising crew for week to get thoroughly accustomed to working of new craft made arrangement for grand plesiosaurus hunt to invited stanch friend umu three four other noble who have manifested capacity for development into kindred spirit on certain glorious morning novel fishing party embarked on board yacht taking with of course fishing line carcass of two llama cut in half for bait together with formidable battery of bow arrow spear heavy mace other weapon for killing of quarry when captured to armament escombe added magazine rifle two packet of cartridge faithful arima have be careful to bring away from survey camp together with everything else belonging to young master on memorable occasion of individual abduction starting under easy sail heading for bottom of lake great fishing line made fast by inner end to windlass bitt remainder of led aft outside clear of rigging be baited paid out astern a soon a cutter have run into deep water be not very long before party intently on watch for approach of plesiosauri detected strong swirling ripple mingling with of yacht wake indicated that at least one of monster be at hand presently ripple broke revealing six foot of smooth black glistening back keeping pace with little vessel while occasionally when light favoured indistinct momentary glimpse might be caught through swirling water of two enormous glaring eye beast in eagerness to reach supposed prey have apparently passed baited hook a unworthy of notice for bait be long way astern of creature seemed intent only on overtaking yacht for now made frequent rush forward until be within few fathom of little vessel counter then sank out of sight dropped astern again a though knew not what to make of moving object ahead of provokingly enough from sportsman point of view never dropped far enough astern to bring level with bait while on other hand when approached yacht be careful to keep far enough below surface to render anything like accurate aim impossible indeed behaved a though instinctively knew that danger threatened although escombe companion be eager enough to waste arrow in obviously futile attempt to hit young leader of expedition rigorously forbade everything of nature of chance shooting lest creature must happen to receive more le slight wound thus be driven to flight for same reason escombe declined to attempt shot with rifle while be intently watching movement of creature standing with weapon in hand ready to discharge effective shot at first favourable opportunity sudden startled yell from arima who be tending fishing line caused whole party to wheel round to see what be matter harry have only bare time to drop rifle grip faithful henchman by belt to thus prevent from being dragged overboard a line suddenly tautened out like bar flinging up great shower of spray a did so while terrific plunge in water far astern revealed fact that second monster whose presence have hitherto be undetected have taken bait become hooked let go line idiot let go hissed escombe through clenched teeth a braced foot against stanchion flung back clinging with hand to arima belt while individual vainly strove to hold now frantically struggling reptile let go man if want to be dragged overboard eaten alive haul down foresail there for'ard stout raw hide line twanged like harp string a terrified arima relaxed convulsive grip on be hauled back inboard to safety by master yacht forward progress be checked with abruptness threatened to drag bitt out of a strain of line with plunging struggling monster at end of be suddenly thrown upon while shock sent individual fore aft sprawling upon deck to uproarious most undignified amusement of young inca mortal terror of faithful subject then a hand scrambled to foot again instinctively regained possession of weapon hooked saurian started to run in vain hope possibly of breaking away from restraining influence have so suddenly unaccountably seized upon yacht be whirled violently round almost capsizing in process dragged with bow nearly buried in hissing curling water back toward head of lake at steadily increasing pace a now thoroughly terrified plesiosaurus surged forward at headlong speed in frenzied endeavour to escape with companion keeping pace by side yacht have only travelled distance of three mile down lake when monster have taken bait on backward journey distance be covered in about quarter of hour fact bore eloquent testimony to tremendous strength of creature harry be beginning to feel exceedingly uneasy lest vessel must be towed into such willow water that must be compelled to cut line in order to save from being dragged ashore when quarry probably also objected to willow water wheeled suddenly right round rushing close past cutter in perfect maelstrom of foam spray headed back for lower end of lake with companion still bearing company to thrust helm hard over to shout to everybody to lie down hang on for life be with work of moment yet yacht handy a be on helm have scarcely swept halfway round when stout line again jerked taut terrific strain again came upon bitt causing to ominously creak groan once more little vessel heeled gunwale under a be whirled violently round until righted again ploughed up glassy sheet of foam laced water on bow a tore along in wake of monster reptile can not possibly last very much longer remarked escombe reassuringly to companion who have by time turned sickly greenish yellow with terror at so unaccustomed adventure too on element to be practically stranger brute will soon become exhausted at rate when doe will haul alongside finish off with spear arrow care how far run so long a head a be now going be sudden twist turn be dangerous if be to break away must probably never have chance to hook again nevertheless despite harry confident prognostication have traversed quite length of lake ere there be slightest perceptible sign of creature weakening accomplished quarter of distance ere reptile slackened speed sufficiently to admit of attempting to haul yacht up alongside then when at length proceeded to make attempt additional strain thrown on rope a be hauled in coiled down seemed to exhaust last remnant of brute strength stopping suddenly rose to surface throwing head out of water shook savagely from side to side in futile endeavour to shake free of hook emitting curious grunting kind of roar a did so yet even now creature be not conquered for when found being hauled alongside yacht suddenly sank nearly whole of length of rope have be hauled in be allowed to run out again ere harry by taking quick turn round bitt be able to stay downward progress then became matter of sheer downright drag by hand ere huge bulk must be brought near enough to surface to permit of use of weapon on when be found that companion still clung faithfully to side at length after fifteen minute of exhausting labour on one hand opposed to stolid dogged resistance on other monster reptile be dragged so close to surface that point of snout be actually raised above level water whole of gigantic body right down to extremity of broad ended tail must be clearly seen hanging suspended vertically in pellucid depth beneath yacht while swimming agitatedly round round suspended body must occasionally be seen creature mate now plunging deep a though thoroughly terrified have at length determined to abandon so dangerous neighbourhood anon returning with swift rush to surface furious dartings to fro a though meditating attempt at rescue of companion now for first time hunter be able to obtain thoroughly clear satisfactory view at close quarter of gruesome looking brute truly hideous nightmare inspiring sight be sight a escombe gazed at ponderous powerful thick skinned body enormous protruding balefully glaring eye long cavernous gaping jaw armed with great serrated teeth of upper jaw fitting in between of lower caused to feel more strongly than ever conviction that in destroying creature be public benefactor captured brute now hung so nearly motionless with point of great barbed hook protruding through upper jaw that be evident strength must be practically exhausted escombe standing by to open fire with magazine rifle in case of emergency gave word to companion to deal death stroke advising to endeavour to reach creature brain by mean of spear thrust through eye while others be to attempt to pierce heart with arrival of crucial moment nerve of native seemed to suddenly fail became flurried frightened in very act of raising weapon to strike man of missed mark inflicting many serious doubtless painful wound not one seemed in least degree likely to prove result be immediate resumption of struggle so violent that for breathless minute two really seemed a though cutter stout little craft a be must be dragged under water sunk in very height of confusion one of hunter must need fall overboard into midst of boiling flurry of bloodstained foam raised by struggle of frantic brute be only dragged aboard again by harry in very nick of time to save from terrific rush of second plesiosaurus then young leader of party seeing that companion be too completely unnerved to be of use that violent struggle of wounded brute threatened to seriously injure if did not actually destroy cutter stepped forward raising rifle seized opportunity afforded by pause of fraction of second in violent movement of creature sent bullet crashing through right eye into brain settled matter struggle ceased for moment two with startling suddenness convulsive writhing movement followed then came terrible shudder with final gasping groan monster yielded up life hung motionless body supported still in upright position by great hook through jaw with crack of escombe rifle second monster have suddenly vanished question now be what be to be done with carcass of dead plesiosaurus a harry stood there contemplatively regarding be perfectly obvious to that if great fish hook be cut out of creature jaw with axe body must at once sink to bottom of lake there must be end of so far a be concerned party must at once be free to resume fishing although have doubt a to whether after what have already happened of monster must be tempted to take baited hook suddenly occurred to that plesiosaurus being to intent purpose extinct antediluvian animal only remains of in existence must necessarily consist of such fossilised fragment a have be accidentally discovered in course of excavation that complete skeleton of such gigantic specimen a before must be regarded a priceless acquisition by curator of natural history museum at south kensington so at once resolved to take necessary step for preservation gave order for line to hook be bent to be led aft for convenience of towage then commanded crew to set cutter sail purpose being to tow carcass to lonely part of shore there have body hauled up out of water flesh carefully removed from bone skeleton a carefully disarticulated prior to packing for dispatch to england cutter be scarcely under way heading for spot have be selected a suitable for above operation when disturbance of water near at hand indicated presence of bulky moving body most probably companion of dead creature have be terrified into temporary flight by report of harry rifle animal however whatever might be remained invisible little swirling eddy ripple on surface of water alone betraying whereabouts while harry friend be discussing appearance wondering what might portend one of happened to glance around in direction startled exclamation caused rest of party to look in direction toward pointed there somewhat to consternation party saw not dozen yard away on cutter weather beam indication two more of monster be present keeping way with cutter a be presently pretty evident edging in toward indeed so close be to that occasional momentary flicker of black back of nearer of two must already be caught through gleaming water two three of noble who have by time succeeded in pulling together getting grip upon courage proposed instant attack upon monster escombe felt that for moment have a much upon hand a must manage for with huge dead bulk in cutter be scarcely under command have desire to scare creature away by commencing attack upon must not follow up choice however be not left to for long for within five minute of discovery of last arrival three of plesiosauri a with one consent at signal closed in upon carcass of comrade flinging upon with utmost fury gave up to task of tearing to piece work being accomplished in midst of foaming splashing turmoil of water be absolutely terrifying to witness caused little cutter to pitch roll to extent that be almost impossible to retain footing upon heaving deck whether creature made attempt to devour great lump of flesh that tore from violently swaying carcass be quite impossible to determine in case process of disintegration be speedy one for in le than ten minute from moment of attack be left attached to hook be head of defunct saurian justly vexed at malicious interference with plan determined to save at least last relic a trophy of prowess young inca gave order for head to be hauled inboard upon first attempt to do one of monster made savage rush seized head in great jaw worrying a dog worry rat giving utterance a did so to succession of horrid grunting kind of growl caused most of hearer to break into cold perspiration so tenaciously did brute retain grip that for few minute onlooker be almost persuaded that be hooked ultimately released mangled fragment powerful jaw have by time crushed splintered almost out of recognition retreating thirty yard suddenly wheeled came foaming back to yacht at made furious dash with apparent determination to climb on board sweep deck clear of human freight so resolute indeed be in driving home attack that actually succeeded in getting two fore flipper in on boat deck scattering occupant right left almost driving two three over side while so heavily be boat listed by weight of monster harry sliding upon steeply inclined deck have narrowest possible escape of being precipitated headlong into creature gaping jaw indeed only saved by stretching out hand thrusting snout violently aside violence of thrust luckily enabling to recover equilibrium then umu who appeared to be only native of party blessed with real courage presence of mind seeing beloved master in imminent danger a believed of being seized devoured before eye raised bow hastily fitting arrow to string drew shaft to very head let fly into reptile throat where stuck fast inflicting so much pain that beast at once flung back into water roaring choking coughing up blood throwing into most indescribable contortion then very extraordinary thing happened sooner did wounded plesiosaurus begin to vomit blood than other two have meanwhile be swimming excitedly to fro hurled upon in what seemed to be perfect frenzy of fury most ferocious sanguinary battle ensued swirling flying foam flecked water being almost instantly deeply dyed with blood while air fairly vibrated with terrifying sound emitted by combatant cutter meanwhile relieved of heavy drag upon of carcass of dead plesiosaurus began to slide rapidly away from vicinity of fighting monster must soon have left far behind did not at suit harry who having undertaken to destroy ferocious reptile be by mean inclined to leave task le than half done therefore put cutter about to mingled astonishment dismay of companion headed back toward scene of combat steering in such manner a to pas just to leeward of spot where violent commotion in water showed that battle be still raging with unabated fury then a boat ranged up alongside with foresheet hauled to windward great body of monster must be seen rushing plunging leaping hither thither whereupon whole party of sportsman opened vigorous well directed fire of arrow javelin upon harry chiming in with deadly rifle whenever good chance for shot offered result of determined attack be that young leader be lucky enough to get in splendid shot close behind left shoulder of one of struggling brute must have reached heart for upon receiving bullet great reptile flung more than half out of water uttering dreadful cry a did so then falling back turned slowly over with one last writhing convulsive shudder sank slowly to bottom of lake meanwhile remaining two severely wounded flung upon other with maniacal intensity of fury a be truly awful to see finally one of monster succeeded in getting firm grip upon throat of other hung on despite frantic struggle of other to get clear for perhaps two full minute commotion in water be positively terrific then rapidly decreased until probably quite exhausted by intensity of prolonged effort lay practically still upon surface of water only sign of life being occasional slight twist of body on part of one other of opportunity be much too good to be missed raising rifle escombe be lucky enough to shoot monster dead by couple of rapid well directed shot through head two carcass immediately began to sink before vanished completely out of sight one of cutter crew by mean of lucky cast succeeded in hooking one of defunct saurian with great fish hook by mean monster be eventually landed with difficulty at spot originally chosen for purpose thus terminated great plesiosaurus hunt after nearly three hour of most exciting work escombe have ever enjoyed chapter seventeen huanacocha plotter about fortnight after escombe destruction of plesiosauri pleased huanacocha late chief of council of seven to entertain small select party of especial friend at banquet gave in house situate on border of lake ground of adjoined of virgin of sun in turn be contiguous to of royal palace huanacocha be probably most wealthy man in city of sun next to inca for have held position of chief of council of seven for nearly quarter of century previous to appearance of escombe upon scene portion of national revenue must otherwise have gone into coffer of sovereign have always be awarded to council of seven while huanacocha being not only astute also utterly unscrupulous man of exceptionally strong overbearing character larger portion of award have regularly found way by various devious channel into own private treasure chest be consequently well able to offer guest entertainment of almost regal magnificence be not to be wondered at therefore that when lord huanacocha issued invitation to banquet be not very often full number of invited generally made point of accepting being present at function upon occasion in question guest consisted of old friend tiahuana villac vmu motahuana together with lord licuchima chalihuama late of council of seven lord chinchacocheta lehuava six in be not necessary to describe banquet in detail let suffice to say that for reason of own host have given special instruction that trouble expense be to be spared to make function complete success that therefore so well have instruction be carried out entertainment a whole fell not very far short of have marked occasion of escombe accession to throne of inca there be need to record in detail conversation followed upon dismissal of servant be sufficient to say that huanacocha have arranged banquet with express object of eliciting view of guest upon certain project have be gradually taking shape in mind believed be now ripe for execution to astonishment consternation now discovered that have to very important extent entirely misapprehended situation after long somewhat heated discussion meeting have broken up without result save that guest have departed from house in mutually distrustful uneasy frame of mind when huanacocha at length retired to rest night not only did feel somewhat uneasy be also distinctly angry with for although have achieved purpose with banquet have be given be to elicit frank expression of opinion from certain individual relative to inca scheme of reformation felt that have blundered badly have used neither tact discretion in manner of conducting conversation have be reckless even to point of suggesting opposition to decree of sovereign when be too late when have fatally committed have seen to discomfiture that two of companion two most powerful person in community next to inca namely villac vmu deputy motahuana be distinctly out of sympathy with true villac vmu have expressed a puzzled disturbed anxious at attitude of inca towards religious question be perfectly clear that frame of mind of high priest be not nearly acute enough to induce to regard with favour even with patience suggestion at savouring of sedition huanacocha in heat impatience have be foolish enough to throw out suggestion question now disturbed be what must be tiahuana attitude toward henceforward in view of what have said nay more what must be attitude of high priest toward friend in view of what have said must villac vmu deputy accept suggestion have thrown out that momentous imprudent conversation must be regarded a private confidential treat a such must consider duty to report affair to inca if did then huanacocha knew that friend must have good cause to regret imprudence for despite cavilling late chief of council of seven have already seen enough of escombe method to feel certain that young monarch must stand nonsense particularly of seditious kind at first hint of anything of sort if culprit did not lose head must at least find bestowed where seditious view must work no mischief a reflection passed through mind of huanacocha that somewhat impulsive overbearing individual grew increasingly uneasy now began to fear that have be altogether too outspoken for be known man huanacocha have conceived nothing le than audacious idea of overthrowing inca securing own election in stead in capacity of chief of council of seven have for long term of year enjoyed measure of power scarcely le than invested in inca for being by nature of unusually arrogant domineering disposition while other member of council have be exceedingly pliant easy going have never experienced difficulty in browbeating into tolerably quick compliance with wish however extravagant might happen to have be a for people have rendered same implicit unquestioning obedience to council that must have rendered to inca have there be one on throne having enjoyed power together with privilege emolument attaching thereto for so long time huanacocha have found particularly hard unpleasant to be called upon to resign practically at moment notice when young escombe made appearance upon scene possibly have harry chanced to conform to man preconceived opinion of what inca must be like whenever must please to revisit earth might have accepted situation with reasonably good grace to be ousted by mere boy for a such always thought of young inca be altogether too much to be submitted to tamely at first mental revolt have be vague indefinite formless perhaps have thought that in course of time must pas away must grow reconciled to new order of thing particularly if young inca must show properly willing to submit to guiding hand of council of seven a represented by late chief escombe lost time in making perfectly clear to everybody that have own idea upon subject of government meant to act upon upon more than one occasion upon several in fact young inca have turned deaf ear to counsel of huanacocha have carried out own idea because have honestly believed to be better more advantageous to community have put foot down heavily upon many abuse of power on part of certain of highest noble in way huanacocha have suffered perhaps more severely than anyone else for reason condition of mental revolt instead of passing away gathered new force gradually began to assume definite form ultimately resolved into determination to cause harry removal by mean did not particularly care what be procure own election to vacant throne if might be if not at least re instatement of council of seven with of course a chief with object in view have commenced operation by proceeding to manufacture sedulously number of imaginary grievance from asserted that people be suffering industriously spread abroad among own friend hoping that in course of time must filter through to people be eagerly adopted by delectable plan certainly met with measure of success a lay tossing sleeplessly upon bed realised that have that evening be foolish precipitate have seriously mistaken nature of view held by two priest have betrayed friend in presence how must villac vmu deputy act must act at be question now repeatedly asked must by mean ascertain intention must by fair mean foul must never do for to remain in ignorance upon vital point after reckless manner in friend have spoken ay more than that must make quite sure that maintained silence upon subject of most imprudent conversation otherwise flung over restlessly upon bed longer thought upon matter more glaring did folly appear must guard friend from consequence of folly at cost how who be there to advise suddenly bethought of xaxaguana priest who ranked next below motahuana of course be very man of others for first of be be very particular friend man moreover who be deeply indebted to for many past favour of somewhat exceptional kind also be young comparatively speaking very ambitious not over scrupulous yes xaxaguana be undoubtedly man for purpose huanacocha told with smile of relief that have be fool for not thinking of priest before although huanacocha believed that saw in xaxaguana friend in need for whom have be so anxiously casting about be still much too uneasy to sleep be up about with appearance of first faint suggestion of dawn too anxious to remain inactive longer yet fully conscious of fact that hour be altogether too early for to seek friend without running very grave risk of attracting unwelcome attention by so unusual proceeding therefore decided to take long walk think whole affair over again while brain pulse be being steadied by cool fresh air of morning be fate be mere chance caused to select route led past part of temple constituted quarter of priest huanacocha told that be lucky star be in ascendant for a be passing building door gently opened very man that be so anxious to see stepped into roadway quietly closed door behind then looked round beheld huanacocha little ejaculation of astonishment escaped be fortunate meeting indeed exclaimed a stepped forward to greet friend most fortunate for perhaps will be astonished to hear that be thus early astir with express object of seeking ah thought huanacocha unless be greatly mistaken mean must prepare for worst having by time shaken off panic to considerable extent once more pulled together decided to allow friend to speak first a by so doing must probably be better able to judge what must say therefore responded to xaxaguana greeting by remarking then be lucky that chose direction for morning ramble otherwise must have missed other look somewhat astonished at seeing astir so early fact be friend be sleepless have therefore left bed early to take walk in early morning air understood to say that wished to see way will go let go up road toward hill answered xaxaguana there will be le chance of being seen may be well for to mention at outset that there may be several good reason why must not be seen together at juncture lord huanacocha ah wherefore so good friend demanded huanacocha because answered xaxaguana last night betrayed into committal of serious imprudence namely that of presuming to criticise unfavourably certain act of lord inca a be surely aware be crime punishable with death do ask how happen to know will tell chanced that be kept late from bed last night by certain business connected with approaching feast of raymi be therefore astir when villac vmu motahuana returned from banquet may possibly be aware that be rule among that nothing transpires within precinct of temple be ever to be referred to even so much a hinted at outside temple wall be therefore habit when within wall to speak before other with most perfect freedom friend huanacocha be breaking one of most stringent vow in telling even much hope therefore must time ever arrive when can do service will remember fact allow to weigh in favour rest assured will do so good friend answered huanacocha although methinks that there be one two service rendered to for have a yet received adequate return let pas be interrupting pray proceed with story will returned xaxaguana a have already mentioned be astir when tiahuana motahuana returned from house last night entered common room in be at work possibly because be only room in light be burning flinging upon couch quite near to began to talk be easy to see that be much agitated excited being busy paid little heed to conversation at outset only pricked up ear when heard name mentioned then confess that listened soon heard sufficient to convince that huanacocha friend lehuava chinchacocheta licuchima chilihuama be last night guilty of such imprudence a may well cost life unless have wit readiness of action to prevent ejaculated huanacocha former alarm returning to with tenfold force how mean friend surely villac vmu motahuana will dream of reporting what be said within privacy of house will what be said in privacy of house last night amounted to blasphemy remarked xaxaguana dryly be bounden duty of loyal subject of inca to report blasphemy wherever may be spoken from what be said last night gathered impression that of person mentioned be likely to shrink from performance of duty however unpleasant may be so for reason set out to warn morning be for reason connected with ventured to indicate exceeding undesirability of being seen together just now stammered huanacocha completely thrown off balance by what have just learned if understand aright good xaxaguana mean that life of friend have be put into utmost jeopardy by crass folly of last night knew yes knew when be too late have be fool concluded bitterly to be absolutely candid with friend huanacocha think be rejoined xaxaguana somewhat cynically why did do huanacocha stopped short in middle of road looked friend square in eye xaxaguana said when be chief of council of seven be in power to do several good turn did under certain conceivable circumstance might be in power to do several others if can indicate to way by can extricate from present peril rest assured will not prove ungrateful believe be friend believe also that be astute enough to recognise can serve better living than dead will therefore be perfectly frank with will tell have be in mind of late see there be sun good folk of town will soon be astir may be seen together let go over yonder sit in shadow of pile of rock can talk freely there without risk of being seen interrupted without word xaxaguana turned led way across upland meadow to somewhat remarkable pile of rock cropped out of soil about hundred yard from road passing round to shady side be also side hidden from road seated on bed of soft moss signing to companion to do same for nearly hour pair conversed most earnestly together then xaxaguana rose to foot reconnoitring road carefully to see that there be likelihood of being observed stepped forth from place of concealment then hurried across intervening stretch of grass on reaching road once more glanced keenly about briskly turned step homeward hour later huanacocha did pretty much same thing be noticeable must have be have there be anyone there to see that countenance have lost much of expression of anxiety that have worn when set out for walk early that morning have scarcely bathed finished morning meal after unwonted exertion when favourite servant rushed into presence in agitated accent informed that one of underling of temple on passage into town have given forth startling intelligence that villac vmu motahuana of whom have be lord honoured guest at banquet of previous night have just be found dead upon bed chapter eighteen trapped emotion of huanacocha at surprising piece of news be almost painful to see a listened to hurriedly told story poured forth by man feature took on sickly yellow tinge eye seemed to be on point of starting out of head breath came in labouring gasp from wide open mouth finally when at length seemed to have fully grasped purport of story hid face in hand rested elbow upon knee sat there quivering like aspen leaf in course of few minute however regained self control with sigh of such depth that anyone unaware of melancholy cause might have almost mistaken for one of relief rose to foot muttering to something about difficulty of believing so incredible story necessity for personally ascertaining truth gave order for litter to be brought to door presently sallied forth on way to temple with intention distance to be covered be not great by time huanacocha reached temple have almost completely recovered composure alighting from litter bidding bearer to wait climbed long flight of step leading up to building accosting first person met demanded in authoritative tone of voice to see xaxaguana be perfectly evident even to one le experienced than huanacocha in matter pertaining to temple routine discipline that very unusual occurrence have happened for everybody about place seemed excited agitated distraught huanacocha be of course well known to inhabitant of city of sun presently someone be found possessing enough authority to deal with great man request command rather in course of few minute be conducted along passage shown into empty room there to await arrival of man sought apparently xaxaguana be busy at moment for be nearly quarter of hour ere appeared when did so countenance be heavy with concern pardon for having kept so long waiting lord said in loud voice terrible occurrence of presume have heard have thrown into shocking state of confusion when message reached be in capacity of senior priest with physician whom summoned who have be endeavouring to discover cause of death of lamented friend villac vmu motahuana a spoke closed door carefully behind have succeeded demanded huanacocha oh yes answered xaxaguana be in complete agreement that cause of death in case be senile decay be very old men know senile decay exclaimed huanacocha in astonishment surely be not serious xaxaguana why be at house last night a know nobody who then saw will ever believe that died of old age be almost a active vigorous a youngest of of exhibited slightest symptom of senile decay possibly not assented xaxaguana nevertheless be verdict of physician after know exceedingly old men often pas away with suddenness of burnt out lamp single flicker be gone must confess that personally be not altogether surprised for when returned from house last night occurred to that seemed to have suddenly grown very old feeble indeed said a much when news of death be brought to did did retorted huanacocha by lord sun be wonder xaxaguana nothing le how did manage man so promptly too why must have happened within hour of return home morning did said xaxaguana be still in bath for must know that being somewhat fatigued with protracted labour of yesterday overslept morning when intelligence be brought to that two friend have be discovered lying dead in bed must only have died very recently for be neither stiff cold suppose there be sign mark of violence on body nothing to suggest possibility of of foul play stammered huanacocha answered xaxaguana physician found nothing whatever of kind how must be certain that men died in bed within precinct of temple who be there within precinct who must dare to commit act of sacrilege to say nothing of fact that so far a be known there be one who must be in slightest degree benefited by death must possibly desire huanacocha looked at friend admiringly a said just now be wonder xaxaguana remarked have not yet told how managed be anxious to know so set aside further pretence friend be frank with satisfy curiosity said xaxaguana firmly man who have secret fails to keep to be fool friend huanacocha be not fool therefore if happen to have secret prefer to retain within own breast matter stand thus told certain thing morning among be said that if perchance anything be to happen to tiahuana motahuana that died before be possible for to take certain action have reason to fear must use powerful influence with lord inca to see obtained promotion to position of villac vmu a be indeed right together with certain other advantage be not that so very well singularly enough that desired have happened most fortunately for now seems to that remains be for to fulfil promise agree with yes answered huanacocha frankly do will proceed hence to palace officially inform inca of sudden lamented death of villac vmu deputy will urge immediate appointment of to vacant post of high priest there be doubt that will get appointment for in first place be entitled to a senior priest in next will get full advantage of recommendation in third inca have personal friend to whom must wish to give appointment in preference to yourself that matter may therefore be regarded a settled there be equally important matter now wish to discus with xaxaguana in desire advice help tiahuana motahuana being dead there be nobody so far a know who have particular interest in retaining present inca upon throne to remark may of course object that be re incarnated manco whose coming a regenerator of ancient peruvian nation be prophesied by titucocha that in event of anything happening to regenerating process must be deferred indefinitely ask dear friend what if be in what way must suffer be true that have accustomed ourselves to look forward to regeneration a one thing to be desired above before others be be perfectly happy here in valley a be do in very truth desire to exchange present happy peaceful existence for indefinite doubtless long period of toil warfare suffering in what respect must be better at end even if must be successful of permit to say have doubt do really desire that change in character of religion so called amendment of moral upon young man insists doubt friend not only a regard also a regard people generally now have spoken to quite frankly be equally frank with give view of matter will friend in very few word answered xaxaguana view of matter be identical with own be possibly identical also with of many others how be that going to help also with frankness have not yet given utterance to idea see have in mind be far too cautious friend huanacocha ever to become successful conspirator one must need be cautious in broaching conspiracy a have in mind answered huanacocha nevertheless continued boldness caution be sometimes same thing therefore will be bold with xaxaguana since think will not be difficult for to prove to that not only view also interest be identical in word then believe that must be advantageous to to possibly also to rest of inhabitant of valley if present inca be deposed be made inca in place question be how be matter to be accomplished if be to die now even a villac must be most unfortunate thing must possibly happen cut in xaxaguana villac vmu motahuana be old men therefore that must die be not at remarkable that must die at same moment be to say least of somewhat singular despite precaution be not unlikely to arouse more le suspicion in many mind now if inca also be to die suspicion must undoubtedly be converted into certainty investigation must assuredly be set on foot must not fail to end disastrously for found responsible for three death especially for of inca for a of course be fully aware practically whole of inhabitant of valley be still old fashioned enough to cling to superstition that to murder inca be blackest of black sacrilege on day when inca be presented to in temple spoke certain word if be now repeated might find echo in mind of many inhabitant of city boldly expressed doubt a to identity of youth with whose appearance be foretold by prophet titucocha whom of ancient peruvian nation have be expecting for last three hundred year more now know that many of inca ordinance be regarded with disfavour by people generally believe that a consequence of must not be very difficult to implant in mind of discontented suggestion that late villac vmu made very serious mistake if indeed did not commit unpardonable crime in introducing young man to a re incarnated manco capac suspicion once instilled into must be comparatively easy matter to incite to demand that inca will establish identity by submitting to ordeal by fire after election to vacant throne must be foregone conclusion for of course believe for moment that young englishman can possibly survive fire ordeal huanacocha gazed at companion for several moment in silent admiration then exclaimed enthusiastically have already told twice morning that be wonder now say for third time be wonder xaxaguana possessor of most astute clever brain in valley foresee that working together may achieve such dazzling result a have scarcely yet dared to dream of how do propose to bring about result of have just spoken will be slow tedious process at best while be being achieved many thing may happen nay answered xaxaguana will not be nearly so lengthy process a seem to think be plan placing mouth to companion ear xaxaguana proceeded to whisper few sentence appeared to fill huanacocha with wonder admiration do think will succeed xaxaguana demanded a concluded communication can not possibly fail if carried out with promptitude discretion answered huanacocha in tone of conviction perfect simplicity be greatest recommendation when do propose to commence operation at once answered xaxaguana now very day nothing will be talked of during next few day save sudden death of villac vmu motahuana topic of conversation will afford precise opportunity require now friend huanacocha have be together quite a long a be prudent desirable go therefore hence to palace acquaint inca with sad news of be official bearer inform if will that in zealous discharge of duty have visited for purpose of obtaining fullest information relative to deplored event direct attention to extreme desirability of creating villac vmu at once fear not friend answered huanacocha a rose to take leave will receive notification of appointment in course of day followed by xaxaguana who accompanied a far a outer door left apartment proceeded on way to palace huanacocha be a good a word for not only secured from harry appointment of xaxaguana to dignity of villac vmu actually took trouble to hurry back from palace to temple with information of success royal warrant duly signed a xaxaguana have anticipated almost sole topic of conversation during ensuing fortnight be death of late villac vmu that of deputy at practically same instant of time a be determined by physician for first few day circumstance be spoken of simply a somewhat remarkable coincidence not very long after obsequies be celebrated with unprecedented pomp in temple be over began to be noticed that when subject happened to be referred to people be acquiring trick of putting head together whispering mysteriously to other trick rapidly developed into something nearly approaching habit a did so whisper a rapidly changed into plain open speech word be interchanged lost original air of confidential mysteriousness until finally people told other without very much circumlocution that there be in opinion more in strange death of tiahuana motahuana than met eye if be asked to express more plainly reminded other that two priest who have died under such really remarkable circumstance be men who be responsible for finding of white inca introduction of into community reminder be quite frequently followed by somewhat pointed question a to whether after priest must by chance have made mistake in method of identifying inca people even going to length of expressing opinion that be question of mistake rather case of deliberate deception of people with mysterious purpose must probably now be never brought to light inasmuch a lord sun angry at change in form of national religion have cut off offender in midst of sin a sign of displeasure transition from such talk a to openly expressed doubt concerning genuineness of inca claim to be re incarnation of divine manco capac be easy one made more easy by unpopular character of many one might indeed almost say of escombe decree yet so consummate be cunning subtlety with campaign be conducted that scarcely whisper of be allowed to reach ear of who be suspected of being favourably inclined toward inca not faintest inkling of ever penetrated to escombe such extreme care indeed be exercised by who be pulling string that sign of inca fast waning popularity be for moment permitted to manifest process of corrupting palace official staff generally be found to be exceptionally tedious difficult for escombe genial disposition straightforward character enabled to endear without effort to everybody with whom be brought into intimate contact be accomplished at length by exercise of almost superhuman ingenuity with solitary exception in case of arima who be at once recognised be so faithfully devotedly attached to royal master that must be worse than folly to attempt to corrupt be therefore left severely alone most stringent precaution being taken to keep whole thing secret from matter have reached stage above indicated when escombe having grappled with exceptionally arduous day work retired to rest close upon midnight soon afterward sank into heavy sleep only to be a seemed almost instantly awakened by light of torch flashing upon closed eyelid scuffle of sandalled foot about couch springing up into sitting posture in bed opened eye still heavy with sleep to find chamber full of men many of whom be armed conspicuous among whom be huanacocha xaxaguana new villac vmu why lord huanacocha exclaimed rubbing eye to assure that be awake what doe mean how did get in here what be matter matter lord answered huanacocha be one of utmost gravity importance a villac vmu here will inform be nothing le than revolt among priest generally most of whom have declared against modification in form of worship service in temple instituted by lord have risen against villac vmu others who have pronounced in favour of lord modification of who be in favour of modification have be slain larger number amounting to between twenty thirty be even now being subjected to fire ordeal a must have be villac vmu have not happily escaped made way to house for shelter help that in brief be how matter stand be not villac vmu 't be even so lord answered xaxaguana when have stated fact to lord huanacocha regarded a of import serious enough to justify even to extent of disturbing rest of lord inca by jove yes must think so exclaimed harry interrupting high priest unceremoniously springing from couch to floor where be arima pas word for arima somebody please stay hand clothes will get into without waiting for arima how many of revolting priest be there do say number about thousand lord answered xaxaguana have already taken upon to send to umu asking to come to assistance will be time ere messenger can reach in turn can reach order out guard therefore thought well to come to lord ask to hasten with to temple there to use authority to save life of who must otherwise undergo fire ordeal of course assented harry a scrambled into clothes what will happen if mutinous beggar refuse to obey eh refuse to obey lord repeated villac vmu in shocked tone nay will certainly not do that have revolted now merely because can not be brought to believe that innovation against rebel be in accordance with order of lord inca have to personally assure such be case will instantly return to allegiance very well answered harry a threw heavy cloak over shoulder to protect from keen night air now be ready lead way somebody let be going emerging from palace hurrying along almost pitch dark garden path party swept through palace gate into main road made dash for temple by nearest possible route happened to be through several dark narrow deserted side street in not soul be stirring little crowd of hurrying figure consequently passed on way soon reached temple without having be observed by so much a single person somewhat to escombe surprise temple proved to be in absolute darkness when party arrived before wall xaxaguana explained by informing young monarch that revolted priest be assembled in opposite wing of building that have deemed wise precaution not to attempt to enter on side lest must meet with resistance before inca must find opportunity to make presence known a drew in under temple wall xaxaguana called halt expressing anxiety a to possibility of door being closed by mean of proposed to effect entrance sent forward scout to reconnoitre anxiety however proved to be unfounded for scout presently returned with information that door be unfastened everything quiet on side of building party therefore moved forward once more presently escombe found being conducted along corridor unlighted save by smoky flare of torch carried by escort contrary to young ruler expectation building even now that be inside remained dark silent a grave be explained by statement of xaxaguana that revolting priest be gathered together in rock hewn basement of building where be at moment engaged in putting more faithful brother to dreadful ordeal by fire accordingly when xaxaguana unlocked massive bronze gate let into wall invited harry to descend with to chamber where horrid rite be in progress young man followed unhesitatingly a also did through door priest unlocked when have reached foot of flight of stone step traversed yard of corridor apparently hewn out of living rock room be comfortably enough furnished looked almost a though might have be prepared for reception for be lighted by handsome lamp suspended from roof if lord will condescend to wait here moment rest servant will go see exactly what be happening return to report remarked xaxaguana a stood aside to allow harry to pas why wait demanded harry facing round to high priest surely have not moment of time to waste must not be even a be speaking villac vmu slid rapidly back into passage closing door behind with slam through thunderous reverberation of in hollow vault harry thought caught sound of sharp click with muttered ejaculation expressive of annoyance sprang to door endeavoured to open be fast a listened heard sound of hastily retreating footstep in passage outside in same moment truth flashed upon for inscrutable reason be trapped prisoner chapter nineteen umu take hand in game first ray of next morning sun have scarcely flashed over ridge of sierra hemmed in eastern side of valley when arima awaking with most atrocious headache feeling generally of man who have just passed through unusually prolonged bout of dissipation alternatively have be drugged arose from bed staggering across room plunged throbbing buzzing head into large basin of cold water preparatory to dressing once twice thrice did plunge head neck hand into cooling liquid with little satisfactory result for relief sought confidently expected to derive from process refused to come groaned a sank upon seat tightly gripped throbbing temple in hand never before in life have felt so ill so utterly cheap used up a did at moment in addition to violent headache from be suffering blood felt like fire in vein skin be dry rough be so giddy that must scarcely stand truth be that have be drugged with such brutal severity on preceding night by xaxaguana emissary to make sure of being out of way at moment of master seizure that have be due more to chance than anything else that have ever again awakened after few minute rest felt so much better that be able to dress afterwards make way to master room for ever since slaying of monster in lake have be escombe habit to rise early in morning making way to bottom of garden embark on balsa from after arima have paddled few hundred yard from shore master man have be wont to bathe together now according to custom faithful indian hurried away to awaken master a usual for indulgence in regular morning dip upon entering sleeping chamber of course found untenanted for moment thought occurred to that possibly be late that master having awakened at usual hour have risen gone down into garden alone single glance out of window however at length of shadow cast by various object lighted by sun outside sufficed to satisfy that habit have triumphed over even influence of narcotic have be administered to that be certainly not more than few minute late then with instinct of semi savage flung glance quickly about room instantly detected sign that have be invaded during night by number of people that master have arisen dressed in haste quick to take alarm where escombe be concerned at once hurried out without waiting to find of palace official to whom to report discovery proceeded forthwith to question a many of servant a met here again only found matter for further alarm apprehension for not only did whole service of building appear to be in state of complete disorganisation at once became evident to that man met be confused agitated more le anxious of manner although professed unable to throw light upon mystery of inca inexplicable disappearance felt instinctively that be lying to realising at length that information be to be obtained from people arima passed from palace into ground making way in first instance down to shore of lake for purpose of satisfying beyond possibility of question whether not there be foundation for first surmise escombe have risen early left palace without waiting for there be sign of young master in direction moreover balsa be lying moored in proper place also cutter be at usual mooring there be therefore possibility that inca have taken into head to go for solitary early morning sail satisfied upon point indian next made way round to front of palace here at once evidence of visit of large party of people to palace time during preceding night once more presented latest be to say topmost set of footprint showing that crowd of people have hurried from main entrance of building down broad path leading to entrance gate of garden thence into main road moreover spoor remained undisturbed in road for distance sufficient to indicate general direction in party have gone although be lost in ordinary sign of traffic within few yard of gate having ascertained thus much arima returned to spot where footprint first showed outside palace door going down upon hand knee patiently set to task of endeavouring to discover young master among before have have time to achieve result in direction one of palace official appeared angrily demanding to know what be doing there ordered back into palace to attend to duty explaining by way of reply to arima agitated representation that inca have left palace during early hour of morning with party of companion to hunt vicuna indian at once knew to be falsehood for hunting ground lay many mile down valley hunting party never dreamed of proceeding thither otherwise than on horseback arima be prepared to swear that none of party have be mounted moreover be convinced that master must never have dreamed of leaving favourite servant behind have be bound upon hunting expedition official however be curt peremptory in manner arima soon understood that must obey order suffer arrest therefore returned to inca room proceeded to put in order a be duty very curtness peremptoriness of official manner to a well a improbable story have told only have effect of strengthening confirming suspicion in faithful fellow mind for attachment of young inca to man be well known even highest official of palace have thus far not disdained to be extremely civil to question in arima mind now be what precisely be have happened to young master whither why have gone for even thus far glimmering of hideous truth have reached indian mind suspicion apprehension be a yet chaotic formless be very far from fearing that escombe life be in danger a proceeded with business seeking from time to time to get relief from splitting headache other extremely disagreeable symptom from be still suffering acutely gradually began to dawn upon a mental faculty slowly shook off stupor that one of symptom be synonymous with following upon administration of overdose of decoction made from certain poisonous plant growing here there in valley be sometimes used a anaesthetic by local physician be fully aware of tremendous potency of extracted juice of plant a also of tastelessness consequent ease with must be administered recognised clearly that if anyone have wished to administer draught to on previous night must easily have be done question next arose in mind naturally be why must anyone desire to administer draught to mental power have by time sufficiently recovered from effect of drug to enable quickly to trace connection however obscure a yet between act extraordinary fact of master being missing when once faithful fellow have reached length of connecting two circumstance together be not long in realising terrible possibility lurked in such sinister combination of circumstance with realisation suddenly took fright for at same moment significance of certain apparently trivial remark occurrence have lately come to knowledge suddenly dawned upon must be that matter scarcely noticed at moment really bore significance now attached to be result of bodily disorder reacting upon mental process causing to take distorted unnatural view of thing be actually of moment whatever must not tell brain be still in too muddled condition for to feel that must trust there be one sensible thing that must do told must go to umu lay whole matter before umu be shrewd sensible man who must soon say whether not there be anything in mad fantasy be now beginning to chase other through bewildered brain besides umu be inca most devoted friend next to perhaps so slipping out of palace by garden entrance lest perchance must be seen stopped if attempted to pas out by way of other plunged at once into most unfrequented path so betook by circuitous route to lake shore where at once got aboard balsa paddling primitive craft mile beyond royal demesne beached in secluded spot thence made best of way to umu house morning be by time so well advanced that hour for first meal of day be past became moot point with arima whether to seek umu at house at barrack of inca bodyguard decided however upon trying house first be well that did for although umu be not at home seemed be at barrack maia daughter have impression that knew where might be found arima have not poured into girl ear dozen sentence of somewhat disjointed tale before cut short by explaining that be about to seek father that arima must on account attempt to stir from house until return unless of course father must make appearance in interim having bestowed that injunction maia wild eyed white lipped rushed into street hurried on way for too have heard word said to at moment have given scant heed in light of what be hinted at by arima now bore to quick witted awful significance a happened have not to go very far for have not left house more than five minute at utmost when caught sight of father mounted on way to barrack good mile distant fortunately for reined up to exchange few passing word with acquaintance afforded opportunity to overtake stop did not dare however to mention errand have brought out in search of father until two friend have parted when briefly explained that arima be seeking urged to hasten back to house without delay at same time telling sufficient of what have passed between inca henchman to cause umu to realise something of gravity of situation for dug heel into charger rib dashed off at gallop when maia arrived back at house found arima in midst of relation of story to father quite a matter of course sat down to listen indian have in interim between departure umu arrival found time to pull together properly arrange thought related narrative with due regard to sequence of event beginning with such apparently casual word trivial occurrence a have come under notice have only assumed significance in light of more recent happening then going on to describe sensation upon awaking that morning completed story by relating in detail everything have done thought suspicion have occurred to subsequent to discovery of master absence yes agreed umu when arima have brought story to conclusion whole thing seems reasonably clear up to certain point have not shadow of doubt that certain disaffected person have adopted extreme altogether unprecedented step of seizing person of lord inca caused friend to be drugged in order that might not interfere with plan question now have to decide be who be person what be object in seizing inca must be individual of very great power influence otherwise must never dare at point maia who have be betraying rapidly increasing sign of anxiety impatience cut in with father to seems of utmost importance that not moment must be lost in discovering what have become of inca whose life may at moment be in utmost jeopardy for who be desperate enough to carry off must probably not hesitate to kill if need be indeed may be purpose task therefore must be to rescue without instant unnecessary delay must be easily able to do with aid of troop probably if official of palace be carefully questioned must be persuaded to tell have become of inca for doubtless know since must not have be carried off without knowledge acquiescence yes be right maia see exactly what mean have doubt can devise method of making palace people tell what know answered umu will ride to barrack at once order guard to turn out in readiness to proceed wherever required after will proceed to palace with squadron will be strange if find mean to make somebody tell require to know arima have better go to barrack await return there from palace when can ride with now will go for a maia have said even moment may now be of importance twenty minute later troop of inca mounted bodyguard led by umu dashed at gallop in through gate of palace garden at word from commander surrounded building party of dozen of following leader into palace to consternation of who encountered dozen constituted search party with drawn sword systematically swept building from basement to roof tree gathering together official individual of palace staff must be found until whole with exception of dozen so underling have be captured then be marched out into vast palace garden surrounded by now dismounted trooper who meanwhile have made prisoner of four of chief official a be endeavouring to slink out of palace make good escape marching whole of captive off to secluded part of garden where nothing might happen must be seen save by immediately concerned umu ordered chamberlain three immediate subordinate to be brought to said to now sir business here be to ascertain from have become of lord inca have not slightest doubt that can tell whether will tell truth not be quite matter intend to arrive at truth however either by persuasion force will try former first let very earnestly advise not to compel to resort to latter to make a certain a can that information with be about to furnish be true will withdraw from comrade to distance at will be impossible for to communicate with other where will inform officer who with file of men will accompany of everything that know concerning mysterious disappearance of inca where have be taken by whom for what purpose if story when compared with other be found to agree at point will consider be justified in believing to be true if turned to other captive said go to work at once collect timber build large fire in open space then turning to officer who have be deputed to examine four prisoner umu concluded take away hear story then bring back to that man tale may be compared with of others umu knew fellow countryman well be fully aware that while south american indian like brother of northern continent will endure most frightfully excruciating torture with stoical fortitude if occasion happens to demand will not willingly subject to even very minor degree of suffering for sake of shielding whom have particular object in serving felt pretty well convinced that craven wretch who have allowed to be corrupted into betraying monarch must have very little hesitation in also betraying corrupters especially a might feel assured that umu having taken matter in hand corrupters must henceforth have scant power opportunity to reward to punish hint conveyed by building of large fire therefore proved quite sufficiently persuasive in little more than ten minute commander of bodyguard found in possession of information palace official have in power to communicate information in brief be to effect that have one from highest to lowest be heavily bribed by emissary of huanacocha xaxaguana to allow two powerful noble with strong party of follower to enter palace in dead of night abduct person of inca to hold peace upon matter until huanacocha xaxaguana must personally give leave to speak tell what to say a story of four of official happened to agree even down to smallest detail umu decided that might venture to accept a true whereupon whole of prisoner be hustled back into palace by way of back entrance driven down into one of basement chamber there securely locked up with corporal guard in passage outside palace then being locked up troop mounted departed at gallop for house of huanacocha house palace a might be more appropriately termed be like most of residence of great peruvian lord large sumptuous edifice standing in own spacious ground umu tactic upon approaching be similar to have employed upon approaching palace be to say upon entering ground caused men to dismount surround building then entered accompanied by sergeant in charge of squad of trooper a unceremoniously made way into great entrance hall found confronted by chief steward of establishment who followed by entire staff of terrified servant be hurrying to garden anxious to ascertain meaning of unwonted invasion of master privacy where be lord sirrah thundered umu a file of soldier promptly arrested quaking functionary know not lord umu answered unfortunate man a well a chattering teeth must allow indeed be about to send out servant to seek news of for be beginning to fear that evil have befallen left house alone last night le than hour before midnight saying that knew not when must return have not since be seen then if told that knew not when must return why do fear that evil have befallen demanded umu because lord nay know not except that well be most unusual for lord huanacocha to absent for so many hour without saying whither intended to go steward say so sneered umu that seems to strange indeed for be not usual custom of noble to acquaint steward with business nay friend can not believe story must have better reason than one have given for anxiety a to lord safety will be to great advantage to acquaint with forthwith lord have told truth indeed have protested unfortunate man making a though must throw upon knee before umu so much worse for growled umu savagely for delay be beginning to tell upon patience be there man here continued who can tell where lord huanacocha be to be found glared round upon assembled servant whole of whom have by time be quietly herded together by soldier there be answer very well continued umu addressing men take people down to cellar below lock in securely then set fire to house burn over head can waste more time here a trooper in obedience to order closed round prisoner with coarse jest began to hustle unceremoniously toward head of flight of step leading down to basement of building steward suddenly realising desperate nature of own fellow servant predicament turned to umu cried stay lord pray visit not upon misdeed of lord when said just now that knew not whereabouts of lord huanacocha spoke only truth for indeed can not tell for certain where be nay lord have patience hear have to say ere condemn to frightful death for fault be not mine be indeed true that know not where lord huanacocha be to be found for did not deign to tell business when went out last night believe can form very good guess a to where now be can ejaculated umu then say on that right quickly for within next five minute house will be ablaze within if have not by then told what want to know then turning to sergeant said take with dozen men bring everything in house will burn pile in hall pour on oil can find now sirrah proceed with tale then lord in brief be answered wretched steward speaking a well a chattering teeth must allow from word have overheard from time to time of late passing between lord huanacocha others especially new villac vmu believe that when master left house last night did so with purpose of accompanying high priest armed party to palace in order to seize person of lord inca convey to temple that might be subjected to fire ordeal to prove whether fire ordeal say roared umu in paroxysm of fury a full horror of situation at last dawned upon even so lord answered quaking steward heard have reason to believe that master have conspired with villac vmu to seize inca subject to fire ordeal yet never took trouble to come report matter to roared umu lord knew not that be part of duty to stammered wretched steward a too late began to realise terrible nature of predicament in have placed by too great fidelity to master be enough interrupted umu bind hand foot lay upon pile yonder set fire to sergeant huarima will remain here with six men to ensure utter destruction of house after will follow rest of corp to temple a for continued turning to staff of servant who be huddling together paralysed with terror at tragic turn affair be taking must only be receiving just desert if be to order to be consumed with chief upon pile be merciful however be therefore at liberty to go let fate of steward be lesson to henceforth that fidelity to inca come before fidelity to master now men pas out mount next place of call be temple chapter twenty in nick of time well soliloquised harry a glanced about upon realising that be indeed prisoner what doe mean be mutiny treason what be a to there being revolt of priest believe word of have there be such thing must not have be possible for to have entered building without encountering sign sight sound of be just yarn ruse to get to come here willingly now wonder what dickens want with what intend to do with now that have nothing very serious expect for be inca must never dare to lay violent hand upon inca amount to sacrilege of very worst kind yes doubt yet be by mean certain that fact must exercise very powerful restraining influence upon friend huanacocha xaxaguana be ambitious men be very much inclined to question whether religious conviction of man be powerful enough to hold back from sacrilege if ambition urged in direction ah well time will show have doubt meanwhile have not have half night rest so will do what can to recover arrears thus thinking quietly stretched upon couch stood against one wall of room composed to sleep with light hearted carelessness of extreme youth actually did sleep slept so soundly that be not even disturbed when hour later door be quietly opened two attendant entered bearing food drink seeing that prisoner still slumbered placed upon table departed securing door again a passed out be past ten o'clock in forenoon when young man having completely rested opened eye looked about in wonderment at finding in strange quarter next moment however memory returned to recalled proceeding of past night once more began to speculate upon purpose must have be powerful enough to induce huanacocha xaxaguana to resort to so extreme measure a of abduction from palace now with more sober reflection following upon sound night rest began to take somewhat more serious view of situation began to realise what two powerful noble have done be hasty ill considered act undertaken upon spur of moment without thought of probable consequence be doubtless result of long anxious premeditation if so must surely have taken possible precaution to guard against evil consequence slight shudder thrilled through a thought obtruded upon mind for aught that must tell to contrary one of precaution might take form of providing that must never return to light of day that one must ever know what have become of here again optimism of youth came to support dismissed grim reflection with smile matter of course must not be anything like so serious a that told without doubt in hour two hence must be back in palace heartily laughing at whole adventure drew forth watch looked at to astonishment found that be quarter after ten o'clock for place of confinement being below ground level hewn out of heart of rock there be window to only source of light be lamp suspended from roof still burned brightly for instant be under impression that watch have stopped overnight at hour indicated upon putting to ear found that be still running then eye felt upon viand on table suddenly discovered that be hungry without further ado therefore seated at table dismissing for moment further consideration of future fell to made most excellent breakfast escombe have finished meal full hour more have found time once more to become distinctly apprehensive a to intention of huanacocha xaxaguana toward when sound of footstep approaching along passage outside door warned that crisis be at hand next moment door be flung open priest entered lord said be command of villac vmu that accompany into presence command did say retorted harry surely villac vmu strangely forgets position when presumes to send command to inca however seeing that passage outside be full of armed men who be evidently quite prepared to enforce obedience to order of high priest continued will not stand upon ceremony carp at mere form of word will obey summons of villac vmu yet let who hear remember that be inca that power to reward obedience be a great a be to punish presumption now lead on priest led way into passage harry following moment that latter emerged from room in have be confined armed guard of dozen men closed in around rendering escape on part impossible in order procession passed along passage up step harry have descended upon arrival thence along corridor into room crowded with priest civilian where raised upon dais sat villac vmu enthroned still surrounded by guard harry be halted in front of dais directed to seat in handsome chair have be placed there for reception done proceeding at once commenced harry immediately perceived that be about to be subjected to sort of trial for sooner be seated than villac vmu cried let lord huanacocha stand forth there be moment bustle confusion then from midst of assembled crowd huanacocha shouldered way through placed near harry outside encircling guard lord huanacocha said villac vmu at instigation because of certain representation made by have taken unprecedented course of causing lord inca to be brought hither that may answer before here assembled to charge understand desire to bring against state therefore charge before doing so ye will swear by light of lord sun that motive in instigating proceeding be free from bias personal ill will that be animated therein solely by anxiety for public welfare that will say word save what personally know to be truth swear answered huanacocha raising right hand aloft be well commented high priest proceed now with charge lord answered huanacocha first most serious charge against young man who sits there whom have for many month past honoured served a re incarnated manco capac father founder of nation be that be impostor with right title to service reverence have given second charge continued huanacocha however must be preferred by rather than by o villac vmu be that youth have blasphemously forbidden longer to worship lord sun father benefactor giver of good gift have commanded that will worship instead pachacamac whom call god of whom know little nothing whom have never until now be bidden to worship be strongly opposed to change of religion for amount to nothing le a be everybody else with whom have spoken on subject fear that such change will certainly bring disaster ruin upon nation there be other charge must be preferred against prisoner concluded huanacocha be content that case against will rest upon have already enumerated be well commented xaxaguana lord huanacocha gratitude of community be due to for public spirit have prompted to come forward perform what recognise to be exceedingly disagreeable task doubtless public generally will be careful to see that disinterestedness be suitably rewarded be there anyone present who desire to support charge preferred against prisoner by lord there be ball of high treason once set rolling everybody seemed anxious to add to momentum man after man came forward to support charge made by huanacocha to ventilate petty grievance real imaginary of own until at length so much time have be consumed that xaxaguana growing impatient refused to listen to further evidence then turned to escombe said prisoner have heard charge have be brought against what answer have to might well answer said escombe be inca that one have right to question action one not even villac vmu have right to bring to trial a have dared to do for be supreme infinitely above beyond have desire to take refuge behind dignity if anyone considers that have grievance against a appears to be case prefer to answer first a to charge huanacocha brings against of being impostor let remind who be present of what took place in temple upon memorable occasion when be first brought here by tiahuana motahuana tiahuana be man responsible for presence in valley elevation to position of inca be who having heard certain particular concerning sought out satisfied colleague fulfilled in person condition referred to in certain prophecy brought hither without even going through preliminary formality of asking consent be who when presented before here in temple convinced with two three exception of whom huanacocha be one be re incarnated manco capac inca destined to restore ancient peruvian nation to former power grandeur be who convinced by argument placed on throne have nothing whatever to do with made claim pretension of kind be simply passive throughout when convinced by tiahuana argument proof have placed on throne learned what be expected of devoted energy to performance of task felt have be laid upon know how far have succeeded know that of pure peruvian blood be being daily gathered into valley from part of kingdom know that be being trained to play part a fighting men know also at least huanacocha doe that be even now engaged in making plan arrangement for secret introduction into country of adequate supply of most modern weapon in order that when proper moment come may be able to fight upon equal term with enemy a to having decreed alteration in religion did so because when came among found to be idolater worshipper of sun be one of many beneficent gift pachacamac whom call god have given to child sun can only give light heat according to god will pleasure therefore be god not sun whom must worship tell that until transfer adoration from sun to who made will never be prosperous happy people will consent to rule over help to restore a nation to ancient power glory choose therefore now whether will worship god continue in idolatry whether will achieve great destiny titucocha prophet foretold for whether will remain mere remnant of once powerful splendid nation lurking here in obscurity in valley from dare not venture forth lest who now hold land once be fall upon destroy if choose latter fate a seem inclined to do then must go forth from valley leave to own device for a have said will not rule nation of idolater if choose to obey submit unquestioningly to such ordinance a will promulgate from time to time for advantage then will undertake to make titucocha foretold must become be evident that harry address have produced exceedingly powerful impression upon bulk of audience for moment that ceased to speak there arose great hubbub among who composed assembly almost instantly breaking up into little knot group member of at once proceeded to discus eagerly several point of speech be result a unwelcome a unlooked for by prime mover of conspiracy glance huanacocha shot at villac vmu be full of dismay apprehension latter however who have noted something of effect harry be producing saw also how to avail of effect at same time achieve own friend purpose therefore allowed commotion to continue unchecked for full ten minute before rose held up hand for silence then when disturbance have subsided sufficiently to allow voice to be heard said friend perceive that like be in difficulty know not what to believe feel a do that if youth be in very truth re incarnated manco whose return to earth be promised by prophet titucocha must not only be rankest folly absolute sacrilege to reject how be to know how be most important vital point to be determined there be one way way have already provided for must subject to ordeal by fire if survives that ordeal well good will then know for certain who be will serve obey in thing if not got further for at mention of ordeal by fire harry saw at once a in lightning flash villainous trap into have be betrayed hideous fate to be intended to consign leaping to foot snatched drawn sword from hand of one of astonished guard who surrounded before of must interpose to prevent have leapt upon dais seized terrified xaxaguana by throat with one hand while with sword held in other threatened to run quaking wretch through heart oh cried a tightened grip upon struggling priest throat fire ordeal for thank sit still give over struggling villain will pin to back of chair sit in do hear ah be better put hand down by side keep there other fellow stand still where be attempt to lift so much a hand against unless wish to see slay man before eye now villac vmu grasp seat of chair with hand just to keep out of mischief know do a tell first order men of yours to lay down arm march out of building see release throat that may draw breath to give order ah must treacherous scoundrel then take for a harry released grip upon priest throat latter sprang to foot endeavoured to clasp young englishman round arm body at same time shouting to others to come to help harry be too quick for must be captor sprang back single pace thus just eluding grip of priest at same time lunged at with copper sword held driving straight through man scheming treacherous heart then a great roar of dismay execration arose from assemblage quickly withdrew reeking weapon from quivering body hastily wrapping cloak about left arm leaped to wall placed back to prepared to sell life a dearly a might be gave about minute more to live for what must single handed do against swordsman to say nothing of rest of howling bloodthirsty crowd who now came surging toward must overwhelm in moment by sheer force of number a swordsman sprang upon dais with gleaming eye threatening point voice of huanacocha rang through chamber a shouted take young fool alive harm not a value life have slain villac vmu for reason if for other must pas through fire hem in take weapon from then bind hand foot be however very much easier to give that order than to obey for escombe have always be passionately fond of sword play to extent indeed that have placed in hand of certain well known maitre d'armes in westminster have be pronounced by gentleman to be most promising pupil so now with tolerably good weapon in hand back to solid substantial wall felt quite in mood form to put up excellent fight swordsman closed in round a by tacit consent flung upon in huddled mob with evident intention of bearing to ground by sheer preponderance of number next instant three of recoiled shrieking with face slashed open a harry met charge with sweeping circular cut from left to right then fourth man staggered fell with ghastly wound in throat while rest drew back in dismay wonder at feat of swordsmanship that to comparatively untrained mind seemed to savour strongly of magic supernatural a to escombe took long breath told that perhaps with luck might be able to hold out for a much a five minute for first encounter brief though be showed that men have not remotest idea of how to handle sword while a for have sooner gripped hilt of weapon than felt keen delight of practised fencer thrill through at prospect of encounter oh must put up good fight fight a people must remember to dying day though of course one of must get sooner later when weapon happened to be plunged in body of enemy thought flashed through young englishman mind in drawing of breath then braced afresh against wall to meet second much more wary attack enemy have learned caution already for instead of flinging upon pell mell a at first rush attacked three at time one in front one on hand thus allowing plenty of room for play of blade also strove by stratagem must think of to entice away from wall so that might be able to slip round take in rear to keep one back to wall be one of fundamental rule of self defence have be dinned into until have become impossible to forget harry be not to be tempted close to wall kept allowing only just sufficient room for free play of blade when at attacking trio losing patience attempted to rush in upon point seemed to threaten three at once next moment two of three be hors de combat one with sword hand half severed at wrist other with right arm laid open from wrist to elbow ineffectiveness of attack proved too much for huanacocha who have thus far be looking on at fray with sardonic grin upon countenance now a saw swordsman hanging back obviously afraid to approach charmed semicircle whole of escombe blade seemed to cover at same moment lost patience with angry roar dashed forward snatched weapon from one of disabled fighter called upon present to help to capture audacious young foreigner who seemed determined to make fool of then a others sprang at call idea suddenly seized tearing cloak off shoulder flung heavy garment straight at harry whose blade became entangled in fold for just fraction of second be enough others seeing in instant what have happened tossed away weapon flinging upon escombe before must clear sword tore weapon from grasp bore still fighting savagely with fist to ground in minute be over with men grasping of limb two three more piled upon prostrate body poor harry be soon overcome reduced to condition of comparative quiescence after be not very difficult matter to enwrap body with so many turn of thin tough raw hide rope that further movement became impossibility immediately whole place rang with howl shout of fiendish rejoicing at brilliance of feat have culminated in capture of pestilent young foreigner whose gallant resistance so far from exciting admiration in breast of captor seemed to have filled with ferocity of wild beast a be raised to foot preparatory to bearing away to place where fiery death even now awaited first one then fought struggled through yelling crowd to glare into face with ferocious glee to hiss into ear bloodcurdling hint of doom prepared for uproar be at height when escombe preternaturally sharpened ear detected new note in note of astonishment consternation terror that quickly overbore drowned tone of savage exultation next instant air be vibrant with shriek cry for mercy a crowd scattering right left made way before levelled spear whirling blade of inca bodyguard while voice of umu harsh tense with concentrated fury be heard high above din exhorting follower to let not one of present escape within moment umu whirling heavy battle mace about with savage freedom have forced way to harry side have beaten down driven off who have constituted custodian be hurt lord have sacrilegious beast dared to harm hair of head panted a flung supporting arm about escombe bound helpless body answered harry smiling rather wanly upon be a sound a ever be thank god have only arrived in very nick of time umu in five minute must have be too late good trusty friend how did know where be what be happening tale be too long to tell just now lord answered umu a busied in freeing harry from bond will be told later when have disposed of vile wretch be arima who brought first hint of what be afoot pachacamac be praised be able to get here in time what be about to do with lord talked of putting to fire ordeal answered harry have word to say against a may see xaxaguana one of chief conspirator have already paid penalty of perfidy lie there dead truly lord fought well exclaimed umu admiringly a glanced about at dead wounded huanacocha be among rabble be unless have escaped answered harry if have tenth man of bodyguard will lose hand foot snarled umu savagely then brow cleared a glancing at mob of prisoner trooper be now forming up detected huanacocha alive apparently unhurt among ah be there see continued very well plot be of hatching will undergo fire ordeal nay not that good umu not that protested harry fate be too horrible to be thought of punish by mean if will for indeed deserves punishment not in way very well lord answered umu will be a wish meanwhile pray to return to palace escorted by bodyguard while with few men attend to safe disposal of fellow five minute later escombe found scarcely knew how mounted on trooper horse wending way back to palace surrounded by devoted bodyguard while populace quick to detect how matter be going rent air with acclamation hour later umu bowed into escombe presence to report progress prisoner lord said be with exception of huanacocha safely confined now await such punishment a may be pleased to inflict upon in presence of great multitude have caused head of huanacocha to be struck from body in ground of own palace have thrown head body together upon smoking ruin of place have likewise posted notice upon entrance gate forbidding anyone to interfere with body give burial be to be left where lie for dog of city to devour a warning example to others of fate of who conspire sacrilegiously against authority person of sovereign have left two armed trooper to mount sentry at gate to ensure that order be obeyed two only ejaculated harry in horrified tone dear umu if may judge of temper of people at large by with whom have to deal in temple to day two unfortunate men have be torn to piece before now must send support at once to want more bloodshed over unfortunate business there will be no more lord answered umu grimly sentry be a safe a if be in barrack people know know at first sign of disorder must sack city from end to end put one of inhabitant to sword there will be no more crime of sort for many day to come after have befallen huanacocha who be most powerful noble in land be sure hope not answered harry if must prove to be right in estimate of salutary influence exercised by example have made of turbulent fellow death will not have be in vain now umu what about palace servant see that entirely new staff have be installed here by order arima tell also tell that others be safely lodged in prison surely have nothing to do with conspiracy whereupon umu by way of reply proceeded to recount to royal master whole history of affair so far a have learned included pretty nearly everything be worth repeating for in course of investigation during eventful morning soldier have come upon thread after thread until taking into account what then learned adding to such stray hint a have previously reached to have up to that morning attached significance there be very little left to be learned relative to conspiracy result of be that after thinking matter over very carefully escombe be driven to conclusion that curious people into whose midst have be so strangely brought be not ripe for reform a ruler must have felt duty to introduce that did not want must never willingly accept consequently must either govern a desired to be governed at expense of own conscience else abandon idea of ruling at having come to conclusion summoned noble to conference at put case frankly before inviting a frankly to express opinion upon with result that be fully confirmed in opinion have formed day after close of conference definitely announced to umu intention to abdicate quit valley at same time asking that officer advice a to best most desirable mode of procedure in so exceedingly delicate business affair can be arranged quite easily lord answered umu there be not slightest need for to abandon after what have happened to villac vmu huanacocha who be two chief conspirator example will make of who be foolish enough to listen to will be troubled by more conspiracy will see that law may choose to make be obeyed whether happen to be to taste of people not there be few who like be able to recognise such law a have thus far made be for advantage will always be able to reckon upon support while for others who have not sense enough to understand what be good for must be compelled to bow to decree of who be wiser than if a have intimated be quite resolved not to enforce wish upon people against will will issue proclamation declaring that since inhabitant of valley have rejected enormous benefit advantage have desired to bestow upon have decided to leave valley abandon to fate have assumed rein of government will henceforth rule in stead be for lord to say of two alternative will be adopted very well umu said escombe have already quite made up mind will not remain here to force upon people law ordinance be unacceptable to therefore issue proclamation a soon a please will make arrangement to leave forthwith presume may depend upon to furnish with guide escort a far a santa rosa from will take train to islay also a will require money to defray expense back to england will take liberty of withdrawing one bar of gold from palace treasure chamber for purpose assuredly lord answered umu will be furnished with reliable guide can have none better than arima also such escort a will enable to perform journey in perfect safety comfort a to gold must of course be for to determine how much will need to defray expense back to own country what of remainder of treasure will scarcely be able to take whole of with for to transport across mountain must need service of man in valley so large following a must be apt to attract undue unwelcome attention ay that must laughed harry have intention of robbing of treasure umu very far from single bar of gold will suffice for need thanks whole of treasure be yours lord to do what will with answered umu be given to on day when be proclaimed inca oh yes know interrupted harry be given for certain purpose to wit reconquest of country restoration to former owner since people be too indolent too self indulgent to allow to do for of course have claim upon treasure must not possibly dream of appropriating to own us so let be then lord answered umu take what require for rest will deal with matter week later witnessed escombe departure from valley of sun with arima a guide troop of inca bodyguard a escort a umu have promised possible arrangement have be made for safety comfort on journey portion of lay between valley santa rosa be accomplished far more agreeably than be that lay between santa rosa sea bodyguard escorted to within twenty mile of santa rosa be a close to city a be prudent for to approach then left to complete journey in company of arima porter who bore baggage for there be not very much of latter now remaining nevertheless following amounted to twenty five men for in addition to escombe personal belonging tent etcetera there be three stout wooden case measuring about eighteen inch way containing a umu at parting informed harry smallest possible share of treasure must be permitted to leave with when be ultimately opened proved to contain gem diamond ruby emerald of such enormous value a to constitute owner multi millionaire be not to be supposed that escombe succeeded in conveying treasure down to coast getting safely embarked upon mail boat for england without tremendous difficulty trouble by exercise of immense ingenuity tact expenditure of very considerable amount of time ultimately managed harry be now safe at home settled down very comfortably with mother sister in most lovely part of devonshire where divide time pretty evenly between enjoying converting store of gem into coin of realm seeking opportunity to employ enormous wealth for benefit advantage of le fortunate fellow men let not be thought however that harry adventure in city of sun have banished from mind fact that still owed very important duty to sir philip swinburne on contrary be subject became most important one in thought after have finally completed arrangement for safe transport of treasure to england indeed claimed attention immediately upon arrival at coast one of first act be to write to sir philip acquainting that gentleman with fact of escape from indian for so put impending departure for england adding that must afford pleasure of calling at office in westminster at earliest possible moment after arrival home have already ascertained that survey party have completed operation that bannister have left for two month prior to date of own arrival upon coast knew that there be many point in connection with portion of survey have be executed prior to bannister arrival upon scene nobody must make clear accordingly have sooner started upon long homeward voyage than betook to task of preparing voluminous explanatory note on point so far a memory served in order that might have information cut dried for submission upon arrival home in conformity with promise duly presented in westminster within twenty four hour of return to english soil receiving enthusiastic welcome from former confrere especially from bannister whom found busily engaged in plotting result of sounding taken at lake titicaca be also effusively welcomed by mr richards who have already wrought into state of distraction in futile endeavour to clear up very obscurity formed subject of harry note with return of escombe to office trouble of chief draughtsman on account ceased found once more able to sleep at night for harry promptly made clear that held absolutely at sir philip disposal until whole of plan relating to survey must be completed presented at office punctually at ten o'clock morning worked diligently throughout day for succeeding two month until entire work have be brought to satisfactory conclusion sir philip have written report dispatched with proposal to chairman of peruvian corporation whether proposal will be carried into effect future only can tell for involve expenditure of formidable number of million be safe to say that if be harry will take part in work view being that since have need to earn living must be wrong of to accept post thus shut out someone who have that need still have satisfaction of knowing that although future be independent of goodwill of man so conducted during trying time of service under butler afterwards while working singlehanded a to win warmest approval esteem of sir philip swinburne worthy richards latter of whom be now wont to quote harry escombe a pattern model of engineering pupil be also due to harry to mention that made early opportunity to call upon butler widow for purpose of personally acquainting with detail of surveyor unhappy end in doing contrived so to modify particular of story that by judicious omission here there without sacrifice of truth succeeded in conveying impression be very comforting consoling to unfortunate lady in midst of grief a found that poor soul have be left in very straitened circumstance made business promptly to arrange with lawyer that must be paid anonymously sufficient sum quarterly to place beyond reach of want
