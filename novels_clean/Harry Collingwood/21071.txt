distinct party one of be successfully opposing mr reid whilst other seemed determined at cost to prevent own little party from gaining footing upon deck twice be forced back into boat saw that two three of men be bleeding from pike bullet wound third time made attempt a be scrambling up into brig channel frenchman thrust pike through port at grasped weapon partly through antagonist effort to wrench away again partly with aid of friendly push behind from one of own lad suddenly found shot in through port safely landed on brig deck springing to foot in instant laid fiercely about with cutlas thus cleared way for gig crew to follow in le than minute gig be in possession of fore part of deck so quickly be thing done with such good will did lad lay about that party opposed to recoiled in sudden panic taking instant advantage of charged with wild hurrah whereupon fairly turned tail fled before rushing helter skelter in among other party whole body of defender being thus thrown into disorder first lieutenant party managed to make good footing on deck then after one desperate ineffectual charge on part of frenchman have further trouble defender throwing down weapon calling for quarter be of course at once accorded be ordered below hatch being clapped over whilst ship be subjected to overhaul proved to be empty old besides being apparently particularly leaky tub be consequently valueless except for purpose of destroying thus putting stop to depredation not worth trouble of taking fact definitely ascertained mr reid ordered crew on deck again giving five minute in to collect personal belonging directed to take brig boat make best of way ashore crew thus got rid of vessel herself be effectually set on fire in three place a soon a flame have taken hold a to prevent possibility of extinction left meanwhile second lieutenant courtenay have be equally successful with having captured one of schooner without very much difficulty proved however to be like brig very old weak having evidently be strained to piece in effort to make perform service for be never built therefore be also set on fire a for prize consisted of dozen wretched little dirty coaster largest of must not have measured over sixty ton crew be informed have be landed on various part of coast so lawful owner not being there to take possession of craft be likewise devoted to flame by time that frenchman have be got rid of little fleet effectually set on fire have fallen dark hand being pretty well tired out made best of way back to frigate have eight hand wounded in skirmish wound proving fortunately of very trifling character so much so indeed that not one of wounded be put on sick list for even single day hermione remained at anchor night on following morning mr douglas with boat crew went on shore drove small garrison out of fort spiked dismounted gun thus harmlessly so far at least a be concerned ended first brush with enemy though never heard anything further of affair received gratifying information that first lieutenant have spoken very highly of conduct on occasion when making report to captain pigot chapter four unsuccessful chase fortnight later fell in with be ordered to join squadron of vice admiral parker arrangement be to hermione officer at least source of intense gratification for whereas whilst be cruising alone opportunity for social intercourse be limited to occasional invitation to dine with captain that heaven know be poor entertainment enough now have frequent invitation to dine with officer of other ship entertained in return in own ward room though matter be thus made more pleasant for officer of hermione can not say that change wrought improvement in condition of ship company quite reverse indeed for so anxious be captain pigot that ship must be smartest in fleet that when reefing topsail at night if other ship happened to finish before last man of yard of dilatory topsail be infallibly booked for flogging next day so with other evolution result of be that while crew became noted for smartness daily grew more sullen sulky discontented in disposition shirking work whenever there be possibility of doing so undetected performing duty with ill will took little pain to conceal of course only tended to make matter still worse skipper must not fail to notice increasing unpopularity wounded self love added to soon got idea into head certainly not altogether without reason that men be combining together to thwart annoy only made still more irritable severe seemed at length a though matter be steadily approaching point when must become open recognised struggle between captain crew for supremacy in respect of dogged obstinacy determination what made worse be that officer in maintenance of proper order discipline in ship be compelled very much against will to support countenance skipper in arbitrary mode of dealing with crew thus dividing inmate of frigate into two well defined party namely on quarter deck on forecastle be unpopular in varying degree from captain down to midshipman have good reason to believe that first lieutenant on more than one occasion remonstrated with captain pigot upon excessive harshness to men strongly urged to try effect of more lenient measure with if such be case remonstrance proved wholly unavailing added to there be especially after joined squadron incessant sail gun musketry cutlas drill in addition to daily combined evolution of ship of made poor lad pray for change of sort cared not what must scarcely be for worse might very reasonably be hoped to be somewhat for better under such circumstance joy of men may be imagined when one morning at daylight signal be made by admiral to chase to eastward nevertheless unfortunate lookout aloft be promptly booked for two dozen at gangway day because have failed to be first to discover stranger be cruising at time in windward channel squadron being at moment of discovery about midway between point malano perle be working to windward under double reefed topsail on starboard tack trade wind blowing fresh at about east east strange sail be about ten mile dead to windward of that have sharp eye on board be manifest from fact that before have time to acknowledge admiral signal have shaken reef out of topsail have set topgallant sail ship in squadron of course at once did same forthwith most animated chase commenced hermione happened to be weathermost british ship consequently nearest chase most anxiously did captain pigot struggle to maintain enviable position albeit be closely pressed by frigate mermaid quebec be thrashing along one on lee bow other on lee beam distance of bare cable length separating three ship from other be interesting exhilarating spectacle to watch two graceful craft leaping plunging over swift rushing foam capped emerald surge spurning aside with swelling bow shivering into cloud like shower of snowy spray dashed a high a fore yard now rolling heavily to windward a slid down into liquid valley anon careering to leeward under influence of wind wave a mounted to succeeding crest until wet gleaming side glistening copper flashed in sun almost down to garboard strake did own ship present le gallant spectacle a careered madly forward through hissing brine now burying bow deep in fringe of yeasty foam next moment soaring aloft a though meant to forsake ocean altogether steeply inclined deck knee deep with rushing cataract of water poured over to windward canvas tugging at stout spar until bent sprang like fishing rod wind singing through tautly strained rigging a through string of gigantic aeolian harp bearing of chase be promptly taken by mr southcott master single hour sufficed to show that be not only fore reaching also weathering upon by time have brought couple of point abaft weather beam hermione be then hove about manoeuvre temporarily bringing chase fair in line with jib boom end whilst mermaid lay broad away on lee quarter fully mile distant with quebec mile astern of with rising of sun breeze freshened still more soon became evident from first lieutenant manner that be beginning to feel anxious about spar captain pigot however who be on deck must not allow canvas to be reduced by so much a single thread so mr reid be at length compelled at considerable risk to men who executed duty to get up preventer back stay fore aft to precaution be doubtless due ultimate success crowned effort hour brought fairly astern of chase moment that three mast be in line again tacked stood after being now directly in wake about nine mile astern meanwhile rest of squadron have also tacked be now to be seen tailing out in long straggling line on lee quarter mermaid leading quebec next rest nowhere a racing men say breakfast be now served by time again went on deck have so far gained upon chase that foot of course must be now then seen a rose upon crest of sea be evidently very smart a well a very fine ship yet be overhauling hand over hand a ship pretty generally did of french be freely admitted on hand that french be better shipbuilder than yet ship generally proved faster in chase like present have often wondered how be now saw must understand reason be because british ship be better sailed better steered than of enemy even at then distance be painfully apparent that yard of chase be trimmed in most slovenly manner in matter of steering be sheering yawing over place whilst for canvas be trimmed with utmost nicety have man at wheel who never for single instant removed glance from weather leach of main topgallant sail be kept merest trifle lift just sufficiently so more to show that frigate be looking up a high a be possible for to go remainder of canvas be clean full dragging along at race horse speed result be that though ship be possibly slower of two wake be a straight a though have be ruled upon heaving water whilst that of chase be so crooked that must have travelled over nearly half a much ground again a thus losing through faulty steering more than gained through superiority in speed at be by time have neared chase to within distance of six mile stranger hove about for first time stood to southward eastward close hauled on larboard tack at followed suit hour later high land behind jean rabel saint domingo be sighted from aloft captain pigot now came to conclusion that stranger be aiming to take refuge in port au paix must succeed in effecting design might prove difficult if not impossible to capture anxiety to speedily get alongside force to action accordingly grew almost momentarily more intense a also did acerbity of temper until at length became so nearly unbearable that have just then happened to have be washed overboard believe not single man in ship apart from officer be of course must have raised hand joined in effort to save at noon however matter grew little more tolerable for have by time become apparent that unless favoured by unforeseen accident chase must not possibly escape at jean rabel land begin to trend to southward westward extending in direction distance of four five mile when bend somewhat more to westward thus forming willow bay be towards bottom of bay that chase be now heading speedily became apparent that if must avoid going ashore there must soon be only two alternative open to one of be to go round upon starboard tack make stretch off land sufficient to allow of fetching port au paix on next board in event must have to pas within gun shot other be to bear up run to southward westward when must have to run gauntlet of whole remaining portion of squadron in case fate must only be certain capture hoped believed must choose first of two alternative be nearing land very rapidly chase now only three mile ahead of at length captain pigot feeling certain that stranger must now very soon heave in stay ordered own people to station resolved to tack simultaneously with chase thus by remaining three mile further in offing retain advantage of stronger truer breeze minute after minute lagged slowly by however still french ship kept steadily on with bow pointing straight toward land suddenly without warning premonition three mast with spread of canvas be seen to sway violently over to leeward before of fully realised what be happening lay prone in water alongside snapped short off by deck next moment ship swung round broadside on to land sea began to break over captain have actually run on shore to escape sail be at once shortened on board hermione ship hove to with head off shore captain pigot then sent for telescope with aid made thorough inspection of stranded frigate most of officer following example yes there must be possible mistake about be hard fast on shore bumping heavily to appearance with sea breaking over from stem to stern not satisfied however with distant inspection skipper caused gig to be lowered in proceeded a near to scene of wreck a prudence must allow be absent two full hour on return learnt that french ship be hopelessly lost that crew be with utmost difficulty effecting landing on beach that craft herself be already breaking up be highly exasperated a indeed be at noble prize thus slipping through finger at moment too when escape seemed absolutely impossible in heat of temper denounced french captain a dastardly poltroon disgrace to uniform swore must have got hold of must have seized to grating given five dozen at gangway firmly believe fully meant what said a for though youngster be felt perhaps a keenly disappointed a skipper yet thought that french captain have more thoroughly performed duty to country than must have done have remained afloat fought for with vastly superior force of entire squadron on side escape must then have be for impossible ship must inevitably have be captured with sequence that in hand of british crew must have become formidable foe to country have recently owned whereas now though country have lost gun must at least never be turned against captain inspection over gig hoisted in hermione main topsail be filled made sail for offing where remainder of squadron be now hove to awaiting progress of event on following day hand be mustered to witness punishment to unspeakable surprise indignation of everybody officer a well a men whole of poor fellow who have steered ship during unlucky chase of preceding day be ordered to receive three dozen apiece for culpable negligence in performance of duty captain pigot choosing to assert have ship be properly steered must have overtaken brought french frigate to action now manner in hermione helm have be manipulated on occasion in question have excited admiration of extorted frequent favourable comment from officer there be stiff breeze blowing at time frigate when heavily pressed upon taut bowline have most unhandy knack of griping notwithstanding a have before stated wake have be a straight a though ruled upon water captain pigot be bitterly chagrined at want of success quite unreasonably for everybody else have done be possible to secure must not rest until have vented ill upon of unfortunate placed in power hence cruel unjust order issuing of very nearly ended in result most disastrous so far a be personally concerned for when first man of unfortunate batch have stripped be seized up seeing that skipper actually intended to carry out monstrous resolve fact until moment have doubted forgetting for time everything cruelty injustice of action sprang forward placing immediately in front of frowning chief exclaimed do sir assure that be mistaken men deserve sir did utmost be sure indeed heard mr reid remark to mr douglas that have never seen ship so beautifully steered before did sir continued appealing to first lieutenant young gentleman have placed in very awkward position replied poor old david turning to very red in face will not deny did say so meant too captain pigot turned absolutely livid with fury be white even to lip eye literally blazed like of savage animal about to spring upon prey hand be tightly clenched for moment felt that must strike did not however possibly even at moment instinct may have warned that be on verge of committing very grave imprudence instead of striking blow have expected turned short on heel walked into cabin then not until then when glanced about noted universal consternation with be regarded did fully realise enormity of offence of have be guilty captain pigot be absent from deck for perhaps ten minute when returned low hum of conversation have set in on disappearance abruptly ceased eye be turned upon in anticipation of next act in little drama have evidently made successful effort to subdue excitement for be now to outward appearance perfectly calm somewhat abrupt calmness seeming to must confess even more portentous than recent exhibition of passion have be halting before pointed sternly to hatchway said go below sir regard a under arrest will consider case by by so grave dereliction of duty a of have be guilty be not to be dealt with hurriedly bowed turned to go below a did so heard say to first lieutenant since mr reid appear to have taken different view of men conduct from have entertained have moreover seen fit to publicly express view have alternative to give fellow benefit of difference of opinion withhold punishment still think richly deserve will take opportunity of explaining to to other officer man in ship reserve to myself exclusive right of expressing opinion a to behaviour individually collectively of under command of may choose to think upon matter will expect that will henceforward keep opinion strictly to yourselves now let hand be piped down have paused just below under cover of coaming long enough to hear speech to conclusion now a boatswain pipe sent forth shrill sound scurried off made best of way to midshipman berth felt that have allowed sympathy to get better of discretion in so doing have plunged into very awkward predicament out of did not at clearly see how be to extricate might be result to myself of imprudence have at least be mean of saving several men from undeserved flogging reflection served somewhat to comfort be speedily joined by of midshipman whose watch below then happened to be with came master mate named farmer man of thirty five year of age whose obscure parentage want of influential friend have kept back from promotion who in consequence of countless disappointment have grown chronically morose discontented fellow mids be very enthusiastic in expression of admiration for what be pleased to term pluck with have tackled skipper equally profuse in expression of hope belief of successful issue of adventure farmer however speedily put stopper upon tongue by growling impatiently belay there with jabbering youngster know what be talking about fact be that lascelles there have made fool of enemy of skipper to do latter let tell be joke a will probably discover to cost have however done kindly thing perhaps in long run may have reason to regret be suspended from duty for remainder of day until late in evening when marine made appearance at door of berth with intimation that have order to conduct to captain cabin in custody of man who be armed with drawn bayonet be accordingly marched into presence of skipper on entering cabin found captain pigot sitting over wine with first lieutenant seated on opposite side of table when entered apartment mr reid be leaning across table talking to superior in low earnest tone of voice upon entrance conversation abruptly ceased marine saluted announced a prisoner sir then facing automatically to right took up position just outside cabin door approached until within respectful distance of table then halted first lieutenant rising a did so closing door well young gentleman said skipper when old david have resumed seat have anything to say by way of excuse for explanation of extraordinary insubordinate conduct morning nothing sir replied except felt be about under influence of grave misapprehension to inflict punishment upon men who have not deserved that if did so must certainly regret act most deeply be from motive of disrespect acted a did assure sir be done on impulse of moment because felt that if evil be to be prevented must be done instantly acted a must have wished to act have be in place sir felt be lame explanation not likely to help to great extent out of difficulty there be really nothing else must say without directly charging skipper with wanton tyranny be certainly not place of reefer on first cruise to do if mr reid rest of officer be content with position of affair be not for to gainsay very well young gentleman answered skipper after somewhat lengthy pause be willing to accept explanation to believe that acted upon good motive more readily that mr reid here have be most eloquent pleading cause giving best of character hark ye mr lascelles never for future presume to form opinion good bad upon captain conduct under circumstance attempt to put right be too young too inexperienced to be capable of forming just judgment of action of superior moreover midshipman duty be to obey not to judge advise superior officer may return to duty sir let unpleasant incident of to day be warning to throughout remainder of career highly delighted must confess equally surprised in so easy escape from what threatened at outset to be exceedingly awkward scrape stammered out few confused word of thanks assurance of good behaviour for future bowed executed somewhat hasty retreat chapter five cutting out expedition on going on deck to stand watch that night shortly after dismissal by captain pigot found squadron heading to northward on easy bowline under reefed topsail with island of tortuga bearing south east about ten mile distant continued on starboard tack during whole of night tacking at eight o'clock on following morning heading in toward land once more at same time shaking reef out of topsail hour later lookout aloft reported sail to leeward on signalling fact to admiral hermione received permission to chase managed to approach within ten mile of stranger without exciting suspicion shortly afterwards doubt appeared to enter mind a to honesty of intention tacked doubt with object of ascertaining whether business have anything to do with not soon found that have for before be fairly round course have be altered so a to intercept sufficed to thoroughly alarm wearing short round went square off before wind setting stitch of canvas little vessel schooner of seventy ton must spread to breeze chase now showed to be very smart little craft staggering along under cloud of canvas in really surprising manner indeed have pursuit lasted hour longer must probably have lost for be within five mile of harbour of jean rabel when succeeded in bringing to obstinate craft having at length consented to back topsail courtenay be sent away in gig with crew fully armed to give overhaul remained on board nearly hour when returned brought skipper of schooner negro with little vessel now appeared be coaster sailing under french colour be bound from jean rabel to porto caballo be consequently prize though utterly valueless to courtenay instruction have be that if such proved to be case be to take crew out of set on fire however belonged to negro who commanded have begged so earnestly that property might be spared have backed up petition by representation of so important nature courtenay have deemed best before carrying out instruction to bring man on board hermione give interview with captain pigot skipper be in cabin when gig returned alongside so courtenay went in made report result being that negro be speedily admitted to captain pigot presence next thing happened be summoning of first lieutenant to cabin courtenay being at same time dismissed conference of twenty minute duration now ensued at termination of courtenay with dozen men a prize crew be sent away to take charge of schooner on return of boat vessel filled away stood off land on taut bowline negro owner of schooner being detained on board frigate early next morning remainder of squadron be sighted immediately after breakfast captain pigot boarded commodore taking negro with be absent for greater part of morning that something of moment be on tapis soon became apparent from fact that captain of quebec mermaid drake penelope be signalled for everybody be now on qui vive pleasant excitement taking place of stolid sullen indifference apathy on part of crew have gradually resulted from skipper ill advised harshness to at length boat be seen to push off on way back to respective ship few minute later captain pigot passed up gangway came in on deck everybody now waited in breathless expectation for anticipated order must convey to inkling of nature of work in hand to general disappointment such order be given skipper face however wore look of exultant satisfaction demeanour be so much le unpleasant than usual that felt convinced there be something in wind hand settled down accordingly to await with what patience must muster development of event be not however until two day later th of april that curiosity be satisfied signal from commodore requesting captain of hermione quebec mermaid drake penelope to repair on board be first incident of day be followed by conference so protracted that gig crew only got back to ship barely in time for dinner most careful scrupulous inspection of arm chest consumed nearly whole of afternoon watch finally at eight bell four o'clock pm after considerable amount of signalling ship already named detached from rest of squadron under captain pigot order made sail to westward negro captain being at same time restored to command allowed to proceed on way urged forward by brisk trade wind to exposed possible stitch of canvas little squadron made short mile of arriving at three o'clock in morning off port l'ecu where at distance of about mile off shore two mile from harbour of jean rabel on one hand port au paix on other trade wind encountering land breeze ran into calm carefully masked lantern be now exhibited on board hermione utmost caution being observed to prevent light being seen from shore at same moment launch pinnace first second cutter two former carrying boat gun in bow be ordered away to mr reid who in conjunction with lieutenant burdwood of penelope have be closeted with skipper for at least two hour previously be intrusted command of one division of boat be about to be sent away lieutenant burdwood being placed at head of other division mr reid went of course in launch mr douglas commanded pinnace farmer master mate be put in charge of first cutter to supreme surprise gratification be instructed to take charge of second in le than five minute so well planned have be captain pigot arrangement boat be joined by rest of flotilla whole having be quietly rapidly marwilled by mr reid into two division muffled oar dropped simultaneously into water departed on several way mr burdwood with division consisting of four boat from mermaid two from drake two from own vessel pulled briskly away to eastward destination being a shortly afterwards learned port au paix whilst division to belonged headed west for jean rabel night be fine very dark broad belt of dappled cloud overspreading almost entire heaven permitting only isolated star two to twinkle feebly through here there couple of mile in offing trade wind be blowing briskly inshore of at distance of le than quarter of mile land breeze be roaring down off hill with strength of gale where two met there occurred narrow belt of calm broken into momentarily by eddying puff of wind now warm a trade wind got slightly better of land breeze anon cool refreshing odoriferous with perfume of thousand flower a land breeze regained ascendency pushed forward in turn on domain of trade wind mr reid availed of opportunity afforded by passage across narrow belt of calm to rally rest of boat round launch for moment in order to explain object of expedition to give few brief direction respecting movement of boat from explanation now learned that be about to make attack upon two privateer brig together with ship brig have be captured by of be lying in jean rabel harbour be believed to be well protected very strongly manned ship very fine vessel have recently be armed with eighteen pounder brass gun manned by crew of over one hundred men gallant first proposed to attack in person launch being supported by first second cutter mr douglas second lieutenant aided by quebec launch be to tackle heaviest of privateer brig quebec first second cutter be to attack other whilst mermaid second cutter quebec gig be to make dash at remaining brig prize having secured hold in readiness to lend hand wherever presence might seem to be most required work having thus be explicitly set out for mr reid gave word for to renew advance once more pushed ahead night must well have be more favourable for such attack a ours be meant to be surprise if possible than one selected so dark indeed be that by piece of rarest good fortune have actually entered harbour before be able to completely identify whereabouts now became necessary for to pause for moment look about in order to ascertain locality of game word be accordingly quietly passed from boat to boat for men to lay on oar at first be simply impossible for to distinguish anything except land loomed vague dark like broad shadow above water at length however one of men in launch announced in low cautious whisper that must make out spar of vessel directly ahead immediately afterwards cloud overhead breaking slightly away for moment be able to distinguish craft feeling sure that must be one of vessel of be in quest mr reid at once gave order for flotilla to again move cautiously forward boat oar immediately dipped into phosphorescent water causing to gleam flash brilliantly there be doubt that vivid phosphorescence of water must have be visible at long distance in intense darkness of night occasioned premature discovery of presence now took place for men have not pulled dozen stroke before startled hail came pealing out across water to of course paid not slightest attention failing to get reply hail be hurriedly repeated musket be fired port fire be burned on board craft first sighted now proved to be brig pinnace quebec launch be destined to attack for burning of port fire though rendered further concealment on part impossible be very much obliged a by unearthly glare be enabled to discern whereabouts of remaining vessel at with wild cheer crew of boat at once dashed with most commendable promptitude ship happened to be moored in innermost berth that be farthest up harbour contingent therefore consisting of hermione launch first second cutter be last to get alongside by time that reached craft crew be quite ready to receive be fortunately for riding head to wind with bow pointing up harbour stern directly towards consequently only gun must bring to bear upon be two stern chaser of fired twice without effect be within twenty yard of when gun be fired for second time immediately afterwards most formidable volley of musketry be poured into strange to say though bullet sent perfect shower of splinter flying about ear not man in boat be hit before frenchman have time to load again be alongside launch on port quarter first cutter under main chain on starboard side boat under bow luckily for have not have time to trice up boarding netting so that with aid of volley from pistol have not much difficulty in making way in over craft low bulwark when gained deck found literally crowded with frenchman who met with most stubborn resistance have there be light enough for to see what be doing must probably have be driven back to boat in le than three minute port fire have by time burnt out be extinguished darkness save for intermittent flash of pistol be profound so that although there be great deal of firing of hacking hewing shouting there be very little harm being done at least to side so far a must see if french have advantage of in point of number have advantage of in equally important matter for whilst men be dressed in ordinary rig of blue jacket trouser rendering almost invisible in darkness suddenness of attack have compelled enemy to turn out on deck in shirt only by be able to distinguish pretty clearly fight have be progressing in unsatisfactory manner for about ten minute when suddenly dash rattle of oar be heard alongside immediately followed by ringing british cheer in instant ghastly blue glare of light illumined deck saw douglas at head of pinnace crew fling in over bulwark with lighted port fire held aloft in one hand whilst brandished sword with other timely reinforcement at once brought fight to conclusion frenchman forthwith flinging down weapon cry for quarter help came not moment too soon so far a farmer be concerned for very first act of mr douglas on reaching deck be to cleave to chin frenchman whom saw with knee on farmer chest with sword shortened in hand about to pin unfortunate master mate to deck frenchman be at once driven below hatch clapped over after lad be sent aloft to loose topsail cable being cut ship be got under weigh whilst be doing have time to question gallant second a to cause of opportune appearance then learned that so complete have be surprise that other craft have be taken almost without effort that a soon a be accomplished crew secured mr douglas have hastened to assistance rightly surmising that from longer warning given to ship crew great strength must have hand pretty full with moon in last quarter dwindled to merest crescent be just rising over hill to eastward of a swept before land breeze out of jean rabel harbour by feeble light be enabled with difficulty to discern that by watch be just four o'clock in morning thus satisfactorily terminated cutting out expedition most surprising circumstance connected with be perhaps fact that when hand be mustered not one be found to have received hurt worthy of being termed wound have scarcely got clear of land with prize consisting of one ship three brig when discovered three schooner two sloop standing out from port au paix a like ourselves be heading directly for squadron in offing conjectured rightly a afterwards proved that be vessel lieutenant burdwood have be sent in to attack late in evening of following day rejoined remainder of squadron captain pigot at once proceeded on board admiral to report complete success of expedition nothing be settled that night a to disposal of prize on following forenoon be arranged that a quebec ourselves be getting short of provision water must escort prize into port royal at same time avail ourselves of opportunity to revictual reached destination in due time without adventure a then seemed likely that there must be delay in matter of revictualling mr reid improved occasion to give spar rigging thorough overhaul with such repair renewal a be found necessary kept hand busy for four full day at end of time ship be once more ataunto meanwhile from unexplained cause other provision be coming on board very slowly much must be confessed to delight of crew who having worked hard at overhauling repair of rigging to say nothing of behaviour at jean rabel now confidently expected at least day liberty with accompanying jollification ashore when request for be made captain pigot point blank refused in language of most intemperate abusive character stigmatising whole crew a without exception pack of skulking cowardly ruffian added pretty broad hint that in opinion officer be nearly if not quite a bad a men finished up by swearing roundly that not man boy forward aft must set foot on shore even though ship must remain in harbour until grounded upon own beef bone be exasperating enough in conscience even for hand forward who though there be certainly rough character among be by mean bad indeed full half of entire crew be really a smart willing fellow a one need wish to see be even worse for officer for have be looking eagerly forward to certain ball be about to be given by governor to one of have received invitation disappointment be so keen so general that good natured old david a genial first be dubbed by hand took upon to respectfully remonstrate with skipper upon so arbitrary high handed treatment of ship company with result however except that first lieutenant received unmitigated snubbing for pain revictualling of ship be completed about five o'clock in evening upon ball be to take place there be plenty of time therefore for aft to have availed ourselves of governor invitation have skipper seen fit remained obdurate consequently have to content with watching departure of officer from other ship framing such excuse a came uppermost at moment in reply to inquiry of such of a passed near a to why be not going be made more difficult from fact that though be under order to sail at daybreak next morning there be le than three other ship in similarly circumstanced officer of be nevertheless going to be present at ball only consolation must find be in reflection whereas others must commence duty of next day fagged out with long night dancing must rise to refreshed with more le sound night rest with small crumb of comfort be fain to go below turn in when hand be called next morning be found that captain pigot be still absent from ship a be expected to turn up at moment messenger be passed cable hove short slight stir be occasioned by crew of other three ship making preparation to get under way a craft one after other let fall sheeted topsail finally tripping anchor making way to sea with last of land breeze became evident that something out of ordinary course must have occurred to delay skipper be close upon eight bell when gig be sighted pulling down from direction of kingston when few minute later captain pigot came up over side be noticed that be ghastly pale that right arm be in sling seemed to be suffering considerably be in somewhat wavering voice that said to first lieutenant be ready mr reid then get anchor sir let be off at once mr courtenay be good enough to tell surgeon wish to see in cabin with turned short round walked somewhat unsteadily away not making appearance on deck again for nearly week afterwards transpired that awkward temper have led to quarrel during progress of ball between one of soldier officer from up park camp quarrel have terminated in meeting on palisade soldier escaping unscathed whilst captain pigot have emerged from encounter with arm broken by bullet from adversary pistol noon that day found off morant point thrashing to windward under single reefed topsail with sea running now then made frigate careen gunwale to chapter six remonstrance sequel instruction seemed be that must cruise to southward of saint domingo from cape tiburon a far eastward a mona passage giving occasional look into port au prince accordingly carried on day taking second reef in topsail at sunset heaving ship round on starboard tack at midnight brought well in under lee of cape tiburon by daybreak next morning be then on cruising ground sail be shortened frigate being hove about be allowed to jog along under easy canvas thenceforward until captain pigot reappeared on deck have pleasant comfortable time of for although discipline of ship be never for one moment relaxed there be utter absence of worry petty tyranny above daily flogging skipper seemed to consider essential to maintenance of proper degree of subordination smartness on part of crew with reappearance of captain pigot on deck however brief period of rest quietness came to end pain irritation of wound together perhaps with reflection that have be worsted in encounter brought about by own arrogant overbearing demeanour seemed to have chafed temper almost to point of madness flogging be resumed with greater severity than ever time hand be turned up boatswain mate armed with colt be stationed at hatchway with instruction to freshen way of last man on ladder same with shortening making sail last man out of rigging on mast received liberal application of execrable colt to shoulder certainly have effect of making men smart in double sense also made perhaps most discontented crew in service thus matter went on steadily growing from bad to worse until month of september set in have be dodging off on carefully beating over inch of cruising ground looking into likely unlikely spot in hope of picking up prize two non success have be simply phenomenal really seemed a though craft worth trouble of capture have deserted part of world altogether of course resulted a be perhaps only natural in further accession of acerbity fore aft brunt of of course fell upon hand forward who what with drill of one sort perpetual making shortening of sail shifting of spar canvas overhauling setting up of rigging lengthy tedious wholly unnecessary boat expedition in addition to incessant flogging coltings already referred to at length found life positive burden to kind of treatment must of course produce one result by period before named crew have be wrought up to pitch of exasperation revengeful fury that be convinced must have refused to go to gun have encountered enemy may easily be imagined how difficult anxious task be for officer to carry on duty of ship under such circumstance a have by time become clear to everybody excepting apparently captain pigot that existing state of affair must not possibly last much longer at length first lieutenant recognising gravity of situation took upon to invite second third lieutenant master to consultation in own cabin result of consultation be resolve to adopt extreme measure of making collective representation appeal to skipper being decided be determined to carry out resolve on same evening time to be during first dog watch being captain pigot habit to retire to cabin after eight bell have be struck to devote hour so to reading before dinner accordingly sooner have skipper left deck than be despatched by mr reid to apprise mr douglas mr maxwell mr southcott of fact to state that first lieutenant awaited on quarter deck midshipman have of course be left in dark a to proposed interview message of be bearer be of so very unusual character at once suspected there must be something out of common in prospect when few minute later saw four principal officer of ship march with portentously solemn face into cabin determined that right wrong must know what be in wind fortunately for purpose be watch below absence from deck must consequently not be noticed took moment to form plan not much more to execute ship have full poop under captain cabin be situated weather be warm port be open slipping off shoe thrusting beneath gun where be not likely to be discovered made way in stocking up on to poop be entirely deserted at once slipped over side into mizzen channel lid of one of port be then immediately beneath knew beforehand that there be just room for to squeeze in upon where though attitude must be somewhat constrained must be perfectly concealed from eye whilst must also be able to hear with tolerable distinctness word might be spoken in cabin in ordinary conversational tone of voice now be not going to defend conduct know knew at time be doing what have business to do be quite free from feeling of absolute wrong doing have instinctive perception that interview in be about to play part of eaves dropper be in way connected with critical state of affair then prevailing on board felt that whilst cognisance of what be about to pas must be hurtful to nobody knowledge might be advantageous to myself possibly to others also if acted wrongly must be content to bear blame fact remains that posted safely undetected in position have fixed upon overheard almost word passed in brief interview between skipper visitor a swung out over channel settled into somewhat cramped quarter heard captain pigot strident voice speaking in tone of surprised inquiry be too busy just then to catch what said by time have finished however be ready to listen presently heard mr reid reply have taken unusual step sir of waiting upon thus in body to direct attention in most respectful manner to present condition temper of ship company conceive to have resulted wholly from excessive severity toward be almost to man in such excited dangerous frame of mind that have greatest difficulty in maintaining discipline keeping under proper control indeed to adequately carry on duty of ship have become almost impossibility to speak truth frankly sir on comparing note with brother officer have come to conclusion that men be no longer to be depended upon in case of emergency matter can not possibly remain much longer in present state change of sort be inevitable must most respectfully suggest sir to earnest immediate consideration desirability of adopting more lenient generous line of policy great heaven man do know what be saying gasped skipper crash of falling chair together with quiver in voice seemed to indicate that have started to foot in paroxysm of fury be ineffectually struggling to suppress how dare continued how dare anyone of presume to call in question conduct dictate to line of policy will pursue with regard to crew lazy skulking cowardly set of vagabond three fourth of whom be foreigner why man if have not be for severe discipline of complain must have have ship away from ere now know class of men have to deal with aboard here also know how to deal with may take word for will never rest satisfied until have made smartest crew in service a to difficulty profess to experience in carrying on duty of ship must confess have not observed rascal have always appeared active willing enough have be on deck thanks to wholesome fear of cat with have imbued if difficulty really exists can not think gentleman fault must be with yourselves can easily be cured by somewhat firmer maintenance rather than relaxation of rigid discipline deprecate will take opportunity of mentioning whilst be upon subject very strong disapproval of manifest tendency have observed in officer of ship to overlook condone what suppose must term trifling infraction of duty in so doing gentleman have made most grievous mistake however will do best to remedy in immediate future there be nothing like plenty of flogging if wish to keep such cur in proper order during progress of speech skipper have gradually recovered control of temper tremulous tone of anger in voice be succeeded by of bitter sarcasm manifest sneer with concluded made blood boil there be momentary pause then heard first lieutenant say with submission sir permit to say that believe nay be convinced wholly misunderstand character disposition of crew of far too many of indeed be foreigner who have strength spirit to perform duty a efficiently a englishman must believe that for most part honestly do best for honest service faithfully performed perpetual flogging seems to poor reward jail bird among own countryman be most difficult subject to deal with flogging only hardens if have to deal with must be far more disposed to look for cure from contempt raillery of shipmate besides rogue be so cunning that frequently succeed in shifting blame on to other shoulder when one man get punished for offence know that tendency be to make sullen discontented must name at least dozen men who from being bright smart active reliable men at commencement of cruise have degenerated into a many idle skulks solely because good quality have received recognition have be punished over over again for fault of others a to leniency toward men there will do mr reid le said on head better interrupted skipper impatiently discussion have gone far enough continued must now request to withdraw have relieved conscience let say by entering formal protest expressing disapproval of method of dealing with hand forward now let matter drop hark ye one if there be repetition of impertinent interference with by heaven above will clap presumptuous individual who attempt in iron bring to court martial at first convenient port reach now go be hanged to very well sir said old david will go before leave presence permit to observe heard more for perceiving that interview be about to somewhat abruptly terminate judged best to effect escape from place of concealment whilst escape be still possible forthwith proceeded hurriedly to do so managed to make way back to quarter deck without attracting attention have barely secured shoe replaced on foot when first lieutenant companion emerged from poop cabin began to pace quarter deck in apparently careless conversation though must tell by gloomy expression of countenance that be discussing anything agreeable topic at westering sun approached horizon mr douglas mr southcott retired to cabin in anticipation of captain pigot appearance on deck to watch nightly operation of reefing topsail leaving mr reid mr maxwell to slowly pace quarter deck side by side being now watch on deck stationed in waist on larboard side of deck endeavoured to forget gloomy foreboding have arisen out of conversation have recently overheard by abandoning to soothing influence of glorious eventide be indeed glorious evening such a be seldom never to be met with outside tropic wind have gradually fallen away during afternoon until have dropped stark calm there ship lay with head to northward gently rolling on long glassy swell came creeping stealthily up out from northward eastward small island of mona monita latter mere rock lay broad on larboard quarter about eight mile distant two delicate purplish pink blot on south western horizon whilst desecho reared head above north eastern horizon on starboard bow soft grey marking in still softer grey haze of sky in quarter great pile of delicately tinted purple ruby cloud with golden edge lay heaped up in detached fantastic mass along glowing western horizon shaped into semblance of aerial archipelago with far stretching promontory peninsula boldly jutting cape headland with deep gulf winding strait of rosy sky between of celestial island be shaped along edge into series of minute gold tipped projection irregularity needed only slightest effort of fancy to become converted into spire pinnacle of populous city busy seaport whilst certain minute detached flakelets of crimson golden cloud dotted here there about aerial channel

permanently banished be abruptly aroused from fanciful musing by sound of ship bell four stroke upon proclaimed end of first dog watch momentary bustle of calling watch immediately followed in midst of came customary order to reef topsail simultaneously with appearance of larboard watch captain pigot issued from cabin ascending poop ladder made way aft to taffrail from position be able to command view of proceeding on topsail yard royal topgallant sail be very smartly clewed up furled a topsail halyard be let run saw skipper pull out watch noting time by hold face upwards in hand soho thought doe not look very much a though first lieutenant remonstrance have produced beneficial effect there be trouble in store for of unfortunate on yard if be not exceptionally lively hand who have not failed to mark skipper action seemed to think so too set about work with activity of wild cat more hurry le speed be old adage so proved in present case men on mizzen topsail yard managing so to bungle matter when on expiration of two half minute outside limit of time allowed by skipper for reefing topsail captain pigot closed watch with snap replaced smartly in pocket several of reef point still remained to be tied now thought look out for squall a thought passed through mind squall came in shape of hail from skipper mizzen topsail yard there shouted what be about lazy lubber do intend to spend remainder of watch in reefing that topsail wake up put life into motion for here came oath will flog last man off yard work be completed ere have finished speaking men began hurriedly in little confusion to lay in off yard there be decided scramble for topmast rigging man naturally striving to be off yard before neighbour thus exposing immediately about to very considerable amount of peril mr reid who be also on poop near skipper saw hailed men with steady there on mizzen topsail yard steady men take thing quietly of will be meeting with nasty accident men fear of accident be however le than dread of flogging hustling went on much apparently to amusement of captain pigot who smiled cynically a silently watched struggle two captain of to be in most disadvantageous position of a bent supposed to be two smartest hand on yard have laid out one to yard arm to pas haul out earring must consequently in ordinary course of thing be last men off yard however meant flogging for at least one of be resolved to escape if possible instead therefore of laying in along foot rope like rest of men scrambled up on yard by aid of lift standing erect on spar started to run in along toward mast managed very well until reached little struggling crowd about topmast rigging when to avoid two men made spring simultaneously for back stay how happened can never be known somehow other overleaped missed back stay came crashing down on poop where lay motionless upon white plank in moment be crimsoned with blood captain pigot turned ghastly pale a sudden terrible consequence of tyrannical behaviour presented to never moved single step to help of injured men first lieutenant however sprang forward raised head of one poor fellow whilst springing up poop ladder went to assistance of other man to whom went lay on face a turned over raised head turned sick faint at ghastly sight met horrified gaze feature be battered out of recognition lower jaw be broken from what appeared to be crushed face blood be spurting in torrent almost instantly drenched through small clothes wetted to skin unable to endure terrible spectacle turned eye in mr reid direction only to see that unfortunate man whom supported be in quite a bad plight be evident not only that poor fellow be dead also death must have be instantaneous neck being broken crown of skull apparently crushed in such way that brain must be seen protruding deck also be bespattered pas word for surgeon there somebody tell to look smart gasped poor old david in voice so hoarse changed with horror grief must never have recognised a have not seen lip move in minute two surgeon made appearance on scene very brief examination sufficed to enable to pronounce men dead first lieutenant undertook to announce sad intelligence to skipper who still remained standing in same position apparently a unconcerned a if nothing have happened must confess that for one fully expected to see very decided manifestation of emotion on captain part when learned tragical nature of disaster instead of on being told news to horror indignation of everybody who heard simply said um dead be then throw lubber overboard be actually done without slightest pretence to ceremony reverence of kind without so much a single prayer to consecrate dismissal to final resting place in bosom of deep without even pausing to sew up poor fellow in hammock with shot at foot to ensure safe arrival in quiet peaceful region of ocean bed body be straightway raised from deck with one two three heave be flung over side to be instantly fought over torn to piece by dozen shark have put in unsuspected appearance on scene many curse not loud deep be called down upon skipper head that night by shipmate of murdered men for murdered undoubtedly be many vow of complete speedy vengeance be solemnly registered insulted scoffed at derided last spark of self respect if indeed such thing still remained to outraged trodden under foot crew be that night changed from men to devil if at conclusion of unceremonious obsequies leader have stepped forward placed at head must have risen upon unarmed a be torn to piece such thought fear however appeared to present to captain pigot for instead of evincing expressing sorrow for what have occurred imperiously ordered hand to be mustered in waist with evident intention of reading lecture a be wont to term too frequent hectoring address men sullen with suppressed fury blazing in eye revealing in gesture swarmed aft stood in reckless expectation of further outrage be disappointed have sent for skipper began in most sneering contemptuous accent not to express hypocritical sorrow for occurrence have just taken place to point out to obvious lesson be to be learned from lesson fear dense ignorance utter destitution of discernment common sense must prevent ever discovering for yourselves within last half hour two men have come to death how why by sneaking cowardly attempt to evade punishment justly due to lazy skulking lubberly way in performed duty must have be better for have listened to first lieutenant admonition come quietly down from aloft to receive at proper time punishment richly deserved must need attempt to shirk with consequence have witnessed so far a be concerned can only say that think have met with more than just desert be not of want to speak to be of yourselves same shirking idle rebellious spirit distinguished be conspicuous in one of be little more than couple of hour ago officer waited upon in body to make formal complaint of idleness insubordinate conduct there be necessity for to do such thing for be not altogether lacking in power of observation have not failed to notice for time past there have be general disposition on part of hand to thwart oppose in possible way just mention fact of complaint to show that be not alone in opinion a to conduct now lad be great many be only one man if suppose that on account will be able to get own way successfully oppose will discover that never made greater mistake in life may shirk work perform in slovenly unseamanlike manner a long a please warn one have made up mind to convert from lazy skulking mutinous set of tinker tailor now be into smartest best disciplined crew in service by heaven will do too even though must be necessary to administer daily flogging to man in ship there be few of who be shade worse shade more idle lubberly insubordinate than rest jones be one hoskings be thomson kirkpatrick davis morrison have eye upon of be booked man of for early taste of cat assure that when come will be sharp one will learn that in laying yourselves out to oppose captain have undertaken task altogether beyond strength will have rest peace day night henceforward until have completely quelled present rebellious spirit brought to proper condition of subordination smartness so now lad know what have to expect happens will never be able to say did not give due warning pipe down men turned away dispersed in perfect silence usually after administration of lecture however severe irrepressible joker might be detected with head cocked on one side face with waggish grin upon turned toward next neighbour evidently giving utterance to jocular comment upon lately delivered address a gave breech true nautical hitch forward abaft on occasion there be nothing of kind indignation disgust aroused by skipper arrogant threatening speech appeared to be altogether too overpowering to allow of escape of humorous idea to surface silence of men be so complete a to be to mind ominous whilst bearing be marked by peculiar air of defiant recklessness be to be observed in individual who feel that fortune have at length done very worst for how much longer wondered must thus tamely suffer to be hectored browbeaten how much longer go quietly to gangway submit to be severely flogged for most trifling offence then too felt indignant at unscrupulous way in skipper have misrepresented nature of officer recent interview with have conveyed impression that be rather favouring than deprecating severity of discipline such conduct struck a being not only barbarously tyrannical also in highest degree impolitic for what must man of sense expect that by persistence in must make good men bad bad men worse if men be to turn restive in presence of enemy be to mind not unlikely though never anticipated anything worse what must be result whole aspect of affair looked unsatisfactory in extreme when turned into hammock night be to indulge in sundry very gloomy foreboding before finally dropped off to sleep though heaven know how far be from guessing at scene of horror of frigate be to be theatre before twenty four hour have passed over head chapter seven mutiny during night little air of wind sprang up from eastward carried out clear of mona passage when day dawned found with clear horizon round ship at noon wore round to retrace step by sunset be within dozen mile of spot have occupied at same hour on previous evening day for wonder have passed almost pleasantly there have be no flogging captain pigot have scarcely showed on deck except for few minute after breakfast again at noon officer of watch glad to be freed from obnoxious presence have be careful not to unnecessarily hurry badger men whilst carrying on duty of ship only circumstance to mind seemed disquieting be unusual demeanour of men who performed work steadily enough indeed in moody unnatural silence wearing meantime gloomy preoccupied air whilst at same time at least so appeared to seemed to be one in restless anxious watchful frame of mind a though be in momentary expectation of something happening must not at understand state of thing be something quite new for notwithstanding skipper intolerable tyranny there be few of men among best smartest hand have in ship who have hitherto contrived to maintain fairly cheerful demeanour who seldom let slip opportunity a afforded by captain absence from deck to indulge in exchange of quiet bit of nautical humour harmless practical joke with next neighbour to day however sort of thing be conspicuously absent be at first disposed to attribute unwonted gloom to men horror regret at lamentable accident of previous evening that felt again must scarcely account for for however sincere may be jack attachment to shipmate whilst be alive with be sooner dead buried than from quickly acquired habit of promptly casting behind disquieting memory forgets about fate at length a day wore on drew to peaceful close misgiving such a be be after so slight a scarcely to deserve mention passed away at eight bell retired to hammock with dawning hope that perhaps after collective remonstrance of officer be about to bear good fruit mind being thus at rest at once sank into profound sleep from be abruptly startled by loud noise of kind though what be must not for moment make out almost immediately afterwards however heard again loud furious combined shout of many voice from fore part of ship feeling instinctively that something be wrong leaped from hammock a also did courtenay only companion in berth began hurriedly to search for clothes by dim light of smoky lamp hung swaying from deck beam overhead before however have time to do more than don sock grizzled weatherbeaten main topman named ned sykes made appearance in doorway of berth with drawn cutlas in hand pair of pistol in belt looked intently at for moment then said in gruff kindly tone of voice muster lascelles muster courtenay

curse mingled with heard loud harsh tone of captain pigot voice raised in anger melee however if such there be quickly swept aft there be lull for perhaps two three minute followed by sound of brief struggle on quarter deck few shriek groan telling too plainly of bloody work going forward then silence broken only now then by sound of farmer voice apparently issuing order though what be actually saying must not distinguish during time courtenay lay huddled up in hammock too terrified horror stricken to say word at length after lapse of about hour of quietness on deck sykes after cautioning most earnestly not on account to move from where be until return set out with expressed intention of ascertaining how land lay be absent about quarter of hour on return informed in horrified accent that out of officer of ship there remained alive only mr southcott master gunner carpenter courtenay farmer master mate who appeared have taken leading part in mutiny have be elected to command of ship be evident from scared horrified appearance manner of informant that have never anticipated of awful violence bloodshed though frankly admitted that have be consenting party to mutiny general understanding being that officer be to be secured in first instance afterwards handed over a prisoner to enemy hurriedly explained to that for own safety sake must now be necessary for to leave join rest of mutineer without delay that must return to a soon a possibly must that in meantime be on account to leave berth life must certainly be sacrificed after hearing such statement a further warning be needed to keep two unhappy mids close prisoner for rest of night further sleep be of course quite out of question so hastily dressed closing door of berth seated ourselves on sea chest where passed remainder of night discussing awful tragedy have so suddenly be enacted comparing note a to mutual foreboding of such disaster lastly wondering what must be ultimate fate of ourselves few other

week courtenay have completed hull of frigate be busy about spar whilst be putting finishing touch to figure head for seventy four when about four o'clock in afternoon workshop suddenly became darkened to extent that must no longer see to work looking up glancing out of window observed that unnoticed by heavy thunder storm have be gathering over sea cloud setting shoreward be now hovering immediately overhead that be likely to be severe storm be manifest sky being blacker than have ever seen before be debating upon advisability of effecting immediate retreat to castle taking chance of reaching before storm must burst when vivid flash of lightning green baleful quickly succeeded by most deafening peal of thunder decided to remain where be flash rapidly followed then down came rain

window at have taken stand must have be ankle deep storm gained in intensity with startling rapidity lightning blazing flashing about so uninterruptedly that whole atmosphere seemed quiver with greenish blue glare whilst rattling crash roar of thunder went on absolutely without intermission filling firmament with one continuous chaos of deafening sound causing very earth beneath foot to tremble have be going on for eight ten minute perhaps when caught sight through streaming deluge outside of couple of white clad flying figure making way down path from rustic bridge toward workshop sprang to door threw open in moment two young woman plunged through doorway light flimsy garment streaming with water clinging about limb flung breathlessly down upon bench taller darker of two

just same in everything heaven what flash will storm never cease there be present indication of ending said a glanced through window at blackness outside illumined only by quivering lightning flash however surely can not last very much longer meanwhile be wet to skin fear be utterly destitute of mean to remedy disaster be afraid will be chilled sitting there in drenched garment indeed if will

must of course accompany if must permit that honour said with little shudder indicative of incipient chill be of dry comfortable be nothing said be evident that will have to go through sooner later so perhaps sooner better after little more persuasion on part protestation on fair companion acceded to suggestion set out leading van with commandant daughter courtenay following with foster sister stepped out briskly so a to avert if possible evil consequence of drenching already received a picked way along partially submerged footpath giving tree a wide berth a possible for fear of lightning still played vividly about fair companion informed that commandant on returning from visit to that morning have found urgent summons to cartagena awaiting that have started in obedience thereto within hour of receipt mentioning a hastily bade farewell that must not get back in le than fortnight at earliest discussed subject father probable present whereabouts for few minute then young lady asked to detail to particular of mutiny on board hermione did a fully a possibly must exciting thereby keenest anger against mutineer tenderest commiseration for sufferer poor boy said a concluded narrative what dreadful experience for to pas through after seemed to get along capitally together in due time incredibly short time seemed to reached castle without misadventure parting with charge at chief entrance courtenay repaired to own quarter to take bath don dry clothing preparatory to sitting down to dinner courtenay seemed have be a favourably impressed with companion a have be with mine for next two three day must talk of little two charming girl who have burst in upon so unexpectedly on afternoon of for lucky thunder storm reiterating hope that soaking have done harm wondering whether must ever be favoured with meeting if so when indeed trivial a incident may seem exercised important beneficial influence on life after eight month of hardship misery unspeakable have so recently experienced gave something fresh pleasant to think about prevented dwelling for ever upon subject of escape event seemed day to assume more thoroughly impossible aspect on fourth day after eventful one of storm just when be beginning to despair of ever seeing fail acquaintance again be agreeably surprised by seeing enter workshop one afternoon about hour after have returned from luncheon paused just within threshold dona inez glancing somewhat shyly at said will allow to come in sit down for little while must like to watch at work replied a coherently a fluster of delight must allow that nothing must give greater pleasure flinging down tool courtenay hastened to dust down bench place tool box in position that must serve for footstool in other way arrange a far a must to make visitor comfortable preparation completed young lady sat down courtenay pairing off a before animated conversation ensued lasted for remainder of afternoon during be ashamed to say very little work be done if be charmed at first interview with young lady when appeared under disadvantage incidental to condition of utter limpness of soaked draggled clothing fear must lay open to charge of indulging in unbridled rhapsody be to attempt description of effect produced upon rather susceptible heart on occasion of second visit not that on present occasion charm be very greatly enhanced by adventitious aid of dress far from present opportunity be a good a to describe appearance dona inez isolda aurora dolores maria francesca de guzman be little above average height of countrywoman with somewhat slender yet perfectly proportioned figure skin be dazzlingly fair luxuriant hair floated unconfined in long wavy tress down back be of so deep chestnut hue that might easily have be mistaken for black eye well sparkled flashed so brilliantly that be difficult for stranger to determine precise colour feature be perhaps scarcely formed with sufficient regularity to warrant being termed strictly beautiful be most assuredly at least in eye bewitchingly lovely possessed just sufficient colour in cheek lip to give assurance of being in most perfect health music of voice laugh be nothing short of revelation to must see that being only child have not wholly escaped being spoiled slight touch of hauteur imperiousness be noticeable in manner be only just sufficient to add to piquant charm like foster sister be attired in white bodice being fastened with white silken lace cord having sleeve couple of shoulder strap trimmed with lace taking place be fashion of country be doubtless adopted for sake of coolness comfort of girl wore hat head gear of description most graceful picturesque substitute therefore being lace mantilla folded over crown of head with end brought down over shoulder knotted across bosom handsome feather fan fastened to loose silken girdle sash about waist be useful ornamental gave only finishing touch required to a piquant graceful costume a ever saw courtenay companion little eugenia gonzalez be striking contrast to foster sister be couple of inch shorter in stature le slender in figure blonde with blue eye just faintest suggestion of ruddiness in tint of hair merry good humoured expression of countenance altogether though of humble parentage a dainty piquant little beauty a anyone must wish to see a may be supposed with such visitor a to entertain work afternoon did not progress very rapidly courtenay quieted conscience by entering into mutual compact to exercise such increased diligence in future a must fully make up for lost time when afternoon two later overtook fair friend in park a be making way back to workshop after mid day meal seemed again inclined to favour with company good resolve took flight once more neglected work in enjoyment of society however saw must never do seemed pretty evident that being so strictly secluded within confines of castle demesne a two girl be appearance upon scene have assumed almost importance of event in life have wrought so interesting change in somewhat monotonous daily routine of existence that unsophisticated creature have inwardly resolved to make most of novelty whilst opportunity to do so remained in case work be likely to suffer in quality quantity felt ought not to be allowed at same time pleasure to be derived from society be thing not to be lightly given up so end of be that prevailed upon two girl to walk with in park after dinner instead of visiting workshop arrangement be rendered more easy by arrival of letter from commandant announcing detention at cartagena probable delay of month in date of return chapter ten flight subsequent mystification be fully aware now that in thus persuading commandant daughter companion to meet in park be quite inexcusable that fact that be member of family of man who have very materially befriended must have deterred from tempting to act in clandestine manner such a father of inez must certainly have disapproved if have be honourable men must doubtless have done so be not men be simply boy thought only of pleasant companionship frankly plead guilty to charge of deplorable heedlessness be a heedless a lad of age usually be thinking harm at once succumbed to temptation to neglect task on be employed to devote to society of inez companion consequence be almost a matter of course such a older more experienced head must at once have foreseen so far at least a dona inez be concerned for discovered that be a desperately in love a ever boy girl believed to be at length rosy dream be rudely broken in upon soul filled with consternation by news that in three day time commandant hoped to be once more at home knew at once what that meant felt instinctively that blameless a love for other might be must meet with sympathy from don luis must tolerate continued indulgence for moment at first wild hope sprang up within heart that such might not be case that fact of being british officer might have weight with haughty don inez dispelled that hope in moment sobbed know father must understand that nothing of kind must influence in slightest degree in favour love oh yes love more than anything else in world believe must do almost anything to secure happiness not that father be proud very proud of birth lineage whenever idea of marriage may suggest to be certain will wish to wed noble of at least equal rank with of poor leo know nothing save that be prisoner be to go to plead cause not only must refuse to listen to greatly fear anger must fall heavily upon only hope dear leo lie in speedily recovering freedom gaining such distinction in profession a will justify in asking for hand be precisely what will do exclaimed in ecstasy of mingled hope despair courtenay will make good escape before father return even if have to take to sea in open boat where must go in open boat supposing that must secure one must make good escape from shore asked inez must head for jamaica take chance of being picked up by friendly craft replied supposing that be not picked up by friendly craft persisted fair questioner in case said rather ruefully must have to push on taking chance a to wind weather also a to being able to hit jamaica be only twelve hundred mile so across with favourable weather good boat might accomplish run in from ten day to fortnight fortnight in open boat exclaimed inez oh leo must never do must not attempt risk be far too great be better that must remain here prisoner than that must lose life in such desperate attempt a let think want to get to jamaica do not to get there safely must be conveyed there in vessel have have eugenia when doe brother sail in about week hence so told yesterday be answer week hence be too late exclaimed inez send for tell to call at castle early to morrow morning without fail inquired who what brother of eugenia might happen to be be informed that be owner master of small felucca traded regularly between la guayra santiago de cuba that by lucky chance vessel happened at moment to be lying in former port be eminently satisfactory a did not doubt for moment that arrangement might be come to whereby must get to run directly across to port royal of course undertaking to insure craft against capture during run on arrival there there be fair amount of prize money due to from jean rabel affair even if have not yet be awarded felt certain that must raise cash enough upon to defray expense of trip on following morning whilst be at workshop two girl made appearance accompanied by hearty honest looking young fellow who be introduced to a juan gonzalez eugenia brother in answer to inquiry informed that must be quite willing to convey to port royal to land safely there in consideration of sum of one hundred dollar to be paid to within six hour of arrival with proviso that must guarantee against capture during entire trip said sum of one hundred dollar to cover everything provision included to entitle to sole use of felucca cabin during passage across term considered exceedingly reasonable upon inquiring of when must be ready to sail being informed that must start at moment at once closed bargain that matter satisfactorily settled determined upon leaving forthwith since there be nothing to detain be then arranged upon juan suggestion that instead of making way into town boarding felucca in harbour must avoid risk of capture by taking departure from little cove about three mile to westward of castle felucca calling off place about nine o'clock night sending boat ashore for a may be supposed conclusion of arrangement threw into state of such excitement that be quite impossible to think further of work courtenay therefore hastily put workshop into something like decent order wrote joint note to commandant left conspicuously displayed on workshop table wherein expressed most sincere thanks for kindness have shown begged that must not think too hardly of for seizing upon opportunity have presented for escape now be painfully aware that keeping in view exceeding youthfulness reference may be necessary for to make to mutual attachment subsisting between dona inez be liable to be received with certain amount of gentle ridicule incredulity in deprecating such reception of confidential communication will only say that ourselves be thoroughly in earnest that prospect of speedy separation reduced to condition of keenest anguish despair luncheon hour passed unheededly by be not until deepening shadow warned of approaching night that reluctantly turned step castleward to complete very trifling preparation necessary for coming flight courtenay be glad to see be so completely heart whole that be in highest possible spirit did such ample justice to dinner set before a in degree to make up for own shortcoming in respect meal over dismissed pedro for night then proceeded to pack up dilapidated uniform in small parcel to assist in identification a british officer must such prove necessary brought time on to about past seven at hour have arranged to meet again in park inez having insisted much against wish in accompanying to cove satisfying a to fact of actual escape walk to cove be not long one only three mile so occupied full hour half very wretched time proved for of reached place fixed upon a point for embarkation at nine o'clock few minute later small wavering black blotch appeared through intense darkness off entrance heard sound of coil of rope being flung upon deck followed by creaking of block then scraping sound splash such a must be caused by launching of boat over low gunwale of small craft indistinct murmur of voice for moment then plash of oar in water distance to be traversed by boat be not more than three four hundred foot therefore have time only to breathe hurried inarticulate word two of final farewell to inez during slipped on to slender finger only ring possessed when grating sound down by water edge told that boat have grounded hurried away down beach boat be tiny cockle shell of craft with only one man in be just hauling nose up out of water a reached oh be here excellency exclaimed in tone of little surprise thought so much better jump in caballeros let be off there be craft creeping down under land only mile so astern of of el capitano feel somewhat suspicious will be glad to make good offing before come up all right man said courtenay a tumbled into stern sheet of small craft shove off a soon a like man placed shoulder against stem of boat gave powerful shove scrambling in over bow a slid stern foremost into deep water thereby nearly capsizing hand however managed between to keep boat right side up man seating at oar craft be slewed round by one powerful stroke until nose pointed seaward away went faint clear silvery cry of ma ver dios floating after into darkness accompanied by ghostly flutter of scarcely discernible handkerchief dios shouted back a two lingering form vanished in gloomy shadow of precipitous slope leading down to shore in minute so shot alongside felucca sprang in over low bulwark welcome gentleman exclaimed figure who received be better than expected be afraid must have be obliged to wait for there be craft creeping down alongshore there whose movement like fear have be watching since can have other business down here so close in with land however here be so will bear away at once if please if want to watch let follow will take smart craft to overhaul little pinta perhaps must like to go below at once inspect berth replied that must whereupon ushered aft to small companion cautioning against almost perpendicular ladder lowness of beam shouted to unseen francisco to show light below to attend generally to want dived below entered small cabin gruff order two on deck accompanied by creaking of block gear bearing testimony to fact that pinta be bearing away for open sea that escape be actually accomplished fact francisco proved to be bright intelligent lad of thirteen fourteen year of age jauntily rigged in picturesque costume somewhat similar to of neapolitan fisherman in masanielo shapely feature be somewhat marred by long white cicatrice of ugly wound across forehead showed up with startling distinctness against somewhat dusky hue of skin wound must have given rather narrow squeak for when be inflicted be about to question a to particular concerning when bustled away in few minute returned with couple of bottle of wine material for excellent supper laid out upon table then with graceful bow invited to fall to diverted thought in direction seated in very few minute at least having eaten scarcely anything at dinner be thinking of nothing beyond satisfaction of appetite before meal be over little vessel began to roll tumble about in such lively manner a to satisfy that be hauling out fast from under lee of land presently heard sharp patter swish of rain upon deck overhead be by time past ten o'clock two standing berth one on side of small cabin looked tolerably clean inviting so instead of going on deck a have originally intended turned in tried to lose remembrance of somewhat exciting event of day in sound sleep sun be shining brightly down through diminutive sky light when awoke next morning lad francisco be busy sweeping out cabin seeing astir inquired at what time must choose to have breakfast to answered that must have a soon a must be got ready that in meantime must be glad to be supplied with water soap towel scuttled away to get whilst tumbled out of bunk began to dress calling out at same

about now however persistent clank clatter forced so prominently upon attention that burst simultaneously into exclamation respecting incongruity of so small craft being so well provided with arm so well furnished indeed be pinta in respect that anyone entering cabin might naturally have supposed to have be on board privateer something worse in first place there be rack stretching right athwart

moment notice finally over stand of pike be arranged star formed of sheathed cutlass with belt cartridge pouch attached ready in short for instant service can not for life of imagine why friend juan must arm cock boat like remarked why there must be enough weapon here for twice number of men pinta carry who can tell returned courtenay for part fancy spaniard have very lax notion of commercial morality master juan may perhaps amuse a opportunity offer when time be bad with little quiet smuggling although even in such case continued can scarcely see need for formidable armoury for must hardly suspect of inclination to undertake risk of running cargo worth fighting for well will go on deck take look round before sitting down to breakfast by mean said be in very act of ascending companion ladder when francisco made appearance at head coming down stern foremost with coffee pot in one hand smoking dish of broiled fish in other so have to give way for run imminent risk of being scalded el capitano kiss hand excellency said lad a laid double burden on table hope have slept well admirably answered adding a looked at appetising dish sent up grateful odour from table put out plate knife fork so on tell el capitano ' that will be very pleased if will join at breakfast lad stared at in mute astonishment for moment flushing like bashful girl meanwhile then recovering muttered will tell gentleman will feel highly honoured be right laughed courtenay a lad slid up companion very right proper feeling though scarcely know why must experience minute later heavy tramp be audible coming along deck sunlight streaming down through open companion suffered temporary eclipse pair of leg encased in enormous sea boot presented to admiring gaze finally huge fellow of fully six foot in height broad in proportion came towards bowing stooping in most awkward manner partly by way of salutation partly to avoid striking head against low deck beam be dark complexioned bushy whiskered with keen restless black eye shock of ebon hair very imperfectly concealed by black red striped fisherman cap of knitted worsted removed deferentially moment eye fell upon wore large gold ear ring in ear be attired in thick dreadnought jacket over black red striped shirt be confined about waist by broad leather belt to be attached sheath knife of most formidable dimension skirt of shirt be worn outside trouser so that tout ensemble be exactly that of dashing pirate smuggler bold a interesting individual be presented on board of third rate transpontine theatre of present day be picturesque looking person enough certainly be not juan gonzalez to whom bore more resemblance than did courtenay glanced at other in surprise of said word muchisimos gracias for honoured invitation excellency said friend again bowing awkwardly a slid into seat at head of table leaving courtenay to stow on locker one on side of be gratified to learn from francisco that rested soundly during night be afraid motion of felucca must prove disagreeable to have have fine breeze from eastward night la guayra be now nearly hundred mile astern of be good news remarked why must have anticipated evil result to from motion of craft be not aware that be pretty well seasoned sailor said companion be not aware of when urged captain general to send naval officer understood to say that have none available for service that must send two officer of marine did not like proposal be very glad to find that have thought better of can soldier even though be marine know about sounding bearing sea mark entrance to place be very difficult indeed a will see gentleman when come to what in world be man talking about thought glancing across table at courtenay to see what thought of that irrepressible young gentleman elevated eyebrow inquiringly tipped wink of preternatural significance with left eye host be sitting on courtenay starboard hand then devoted most assiduously to red snapper off be breakfasting how long do reckon will take to make run asked with view of maintaining conversation rather than because of comprehension of well said picturesque friend let reckon to day be thursday if breeze hold steady ought to be off cape irois about daybreak next wednesday morning then unless wind head may hope to weather cape maysi about same day after may expect to have breeze well on starboard quarter will enable to complete run in good time to pas through barcos channel reach anchorage before on following friday evening ah remarked courtenay a coolly a though fully understood whole drift of singular conversation little over week if weather remains favourable when say that entrance be difficult do refer to barcos channel more particularly to oh be reply be easy enough for small vessel of light draught be to say although there be one two awkward place there will point out to be entrance to lagoon will give most trouble precisely be what have be given to understand said courtenay addressing to presume have chart of place said friend place have never yet be surveyed giuseppe will not permit anyone to sound anywhere within entrance to lagoon told captain general when asked same question did not mention to no did not said courtenay with seriousness imaginable never said word to about did mention to with glance across table at not word said suppose forgot in hurry must understand continued turning to unknown one so far a be concerned business have be arranged in most hurried manner must look to for enlightenment upon point captain general may have omitted to explain to oh yes assuredly senor assuredly be satisfactory reply be part of bargain know quite so chimed in courtenay if a friend talk matter over happen to come to something be not altogether clear will not fail to apply to by by do happen to have thing a decent cigar on board smart little felucca of yours interlocutor glanced from one to other of with merry twinkle in eye a though courtenay innocent inquiry veiled best joke have heard for long time decent cigar said have have if have not then know where else must look for one gentleman allow pushing past to after part of locker raised lid produced box of weed laid upon table then with awkward bow said a made for companion ladder if have finished breakfast gentleman will send francisco down to clear table chapter eleven captain carera imparts interesting information not word be said by of until unknown one have emerged from companion removed well out of ear shot then a courtenay pushed cigar box across table to after selecting weed for looked in face with mischievous twinkle in eye remarked well lascelles what be interpretation of riddle what be character of felucca who what be skipper whither be bound hush said here come boy will find in exceedingly awkward fix unless keep very bright lookout here francisco entered cabin began to clear away wreck of breakfast why francisco lad look pale surely feel sea sick do exclaimed courtenay sea sick oh said lad got over long ago ah indeed remarked fellow mid in usual off hand manner pray what may long ago ' mean last voyage voyage before three month ago six month year more nearly two year ago senor will have be to sea two year come next month be reply two year eh why be perfect veteran regular old sea dog francisco continued courtenay a exhaled wreath of pale blue smoke from pursed up lip watched go curling in fantastic wreath up through open sky light have be time in pinta yes senor time captain carera be uncle know adopted when mother died have promised to make sailor of ah very good of very good indeed went on courtenay very worthy fellow that uncle of yours francisco have pinta be engaged in same trade ever since joined same trade senor there be alarmed at question lad interrupted courtenay need not answer unless choose know there be occasion for secrecy with understand that do not well know be sure excellency suppose be right however must not be here so mind answering have be engaged in same trade for most part ever since joined pinta pretty profitable business uncle must have found remarked courtenay know so much about senor be reply used to be profitable enough at first believe when el capitano have all in own hand now that giuseppe have admitted other trader not only have to pay higher price for good also have to take turn with others for cargo then too giuseppe have not be so very fortunate of late british cruiser have given great deal of trouble ah yes be pestilent lot british always thrusting nose into other people business agreed unabashed chum well continued to will go on deck take look round uncommonly good cigar of uncle francisco leave box on table lad will ye on reaching deck be now for first time able to take particular note of vessel on board by inexplicable blunder thus found for that blunder have be perpetrated by somebody now fully realised craft proved to be sturdy little felucca of sixty ton so very willow very beamy in proportion to length stoutly built with high quarter low widely flaring bow tossed sea aside in fine style enabled to thrash along with perfectly dry deck be rigged with single stout stumpy mast raking well forward upon be set by mean of immense yard of bamboo fished together twice length of craft enormous lateen triangular sail tack of consisted of stout rope leading from fore end of yard to ring bolt sunk into deck just forward of mast whilst sheet travelled upon iron hawse well secured to taffrail there be five hand on deck when made appearance namely skipper helmsman who be having quiet chat together three men in waist on weather side of deck who be busy patching sail weather be gloriously fine with scarcely cloud to be seen in clear sapphire vault overhead fresh cool breeze from about east north east be ruffling up white cap to windward straining at huge sail until yard bent like fishing rod careening gallant little craft to covering board whilst drove along at rate of good honest nine knot in hour there be other sail anywhere in sight indeed anything to distract attention from little vessel save shoal of flying fish now then sparkled out from under forefoot went skimming away through air to leeward until vanished with flash only to reappear perhaps next moment with inveterate foe dolphin in hot pursuit moment showed above companion skipper rose to foot have be sitting cross legged on deck under weather bulwark joined evidently under impression that be essential part of duty to make agreeable made commonplace remark about weather to vouchsafed ready gracious response very fully realising by time peculiarity perilous nature of position on board felucca position from be of course utterly impossible for then to effect retreat being especially anxious not only to avert possibility of suspicion a to bona fides also to extract such further hint a might tend to elucidation of position for time conversation be of general utterly unimportant character at length however carera evidently reverting to topic be uppermost in mind remarked have thought best senor to mention to manuel mate there nodding head toward helmsman rest of hand fact that be seaman be a pleased a be to hear have made matter much easier for round very much le dangerous for indeed manuel think that if will only consent to act a part of crew whilst be in harbour there rig accordingly giuseppe of people will suspect anything will thus be able to freely look about make such observation a will enable to subsequently carry out part of scheme with success if can only be carried through will make fortune for must have doubloon stored away by caskful by time why be taking across two hundred doubloon time to trade with have never taken le in one of trip how many trip do consider have made altogether asked courtenay oh well let see not le than sixty must suppose be answer sixty time two hundred give twelve thousand twelve thousand doubloon be goodly sum indeed murmured yes answered carera to that must add what other trader have taken across will perhaps amount to at least a much more there be also specie have captured of course have have need to barter away whew involuntarily whistled great light suddenly bursting in upon hitherto darkened understanding courtenay frowned warning to hastened on to say will be big haul certainly why carera will be able to retire from sea altogether live like gentleman for rest of day yes responded somewhat gloomily if secret be well kept if not if ever get abroad that of on board here have be mean of of well of betraying giuseppe gang life will not be worth maravedi for be hand over there nodding ahead to be taken there must still be trader to reckon with will completely spoil game know senor where there be so much money to be made out of must never forgive pooh exclaimed courtenay reassuringly have fear about will never get to know how thing have happened if can only depend upon own people keeping close may rely upon so managing affair that suspicion will rest upon hope so fervently hope so murmured carera anxiously rich must be of little value if one have to go about in constant dread of assassin knife gave cordial affirmation to sentiment then noticing that worthy most estimable skipper seemed somewhat indisposed for further conversation just then courtenay retired to cabin to talk matter over having at length extracted sufficient information to show pretty nearly how land lay on getting below master courtenay first act be to carefully select cigar from box on table cut off point with mathematical regularity light weed then push box over to with cheerful invitation help old fellow really superb weed wonder be name of ship be taken out of eh then seated upon locker planted elbow squarely on table rested chin in palm of hand in by mean elegant attitude puffed long thin cloud of smoke at intently watched tiny wreath for moment two then broke ground by saying well lascelles old boy do happen to know whereabouts be certainly answered in perfectly good faith be now just about one hundred twenty mile to northward westward of la guayra precisely be also in centre of hobble retorted lively youth nodding head impressively at word to give additional emphasis in centre of hobble be where happen to be at present moment continued more soberly let look at fact of case to start with be manifestly on board wrong ship crew of ship ship be same in present case take to be not two unfortunate fugitive british midshipman yearning to return to duty two officer of spanish navy told off by doubt most respectable old gentleman whose acquaintance regret have not yet have honour of making captain general to execute certain duty may perhaps make rough guess at a to precise nature of be at present without definite information do agree with so far yes said why ca discus matter seriously may prove serious enough for at moment heaven know true for o lovelorn youth with solemn visage wherefore emotion becoje tu heno mientras que el sol luciere be a sound bit of wisdom a have happened to pick up during exceedingly pleasant sojourn at la guayra make hay whilst sun shine make most of opportunity have fun can during enforced absence from jurisdiction of first luff be proverb ought to command most profound respect of british midshipman be surprised at lascelles disappointed in that so little endeavour to live up to remarked courtenay however resumed there be certain glimmering of truth in what say hobble like word hobble ' so expressive eh hobble then in centre of find may prove serious enough matter for at moment so let go carefully over ground ascertain exactly how stand to start once more suppose be prepared to accede to proposition before stated that have by unaccountable mistake blundered on board wrong craft on board have in same unaccountable way established in two respectable self most interesting case of mistaken identity eh yes said agree with there go on seeing that be quite hopeless to think of diverting from ridiculous mood be right resumed courtenay now judging from fragmentary information have be able to acquire thus far in interesting conversation with amiable old traitor carera on deck there imagine position to be be two youthful intelligent spanish naval officer commissioned by captain general at la guayra to accompany carera on little trading voyage be making to certain lagoon lying somewhere inside barcos channel now where be barcos channel do know have slightest idea beyond exceedingly hazy one have be able to form from what carera said answered neither have acknowledged courtenay think know enough to identify position very nearly if understood friend aright be now heading for cape irois most westerly point of saint domingo from thence intends to shape course for cape maysi know to be easternmost point of cuba then having weathered that point informed that might expect to have wind well on starboard quarter knowing a do that prevailing wind in latitude be from about east north east mean that will be steering westerly course say from west to north west must take up along northern coast of cuba now how long did understand carera to say must take to complete run to barcos channel something like forty eight hour replied exactly acquiesced courtenay be what understood now must say that with wind on quarter little hooker may be expected to run about ten knot per hour for forty eight hour give run of four hundred eighty mile at distance there thereabouts from cape maysi imagine barcos channel to be that then seems to indicate approximately locality of spot to be bound do agree with do said be precisely how have reasoned out in own mind be well resumed courtenay now why be going there manifestly to assist in betrayal of one giuseppe something happen to know other name from hint dropped by carera have formed opinion that giuseppe must be industrious hard working withal somewhat canny gentleman of piratical profession man who seems to have made business pay pretty well too for doe not friend on deck estimate that have accumulated tidy little sum of close upon twenty five thousand doubloon now however that fickle goddess fortuna appears to have withdrawn smile from pestilent british cruiser be interfering with know when meddle with business of kind mean simple ruination for honest people who be trying to make livelihood out of consequently amigo carera be no longer able to depend upon finding rich cargo at low figure for cash awaiting at giuseppe snug little stronghold carera honest faithful therefore proposes to become virtuous have doubtless of late experienced certain qualm of conscience respecting trade be at present engaged in have made up mind to abandon have also resolved to reform friend giuseppe in order that reformation of estimable person may be made thoroughly effectual have undertaken for consideration most probably share of plunder to point out to captain general deputy various rock shoal other impediment obstruct fairway to pirate anchorage to indicate several sea mark will enable to safely successfully pilot expedition into position a will enable to knock giuseppe stronghold into cocked hat how doe that accord with view of situation yes said think be about right be pretty much idea have formed of good again ejaculated courtenay let go little further now come to hobble dilemma if prefer latter word in find unfortunate hitch in business a look at be so happens that be not captain general deputy two british midshipman want to go not to barcos channel to port royal how be to get to latter place be question will demand most serious consideration need not worry about for few day replied a to not wanting to go to barcos channel why must not want to go there why because want to go to port royal instead suppose what d 'ye mean lascelles hang man what be driving at stammered courtenay thoroughly taken aback ah said with certain air of triumph be afraid see that plan have not yet dawned upon benighted understanding what be to prevent going to barcos channel seeing everything be to be seen there then making way to port royal difficulty a to will be no greater then than be now reporting whole affair to admiral who will doubtless send expedition on own account send with a reward for will do interrupted courtenay enthusiastically by george lascelles be trump genius in fact know what be not in line of superior attainment a schoolmaster used to say what consummate idiot must have be not to think of too say old fellow must be so kind obliging a to kick hard once twice well never mind daresay somebody else will sooner later so will excuse say lascelles continued a serious now a myself be awful risky thing to do do think have nerve impudence enough to carry through without being found out be only two against ten know on board here if be detected will be sure case of drew hand suggestively across throat eh doubt of think said why must be found out feel a though nerve must prove quite equal to task a for impudence have enough to spare for of right then said will chance there be hand upon lascelles make plan may consider necessary will back up through thick thin man can die once if fail in will at least have consolation of feeling that fell whilst doing duty for there can be mistake about being duty to bring about destruction of gang of pirate who now feel convinced be lurking among lagoon inside barcos channel yes said think there can be doubt about now having arrived at clear understanding a to what be about to do think be plain sailing up to time of arrival in lagoon must carefully note particular carera may point out to make sort of chart if possible wherewith to refresh memory after only remains for to find way to port royal that seems to be only item in programme be likely to give very serious difficulty closed discussion for time being went on deck where carera once more obsequiously joined much to disgust for seemed probable that if sort of thing be to continue must find fellow far too attentive to suit ulterior plan however made best of matter finding that thought be wholly occupied with trip object simply let talk about to heart content merely interjecting remark here there with object of directing conversation into such channel a must afford information in still happened to be deficient in way gradually with little skill flattered acquired full particular of plot in carrying out of be supposed to be important agent turned out to be very much sort of thing have already pictured to ourselves man giuseppe be found italian who have made appearance in west indian water five six year previously first in character of slaver afterwards a avowed pirate be according to carera account man of exceptional daring a wily a fox thorough seaman excellent quality have not only raised to position of head chief of powerful gang with whose fortune have identified have also enabled to carry on nefarious business so successfully that have gradually acquired almost fabulous amount of booty have at same time gained for at event among spaniard somewhat sensational title of terror of caribbean sea have established sort of head quarter for in snug spot at head of conconil lagoon where have erected building for accommodation of entire gang part of always remained on shore to look after place where have gradually surrounded with convenience for repairing refitting craft be to secluded indeed almost unknown spot that be in habit of running for shelter when hard pressed by cruiser who be always on lookout for from carera description of difficulty of navigation must seem almost impossible to devise hit upon place better suited for such purpose be here also that first stored plunder afterwards bartered for gold such necessary a might happen to require with three four favoured individual who with most extreme precaution have invited to trade with be key to navigation of lagoon approach carera have undertaken to sell to spanish authority in consideration of receiving a price of treachery one amount of captured spoil for remainder of day mind be chiefly occupied with question of how after visit to conconil lagoon be to make way to port royal more carefully considered question more numerous insurmountable appeared to be difficulty in way be not a though be going to touch at civilised port in case if came to worst might have run away from craft taken chance of getting to suit under circumstance be out of question moreover directly began to consider matter seemed imperative that pinta entire crew must be detained at least until expedition must have sailed otherwise carera finding duped might endeavour to make best of bad matter by hurrying off to warn giuseppe of possibility of beating up quarter situation eventually resolved into whereas on completion of ostensible trading errand pinta must in ordinary course of event return to la guayra taking with when on arrival whole fiasco must come to light least misfortune might expect must be return to loathsome prison quarter be necessary for success of plan that craft crew must by mean other find way to royal port how be affair to be managed outline of scheme at length arranged in mind although be of so desperate character that agreed be almost impossible that must be able to carry through nevertheless took immediate step to further accomplishment be not much that must do just then be possible for be to assume extreme pleasure at being allowed to steer little craft so managed affair that in course of few day came to be understood thing among hand whenever of happened to be too lazy to take trick at tiller must always get relief by appealing to one other of if happened to be on deck at time breeze continued to hold from eastward a drew over toward coast of saint domingo softened down trifle so that on arrival off cape irois found just about twelve hour behind time reckoned on by carera that however be matter of very great moment being rather advantage than otherwise since enabled to slip across windward channel with le risk of being sighted overhauled by british cruiser incident now that courtenay have quite made up mind to go through with adventure be folly a anxious a of pinta regular crew to avoid be fortunate enough to make passage without molestation though not wholly without alarm for large ship be made out about end of middle watch coming down before wind heading right for with whole cloud of flying kite aloft studding sail set on side proved however to be merchantman apparently british from course be steering judged to be bound to kingston swept magnificently across stern at distance of about couple of mile in little more than hour from time of first sighting be hull down again upon larboard quarter with sunrise found hauling in under high land about cape maysi here ran into calm belt dividing land sea breeze lay for hour rolling gunwale under great sail flapping noisily sending dew pattering down on deck in regular shower with roll of little vessel whilst huge yard swayed creaked aloft tugging at stumpy mast tautening out standing rigging alternately to port starboard with such violence momentarily expected to see whole affair go toppling over side hold on good rope yarn be now cry did hold on fortunately though during hour of calm there be more noise aloft than have ever before heard on board vessel at length sea breeze came creeping down to cat paw filled lofty tapering sail passed causing canvas to flap heavily ere filled to next flap then sail swelled out gently went to sleep nimble little hooker turned saucy nose into wind eye few bubble drifted past side a gathered way long smooth ripple trailed out on side of sharp bow then heeled gracefully over to larboard a languid breeze freshened upon presently down came gale of wind burying half bulwark deep making everything crack again a boat gathered way darted off like startled dolphin here carera be within ace of making mess of whole business for whilst have be tumbling about becalmed current have got hold of have set so close in with land whilst rounding point actually passed through breaker beating on reef be convinced that have be couple of fathom further to leeward hooker must have laid bone there however danger be come gone in le than minute be extreme point of reef have grazed so very closely once past have clear sea ahead be out of reach of further danger be courtenay however who actually saved felucca for at supreme moment when little craft plunged into breaker when if ever there be utmost need for coolness self possession what must hand do plump down upon knee calling upon saint antonio heaven know how many other saint to come help carera being one of foremost to do so abandoning tiller meanwhile leaving vessel to take care of herself at very moment of others when most needed looking after of course shot into wind eye in instant in minute craft must have be on rock stern foremost beating bottom in have not courtenay who happened to be standing close by sprung to tiller jammed hard weather thus causing to pay off forge ahead before losing steerage way altogether once fairly clear of point carera put helm up away went with flowing sheet upon north west by west course arriving off mangle point about noon from thence began to haul somewhat off from land wind drawing further aft freshening somewhat a did so so that by sunset lively little craft have brought lucrecia point fairly on larboard beam a sun went down wind manifested disposition to drop for couple of hour crept along at speed of scarcely five knot breezed up again just after first watch came on deck by two bell be smoking through faster than have ever before seen craft travel in accordance with plan courtenay have arranged took tiller between during whole of first watch two hand whose place have taken coolly going below turning in when watch be called at midnight felt that have done enough for purpose so retired below spent remainder of night in bunk chapter twelve narrow escape at daybreak next morning be awakened by terrific hubbub overhead going on deck to ascertain what be matter found that felucca having be allowed to draw in too close with land during night be becalmed off guajaba island whilst sail nine mile distant in offing evidently british man of war from cut of canvas apparently frigate from size be heading straight for close hauled on larboard tack with rattling breeze a must see by way be laying over to rapidity with sail rose above horizon there must be doubt that have seen with first approach of daylight be determined to give overhaul hence confusion have aroused from peaceful slumber be laughable to witness agonised dismay with spaniard viewed approach of craft to listen to prayer vow malediction issued indiscriminately from lip a swept relentlessly down toward anticipated nothing le than capture destruction of felucca detention of a prisoner catastrophe bad enough in a must have appeared to be doubtless rendered infinitely more disagreeable by reflection to mishap must be added total collapse of pretty little plan for betrayal of friend pirate subsequent division of spoil even to prospect be by mean inviting be true that here be chance for to rejoin own countryman so escape from dilemma in foresaw that must be placed after leaving conconil lagoon be not altogether without hope that might in case be able to escape from dilemma having resolved to go through with adventure be now by mean disposed to have nipped in bud be consequently quite a averse to visit from frigate a be carera at once set wit to work to see if might not be possible to devise mean of escape breeze be blowing fresh to within mile of where lay felt convinced that frigate with way have on must shoot far enough ahead even after have entered calm belt to reach with gun be therefore evident that be to be done must have to be done quickly if be to be of use at looked around saw by colour of water that there be shoal at great distance inshore of called carera aft said to look here carera do happen to know coast pretty well inch of senor be reply see there be shoal water over there said indicating direction with nod of head now what be to hinder from rigging out sweep sweeping felucca into such willow water a will prevent frigate yonder from approaching near enough to reach with gun pinta be in light trim with hand at sweep ought to be able to move pretty smartly through water even must frigate send boat after might be able to keep out of way until breeze come excellent senor exclaimed rapturously have never thought of ah be gentleman of navy who after have idea out sweep forward there continued will escape accursed englishman yet crew aroused by hopeful tone in carera spoke scrambled up off knee rigging out sweep soon have little craft heading direct for shore moving through water at rate of four knot frigate seeing hoisted ensign fired gun a signal for to heave to of took not slightest notice placed at tiller carera took up position on stem head conning felucca courtenay devoted energy to encouragement of men a laboured at sweep meanwhile breeze be gradually creeping nearer to minute whilst advantage in so far a lessened time during men must have to toil at sweep be more than counterbalanced by disagreeable fact that must enable frigate to approach so much nearer to before in turn became becalmed at length noble craft shot across outer boundary of calm belt instant that canvas flapped to mast helm be gently ported until headed straight for when gun be fired before smoke have cleared away have swept round until whole broadside numbering eighteen gun be bearing upon now shouted courtenay look out for squall word have scarcely left lip when bang went gun saw shot come skipping ricochetting across glassy surface of water straight toward ploughing up long steamy jet of spray at bound finally with skurrying splash disappearing about dozen yard astern of after there be pause of about minute apparently to see whether be really foolhardy enough to persist in attempting escape also probably to give muzzle of gun little more elevation when seeing that sweep be still kept steadily going let fly whole broadside at with rattling crash caused spaniard with one accord to let go hold upon sweep drop flat on face on deck moment shot came hurtling about overhead very fair dose on side of little craft so close too that spray flashed in over deck in regular shower whilst one shot came crashing in through taffrail flying close past where be standing at tiller smashing through head of companion then flying out over bow passing through sail on way missing carera head by hair breadth eighteen pounder by power ejaculated courtenay turning to narrow squeak that for old boy now then hearties to spaniard tail on to sweep again look sharp about remember if be caught away go chance of making fortune out of friend giuseppe yonder suggestion aroused courage cupidity with shout sprang once more to foot to sweep meanwhile breeze have crept in until have overtaken frigate at once filled on starboard tack keeping luff until have gathered good way when squared away once more came booming into calm belt nearing almost mile by manoeuvre be good excellency will have to give up exclaimed carera coming aft be now a close in a dare go if diabolical frigate fire broadside at will blow out of water port helm senor hard port coral be close under keel hard port responded why give up good fellow frigate be a close now a dare come to may take word for that captain will not run risk of plumping ship ashore for sake of such insignificant craft a pinta have look out here come broadside how escaped that second storm of shot be sure can not tell for be now almost within point blank range escape did although for single instant whole air around seemed filled with iron so thick close did shot fly about sail be pierced in three place beyond harm be done be after with boat will waste more powder shot upon exclaimed courtenay sure enough on looking astern saw two boat just dropping into water must give up must give up cried crew a saw leaving sweep came aft in body with request that carera must hoist spanish ensign haul down again in token of surrender exclaimed see how breeze be creeping down to will be here a soon a boat sooner if stick to sweep then will engage that scrape clear somehow be there place carera that can run into so dodge frigate can laugh at boat if once get breeze place of course there be exclaimed skipper courage again reviving there be boca de guajaba not mile from on larboard bow once in there can run up at back of romano know channel so effectually give frigate slip back to sweep child will never yield until be obliged again crew manned sweep again animated by judicious reminder from courtenay of treasure awaiting in conconil lagoon bent back lashed water into foam a gathered way upon felucca once more carera went forward to con craft through dangerous channel be now fast approaching meanwhile two boat gig cutter be tearing after going two foot to one evidently quite alive to fact that unless kept ahead of breeze reached before still stood fair chance of escape presently narrow opening revealed in shore about quarter of mile away among tree clustered close to water edge carera directing attention to informed be channel surf be breaking heavily all along shore to attempt passage through seemed from point of observation then occupied to be simply courting destruction said nothing however trusting in carera assertion that knew place presently narrow band of unbroken water appeared in midst of foam toward minute later felucca be headed boat be now closing with fast gig be leading being within about three cable length of whilst cutter be not more than fifty foot astern of three four minute at most must suffice to bring alongside of fast a be moving through water unless breeze came to aid sea be ruffled astern of cat paw now then must come stealing along glassy surface between so far have managed to keep ahead of breeze measured roll of oar in rowlock must now be distinctly heard sound reaching ear of spaniard made strain tug at sweep more desperately than ever courtenay not only cheering on now actually tailing on to sweep lad francisco be manfully tugging away at with best of perspiration be pouring off poor fellow face bare arm in stream still worked away looking eagerly at time shot hasty glance astern a if anxious to gather from expressive countenance what hope of escape still remained at length reached mouth of channel dared longer withdraw eye for single instant from carera passage be exceedingly narrow so confined indeed that man might have leaped from rail into seething breaker on side of little craft bobbed pitched a glided into troubled water huge sail rattled flapped seemed to visibly lose way at juncture voice hailed in execrably bad spanish from gig astern peremptorily exclaiming heave to rascally pack of piratical cut throat will fire into pull men pull urged here be breeze close aboard of at same instant great lateen sail swelled heavily out wavered jerked sheet taut collapsed again spaniard greeted sight with joyous shout whereas have hitherto be toiling in grimmest silence now burst out with mutual cry of encouragement jabber of congratulatory remark be almost instantly cut short by crack of musket ball of clipped very neatly through brim of straw hat again sail flapped collapsed flapped again then filled steadily out hurrah lad exclaimed dozen more stroke with sweep breeze will fairly have got hold of see how sheet tautens out in bow oar stand by to heave grapnel heard voice say in english close underneath counter next instant came rattle of oar a be laid in upon thwart courtenay too heard word knowing well what meant left sweep sprang aft give way men give way now came up from boat spring sodjers spring take within heaving distance will get away from yet see how witch be gathering way bend back now lift well pulled stroke be sort now travel hang men pull ca ye heave there for'ard see if can reach courtenay be crouching low behind bulwark on watch for grapnel in second came plump in over taffrail before have time to catch anywhere however chum have pounced upon tossing into air just a bowman in boat be bringing strain upon chain instrument dropped

felucca out through northern channel be simply pleasant repetition of morning experience for run of about three mile after found at sea again indeed with still very awkward passage of nine mile to make over extensive shoal before must reach deep water have most disagreeable time of for first half hour for though be under lee of couple of island heavy swell be setting in from seaward white water be round in direction very sharp eye be needed at con equally quick hand at tiller to prevent little craft from beating bottom in on coral after however water gradually deepened about two o'clock to everybody intense relief found once more in open water with sign of frigate indeed of sail of kind anywhere within sight for remainder of day during ensuing night course led to northward westward

shelter with snug anchorage for small craft whilst from fact that be situated well within outer limit of shoal be unapproachable except by vessel of exceedingly light draught be therefore not at surprised to learn from carera that be infested by perfect nest of pirate who in felucca schooner of great speed willow draught of water be wont to sally forth for few day cruise in gulf of florida among bahamas to prey upon shipping bound into out of gulf of mexico returning to depot after successful raid landing booty there so that in event of encountering man of war nothing of incriminating character might be found on board asked carera whether be never afraid that of free easy gentleman might time take into head to overhaul pinta on chance of happening to have on board something worth taking to replied with laugh that have fear whatever of such thing pirate always respected such trader a happened to be engaged in dealing with of fraternity trader having mean of making character known to suspicious looking craft might happen to manifest too curious interest in movement indeed have verification of statement same evening whilst be lying becalmed off cristo cay for noble felucca

seeing there be chance of being boarded dived below routed out small square red flag with black diamond in centre hoisted at end of yard whereupon felucca swerved slightly from course passing close

numerous that whole sea inshore of seemed to be completely covered with single glance sufficed to convince that more suitable spot than for pirate head quarter must well be found for attempt on part of uninitiated to penetrate intricacy of multitudinous cay must inevitably have resulted in failure channel there be none so far a must see rather there be hundred of more hopelessly impracticable than other for there appeared to be only very few foot of water in of have be able to ascend to such elevation a say frigate mast head might indeed have be possible to pick out true channel viewed from low deck of felucca appeared pretty much alike that there be channel however that fairly good one carera assured pointing out at same time island fully mile in length lying about due east west

including bale of silk other valuable stuff cask of wine spirit considerable quantity of handsome silver plate latter alone being worth according to estimation considerably more than carera bag of doubloon rest of cargo to boot good be passed on deck from thence down into hold remainder of own small cargo be loaded into boat away went on shore again when came off second time be nearly sunset

more than drunken frolic that if be received treated a such must doubtless turn out well very earnestly urged upon courtenay desirability of retiring keeping out of sight so long a visitor remained on board thought good enough advice to be acted upon accordingly retreated below forthwith at first sight retreat of ours smacked little will admit of slinking off out of possible harm way after what

proposed to mix tub of grog there then a appropriate finish to must by mean satisfy ruffian who be firm in demand so at length recognising that longer refusal must prove dangerous reluctantly ordered hatch to be lifted cask of rum be hoisted out lowered into boat pirate tumbled in after finally with more profanity mingled with snatch of sea song be bellowed forth at top of voice in style usual with half tipsy men away went for shore followed by smothered imprecation of carera fervent prayer that boat might capsize drown visit have evidently discomposed carera nerve to very considerable

rencontre with frigate have fallen in with on passage up have determined to go to westward returning round cape san antonio instead of by way of cape maysi be horribly disconcerting for to tell truth have to large extent be hoping for depending upon rencontre a mean whereby might effect escape from felucca thought that in event of meeting a have on former occasion afforded such material assistance to felucca crew in evasion of capture so now by little judicious manoeuvring on part might be mean of effecting be severe disappointment to to find that most promising opening have so far be able to think of be going to slip through finger urged upon carera importance of time reiterated a often a dared assumed belief that frigate be by time far enough away from bahama channel be in vain fellow be not to be dissuaded from purpose accordingly on leaving conconil lagoon instead of stretching away before wind straight for barcos channel felucca be headed to westward on larboard tack for manou channel leading from santa clara bay into cardenas bay a course must take over new ground courtenay determined to remain on deck to pick up information likely to be of use to in future went to helm whilst companion busied with sounding line hour run brought to inner end of channel found to be somewhat serpentine in course trending generally in north north west direction with minimum depth of two half fathom run of about twenty minute carried clear of channel found in cardenas bay almost landlocked sheet of water nearly double area of santa clara bay with slightly deeper water though even here navigation be only possible for vessel of very light draught stretching across bay hour later passed through group of small cay after water began to deepen somewhat at two o'clock be passed mola point hauling sharp round found quarter of hour later fairly out at sea clear of danger after thoroughly tired out by long busy day courtenay went below turned in by noon next day rather same day to speak with strict accuracy be off havana be in hope that carera must put in there a seemed at first to have idea of doing for whole thought be now bent on effecting escape from felucca a early a possible considered not improbable that in so important harbour neutral ship might be found on board might succeed in taking refuge with master of might be able to effect arrangement by must be willing to convey to port royal to intense though secret mortification carera at length resolved to keep straight on thus of cherished hope be disappointed found however on inspecting carera well worn chart that route have adopted must take within ten mile of west point jamaica shaving island so closely a that there be just possibility that might be pounced upon by one of own cruiser so that be after not exactly in despair still there be on other hand chance that felucca might scrape clear be just chance that have to provide against attempt to do cost infinite amount of anxious almost fruitless thought be indeed only thing now left to think about by curious combination of fortuitous circumstance have not only tumbled blindfold a be into singular adventure have also be enabled to successfully avoid awakening suspicion of people be so unexpectedly associated with a well a to see way clearly through adventure except to successful ending having carried thing smoothly forward so far did not intend to be beaten at last if there be possibility of avoiding racked brain perpetually on subject separately together numerous enough be scheme evolved ala be so nearly impracticable that only under most exceptionally favourable circumstance must hope to carry through successfully two least impracticable be courtenay proposal to scuttle felucca when within few mile of jamaica trusting to hand

watch on deck into forecastle take possession of felucca endeavour to navigate into port royal by own unaided exertion chief objection to first scheme be difficulty of obtaining tool necessary to effectual performance of scuttling in first place in next still greater difficulty of performing operation undetected a regard own scheme difficulty lay in fact that unless watch must be driven below without alarming portion of crew already in forecastle case be utterly hopeless for must last be disturbed come on deck what must two slender lad even fully armed do against ten stout full grown men might possibly shoot down three four unless rest happened to be cowed by decided be not by mean to be depended upon must then be quickly overpowered by sheer force of number scheme be justly regarded by a being of so exceedingly desperate character only a very last resource must adoption be justifiable nevertheless determined to take such measure a be possible for carrying out of scheme in event of nothing better occurring to meanwhile day succeeded day without slightest opportunity occurring for to initiate courtenay scheme required good sized auger with to bore necessary hole in ship bottom soft wood out of to fashion plug wherewith to plug up hole until proper moment must arrive for withdrawing letting water into hull wood there be difficulty about secured enough for dozen more plug such thing a auger must lay hand upon even went perilous length of inventing pretext for gaining access to carpenter tool chest without success be at length driven to conclusion strange a might seem there be such thing on board felucca to add to chagrin discomfiture be sooner round cape san antonio than discovered that carera quite a acute a ourselves have also foreseen possibility of british cruiser being fallen in with if jamaica be shaved too closely have provided against contingency by laying off course for cartagena must enable to give island wide berth move on worthy skipper part be however able to large extent to frustrate for found that be navigator sailing vessel by dead reckoning only so that by of taking long spell at tiller a be now indeed regular custom be able to edge felucca considerably to windward of course in toward jamaica without carera being wiser in exceedingly unsatisfactory manner time progressed with until sixth morning after abrupt departure from conconil lagoon when a day broke sun rose clearing away light bank of grey cloud on eastern horizon soft delicate purplish hummock like protuberance be seen rising out of sea broad on larboard bow be at once recognised a land so reported to carera courtenay be in berth asleep at moment cry of land ho at once aroused slipping on clothes hurried on deck to see what looked like found carera there staring in utmost perplexity at small grey shape only discernible when felucca rose on crest of sea audibly wondering what on earth must be knew pretty well what be carera kept small stock of chart in after cabin always spread out on cabin table to lay off course distance run so that have have abundant opportunity to refer a often a pleased to particular chart be using on trip have met with difficulty whatever in keeping private dead reckoning of own from be already aware that might expect to make dolphin head highest point of land at extreme westernmost end of jamaica on particular morning report that other land have just become visible about point further to southward judged to be lofty hill behind blewfields bay confirmed in belief that calculation have proved correct carera in perplexity went aloft a far a stumpy mast head thing have never known do before to get clearer view of land bearing of be then taken after skipper accompanied by courtenay descended to cabin to consult chart on reference to there be of course only one conclusion to be arrived at be that land in sight be none other than jamaica now turned out that have never visited island have never indeed sighted from westward before hence difficulty in identifying whilst be three discussing matter down below manuel came to open sky light in great trepidation to report shoal water round ship of course caused to rush straightway on deck again though courtenay knowing that must be just about crossing edge of pedro bank felt apprehension whatever with carera rest of felucca people matter be very different be out of reckoning confused accordingly sudden sight of bright green water about shorter more choppy character of sea whilst only short time before water have be a purely blue a heaven above sea long regular completed discomfiture for minute two disorder reigned supreme on board little craft everybody have opinion to express advice to give everybody be jabbering excitedly at same moment man paid slightest attention to neighbour a hand be by time on deck result may be imagined even helmsman deserted post at last to join in general clamour circumstance of courtenay took immediate advantage by springing to tiller ramming hard down lively little craft at once shot into wind with canvas loudly flapping stilled tumult in moment 'bout ship shouted courtenay a man stopped short in midst of gabbling 'bout ship there be blue water away there to windward of if can once reach be safe men sprang at once like cat to station immense lateen sail be trimmed over on other tack with amount of alacrity showed how intense be relief at finding somebody on board equal to occasion so far be well felucca be now heading about north north east straight for land so that chance of falling in with british cruiser be shade better than before ala cruiser sail of kind be just then in sight for giving way to anxiety in turn shinned aloft to take good look round land be there plainly enough not only two peak already reported second of be now directly ahead also five others ranging from three to five point on weather bow stood on a be going for couple of hour so a to get well to windward of shoal though a matter of fact there be plenty of water over everywhere to have floated even frigate for matter going about again when men have taken breakfast high land be by time well in sight all along larboard beam being certainly not more than forty mile distant circumstance that carera be afraid of shoal determined to keep off be greatly in favour since in order to clear portland rock at north eastern extremity must have to draw even closer still in with island be at first terribly afraid that suspicion must attach to comrade a author of error in course have be steering be agreeably disappointed so far indeed be carera from suspecting anything that confided to at breakfast to have invited that though must not in least account for being so far to windward be most heartily glad of since appeared to have sea to ourselves be still trifle uneasy however at being so near very stronghold head quarter of dreaded british in water when went on deck after breakfast first act be to order hand aloft to mast head to keep bright lookout be just ten o'clock in forenoon man at mast head be in very act of descending rigging man getting ready meanwhile to relieve when uttered excited exclamation at once attracted eye toward look over there captain broad on weather bow do see turtle lying there asleep on water carera sprang on to weather rail steadying with one hand by shroud whilst shielded eye with other peered eagerly to windward rest of watch also dropped whatever happened to be busied with exclaiming turtle turtle unceremoniously ranged alongside skipper said carera after long look in direction indicated see anything of where be there be see exclaimed one of men ah now be gone again settled into trough look bit further out in direction captain there be again madre de dios what monster see yes yes see now answered carera excitedly down with helm man let shoot into wind will have fellow get boat into water smartly now men give watch below call to what purpose interposed let poor fellow finish sleep in peace friend will look after felucca whilst be away in boat to be sure will said courtenay with quiet wink at springing aft to tiller laid hand upon saying to man who held away with jose fine fellow into boat lend hand to secure turtle be not day sailor get chance meanwhile rest of unshipped lee gangway getting boat athwart deck sent stern first overboard with splash be in agony of fear must awake turtle so frustrate scheme have darted into brain courtenay also fancied by knowing wink have bestowed upon when be proposed to go away in boat after creature there be still apparently fast asleep rising falling upon surface of restless water capacious shell glistening brightly a sunbeam flashed upon four men constituting watch stepped a quietly a possible into boat followed by carera took place at oar carera standing up in stern sheet to look out for quarry to direct men how to pull be in perfect fever of anxiety lest flapping of sail bustle on deck must awaken watch below bring out of forecastle to see what be matter seaman seldom pay attention to thing so far at least a to leave bunk in watch below when at boat shoved off paddled gently round felucca quarter courtenay found most unexpectedly in very situation for have so long be ineffectually scheming namely in undisputed possession of little craft deck without wasting single moment in watching progress of boat at once slipped forward gently drawing over slide of fore scuttle slipped hasp over staple stuffed few doubled up rope yarn through latter to keep former in

be to do without food water well said to tell truth never thought about that be true be only forty mile from land with fine weather prospect of lasting suppose ought not to leave without mouthful of bread drop of water just jog felucca gently along taking care that boat be not allowed to come alongside again will see what can do wonder how be getting on in matter of turtle jumped on rail in wake of rigging looked out to windward apparently be too much engrossed with chase to take notice of for must see paddling warily along evidently purposing to get to windward of sleeping prey then drift with wind noiselessly down upon carera be still standing up in stern sheet peering eagerly over boat larboard bow men be intently looking over right shoulder presently saw lay oar cautiously inboard then hand ranged along larboard side of boat careening almost gunwale to a stretched arm over side then followed short pause of evidently breathless suspense succeeded by simultaneous grab in instant

oarsman must pull through water be not more than mile astern told courtenay what have done what proposed to do whilst passed couple of rope end through handle of tub in readiness to launch overboard at proper moment companion wore felucca round stood back toward boat seeing returning directly toward men laid upon oar possibly imagining that be about to pick up straight a line for ran until be only about cable length distant when courtenay sprang luff darted away considerably to windward of upon took to oar once more began to force boat heavily ahead against sea seeing that have ample time to launch tub now signed courtenay to shoot felucca into wind when waiting until have lost way very cleverly launched tub keg over side without causing former to ship so much a drop of water then filled away once more occupant of boat by time thoroughly mystified paddled quietly up to floating tub transferred content to boat meanwhile in felucca having stood on to sufficient distance once more wore round again made for boat luffing shaking wind out of sail when within hailing distance of then whilst courtenay narrowly watched boat held ready to fill on felucca again in good time to avoid being boarded sprang into lee rigging hailed boat ahoy be sorry to take felucca from circumstance have now time to explain oblige to do so be going to take to port royal yonder be land not more than forty mile away weather be fine settled so will have difficulty in reaching shore by time to morrow when land make at once for port royal will arrange on reaching there will be properly cared for until such time a pinta can be restored to will find provision in tub fresh water in keg have dropped overboard now adieu wish pleasant passage carera comrade seemed to take in meaning even before have finished speaking for with whole torrent of sonorous spanish malediction once more dashed oar into water made for felucca courtenay promptly kept away filled sail slid foaming past boat at

down accordingly went forward without opening scuttle shouted to that felucca have be surprised captured by british in sense be quite true unless wished to be treated a pirate best thing must do must be to remain perfectly quiet give trouble that vessel be being taken into port royal that on arrival there must make business to see proper authority so explain matter to that worst thing likely to befall felucca crew must be temporary detention only be very likely that communication puzzled considerably if so also have effect of keeping quiet for never heard sound from indeed have tried to give trouble be probable must have mastered before must have gained deck for first act after quieting be to arm with whole beltful of loaded pistol best of sword in felucca armoury after pitched whole of

board to breakfast with condescension of course merely meant that be curious to hear full particular of capture nevertheless felt much gratified at invitation detaining gig alongside only long enough to enable to make ourselves presentable jumped into five minute later found on quarter deck of old mar admiral j happened to be on deck at moment when stepped in through entering port look of mingled astonishment anger with regarded a presented before at once told that something be wrong how now young gentleman testily exclaimed be two midshipman who sent note informing that have captured yonder

be regarded a in slightest degree inappropriate explained in a few word a possible that be two of surviving officer of hermione that have be for time prisoner in la guayra that have only very recently effected escape therefrom that put whole affair straight in moment admiral who peppery a be temper be thoroughly kind hearted old fellow in main actually condescending to apologise for hasty speech steward at moment announcing that breakfast be on table be to say admiral captain bradshaw courtenay trundled into cabin took place at table then for first time a found once more in society of own

passed through since have last found ourselves so placed for part revulsion of feeling almost overcame emotion of midshipman be however proverbially of very transient character soon found prosecuting most vigorous attack upon comestible between mouthful relating in pretty full detail adventure from moment of mutiny excepting of course love passage with dona inez kept strictly to myself story of mutiny naturally excited very lively interest courtenay be questioned cross questioned upon subject until be absolutely pumped dry transpiring that be first survivor of dreadful tragedy who have

of apprehension a to safety appeared that juan whose arrival at cove have be delayed about hour by suspicious manoeuvre of felucca ahead of undoubtedly pinta have hung about spot for something like hour half at expiration of time two spaniard have presented on beach have inquired whether belonged to pinta on saying that did not have be very sharply cross questioned a to who be reason for presence there at hour cross questioning be sensible enough to evade cut short by retreating to felucca returning to la guayra from whence first thing next morning made way to castle to report to seek further instruction having actually witnessed departure knowing from time at have occurred that must have made way on board wrong felucca juan be subsequently able to say with almost absolute certainty must have be pinta lady love be painfully anxious a to fate for appeared that pinta crew bore somewhat evil reputation among who professed to know best at la guayra only hope consolation dona inez must find lay in somewhat too favourable estimate of ability to take care of most earnestly entreated must not lose moment after receipt of letter in writing to set mind at rest added that father have returned home in excellent health that though have at first betrayed vexation at loss of service have soon cooled down have then acknowledged that be glad for sake that have succeeded in effecting escape having read re read most cherished epistle dozen time over refolded put carefully into pocket next turning to letter from father arranged opened according to date of postmark first of letter being third written by father since date of leaving england have received other two on occasion of former visit to port royal in hermione be very similar to others have ever reached from same

epistle time went on to hint mysteriously at cause have brought lamentable state of affair about so obscurely be letter worded that on first perusal only information must definitely gather from be that father be then suffering from effect of many year of mental anguish resulting from matter if understood aright seemed to be in way connected with poor dead mother letter concluded with extraordinary word lionel shadow of deception falsehood rest upon from fault of ours yours distractedly cuthbert lascelles shadow of deception falsehood fault of ours yours distractedly must mean closing word of letter yours distractedly puzzled most of hitherto father communication to however lacking in affection might otherwise have be have terminated with orthodox affectionate father why then departure from rule be intentional be merely to be regarded a indication of terribly disturbed state of writer mind read re read most singular epistle at least dozen time without gathering additional light upon obscure mysterious hint contained then turned to remaining letter thinking might possibly find in solution to enigma at first reading imagined did find conclusion at arrived being that poor unfortunate father must have gone mad patiently went through whole packet second time seeking in additional evidence of insanity saving on one particular matter writer have evidently be in full possession of faculty fourth letter contained information that news of mutiny on board hermione have reached england that be believed of officer have escaped massacre have be landed at la

taken a proof of dissimulation circumstance must only appear suspicious until opportunity for explanation have passed away for ever unhappiness of have gained inkling during nursery day that be

conclusion at last then with considerably lighter heart began finished letter to inez in mingled with usual lover like protestation gave full detail of adventure from parting moment on beach to arrival in port royal harbour further told that found at moment possessed of tidy little sum in prize money that inspired by love for have resolved to fight way to top of ladder with utmost possible expedition with great deal more of same sort must doubt appear most arrant nonsense to dear reader so will not inflict upon two important task completed felt very much more easy in mind be able to sit down to dinner be shortly afterwards served with tolerable appetite whilst be engaged in discussing meal courtenay came in informed that have accepted invitation for to spend week with mr thomson admiral also own agent at country house fifteen mile off in heart of blue mountain range that a have be unable to find in time for to go out there that evening host have promised to send in couple of saddle horse negro guide for accommodation next morning that must find awaiting at mr thomson store at nine o'clock be good news for though have pulled pretty well together after shock occasioned by perusal of father letter felt that little change amusement must be most acceptable under circumstance on following morning punctual to moment presented at rendezvous where found a have be promised couple of excellent saddle horse awaiting in charge of grinning happy looking negro groom who be mounted on stout mule guide who informed that name be pompey promptly took charge of valise slung one on side of own saddle then mounted without loss of time got under weigh for destination first six seven mile of journey be uninteresting enough when plunged into mountain road found ourselves environed on side by thick growth of luxuriant tropical vegetation foliage flower of bore more than hue of rainbow whilst gorgeous butterfly gaudy insect bird of most brilliant plumage flitted hither thither about with occasional opening in dense growth revealing most enchanting little view of distant harbour sea perchance passing glimpse of quiet vale with cane field boiling house residential building journey became enjoyable one indeed reached destination extensive somewhat straggling one storied building with large lofty room shrouded in semi darkness by jalousie venetian shutter be used to carefully exclude ray of sunlight about noon received most cordial hearty welcome from host most hospitable scotchman family here not to unnecessarily spin out yarn spent one of most pleasant enjoyable week have up to time passed family in addition to host charming wife consisted of son three daughter who did everything be possible to make visit pleasant be musical family throughout so that what with shooting riding visiting somewhat distant neighbour receiving visit in return when singing dancing became order of evening short holiday passed too quickly most excellent people be first a be warmest friend ever made in island when late in afternoon of eighth day of visit courtenay with pompey again for pilot mounted to return to kingston received very warm evidently sincere invitation from whole family to make house home whenever opportunity must afford slept at hotel that night bright early next morning made way to port royal where almost first object met view be new ship foam at anchor close under stern of flag ship with hand on board busy bending new suit of canvas directing boatman to run alongside minute two later saw on deck shaking hand with mr neil

of unpleasantness with during short eventful period served under have be thoughtful enough to bring chest along with in boat so that must join at once if need be be accordingly hoisted up over side boatman dismissed after at o'flaherty invitation descended to cabin to cement new friendship over glass of wine to have chat about cruise upon be about to enter leaving boatswain to superintend operation on deck admiral seemed have only given new skipper very general set of instruction leaving to arrange detail a to armament manning of schooner after conference with a be supposed to be person best posted on question of requirement whole of morning be devoted to full particular recital on part of everything have transpired from moment of boarding pinta until of leaving after formed into committee to discus outfit of craft now learned somewhat to chagrin that carera boat crew having duly turned up at port royal have made such representation to admiral a have induced that distinguished officer to release felucca forthwith upon understanding that be to return at once to la guayra be not to attempt to communicate directly indirectly with merlani of other pirate gang on cuban coast be proposed that must attack of course be very well must do harm if rascal only adhered to agreement of confess felt somewhat doubtful mischief however if mischief there be be done be therefore use to worry about saw that must need even greater circumspection than ever in carrying out of difficult enterprise for heaven know necessity ought never to have be created palaver over adjourned to deck from thence into gig have be ordered alongside to convey on shore to dockyard took advantage of opportunity to make thorough inspection of outward appearance of craft be to be future

for privateering purpose carrying capacity being very small whilst effort seemed to have be spared to render exceedingly fast stiff under canvas be very strongly built of oak with massive timber copper fastened throughout heavily coppered up to bend so that a far a hull be concerned there be not much beyond size to find fault with in matter of spar rigging heathen dockyard rigger have completely ruined a o'flaherty admitted almost with tear in eye lower mast have be left in intact untouched a have be when first fell into hand two handsomer stick never saw in place of tall slim

have so narrowly escaped captain fanshawe at once waxed eloquent upon unparalleled audacity effrontery of cuban pirate urgent necessity for prompt suppression instancing escape of pinta a case in point son too a one of actual participators in pursuit have great deal to say upon subject seemed somewhat disposed to draw long bow when narrating own share of exploit tendency thought only kind to nip in bud by giving version of affair father son at first appeared to be considerably nettled when found that be to owed discomfiture better sense speedily prevailed joined a heartily a rest in laugh against on parting at gangway night however a prepared to leave for respective vessel young fanshawe laughingly remarked a gave hand cordial farewell grip have laugh on side at present lascelles warn

favourable opportunity done hoped to have hooker once more at best nothing of importance occurred until arrived off cristo cay when time being about three bell in forenoon watch larger island bearing about two mile on larboard bow couple of mile distant o'flaherty brought chart on deck spreading out on companion slide beckoned to look here lascelles said making mark on chart with pencil point there be where be that pointing away over larboard bow be cristo cay now whereabouts be channel that saw that big felucca going into be further on to westward can not see from here why do ask inquired because bhoy intind to take look in there see what there be to be seen replied if will excuse saying so think have better not said in opinion must be wiser to meddle with other place a little a possible until have beaten up merlani quarter from that must learn from carera gang be far away most formidable along coast seems to that must be only prudent on part to create a little alarm a

saw going in there asked nearly quite two hundred ton said be eighty said where must float can by mean interrupted believe drew inch more than eight foot whilst draw nine extra foot of water let tell mr o'flaherty make difference in willow inlet say more be answer in go even if never come out again that thought be scarcely resolution to wise commander must have come after such expression must of course only hold peace did so until few minute later when opened entrance to channel pointed out to then will clear for action send crew to quarter av ye plaise mr lascelles said o'flaherty done hauled wind reached in for narrow opening be foolhardy undertaking to mind must do o'flaherty justice to say that having entered upon neglected precaution to ensure success thus first act after mustering of crew be to furl square canvas to facilitate working of schooner after requested courtenay to go aloft to topgallant yard to search out from elevation deepest water to con ship accordingly on entering channel be discovered to be very narrow so much so indeed at one point there be not width enough to work ship be only by mean of very smartly executed half board under courtenay direction from aloft that avoided plumping schooner ashore on projecting spit water too be so willow that on looking over taffrail be seen to be quite thick clouded with sand stirred up by vessel keel whilst so close aboard of be land on hand that couple of battery of say four twenty four pounder one on side of channel must have inevitably blown out of water most fortunately for have not occurred to frequenter of place to plant battery at spot so passed in unmolested channel be about mile in length on emerging from found in landlocked lagoon about four half mile wide at broadest part so long that extremity must be accurately defined even from elevated perch occupied by courtenay sign whatever of anything like settlement must be anywhere seen from deck courtenay hailed to effect that must see something like vessel mast head over middle island of group of three on starboard beam further reported on question being put to that water be very shoal round ship that there be indication of something like channel to southward eastward upon sail be shortened to lessen schooner speed through water head be put in direction indicated course be held for about two mile when by courtenay

enough misther lascelles to have gun loaded wid couple ov round shot charge ov grape on top ov thim said o'flaherty rubbing hand gleefully be in act of issuing necessary order when courtenay hurriedly

hastily reload piece now men now be time to rake fire exclaimed o'flaherty broadside of three six pounder rang sharply out followed by crashing rending sound of timber a shot entered through felucca starboard bow hideous outburst of shriek groan yell shout of defiance a grape tore obliquely along deck almost fore aft in moment still flying up into wind felucca crashed into starboard quarter with shock made heel to covering board caused antagonist to rebound full fathom from then a schooner recovered rolled heavily to windward felucca poured in broadside whilst sharp ring of brass piece mingled with crash of timber be vibrating in ear felt sharp stunning blow on head momentarily rendered unconscious hurrah sir be afloat be afloat be first sound heard a scattered sens came back to clearing away with pocket handkerchief blood be streaming down into eye blinding found that have be knocked up against mainmast to one of belaying pin in spider hoop of be clinging with one hand further observed that shock of collision coupled doubt with action of square canvas have be laid aback have caused schooner to back off shoal on have grounded that now have stern way upon hasty glance round deck showed that bulwark deck fitting have be considerably damaged by felucca fire eight nine prostrate form o'flaherty among bore still further witness to destructive effect boatswain came up to said poor mr o'flaherty down sir be hurt who be to take command of schooner sir will said rallying at once a sense of responsible position in thus suddenly found rushed upon boatswain touched forelock remarked have got starn way upon sir if look out will drive over that there stream of ours perhaps send fluke through bottom yes said have goodness mr fidd to muster hand aft here let tail on to hawser rouse smartly inboard then man capstan lift anchor ay ay sir be reply man turned away to see order executed at moment courtenay came aft why lascelles old man exclaimed starting back a turned face toward have rascal done to be awful sight old fellow be hurt much can scarcely say yet replied not very much think head be aching most consumedly wish must kindly get couple of hand have mr o'flaherty taken below must remain here look after ship be o'flaherty wounded gasped courtenay pointed to prostrate body of lieutenant upon chum at once hurried away raising wounded man in arm called one of men to help in conveying below be lucky enough to trip recover anchor without accident quarter boat be hoisted up then wore round after felucca be hovering irresolutely about mile away apparently undecided whether to renew attack not on seeing however that be afloat again after bore up stood to eastward close hauled on larboard tack cracked on after under stitch of canvas must spread walked away from hand over hand at same time looking up couple of point nearer wind than did so that soon became evident might a well hope to catch flying dutchman a to get alongside chase in midst of plumped ashore again time with such violence that fore main topmast snapped short off at cap like carrot hung dangling by gear to leeward be now in very tidy mess have late antagonist chosen to retrace step renew attack upon must in disabled condition have found exceedingly awkward customer to tackle fortunately for seemed to have have a much a wanted quarter of hour later slid out through one of numerous channel between island disappeared setting one watch to clear away wreck other to furl canvas requested courtenay who be now again on deck to take quarter boat sounding line to go away in search of deepest water be found at about fifty fathom distant from directly to windward of ship in direction accordingly ran away stream anchor cable a before cable time however being led in through one of chock on larboard bow from whence be taken to capstan men hove hove until everything creaked again whilst schooner careened fully couple of streak to port be to purpose not inch must budge finally anchor began to come home pretty rapidly stream be evidently of use so sent away boat to weigh giving order at same time to get larboard bower ready for slinging between quarter boat launch also ordered to be hoisted out presently quarter boat came alongside with stream anchor hanging over stern then reason for coming home became evident have hove upon until one of fluke have be torn off by time that stream anchor be out of boat bower be hanging at bow ready for slinging be then run away by two boat directly to windward a soon a be let go began to heave away once more with better result schooner be hard fast effort of ours be equal to moving of now found ourselves in very pretty pickle to add to annoyance made discovery that have grounded just about high water that tide such a be be taking off be to say high tide must be trifle lower than preceding one until neap be reached passed there be nothing for then to lighten ship getting remaining boat into water three be brought alongside iron ballast be then hoisted out of hold lowered into boat until be a deeply loaded a must be with safety even in perfectly smooth water lightened schooner so considerably that felt sanguine of getting afloat when tide next rose not to neglect mean at disposal to secure very desirable end ordered spare spar to be launched overboard with empty cask quantity of lumber from hold raft be constructed capable of supporting three of gun though sank so deep that be at first afraid must lose altogether must then do more until be again high water must not be until hour past midnight unless sent boat ashore to discharge cargo on beach then come alongside again to further lighten ship be very loath to do a felt convinced that process of handling re handling heavy pig of ballast must consume so much time that must lose rather than gain by to say nothing of exhausting labour must thus devolve upon men leaving courtenay therefore who be uninjured in charge of deck retired to cabin be at moment serving for cockpit finding surgeon disengaged submitted to tender mercy first act be to bathe head with warm water until dry blood with hair be matted be cleared away a much a possible then hair be shorn away until wound be fairly exposed injury be then found to consist of scalp wound six inch in length extending from point above right eye just where hair commenced obliquely across skull toward back of left ear scalp for width of about four inch being torn from skull folded back like rag burned throbbed smarted most horribly particularly when sponge be applied to bare skull to clear away blood preparatory to replacing scalp be informed by medico that be very ugly wound probably inflicted by piece of langridge if have be deflected couple of inch to right must in probability have killed be warned that must have to exercise greatest caution in matter of exposing to night air inflammation might set in with very serious result during tedious exceedingly painful operation of dressing wound learned that o'flaherty injury consisted of contusion on head whereby have be struck senseless to deck very badly lacerated right shoulder bone of be also broken so that must probably be quite unfit for duty for remainder of cruise when at length be fairly coopered up made tolerably comfortable sent word to courtenay intended to lie down for while that be to have called moment that presence on deck might be necessary then retired to berth stretched dressed a be upon bed where though be in too much pain to get sound sleep soon dozed off into kind of half delirious stupor unpleasant a be sensation still afforded certain measure of relief from be aroused by clatter of plate dish in cabin a be quite dark in berth rightly assumed must indicate forwarding of preparation for dinner now felt very much more comfortable than when have lain down violent splitting headache have almost entirely passed away cool soothing salve have be liberally applied to wound have greatly modified burning smarting sensation experienced feeling of by mean unpleasant languor produced almost irresistible repugnance to move remembered however that ship be now in charge unpleasant a might be must now le than ever afford to neglect duty so though effort produced sudden giddiness momentary lapse into almost total insensibility staggered to foot cautiously groped way to door of berth through passed into close stuffy cabin from thence up companion way out on deck here everything be so perfectly silent save for gentle lap gurgle of water alongside be for moment startled into belief that ship have be deserted be so intensely dark must see absolutely nothing glancing aft however detected tiny glowing spark away in neighbourhood of taffrail at same moment heard courtenay voice saying be that mr o'flaherty responded be lascelles what have become of hand courtenay be below getting supper answered told that when have finished might turn in for hour two must be pretty well done up with hard day work can hing more now until after flood how be feeling now old fellow sanderson tell got very ugly clip over head to day in little boxing match with felucca have be rather unfortunate business altogether two killed seven wounded at single broadside from only four gun be pretty hard line do mean to say that have lost two men exclaimed for have not heard before yes be answer jones comical fellow who used to play violin on forecastle during dog watch poor tom cotterel have lost number of mess there be five more in hammock hurt more le severely though believe o'flaherty be worst sufferer in respect be greatly concerned to hear more than ever regretted fool hardihood a must not help thinking have induced o'flaherty to rush headlong a be into lagoon so willow that there be scarcely water enough in in deepest part to float schooner abounding moreover a have found to cost in shoal of position of knew absolutely nothing mischief however have be done nothing now remained to make best of with reflection made way below to dinner in obedience to steward summons a entered cabin sanderson surgeon emerged on tiptoe from o'flaherty state room requested in whisper to make a little noise a possible a lieutenant under influence of soothing draught have just dropped off to sleep want to keep a quiet a possible continued sanderson for if be disturbed excited be afraid will have deal of trouble with what be principally afraid of in case a in yours lascelles be access of fever with resulting restlessness may retard healing of wound even bring on mortification what about others asked be of injury severe chiefly laceration painful enough not serious be reply rascal must have fired nothing langridge canister ay said courtenay have fired little earlier so allowed charge to scatter more must have made clean sweep of deck a be charge took effect almost like solid shot a may be seen by mark in planking bulwark where struck ah well be good job be worse remarked sanderson have have one good result in have let of wild irish blood out of o'flaherty have taught lesson let hope to be trifle more cautious in future by by in meantime whilst be on beam end of youngster be going to be skipper oh lascelles of course answered courtenay quickly joined service together know be few month senior in point of age moreover be ever so much better navigator of two indeed be ashamed to say be so shaky in navigation must really be almost afraid to take sole charge of ship might manage right be not absolutely sure of myself be awfully unpleasant feeling to have let tell when be occupying position of responsibility land breeze meanwhile have sprung up be by time blowing pretty strongly so a be trifle anxious about raft with gun alongside hurried meal to conclusion whilst sanderson first took peep at o'flaherty then went forward to look after rest of patient courtenay went on deck where found gunner keeping lookout well mr tompion said a man approached how be matter looking here on deck quiet sir be reply leastways a far a one can be sartain on sich pitch dark night a be lightnin ' little away down there to west'ard durin ' one o ' flash sartaintly did think see objek movin away over there in direction where felucca came from when next flash took place there be sign of anything oh indeed said what did object look like well sir might have ' be boat raft might only have ' be trunk of tree struck adrift if have be tree think a must have wanished quite so quick how long ago be mr tompion just minute two afore came on deck sir well said must keep sharp lookout be can do at present be there anybody on lookout on forecastle yes sir jack sinclair bob mile thank will do mr tompion said man turned away to former post at gangway whatever mysterious object might have be be invisible on occurrence not only of next also of several succeeding flash of bluish summer lightning quivered up from behind heavy bank of cloud low down on western horizon momentarily lighting up with weird evanescent radiance lagoon mainland distant island toward suspicious glance be directed ship partially dismantled a be looked in faint momentary illumination like ghost of ancient wreck hovering over scene of dissolution incident be therefore soon forgotten a courtenay took round from point to point explaining what further step have taken after retirement below in afternoon to facilitate floating of ship tide be now again making at length about two bell in first watch became conscious that schooner have be lying somewhat over on port bilge be gradually becoming more upright meanwhile lightning have ceased darkness have become if possible more profound than ever whilst only sound audible be rippling splash of water alongside melancholy sough of wind faint chirr of insect ashore breeze brought off to on invisible wing a tide made so schooner continued imperceptibly to right at length be so nearly upright that thought might set about attempt to get afloat wind being now off shore be in favour a deepest water be to leeward to seaward of canvas have dared to set must have materially assisted did not care to set a once off bank must have perforce to remain at anchor where be until morning attempt at navigating willow in darkness being most utter madness therefore left canvas stowed resolving to seek aid only a last resort in event of other mean failing ordered messenger to be passed capstan manned anchor be already laid out to leeward so slack of cable be soon hove in steady strain brought to bear upon after came tug of war capstan bar be now fully manned tar pressed broad chest against powerful lever planted foot firmly upon deck straightened out back slowly pawl after pawl be gained until schooner be once more heeling over on bilge time however in consequence of intense strain upon cable be sort hearties exclaimed boatswain encouragingly a applied tremendous strength to outer extremity of one of bar heave with will heave must come heave of now one two three men strained at bar until seemed a though must burst very sinew reluctant click two of pawl showed that something be at length yielding then first with slow jerky motion quickened rapidly ended in mighty surge a men drove capstan irresistibly round bow of schooner swerved to seaward vessel righted hung for moment then glided off tail of bank finally swinging to anchor afloat once more well done lad exclaimed joyously for be great relief to to have schooner afloat again sailor feel just a much out of element in stranded ship a doe when personally be on terra firma in exuberance of gratification gave order to splice main brace preparatory to troublesome laborious task of getting gun ballast on board once more chapter sixteen pirate attempt night attack upon foam men be busily discussing nip of grog when mechanically glancing over black surface of water lay out on side of ship gaze be arrested by sudden phosphorescent flash on starboard beam be now turned in direction of island have be watching so suspiciously earlier on in night looking intently caught again yet again three four time gunner at moment approached to report that men be ready to turn to once more upon directed attention to point at have noticed mysterious appearance asked if must see anything shading eye with hand looked earnestly in direction indicated n o sir ca say a can replied after good long look see sir be so precious dark just now that there be eh what be thought seed something just then sir a flash appeared time sensibly nearer ship than before so did replied be belief tompion that what saw be neither more le than phosphorescent flash of oar in water if be not mistaken there be boat out there trying to steal down catch unawares just go to men please pas word for to go quietly to quarter see that starboard broadside gun be loaded with grape courtenay just then emerged from companion with lighted cigar in mouth have helped to in brief interval of rest following floating of schooner spark at end of weed glowed brightly in intense darkness must probably be seen for considerable distance dowse cigar courtenay quick exclaimed a moved to side tell if can hear see anything over there instinctively guessing at alarm of kind from quarter have indicated shipmate stepped to opposite side of deck dropped cigar over rail rejoined now then what be lascelles asked be there anything wrong why be men mustering at quarter look over in direction see if can find explanation said unconsciously imitating tompion in attitude assumed courtenay stood intently gazing into darkness for full minute more without result have turned to be about to speak when faint crack like breaking of thole pin be heard sound being accompanied by very distinct luminous splash of water have exclaimed courtenay there be boat over there at great distance from at same moment fidd came barefooted noiselessly to side with question did ye see hear that sir ay ay mr fidd saw be starboard gun loaded yes sir then kindly pas along word to captain of gun to watch for next splash then to train gun upon ay ay sir be reply fidd turned away to execute mission a sprang upon rail grasping one of shroud of main rigging to steady hailed in spanish boat ahoy who be what do want lay on oar answer instantly will fire upon waited full minute without eliciting response sign of description from direction in enemy be supposed to be lurking then ordered port fire to be burnt musket to be fired in direction brief interval elapsed then darkness be suddenly broken into by ghastly glare of port fire with one of men nimbly shinned up fore rigging in order to send illumination a far abroad a possible at same instant musket be fired for moment two nothing be to be seen own deck with men standing stripped to waist at gun row of statue marble half ebony a glare lighted up one side of figure left other side in blackest shadow spar rigging towering weird ghostly up into opaque blackness above like of phantom ship whilst water shimmered like burning brimstone under baleful light then evidently under impression that boat have become visible in gleam of port fire though at instant must see nothing voice be heard from out darkness on starboard beam exclaiming in spanish give way with will hero one smart dash now will be alongside yet before can load gun dash of oar in water instantly followed whereabouts of boat being at once made manifest by flash of port fire upon wet oar blade upon foaming ripple gathered under bow of boat by time dozen stroke have be pulled boat very large craft apparently crowded with men became dimly visible like faint luminous mist driving along surface of inky water steady now men cried take time aim straight say when be ready ready with midship gun ready aft ready for'ard reply be uttered almost simultaneously instantly gave word fire three gun rang out a one triple flash not only illuminating vividly for fraction of second boat against be discharged also revealing for same brief space of time second similar boat few yard in rear of first fatally sped three terrible charge of grape gun have be aimed with such deadly precision discharged so exactly at right moment that leading boat be literally torn to piece so utterly destroyed indeed that seemed to have vanished instantly from surface of lagoon leaving in stead only few fragment of shattered planking broad patch of phosphorescent foam in midst of floated late crew ghastly array of corps save where here there wretch le fortunate than comrade still writhed splashed feebly a life reluctantly left torn mutilated body spectacle of catastrophe so suddenly completely wrought instant destruction of thirty forty human being be absolutely appalling effect be intensified by extraordinary circumstance that not single shriek groan outcry of description escaped victim of murderous fire so dreadful be sight for perhaps minute entire crew of schooner fore aft stood motionless dumb petrified with horror staring with dilated eyeball at spot where body now motionless lay faintly defined in last ray of almost burnt out port fire there be time to be lost boat be lurking out there somewhere in impenetrable gloom so rallying faculty by powerful effort managed to exclaim in tolerably steady voice load again men smartly there be boat out there somewhere must be prevented from coming alongside at cost light port fire forward there a man in fore rigging dropped fag end of first into water alongside blackness of darkness once more enshrouded a with pall there be apparently to be no more fighting just then however crew of remaining boat have evidently seen enough to completely damp ardour for time being at least for before operation of reloading gun have be completed splash roll of oar in rowlock must be heard in fast diminishing cadence conveying to experienced ear fact that enemy be beating precipitate retreat horror of night be not yet quite over for whilst be busily preparing to hoist in gun from raft alongside to get ballast back into proper place in hold loud confused splashing sound be suddenly heard away on starboard beam on looking in direction to ascertain what new disturbance might portend saw that water be literally alive with hundred of shark distinctly visible by phosphorescent glow shone from body be tearing snapping at floating corps of pirate rending limb from limb rushing off in direction with dismembered fragment a monster succeeded in securing sight be not calculated to inspire men with relish for somewhat perilous task of going down upon submerged raft into deeply laden boat to sling gun ballast work have to be done boatswain gunner volunteering to go down first soon have work well under weigh finishing satisfactorily off bringing toilsome night of labour to end about two o'clock next morning by daybreak hand be once more astir notwithstanding arduous character of previous day night work anchor be weighed under short canvas with courtenay once more on topgallant yard to con lead man in fore chain on side of ship cautiously felt way to northward westward until about seven bell managed to reach anchorage felucca have vacated on previous day hurried breakfast be then scrambled through after long boat gig under command of courtenay boatswain with crew fully armed pulled away for shore to see whether must discover anything like depot of sign must be detected from deck of schooner pulled inshore about quarter of mile after suddenly lost sight of among mangrove thickly fringed shore of island three four minute later sound of musketry firing at first in whole volley then intermittingly floated off to from direction where boat have disappeared very soon saw light wreath of pale blue smoke floating up out from among tree firing soon ceased then nothing more be heard seen for nearly two hour at end of time thin volume of light brownish smoke rose into sky from about spot where have before seen indication of musketry firing smoke rapidly increasing in volume deepening in colour until thickly besprinkled with spark poured across bay in one vast dense black cloud swept right over where lay half suffocating with pungent fume almost hiding island from sight then when smoke cloud have become almost intolerable boat be seen approaching upon schooner be hove short canvas set in readiness for speedy retreat from uncomfortable berth moment that came alongside anchor be tripped by time that boat crew be once more on schooner deck have run out clear of nuisance foam be then hove to seven singularly heavy keg be hoisted in from long boat boat next followed then away went groping way a before back toward main channel from sea channel be successfully traversed open sea reached about three bell in afternoon watch when turned over command of schooner to courtenay went below to berth not only dead tired also suffering dreadfully from wound in head have not be dressed for nearly twenty four hour be certainly none better for excitement exposure of preceding night previous to though have be fully informed of what have transpired on shore may be related in very few word appeared that sudden evanishment of boat from sight be due to fact that have discovered pushed into narrow channel running to northward eastward between two westernmost island of group along channel have proceeded for about mile when suddenly opened tiny bay on starboard hand from shore of projected long wooden jetty of rough mangrove pile decked over with ship timber jetty at once headed for be immediately saluted with volley of musketry from long black wooden building stood close to shore luckily nobody be hit same good fortune befell when whilst landing on jetty second volley be fired at tar headed by courtenay boatswain then charged up to building without very much difficulty burst in door just in time to see twenty spaniard effecting hasty retreat through opening in opposite side of building lad at once crowded sail in chase shouting laughing like parcel of schoolboy out for holiday occasionally stopping to pop away at enemy with musket pistol a opportunity offered spaniard however be lighter in heel than own men possessed further advantage of knowing country so quickly hauled out of sight be anything further seen of though courtenay maintained pursuit for about hour party then returned to shed by beach whilst courtenay with three four hand gave place thorough overhaul fidd with remainder of men turned to broke up very large yawl built boat be lying alongside jetty afterwards carrying dismembered planking timber up to shed to be still more effectually destroyed with by fire quantity of ship store such a rope canvas pitch tar paint etcetera be found evidently showing that be one of many pirate rendezvous be known to be in existence along coast there be nothing in shape of plunder except seven heavy keg before mentioned one of upon being opened proved to be filled with spanish dollar a did rest eventually so be promptly tumbled down to jetty put on board long boat have evidently be place of little importance from courtenay account be not to be compared for moment with merlani establishment at last place having be thoroughly rummaged bonfire be built on weather side of shed being well fed with tar etcetera soon set entire building in blaze after retreated to boat firing jetty also before shoving off altogether be very satisfactory morning work since with limited facility must be long time before pirate must make good loss damage inflicted upon if indeed must have heart to attempt at barcos channel being only five hour sail distant from cristo cay near have emerged once more into open water a must be quite impossible for to traverse intricate channel through santa clara bay during hour of darkness courtenay stretched off land under easy canvas employed remainder of afternoon in getting up two topmast carpenter have reduced in place of spar expended on previous day job be completed schooner made ataunto again by sunset at hour foam be hove to with head toward land hand with exception of officer of watch two men on lookout be allowed to go below get a much rest a possible in order that might not only recover from fatigue of previous night also prepare for what must probably prove equally fatiguing day on morrow on sitting down to dinner table that evening be much gratified to learn from sanderson that poor o'flaherty be doing remarkably well so well indeed that doctor have yielded somewhat unwilling assent to wish lieutenant have expressed to see after dinner be strictly enjoined to make interview a brief a possible to be cautious above thing not to engage in conversation of exciting character accordingly a soon a dinner be over knocked at door of o'flaherty state room in response to feebly spoken come in entered notwithstanding what sanderson have previously told about appearance be shocked to see how terribly loss of blood torture of wound have pulled poor fellow down swarthy sunburnt feature be now sallow bloodless shrunken contrasting strongly with dark curly hair hung in long elf lock over forehead about face dripping with perspiration caused partly by excessive heat of cabin still more by anguish from be suffering sheet be only covering body being bare from chest upwards for greater convenience in dressing wound right shoulder arm down to elbow be closely swathed in bandage through blood still oozed here there there be restless feverish gleam glitter in eye told too plainly how acutely be suffering there be occasional nervous twitching of finger of right hand did not like to see said have come on within last half hour spirit be excellent voice became stronger almost with word spoke a questioned about doings since moment of being struck down expressed a highly satisfied with that have done especially so at watchfulness have defeated pirate attempt at night attack intimated expectation that although be unable to actually command schooner must keep fully acquainted with everything might transpire consult with regard to proposed movement of important character at time thought reasonable enough soon have cause to regret that have imposed such condition upon daybreak next morning found eight mile off mouth of barcos channel in such position that must be dead to windward of upon springing up of sea breeze be consequently a well placed for run down to a heart must wish on boatswain calling have remained in berth night be greatly annoyed to learn that there be small craft of kind apparently one masted felucca hovering about entrance of channel manoeuvring in such way a to lead to belief that be enacting part of lookout courtenay have be called at same time be quicker of two in movement upon reaching deck discovered on topsail yard scrutinising stranger through telescope craft be then becalmed though have nice little breeze from about east north east on filling upon schooner edging away in direction felucca for such be at once rigged out six sweep of side headed direct for mouth of channel now be afraid indicated first that felucca be enacting part of lookout second that late antagonist have effected retreat to conconil lagoon where have probably united temporarily with merlani gang anticipated that if surmise of mine must prove correct must have hand more than full in forthcoming attack so heavy indeed must be odds against in case thought must be more prudent to defer attack for day two merely passing through channel affecting to make examination of cay on side of previous to retiring again pursuing course to westward thus throwing adversary off guard when considered might be possible to effect descent upon by way of cardenas bay through might perhaps be able to so nearly approach unobserved a to take in great measure by surprise plan however in consequence of injunction o'flaherty have laid upon at interview of previous evening dared not put into effect without first submitting for approval accordingly went down to state room to speak to about to surprise chagrin found utterly opposed to argued that plan must not throw pirate off guard whilst must allow great deal more time in to complete preparation for effective defence moreover disliked idea of making approach through cardenas bay because of having originally passed through during night when a said have have opportunity to take careful note of landmark etcetera reminded of fact that water in cardenas bay be deep enough to float schooner everywhere about track over must have to pas that track be moreover so nearly straight that with good breeze must traverse in hour thus materially lessening chance of discovery be of avail must have own way so be perforce compelled with must confess somewhat serious misgiving to return to deck give necessary order for running in through barcos channel a soon a sea breeze must spring up at length after what appeared to unusually long delay cat paw reached presently true sea breeze came creeping along water freshening a came allowed to reach mouth of channel when foam bore up quarter of hour later be rattling through passage at rate of eight knot on clearing channel opening up bay discovered felucca four mile ahead about half way across foaming along with enormously long tapering yard square across deck sheet eased well out running down dead before wind straight for entrance of lagoon apparently in hope that must follow thus ground upon one of numerous shoal lay between if hoped be speedily disappointed a moment have cleared end of channel concealment being then impossible hauled wind headed schooner for first of mark be to pilot safely on difficult way before have completed first reach felucca have arrived at entrance to lagoon have disappeared be hour after noon when reached same spot two mile further on narrowest passage in whole length of lagoon here fully expected progress must meet with check be disappointed for on reaching spot further progress be suddenly interrupted schooner brought up standing by heavy chain have be thrown athwart channel just far enough beneath surface of water to catch forefoot end being artfully concealed among bush on side down flat on face on deck man of fore aft shouted for guessed what must follow scarcely be order obeyed when flash of artillery blazed out from among mangrove on hand perfect hailstorm of grape langridge struck riddling bulwark tearing foot of mainsail foresail to shred luckily not hitting soul of though how courtenay escaped not being etiquette for of to seek shelter of bulwark heaven only know did gun be pointed so a to sweep ship from stem to taffrail at about level of top of bulwark have men be standing erect must have lost half of starboard helm hard starboard cried to man at wheel a schooner rebounded from chain let fly starboard brace gig quarter boat away mr courtenay have goodness to take gig silence battery on north side of channel mr fidd go in quarter boat do same with battery on south side take hammer bag of nail spike gun before leave flatten in forward there larboard sheet help head to pay round must go outside again seek passage elsewhere men fully realising peril of situation in now found sprang like wild cat to execute order have given in incredibly short time boat be in water with crew in fully armed be in very act of shoving off when sound of sudden commotion in cabin reached quickly followed by cry for help from sanderson before have time to reach sky light to see what be amiss up through companion dashed poor o'flaherty closely followed by doctor former naked a when be born hair bristling eye aflame with fever teeth clenched blood streaming from disarranged bandage about right shoulder glared round deck for instant single horrible unearthly cry escaped from between clenched teeth then before of have sufficiently recovered from astonishment to lay preventing hand upon with one bound reached rail sprang upon steadying with left hand by grasping main topmast back stay waved bleeding right arm frantically to courtenay who by time be hundred yard away at moment hidden battery on north side of channel again opened fire time with round shot felt jar told that schooner have be hulled at same moment heard sickening thud saw poor o'flaherty body doubled up like pair of compass dashed lifeless bloody to deck by one of shot have struck fair in stomach cut almost in two be ghastly sight there be time just then to inquire of sanderson what sudden escapade meant even to have body removed for schooner be at moment head to wind be most anxious to get round in cramped channel be very easy matter managed to box off however in right direction when topsail be backed lay motionless on half stagnant water waiting for return of boat have not very long to wait loud confused shouting intermingled with ringing british cheer from own lad now then accompanied by clash of steel popping of pistol told whilst be manoeuvring schooner that boat crew have effected landing about ten minute later courtenay boat reappeared emerging from among mangrove with boat in tow being captured from enemy be stove sunk directly be brought alongside schooner fidd boat followed almost immediately afterwards then have gratification of learning that battery have be captured gun spiked capsized into mud men who manned driven off into swamp where be perfectly powerless to work further harm for time to come at event in consequence of destruction of boat constituted only mean of escape from situation then occupied too without injury to man on side though pirate have suffered pretty severely be eminently satisfactory there be now nothing to prevent removal by of chain barred passage up lagoon have shrewd suspicion that other snare pitfall have be prepared for further on have made up mind to see if must not be evaded by passing out of lagoon making way to westward close along northern shore of chain of island formed thought quite possible that navigable channel for schooner might be found somewhere between island giving access to lagoon so near head a to be beyond range of other barrier to upward progress might have be prepared if failed in felt confident that must at least be able to push through with boat a soon therefore a boat have be hoisted up filled on schooner made best of way back again judged that must take full hour more to reach spot have in mind eye advantage be therefore taken of brief period of peace quietness to let men get dinner with glass of grog afterwards be thus rested refreshed ready to do anything go anywhere when about three bell in afternoon watch arrived at spot distant something like five mile from entrance to lagoon where found narrow apparently deep channel trending to southward promising to give access to lagoon schooner be at once hove to courtenay in gig with crew fully armed went away to take sounding to reconnoitre twenty minute later boat returned with gratifying intelligence that channel be scarcely quarter of mile in length that communicated a anticipated with lagoon too so advantageously that with due caution by taking advantage of cover afforded by small island might be possible for boat to approach undetected so closely to enemy a to take in great measure by surprise be further discovered that there be three felucca one large three masted craft two small one master surmised to be recent acquaintance of cristo cay lying in anchorage with spring on cable apparently ready for immediate action schooner saw on last visit be now absent merlani presumably with channel upon have so fortuitously chanced be found to be of ample depth throughout almost entire length to float foam unhappily there be sort of bar with only four foot of water upon stretching entirely across inner extremity must thus be compelled to make attack with boat be peculiarly unfortunate a must necessitate division of force certain number of hand being required to look after schooner must ill afford to do in view of strength of opposed to there be however evidently help for therefore manned three of boat six pounder being placed in bow of long boat launch a people have got into way of calling decided after considerable reflection to personally lead attack leaving schooner under weigh with gun loaded with round grape with six hand quarter master on board to take care of be heaven know wretchedly unfit for service of so arduous character a involved in boat attack consciousness upon result of action depended success failure of main object of expedition coupled with anxiety attendant upon responsible position overcame for time being feeling of illness resulting from wound created restless excitement eagerness for feared must afterwards suffer severely impelled at risk to be present to take direction of affair men encouraged by report of gig crew tumbled into boat with alacrity in high spirit courtenay retained command of gig fidd boatswain again assumed command of quarter boat snatching cutlas from arm chest stepped into launch said parting word two to quarter master then gave order to shove off upon away dashed in profound silence for mouth of passage chapter seventeen conquest of conconil lagoon very short time three minute so sufficed to carry through channel into lagoon once reached away went for back of island under friendly cover of hoped to reach undiscovered within about cable length of foe dozen stroke of oar sufficed to carry little flotilla across narrow strip of water during traversing of there be possibility of premature discovery whilst be dashing across open space made best possible use of eye to take in position of affair be enabled to note situation of three felucca be lying at anchor about mile distant must see men moving about deck of there be movement sound on board that must discern indicative of presence being observed be earnestly hoping praying that eye whole attention of pirate must be turned in opposite direction from whence doubtless expected to make appearance subsequently learned that such be actually case moment be fairly under cover of island ordered men to ease up on oar in order that might husband strength a much a possible for final dash ensuing struggle must see must be severe one waving courtenay to range alongside next few minute be devoted to final settlement of plan of attack have observed that two small felucca be lying inside larger one three of craft being nearly in straight line be arranged that three boat must on emerging from shelter of island make dash at nearest a if about to board courtenay making for larboard side of vessel whilst fidd made feint of attacking on starboard side bulk of crew considered must naturally seeing muster on starboard side to oppose strongest division of attacking force thus leaving larboard side weakly defended so rendering tolerably easy matter for courtenay boat crew to gain footing upon deck having thus given gig what aid must launch quarter boat be to pas on make for large felucca leaving courtenay to gain possession of first vessel attacked to secure crew then to further act according to own discretion shortly after completion of arrangement found that be getting into close proximity with foe mast of felucca opening out simultaneously from behind high bluff showing over sloping spur point of island between accordingly got boat into line men braced for dash in minute two boat be unmasked by rounding point even then managed to get length two nearer vessel before be discovered for have given strictest injunction to men not to cheer until heard from felucca roll of oar in rowlock at length betrayed a be announced by shout of unmistakable dismay from nearest felucca immediately succeeded by tremendous amount of confusion bustle on board then indeed lad did cheer once with enthusiasm must have be eminently disconcerting to enemy after laid down to oar in style must confess fairly astonished went through water like race horse over ground dashing alongside first felucca in so short time that crew be unable to train gun upon so greeted only with confused volley of musketry hurt nobody a swerved away from headed for large craft couple of cable length distant caught sight of courtenay head shoulder over bulwark showing that gallant fellow have already gained footing on deck few second later amid clash of steel popping of pistol british cheer told that gig be hard at evidently gaining advantage crew of other two felucca now began to haul on spring in order that broadside might be brought to bear upon be too quick for a happened second small craft must not be got round smartly enough to do harm a for big one in hurry to annihilate crew fired too high whole broadside whizzed harmlessly over head replied effectively with six pounder be loaded with round grape pointed so high that be enabled to fire within three fathom of felucca side before smoke have cleared away be alongside fidd tackling on larboard side whilst in launch attacked on starboard be well for that have have forethought to bring gun with for deck of vessel be now attacking be crowded with men so crowded indeed that bulwark be closely lined on side to oppose whilst others be seen behind first line ready to support comrade for confusion created by timely discharge of piece not one of must possibly have lived to reach deck a be slightly altered plan at last moment for seeing that pirate have mustered strongly in waist evidently expecting to board there gave order for launch to be allowed to shoot along vessel side until reached bow where there be fewer men to oppose proved to be happy inspiration for whilst be busy forcing way in over felucca low rail several cold shot be hove over side amidships evidently with intention of sinking boat being where be of course missed splashed harmlessly into water poor fidd be le fortunate than boat being stove instant ran alongside for few minute crew be in pretty pickle hanging on to bulwark channel wherever must gain hold vainly striving to force way inboard indeed for matter none of be over comfortably situated party being outnumbered in proportion of fully four to one with further disadvantage that be outside bulwark whilst opponent be inside with firm spacious deck to stand upon be perceptible at glance that case be one wherein prompt bold dash be necessary for unless must succeed in establishing footing at first rush chance be that must fail altogether therefore hastily called to men to reserve pistol fire until be sure of mark placing cutlas between teeth whipping pistol from belt sprang for bulwark instant touched great brawny fellow whose ferocious visage well remembered having seen among of drunken party who boarded pinta instantly stepped forward with upraised axe to oppose be fortunate enough to send bullet crashing through brain ere weapon descended a staggered fell backwards on deck leapt in over rail gained spot have occupied dozen opponent at once closed in upon second pistol accounted for one lost weapon right hand together by first stroke of cutlas by time most of launch have gained footing on deck so that began to make presence felt about time too fidd with three four of best men be on right side of bulwark in minute entire party at least who be not killed desperately wounded be on felucca deck settling down to work in grim earnest now ensued hand to hand encounter of a desperate sanguinary character a have ever be fortune to witness tar on one hand realising that if be vanquished very few of must ever be allowed to escape alive from lagoon whilst pirate of course knew only too well that be fighting with halter round neck for fully quarter of hour be hellish conflict waged upon deck of felucca lad now gaining yard two anon being driven back by sheer force of number until back be pressed against rail further retreat unless over side became impossible while air be full of gleam clash of steel crack of pistol musket tramp of foot heavy breathing of combatant with muttered execration ejaculation sharp cry of newly wounded groan moan of who be already down whose life be being trampled out of in press stress of strife oh sickening odour of blood tainted hot still atmosphere assailed nostril with gasping breath drew deck planking be slippery with sanguinary flood bulwark be splashed with hand face clothing be bespattered with scupper be flowing with for time almost seemed to be raining blood faugh very memory of dreadful scene be sickening let say more about pas on at length lad be to say launch quarter boat crew managed to get pirate fairly jammed in between then very number of foe be in favour for huddled together a be in waist not half of must find room enough to strike effective blow moreover became pretty evident that have have enough of be beginning to lose heart instead of pressing eagerly to front to meet a at first man now seemed anxious only to retire into centre of crowd leaving to somebody else glory of carrying on defence seeing rallied launch with made final desperate charge into thickest of enemy when rout of latter at once became complete of flinging away weapon leaping overboard whilst others tore up hatch sprang headlong into hold example of kind be always contagious if one give way doe same be immediately imitated by third so be in present case panic instantly spread before well knew what be happening two boat crew have joined force enemy have vanished victory be ours cheer raised by victor be immediately responded to from second of small felucca now have time to notice have like first be boarded carried by courtenay gallant little band dashing shipmate have seemed on capturing first prize promptly clapped crew under hatch after immediately cut cable loosed canvas ran on board consort by piece of skilful generalship be enabled to board enemy upon equal term instead of having to clamber in over bulwark from boat be just securing second batch of prisoner preparatory to bearing down to lend helping hand when cheer of victory announced to that assistance be no longer necessary now set to work to clap whole of prisoner in iron task in execution of anticipated considerable amount difficulty fortunately for seemed to have have quite a much fighting a cared for therefore submitted with tolerably good grace perhaps ought rather to say with apathy of hardened men fully conscious of fact that further resistance be utterly unavailing task completed whole of captured pirate transferred to hold of big felucca round open hatchway of four of brass nine pounder be ranged loaded with langridge within view of prisoner muzzle depressed so that pointed right down into interior of hold next business be to land party for purpose of securing booty must be found afterwards to destroy various building store of depot a yet have detected sign of life anywhere on shore pirate seemed one to have betaken to craft apparently confident of ability with to achieve easy victory over in to unlikely event of forcing passage through various obstruction have prepared for at different part of channel notwithstanding apparent absence of foe on shore deemed best to send very strong party fully armed of course under courtenay command entire force of expedition with exception of six hand retained on board biggest prize to keep eye on prisoner be accordingly sent away in launch now unhappily in consequence of numerous casualty of ample capacity to accommodate men composing ten minute later who be left behind have satisfaction of witnessing unopposed landing launch with two boat keeper in be shoved off few fathom from beach remainder of party led by courtenay headed at once for building crowned highest spot in little island reached destination unmolested broke up into party entered various building after interval of twenty minute reappeared man loaded with evidently a much a must carry spoil whatever be be piled upon sandy beach close to water edge second journey to building then followed three of journey in be made at conclusion of third launch be hailed to run in commence taking in cargo that article shipped be tolerably weighty be evident from fact that boat repeatedly needed to be pushed further still further astern to keep afloat from rapidity with settled down in water be very long job to transfer good from beach to boat after men who have be doing work scrambled on board took place water reaching above waist a waded off to shrill signal whistle be then given from boat lookout on summit of hill answered with wave of hand then disappeared through door of principal building pause of minute two followed when little party of four courtenay being one of emerged from various building set off down hill by time that reached launch thin wreath of light bluish smoke be seen issuing from building have just left by time launch have arrived once more alongside felucca smoke have assumed darker hue have increased in volume density be seen to be streaked here there with flickering tongue of flame well said a courtenay clambered in over low bulwark of felucca met with resistance be glad to see appear to have taken pretty effectual measure for destruction of hornet nest yonder did see sign of anybody about there sign be reply must see over place from top of hill believe there be living creature of description on island if there be will be so much worse for hour hence about time something very like earthquake will take place for have lighted slow match communicating with magazine containing about three ton of powder in bulk to say nothing of perhaps couple of thousand cartridge building be effectually fired a may see have brought off boat load of plunder from weight judge must consist largely of specie doubloon doubtless of friend carera discoursed so eloquently now what be next thing to be done why said think have better take wounded into launch proceed with just a be a quickly a possible to schooner turn wounded over to sanderson stow booty in hold hoist in launch then make sail for mouth of lagoon where hope to fall in with in felucca will only be able to spare six hand to pull boat will not greatly matter a think be not likely to be interfered with during passage to schooner wish to start short handed a may possibly have little more fighting to do on way down lagoon now hurry away a fast a can please two small craft so gallantly took be not worth trouble of carrying away will therefore fire then get under way forthwith painful task of moving wounded be then undertaken be most distressing to see how severe loss have be out of total of thirty six told have left schooner in boat five only have escaped uninjured courtenay have be hurt though nothing to speak of nine be killed thirteen so severely wounded a to be unfit for duty having at length seen launch fairly under weigh for schooner sent fidd away with four hand in gig to fire two smaller prize task be soon accomplished a vessel be lying alongside other felucca canvas be then loosed anchor be roused up to bow got under weigh have not proceeded further than couple of mile down lagoon before a have quite expected came upon battery constructed upon small projecting spit battery have be passing up instead of down lagoon must have raked fore aft for at least twenty minute peppered with grape for ten without being able to fire single shot in return battery be hastily constructed affair of sod mounted only one gun that gun be long eighteen have removed chain barrier formed first obstruction persevered in original attempt to pas up lagoon there can be doubt that gun must have destroyed schooner hand people who manned battery must not possibly have failed to hear firing have be going on at head of lagoon seemed to have failed to comprehend full significance therefore to have be unable to make up mind to slue gun round point in opposite direction state of indecision on part not only enabled to approach with impunity also to take in flank couple of round of grape from felucca so astonished demoralised that who be not killed disabled by fire incontinently abandoned battery sought safety in flight to deepest recess of bush lined shore fidd with dozen hand then jumped into schooner gig have be towing astern of felucca shoved off with object of destroying battery now have specimen of ability with defence of lagoon have be planned for on approaching battery be found to be bordered on three side by bank of ooze ten fathom broad ooze proved to be of such consistency whilst be much too liquid too deep to permit of man wading through be at same time so thick a to render passage of boat through almost impossible took crew of gig more than twenty minute to force boat through semi liquid mass exerting to utmost meanwhile so that have schooner in passing up lagoon managed to survive fire of gun attempt to storm battery with aid of boat must have resulted in irretrievable disaster however fidd blue jacket managed to reach terra firma eventually be then work of only few minute to capsize gun appurtenance over edge of bank into ooze where whole be instantly swallowed up meanwhile felucca slowly drifting down lagoon encountered at distance of fifty fathom below battery obstacle in shape of second chain similar to former stretched across channel rendered further progress impossible until barrier have be removed there being nobody to interfere with action be soon done then passed on meeting with further obstruction until came to first chain like one previously passed be removed by casting off end allowing whole affair to sink to bottom of lagoon where be doubtless instantly swallowed up by mud in le than hour afterwards found clear of terrible lagoon altogether fairly in santa clara bay where fell in with foam hove to waiting for be by time within hour of sunset so a be anxious to get into open water before nightfall be arranged that must go out to sea through manou channel cardenas bay a have before done in pinta passage be accomplished without mishap diana cay being passed on larboard hand vessel head being laid north by east just a first star began to twinkle out from darkening blue above shortly after fell calm advantage be taken of brief period of inactivity preceding springing up of land breeze to apportion few effective hand remaining to a fairly a possible between schooner prize latter being of course put under courtenay command with pottle quarter master a lieutenant gun room officer midshipman rolled into one courtenay crew with kit hammock be transferred to felucca in good time to fill on stand on in wake of foam with first of land breeze then with pottle in temporary charge of prize tompion keeping lookout on deck of schooner courtenay more firmly knit together than ever by trying event of day have just passed through sat down to talk matter quietly over together while discussed very creditable dinner steward have provided for on following morning melancholy task of burying dead be performed vessel being hove to with colour hoisted half mast high during ceremony think be very great relief to hand when poor fellow ten in including o'flaherty having be consigned with solemnity to last resting place beneath heaving billow be able to fill away again resume course to northward eastward noon that day found three mile to windward of anguilas situate at south east extremity of cay sal bank hour later lookout on board foam reported sail apparently large schooner on weather beam running up old channel under easy canvas breeze be then blowing rather fresh at about east by north foam thrashing along with lee covering board awash royal stowed topmast whipping about like couple of fishing rod whilst felucca be about three mile ahead of broad on weather bow going two foot to one weathering on at plunge be consequently sailing at right angle to stranger rather drawing away from line of course than otherwise yet such be speed with came along that in hour be hull up from deck now became apparent that be manifesting certain amount of curiosity a to who what might happen to be for instead of gradually revealing starboard broadside to a must have done have held on original course be gradually hauling wind by keeping bowsprit pointed straight for be at first disposed to regard a english enormous spread of lower topsail yard convinced upon nearer approach be mistaken that same peculiarity of rig be strong argument against assumption of being french considerably puzzled what to make of sent for glass in order to get clearer view of by time that instrument have be brought on deck put into hand be within four mile of single glance through telescope sufficed to tell who what be yes there must be doubt about craft running down so rapidly toward be none other than merlani schooner identical craft courtenay have seen hove down on occasion of visit to conconil lagoon here be pretty kettle of fish indeed fellow deck must of course be crowded with men whilst have not enough hand to man single broadside supposing even sent available man to gun leaving canvas to take care of a for courtenay be even worse off than be puzzled what to do for best for felt that single false move at juncture in presence of such enemy might involve in absolute ruin hurried consultation with boatswain gunner however decided to put bold face upon affair brazen out in accordance with resolution ensign pennant be hoisted topgallant sail be clewed up furled gaff topsail hauled down stowed courtenay very smartly followed suit in matter of showing colour tacking at same time edging down toward evidently shook nerve of unwelcome neighbour somewhat seemed to think two to one rather long odds for immediately bore away far enough to show gaff end clear of topsail when at once ran up star stripe with display of bunting of course feigned to be perfectly satisfied vessel held on course merlani doubtless chuckling to think how smartly have hoodwinked whilst be only too pleased at having got out of difficulty so easily on courtenay rounding to under stern appeared that too believed strange craft to be schooner like have be temporarily thrown off balance like also have just come to conclusion that bold front be proper game to play when sight of colour shortening of sail gave cue have forthwith put down helm come round to take part in game of braggadocio incident of rencontre with merlani for subsequently learned that actually be be last occurrence worthy of record befell on somewhat eventful cruise for after losing sight of suspected schooner never fell in with sail of description until entered port royal harbour where arrived after pleasant somewhat tardy passage exactly one week after fight in conconil lagoon may a well here state parenthetically under sanderson skilful hand assiduous care wounded myself included did marvellously well though of poor fellow on arrival have to be removed to hospital one of eventually recovered a for contrary to expectation excitement exertion to have be unavoidably exposed did harm on morning of arrival be able to dispense with cumbersome unsightly swathing of turban like bandage have up to then be compelled to wear liberal application of sticking plaster being thenceforward required until wound be completely healed black pilot berthed at request close under gun of flag ship anchor have scarcely taken fair grip of ground before found seated in stern sheet of gig with carefully written report in hand en route for interview with admiral found old gentleman on quarter deck of mar up down be stumping in evidently very amiable mood something other forget what have put temper out of joint be expressing with freedom vigour fluency of language have seldom heard equalled certainly never surpassed be inclined to be ironical too for on presenting before brought up abruptly surveying fiercely for moment exclaimed well young gentleman pray who may be what do want if may venture so far a to make inquiry be mr lascelles sir of schooner foam just arrived have come on board to make report replied oh said somewhat le sternly be mr lascelles of schooner foam be pray sir where be mr o'flaherty that must find necessary to discharge function be not wounded hope regret to say sir that be dead said dead repeated tut tut be bad news indeed here come into cabin with sit down look a pale a ghost have be wounded if fag end of sticking plaster see projecting beneath rim of hat have significance there take chair help to glass of wine make comfortable continued a reached cool roomy cabin give report let have short verbal account of how got on what have befallen brought in prize with see very fine craft of class seems to be there now fire away with yarn refreshed with sip of old gentleman very excellent madeira then proceeded to give outline of principal event of cruise narrative being frequently broken in upon by with question of decidedly searching character in reference to such matter a seemed to to require further elucidation at close of narrative old gentleman rose from seat shook warmly by hand exclaiming well done dear boy well done have behaved admirably with discretion far beyond year have known a much at outset a do now need not have sent mr o'flaherty at poor fellow be good officer brave man none braver be rash have seen great deal of boat service thought well well never mind be pity gave alarm to felucca so prematurely though be very pleased with young gentleman with shipmate too very pleased indeed got out of two bad scrape very cleverly to say nothing of way in afterwards weathered upon arch pirate have be neatly done upon word did quite right boy not to turn stern to never turn tail to enemy even though be big enough to eat until very last moment then if think have ghost of chance of thrashing doe not mean however that when retreat be necessary be to stay until be too late be eaten must have liked to see fellow chuckling to a thought how cleverly have hoodwinked poor chap little dreamed that be walking off with hard earned saving snugly stowed away beneath cabin floor will not be so very long please god before will have also crew safe in iron well well now be off aboard hooker again see ready for turning over prisoner plunder harkye youngster come dine with at penn to night seven sharp give compliment to shipmate say will be glad to see too chapter eighteen dinner party at admiral penn dinner that evening at penn be very pleasant affair indeed at event for courtenay for on occasion reaped first fruit of toil peril have recently encountered in shape of ungrudging unstinted praise commendation be so welcome so encouraging to young aspirant for fame party consisted of three post captain commander four lieutenant dozen mids included with jolly old admiral host made up nice compact party guest appeared have be invited expressly to meet do honour consequently found to be lion of evening be of course invited to tell story over again from commencement did beginning with mutiny on board hermione narrative being frequently broken in upon by question from one of guest of whom be bound to record manifested utmost interest in what have to say question on more than one occasion took quite form of severe cross examination post captain in particular seeming determined to arrive at clear distinct understanding a to motif prompted in many of action decision be somewhat at loss at first to comprehend meaning of cross questioning became apparent later on in evening when three captain commander formally offered to receive on board ship one of happened to be seventy four whilst other three be fine dashing frigate offer be of course of most advantageous character have accepted feel sure that joining ship with reputation have honestly won for advancement in service must have be certain rapid something in admiral manner caused to hesitate so with hearty thanks to for kind offer begged favour of few hour for consideration courtenay taking cue from did same when at length rose to take leave of host return to respective ship admiral drew courtenay aside said a shook hand with before decide to accept to refuse of offer have be made to to night come see will be on board flag ship to morrow at noon promised that must do so shortly afterwards got under weigh in company with fellow guest whole party being on horseback for kingston road rather bush path along travelled for greater part of way being brilliantly lighted by ray of glorious full moon autocrat of quarter deck with whom thus found privileged to ride cheek by jowl proved to be splendid fellow very gentlemanly in manner yet having evidently sunk quarter deck for nonce frank hearty a believe only sailor can be permitted rather invited by cordial manner to join freely in conversation instead of relegating to rear a captain must undoubtedly have done in like circumstance held out so many inducement for to join at length got idea into head that actually wanted frank friendly treatment served one good purpose at least gave clearer insight into character disposition than have be able to obtain at admiral dinner table helped to definitely make up mind under leader if of must serve punctual to moment courtenay presented ourselves on quarter deck of mar next day sent in name to admiral who be in cabin just a ship bell be striking eight be at once invited to step into cabin did finding old gentleman busy with secretary writing letter have evidently just completed dictation of one a entered for remarked to thin pale young man who be seated with at table there purkis will do for present just transcribe document have already taken down whilst have chat with young gentleman daresay that by time have finished will be ready to go on again well young gentleman continued good morning find couple of chair bring yourselves to anchor waving hand toward of article of furniture in question a spoke when have seated ourselves resumed well now that have slept over offer received last night what do think of a looked straight at during propounding of question took initiative in replying said so far a be concerned sir unless have something else in view for must like to join alecto serve under captain fanshawe inquired old gentleman turning to courtenay must like to accompany friend lascelles wherever go if have objection sir be courtenay reply well said admiral rubbing bald head in manner seemed to denote that be somewhat perplexed think have chosen very well alecto be noble frigate very comfortable ship whilst fanshawe be one of very best men on station indeed may say in entire service will be very glad to have know if elect to join continued addressing more particularly qualified expression of choice by adding word unless have something else in view for ' upon word laid stress now wish to influence of in way do understand to mean by expression that be willing to place yourselves in hand most assuredly yes sir replied in case must be duty to do so have be pleased to express such very high approval of conduct during recent cruise have exhibited flattering interest in welfare that duty in case becomes positive pleasure for part ask nothing better than permission to leave entirely in hand also chimed in courtenay very well spoken young sir very well spoken indeed exclaimed admiral evidently much gratified at reply well continued have other view for view presented a sat listening to what have to tell yesterday morning be strengthened by what afterwards found in capitally written report be not practice to flatter unduly praise officer especially youngster like for proper performance of duty practice be apt to make conceited to think too much of to consider that there be nobody like that can not be done without appear to be modest thoroughly sensible lad have exhibited amount of tact judgment quite beyond year in circumstance where much older men might have be puzzled how to act therefore hesitate to say that be exceedingly pleased with both that be thoroughly satisfied with conduct in respect that think considering how very short handed be at present on station in matter of officer might be better employed than in mere doing of midshipman duty even on board smart frigate have of interested very much must like to see getting on in profession mounting ratline a speedily a may be if like to trust yourselves to be willing to work hard behave well will see to that have chance given to make mark be afraid will have to separate now what do say a question be again put pointedly to replied that whilst must greatly regret being separated from so stanch shipmate so true friend a companion have proved to be in many situation of difficulty peril must not allow feeling to interfere in way with plan of kind generous patron felt sure that in saying on own behalf might also say a much for friend to speech courtenay bowed acquiescence looking rather glum at same time must say very well said admiral must separate for present promise that will become shipmate again at earliest convenient opportunity now listen to there have be numerous complaint from merchant here during last two three month that cargo consigned to have never arrived only conclusion possible be that ship carrying cargo have be snapped up by privateer have already sent out men of war available to cruise about spot most likely to be haunted by pest there be couple of cruising ground be still le effectively watched than must like have be thinking must send two lad away to just to see what can do courtenay intend to put in charge of large felucca brought in from lagoon be just craft for work will have to do good powerful vessel of light draught of water cruising ground will be from cape maysi northward a far a long island giving kays in austral bay overhaul now then thence to windward of windward passage down a far south a say silver kay passage then to westward a far a cape maysi again will have to be very careful young gentleman in navigation of austral bay may find cast away on one of shoal lascelles intend to put in command of schooner dauphin be brought in by minerva few day ago be really formidable vessel of class think quite likely will be very severely blamed behind back for intrusting to mere boy a be must look upon command a indication of confidence have in gallantry discretion will look to to justify by conduct in choice have made cruising ground will be round saint domingo a far east a virgin island duty of will be firstly to protect commerce next to beat up enemy quarter everywhere within bound capture sink burn destroy everything can lay hand on be not too big for to tackle whole coast of saint domingo be swarming with french privateer really pirate under rather more respectable name be to fellow want to more particularly direct attention foam will pay off at once think will be good plan if mr courtenay will try to secure hand now have on board felucca for next cruise if mr lascelles have particularly good men on board foam that must like to keep have better endeavour to get to enter for dauphin by way will re christen call dolphin for future now good morning of if want few day leave take sending mr purkis here address so may know where to communicate with leave ship however until foam be paid off will be to morrow upon hint to depart rose thanking kind benefactor a briefly a possible for really extraordinary kindness to bowed out withdrew a went down over side resolved must there then pay visit to new command see what be like have already noticed lying alongside dockyard wharf have admired not only for handsome rakish appearance also because be largest schooner have at time ever seen therefore pulled straight away for dockyard courtenay accompanying in foam gig a soon a be fairly away from mar fidus achates turned to said well lascelles be very well for old fellow who be well up in navigation really know how in world will get on be true did fairly well in felucca on trip from lagoon then be always careful to keep schooner well in sight so be really trusting to a much a to myself now will have to depend upon if have not felt certain that will polish up during few day that may be in port together must have be obliged to decline admiral very kind offer what brick old fellow be to be sure yet see what name have for harshness severity depend upon said be only harsh severe with who deserve then great allowance must be made for man occupying such responsible position a matter what go wrong who be to blame be always who be called to account for have certainly proved true friend to henceforward will never sit down tamely hear vilified a to yourself dear fellow make mind easy be far better navigator than think what little help may need to render perfect will cheerfully give week hard study on part will be quite sufficient to qualify for going anywhere a rapidly approached wharf noble proportion of dolphin became moment more apparent when at gig dashed alongside passed in through wide gangway felt a though have frigate under measured one hundred twenty foot in length between perpendicular be thirty foot beam at widest part dimension gave measurement of close upon five hundred ton hull be however exceedingly willow draught of water being only nine foot when in usual sailing trim line be moreover without exception finest most beautiful ever saw so that though in consequence of curious manner in tonnage be at time calculated be extraordinarily large vessel of class believe must have carried cargo of more than four hundred ton of dead weight however be in favour so far a speed be concerned a gave large beamy hull very small displacement whilst long flat floor rendered exceedingly stiff latter quality being peculiarly apparent from fact that though on occasion have empty hold iron ballast having be removed stacked upon wharf scarcely deigned to heel at to sea breeze though be blowing gale at time whilst spar be ataunto just a have come in from sea be truly noble craft model be superb fell in love with on spot sailor must have helped doing so have be taken under french colour own opinion be supported by of others who be far better judge than be that be american built there be easy graceful spring in long spacious deck frenchman must ever have compassed there be american look too about bow raked forward in exquisite curve whilst flared outward in way promised to make wondrously dry comfortable in sea way armament have be like ballast removed to wharf understood from foreman in charge that be to be replaced by one somewhat lighter when stepped on shore saw gun eight long eighteen with long thirty two mounted on pivot for forecastle inwardly resolved that since have be able to carry so far must continue to do so if power of persuasion must be made to avail anything with admiral have accommodation for eighty men forward cabin abaft for size elegance of fitting must not have disgraced frigate poor courtenay be so completely overwhelmed with admiration really felt quite sorry for hitherto there have be nothing approachable in opinion to felucca by bye have forgotten to say be called esmeralda now be dwarfed into insignificance in respect by dolphin young skipper quite put out of conceit with however consoled if not with reflection that dolphin once out of sight must forget about having given craft thorough overhaul sauntered off to naval hospital only short distance from dockyard gate to see how wounded be progressing also to tell whole truth that boat crew might have opportunity to take good look at schooner felt sure must so favourably impress must have little difficulty in persuading to enter for remained in hospital about hour on return to dockyard just caught glimpse of men tumbling over schooner side back into boat so have good hope of finding that have one swallowed bait shoving off put courtenay on board craft then proceeded to foam where be kept pretty busy for remainder of day preparing to pay off a have clerk to help allowed hand to go to dinner without saying anything to to give gig opportunity to discus dolphin with shipmate a felt sure must before turned to after dinner sent for aft made maiden speech ran somewhat a follows lad said have sent for to tell that foam will be paid off to morrow wish to take advantage of opportunity announcement affords to also thank heartily for gallant way in have stood by for way have behaved generally from moment when devolved upon through mr o'flaherty wounding subsequent death to assume command of schooner cruise together have be short one be true have be long enough to enable to become personally acquainted with individually to discover good bad quality latter be pleased to say have be so few so trifling that be not worth further mention whilst former have be so conspicuous a to render anxious for continuance of connection between brings to final statement be that admiral have be pleased to announce intention of commissioning fine schooner dolphin yonder placing in command now lad daresay guess pretty well at what further have to say dolphin be to proceed against french privateer be snapping up so many of westerly bound merchantman so there will probably be plenty of fighting for to do there will also be plenty of capture recapture mean plenty of prize money for crew be most anxious that crew will be good one a good in respect a foam crew have proved to be in short lad must like to have one of with again think matter over of who be willing to try cruise with to enter for dolphin can let know to morrow when be paid off will do now may go to duty instead of turning to at once however men clustered together began to confer eagerly with other with boatswain gunner quarter master result of confabulation being that in le than five minute entire crew to man came forward announced desire to enter for dolphin be eminently satisfactory for now have at least nucleus of thoroughly good crew on following day foam be paid off a previously arranged whereupon hand re entered for dolphin after be granted forty eight hour leave business being settled sought interview with admiral told of success at expressed greatly pleased there will be difficulty in making up complement said though will have to put on board few convalescent from hospital will take care that get none thoroughly sound healthy men there be at least dozen now ready to be discharged who only want mouthful of sea air meal two of salt junk to make fit for anything will also give couple of midshipman master mate with what have already will think make pretty complete be more than have dared hope though certainly not more than be necessary for craft a dolphin so finding old gentleman disposed to be generous boldly broached matter of gun pleaded so earnestly that at length won consent to retention of schooner original armament concluded business on board flag ship so handing address to secretary jumped into shore boat have alongside made best of way to kingston where courtenay have preceded have previously made up mind to test sincerity of invitation mr thomson who have very hospitably entertained on last visit to kingston have given so first disposed at hotel of excellent meal called lunch be quite substantial enough to merit name of dinner then hastily dashed off letter to officer who have proposed to receive on board ship thanking for very kind offer explained be gratefully obliged to decline in consequence of admiral having intimated intention of sending on special service duty performed sallied forth made best of way to friend place of business where upon first hint of having obtained few day leave former invitation be repeated so earnestly heartily a to leave in shadow of doubt a to sincerity found to great gratification that family still occupied country house where have previously be so hospitably entertained to get over slight difficulty presented a to how be to convey thither host with generous confidence certainly have done nothing to merit urged to make immediate start in ketureen begging at same time not to forget to send into town saddle horse for own use later on in day unbounded confidence reposed in by gentleman will be better understood when mention that be actually trusted to drive however proved worthy of trust be proud to say broke knee wind of spirited animal have in tow did smash ketureen on contrary arrived at journey end with in such excellent condition a to extort compliment upon skilful driving from somewhat surprised by mean disconcerted hostess also faithfully delivered message anent saddle horse then feeling that have done whole duty manfully dropped into wake of two black servant who have shouldered trunk followed to room promptly assigned to where hastily removed travel stain preparatory to entering family circle appearance there be greeted with enthusiasm for news of triumphant return from lagoon have by time spread throughout entire length breadth of island be regarded a hero especially by juvenile be invited to fight battle over over again be made much of have remained there long there be doubt must have be utterly spoiled luckily perhaps for though certainly did not think so at time leave be cut short on fourth day by intimation from admiral that presence on board respective ship have now become desirable whereupon reluctantly bade land friend adieu once more returned to port royal courtenay more than half suspected leaving heart behind in charge of sweet mary thomson host youngest if such distinction be permissible most charming daughter chapter nineteen assist in capture of french frigate for next three day be so busy looking after thousand one thing requiring attention just before ship go to sea that scarcely have time to sleep much le to get meal on fourth morning be able to report a ready for sea when admiral gave written instruction ordered to sail forthwith accordingly got under weigh about noon with strong sea breeze blowing made short stretch over toward quarantine ground tacked a soon a must weather port royal point passed between rackum gun cay went flying down through east channel at rate of full thirteen knot with topgallant sail stowed courtenay ought to have mentioned sailed on previous day eight bell in afternoon watch saw drawing well up abreast of morant point hour later mr woodford master mate who be doing duty a master took departure have fairly entered upon cruise to merely say be delighted with new command must very inadequately express feeling be enchanted with worked like top sailed like witch be a stiff a church so weatherly notwithstanding exceedingly light draught woodford declared must be puzzled how to correctly estimate lee way last though not least be superb sea boat dry a bone save for spray flew in over weather cat head notwithstanding extraordinary speed men too be in ecstasy with slapping rail with hand cry enthusiastically go old gal a plunged easily into short choppy sea sent spray foam hissing whirling many fathom away to leeward astern of then too have fairly good crew amounting to eighty six told fore aft though several of be fresh from hospital two midshipman with admiral have supplied be quiet gentlemanly lad aged fourteen thirteen respectively woodford master mate be man of about twenty five first rate navigator sanderson be again with a doctor old friend fidd tompion pottle occupied same position on board dolphin that have held on board foam have in addition very respectable young man to perform duty of purser very handy man swede a carpenter a walked deck that evening chatting gaily with woodford sanderson felt must be confessed intensely proud of position be not feeling pardonable there be lad who have still to see eighteenth birthday intrusted with absolute command of vessel so powerful with so numerous crew many poor hard working third lieutenant must have looked upon a promotion have be placed in shoe with destiny of nearly hundred of fellow being in hand to responsible position have attained not through influence of powerful friend for of such have none solely a must not help feeling through good conduct own unaided exertion with of course blessing of god about be ashamed to say thought far too little in day yet must not see that have done anything very extraordinary have simply striven with might to do duty faithfully to best of ability keeping new motto for love honour ever before eye lo reward have already come to a come must will to who be diligent faithful if have succeeded so well in past with limited advantage then possessed what asked may not achieve with present mean felt that there be scarcely anything might not dare do pulse throbbed blood coursed in quicker tide through vein a told myself be now indeed fairly on highway toward achievement of twofold object to have dedicated life shortly after taking departure from morant point a already recorded wind headed schooner broke off until be heading about north east close hauled notwithstanding fact that have run into very nasty choppy sea log showed that dolphin be going through water at rate of eleven knot stood on in same direction until midnight when having brought high rocky islet of navaza far enough on weather quarter to go to windward of on other tack hove about standing to southward eastward for remainder of night daylight next morning found with point gravois broad on weather bow distant about twenty mile be most gratifying a showed that have beaten clear across windward channel against fresh head wind in about fourteen hour passage almost if not quite unexampled in point of celerity be intention to work close along whole of southern coast of saint domingo on eastward passage did looking in first behind island of vache where be lucky enough to descry french privateer brigantine snugly anchored under shelter of small battery a there be nothing like making hay whilst sun shine at once headed straight for anchorage trusting to extreme roguishness of own appearance to put enemy off guard began to shorten sail in somewhat slovenly fashion a though be about to bring up then passing under stern of quarry luffed up into wind shot alongside craft hove grappling iron into rigging whilst boarder be still busy driving astonished crew below cut cable dragged quarter of mile to sea before people in battery woke up fully realised what be about by time however be in full possession of prize be able to make sail upon although shot from battery flew about ear pretty thickly for next ten minute actually succeeded in getting out of range without once being struck so completely have surprised french crew that not one of men received so much a scratch julie for such proved to be name of prize though small turned out to be of considerable value for be pretty nearly full of rich heterogeneous assortment of good shrewdly suspected have be taken out of ship be subsequently scuttled burnt therefore put one of mids with dozen hand on board sent into port royal where a afterwards learned safely arrived next morning little slice of good fortune coming a did at very outset of cruise be peculiarly gratifying to not so much on account of honour profit likely to accrue to personally from transaction because put crew into good spirit infused into especially stranger among amount of confidence in extremely youthful appearance must perhaps have otherwise failed to command devoted entire week to projected examination of saint domingo coast making four more capture during time proved to be of so little value that be set on fire destroyed then having worked way a far east a saona stretched across mona passage looked into various bay creek on south coast of porto rico without success finally found on sixteenth day out with island of virgin gorda herman reef under lee a stood to northward eastward to weather virgin group be about noon when having stretched off land twenty mile so be about to bear up take look at northern shore of island whose southern coastline have just so rigorously overhauled lookout aloft hailed to say that thought heard firing somewhere to windward be walking deck at time chatting with young marchmont one of two mids sent on board by admiral upon report being made lad volunteered to go aloft investigate couple of minute later active youngster be on royal yard peering out eagerly ahead to windward with one hand shading eye to ward off glare of sun remained thus for perhaps three four minute when saw assume more eager look presently turned round hailed on deck there there certainly be firing going on somewhere in neighbourhood sir for have just heard most distinctly moment before spoke thought caught sight of something like smoke wreath gleaming in sun away yonder broad on weather bow have there go again did not hear sir replied wash of water under bow alongside make too much noise down here will do can come down again mr marchmont if a believe there be firing going on to windward of will soon know more about for of course will not now bear up until have satisfied a to matter men forward became at once upon qui vive a must see by animated countenance of messmen eagerness with exchanged remark a went to galley for dinner cook be then serving out a also by nimble manner in relief lookout aloft shinned up ratline be one of keenest sighted men have on board instead of seating a usual on topsail yard continued upward progress until reached royal yard upon perched a easily a if have be in arm chair steadying body by bracing back against few inch of slender royal mast rose above yard have not be settled more than ten minute before hailed to report that heard firing distinctly have also caught sight of light wreath of smoke about four point on weather bow be so far satisfactory inasmuch a there must now be no longer doubt a to firing next thing be to find out nature whether be in broadside by single gun how often occurred so hailed to report time heard anything presently hailed again gun sir took time not quite minute have elapsed when again reported gun sir not so loud time think be lighter piece than last be nearly five minute before next report be made so concluded that must be running fight chase in fact be going forward interval of perhaps minute passed when distinctly caught sound of faint boom at same moment hail came down gun sir heavier one than last sail ho three point on weather bow will do replied need not report firing further keep sharp lookout for sail what be one in sight like can hardly tell at distance sir head of royal be only just showing above horizon appear to be of great size four minute later second sail be reported a have expected lookout now expressing opinion that new comer be probably frigate whilst smaller craft leader in race be ship sloop brig other midshipman lad named boyne be now on deck having relieved marchmont at noon youngster who have taken precaution to bring telescope on deck with now started forward with agility of monkey soon placed alongside lookout immediately raised telescope to eye be by time jumping into short lumpy sea made motion aloft very considerable moreover position be not one very favourable for observation so be rather long time bringing glass to bear at length however with assistance of lookout managed to get craft one after other into field of vision after good long look reported be raising stranger very fast sir can see royal half way down topgallant sail of be running dead before wind with royal studding sail set on side leading ship be brig apparently british one in chase seems to be frigate thank mr boyne replied just stay there little longer if please keep eye on stranger report anything noteworthy may see ay ay sir be answer to work lad again went with telescope most industriously must now hear firing quite distinctly on deck of course be unable to see anything though expected to catch gleam of canvas on horizon very shortly presently young boyne hailed again big fellow be overhauling little one very fast sir doubt how doe frigate bear now mr boyne about three point on weather bow sir thank keep away point to helmsman mr pottle take small pull upon weather brace if please give foot two of main sheet ay ay sir answered pottle lay aft here sea dog check weather brace royal yard there hold on tight be going to take pull upon weather brace be ready there now then lad steady not too much have rather overdone ease off inch two of royal brace haul taut to leeward well there belay lee to'gallant brace haul taut topsail fore brace well there belay of forecastle there ease up that flying jib sheet what do mean know nothing by flattening sail like so that be better belay so old fellow went on making round of deck trimming sail until drew to utmost advantage at length a schooner rose upon crest of sea gleam of sun upon white canvas be caught for moment instantly reported by dozen eager voice from forecastle then bore two half point good upon weather bow again hailed royal yard royal yard there can make out how stranger be steering mr boyne be heading north east by north ay ay sir if be case vessel ahead be steering about west south west will do mr boyne may come down sir clear for action mr pottle if please then let crew go to quarter ay ay sir clear for action mr fidd twee twee twee e e tweetle weetle tee tee tee e piped boatswain following up shrill music with hoarse bellow of hand clear for action now then old stew pan to cook dowse galley fire hearty stow away best chiney down in run tumble up there bull dog tumble up be very long job to prepare schooner for action in twenty minute everything be ready magazine opened powder shot passed up on deck gun cast loose loaded pike cut adrift from main boom arm served out to crew man at appointed station by time lower yard of brig have risen level with horizon whilst upper half of frigate topsail must be seen from deck firing meanwhile have gone on pretty deliberately be now possible to see from deck with aid of telescope that sail of pursuer pursued be suffering pretty extensively from effect of cannonade be evident that be firing high frigate trying to wing brig so arrest flight whilst brig be equally anxious to maim big antagonist spar by mean only must hope to effect escape so far brig appeared to be getting rather best of for though canvas showed daylight through in several place spar running gear still remained uninjured sail be drawing to utmost advantage whilst frigate have lost fore royal mast with sail be hanging down over topgallant sail topsail main topmast studding sail tack be cut sail streaming out loose flapping furiously in wind little casualty being sufficient to enable brig to hold own for time being at least in unequal race to encourage plucky little vessel by showing that help be at hand now fired gun hoisted colour allowing ensign to stream a far out to leeward a possible in act of running up to gaff end in order on board might catch glimpse of before be hidden by canvas approaching other a be nearly end on rose other very rapidly at length in dolphin have satisfaction of seeing frigate vessel most distant from fairly hull up have by time cleared away wreck of fore royal mast have spliced studding sail tack be in very act of setting sail again when brig two stern chaser spoke out simultaneously next moment down toppled frigate fore main topgallant mast with attached topgallant studding sail boom snapping off like carrot at same time there noble craft be in pretty mess ringing cheer on board brig might almost have heard went up from lad at sight followed by hoarse murmur of lookout now johnny crapeau have lost temper brig be going to get loco in a frigate put helm down fired whole broadside at flying craft there be not so very much damage done after so far a brig be concerned peak halliard be cut temporarily lost use of main trysail must see rope end two streaming out here there in wind be excepting that canvas showed few extra eyelet hole with frigate however be different by yielding to feeling of exasperation a have skipper have be betrayed into very unseamanlike act in luffing ship with studding sail upon result be that lost remainder of boom in instant found in worse pickle than ever by time brig have passed far enough to leeward of to be able to clearly distinguish colour of bunting seeing also that be indisputably holding luff so a to close with frigate accepted a friend notwithstanding decidedly rakish appearance at once coolly began to shorten sail evidently now determined with aid to try conclusion with big antagonist be about time for to do same accordingly clewed up furled royal topgallant sail hauled down stowed gaff topsail main topmast staysail brailed in foresail triced up tack of mainsail left schooner in condition to be worked by le than dozen hand by time that have be accomplished running gear hauled taut rope end coiled down everything made ship shape on board have arrived within distance of something like two mile of frigate at juncture fired shot at from bow gun possibly a hint to not to interfere with shot fell short several yard umph remarked woodford from post at helm nothing very terrific about that twelve pounder apparently shockingly poor aim thirty two will make johnny open eye with astonishment expect yes said ought to be able to reach from here so will let long tom return compliment forward there be ready with pivot gun ready sir be reply then just give frigate taste of quality will keep away couple of point so that may have fair chance see if ca make shot tell ay ay sir if make splinter fly may stop grog for next month answered collins captain of gun who happened to be bit of favourite with be trifle free in language in consequence gun be carefully levelled when be ready woodford gently put helm up schooner gradually fell off from wind presently there be deafening explosion accompanied by jarring concussion shook schooner from stem to stern a smoke drove away to leeward saw jet of spray dozen foot high shoot into air a ball struck crest of wave in instant white patch of naked wood appeared exactly in centre of port sill showing where shot have hulled frigate good if have crippled one of gun be dutchman ejaculated woodford letting schooner come up full by once more very good indeed collins shouted load again fine fellow a quickly a possible sail trimmer ready about mr boyne see that muzzle of larboard broadside gun be well elevated fire a be brought to bear take steady aim lad throw away single shot if can help have be going to rake down with helm woodford helm lee ease up jib sheet forward there round in upon main sheet smartly men let draw fore sheet brace let go haul schooner what beauty be worked like top be round on other tack presenting broadside to frigate when latter launched whole content of larboard battery at almost at same moment fired four eighteen in larboard battery at then before have time to note damage done if shot came screaming about ear there be crash on board schooner only one be caused by shot passing through weather bulwark striking ring bolt in deck after bounded high in air went overboard to leeward there be couple of hole in beautiful mainsail one in flying jib beyond be uninjured one of men in larboard battery have cheek slightly lacerated by splinter with trifling exception none of be worse frigate however did not escape quite so easily when again looked at be seen that have knocked away jib boom close to cap have cut away flying jib halliard stay with result that sail be towing under forefoot fore topsail tye have also be cut yard be down on cap rendering plight worse than ever loss of head sail occurring at moment when having partially luffed to fire at wind be well on starboard quarter frigate now showed symptom of flying up into wind altogether although be evident from sluggish way in did so that tendency be being strongly counteracted by helm soon saw that crew be powerless fly into wind must in spite of ready about again lad cried now mr marchmont be turn by time that be fairly round frigate stern will be turned directly toward offering excellent mark let see how many of shot can send in through cabin window will ay ay sir will do best answered lad in high glee then saw pas rapidly from one captain of gun to heard mention distinctly in excitement something about bottle of grog men grinned turned quid hitched up waistband of breech squinted along sight of gun looked at frigate a though measuring distance then adjusted elevation of piece with evidently nicest judgment very best of intention watching frigate carefully helm be put down at just right moment a topsail swept round be braced up bang bang bang bang roared eighteen away skipped shot crash went four of slap into stern of disabled frenchman playing very mischief with gilt ginger bread work with part of ship be profusely decorated rattling broadside from brig now drew attention to saw that be standing toward close hauled on larboard tack under topsail topgallant sail that also have taken advantage of frigate helpless situation to rake most handsomely frenchman meanwhile having got into what courtenay must have termed centre of hobble be very busily doing best to get out of again in very seamanlike way too notwithstanding former mistake by clewing up furling everything abaft mainmast so trimming yard a to cause frigate to gather stern way gradually pay off again however be work of little time hampered a ship be with wreck forward before be done have passed to windward of receiving in so doing fire of seven of sixteen larboard broadside gun to replied effectively with starboard battery having reached far enough to weather on next tack went about crossing bow fired larboard battery thirty two pounder into again raking severely best of bringing fore topmast down by run have by time paid off sufficiently to have gathered head way crew actually managed to get before wind be only for few minute soon broached to again being by time almost entirely bereft of head sail foresail alone remaining there hung in wind eye helpless practically at mercy dolphin be at once placed in advantageous position on frigate starboard bow kept there by topsail being laid aback whilst brig took up corresponding position on enemy starboard quarter then opened raking fire upon so effectually that ten minute later hauled down colour surrendered chapter twenty privateer indiaman having satisfied ourselves that french frigate have actually struck filled on schooner ran down under lee of brig where once more hove to gig be lowered manned proceeded on board to see if service be further required on reaching deck be met by man of five thirty year of age evidently skipper of craft who held out hand to most cordially exclaimed welcome young gentleman on board britannic majesty brig dido hove in sight just in nick of time morning for for very effective help must have be captured instead of captor by time what be name of schooner dolphin replied cruising sixteen day out from port royal dolphin eh said well be remarkably fine powerful craft carry heavy metal too skipper evidently know how to handle what be name by bye modestly explained be in command of craft announcement created sensation among officer who have gathered round exclaimed skipper incredulously well then can only say young gentleman that be shaping well very well indeed there be not man in service who must have fought that vessel more gallantly with better judgment than did will take care to say so to admiral when get in have rendered very important service lad let tell for have not only saved old dido from being taken helped in capture of fine frigate have also saved most urgent important despatch have on board have lost many men in action not one said have so far a know single man with wound worth mentioning ah be lucky remarked for may thank heavy metal way in be served be able to cripple frigate before must touch well come down into cabin take glass of wine with whilst talk over what be next to be done mr thompson let mr rogers come down to with report when return from frigate now then mr ah way please by way did not catch name just now there be very good reason for a have never mentioned to however did so then informed that name be venn that held rank of commander by time that have come to understanding found in cabin much smaller plainer apartment than of dolphin by bye wine be produced drank glass together then new friend proceeded to explain to that a brig have suffered rather severely have have great many men wounded in running fight with frigate must be obliged to draw rather heavily upon dolphin to make up crew for prize that under circumstance considered must be advisable for to accompany dido prize into port royal arrangement suited very well indeed a thought just possible there might be letter for if not from father at least from inez be just about to return on board schooner to give necessary order when midshipman who have accompanied first lieutenant of dido on board prize to take possession returned with information that frigate be named cythere mounting thirty two twelve pounder with crew originally of three hundred twenty eight told loss during action amounting to thirty two killed sixty eight wounded captain being among former by eight bell in afternoon watch have managed to make up between transfer to frigate very respectable prize crew after hawser be passed on board prize from dido dolphin brig taking up position upon frigate larboard bow whilst stationed on starboard when sail be made upon towing vessel shaped course for jamaica prize crew busying meanwhile in getting up new spar repairing damage in standing running rigging by daylight next morning be so far accomplished that be able to cast off towing hawser when three craft proceeded in company arriving without mishap adventure in port royal harbour on morning of sixth day succeeding action commander venn be a good a word in framing report of capture in consequence of rose higher than ever in favour of admiral who showed appreciation of service by filling up provision water with possible speed hurrying off to sea again a have hoped there be two letter for one from father one from inez a former be written in same unsatisfactory strain a have preceded a latter contained nothing of interest to anyone will not trouble reader with even so much a extract from pas on to incident be destined to very materially affect happiness of whole future life that of others a well having filled up provision water a already stated having received on board again hand who have helped to take cythere into port sailed once more on second day following arrival proceeded again over ground have already beaten so successfully be even more fortunate on occasion than have be before though found that be no longer possible to take enemy by surprise a have done at first have learned wisdom from experience have become aware of tactic notwithstanding took four privateer one of cut out from under battery made several recapture two of proved to be very valuable a incident happened to be mere interlude a be in story having special significance will leave without further mention pas on reader will therefore please understand have be in command of dolphin rather more than six month when incident occurred to be about to refer time be about hour thereabouts after midnight position be about sixty mile south east of beata point southernmost point on mainland of saint domingo day have be fine with very nice pleasant working breeze a sun have declined toward horizon wind have shown sign of dropping gradually dying away after sunset until toward end of first watch have fallen so completely calm that have furled canvas to save wear tear be at time mentioned lying under bare pole slowly drifting with current to westward night be pitch dark for there be moon with dying away of wind great bank of heavy thunderous looking cloud have gradually worked up from westward imperceptibly expanding until have at length obscured entire firmament promising thunder storm must doubtless be heavier when broke from length of time took in brewing have remained on deck until midnight observing when middle watch be called that barometer have dropped only merest trifle have gone below upon deck being relieved leaving order with young boyne to call in event of change in weather have flung half undressed into cot hoping to get nap before storm broke feeling pretty confident that when did nothing very serious must happen schooner being under bare pole somehow must not get to sleep probably on account of oppressive closeness of atmosphere for be stiflingly hot although skylight companion be wide open there lay tossing restlessly from side to side in state of preternatural wakefulness listening to lap gurgle of water against ship side creaking of bulk head rattling of hook held cabin door wide open yerking of main sheet block jerk jerk of rudder of lashed wheel above with swish of water under counter about stern post a vessel rolled lazily upon long sluggish swell came creeping slowly up from eastward if by chance momentary feeling of drowsiness happened to steal over carefully fostered might have eventually led to falling asleep be sure to be put to flight by ill timed movement speech by on deck above although will do justice to say that so far a speech be concerned spoke seldom then in subdued tone at length however be going off varied sound have mentioned have lost distinctness have changed character be beginning to merge into accompaniment of what few minute later must have be dream when heard pottle voice exclaim with startling suddenness hillo what be to young boyne replied in unmistakably sleepy tone what be what mr pottle why replied pottle thought saw have look there be again did not see something like flash away off there on starboard beam sir said boyne evidently little more wide awake can not say did probably be lightning must have before long lightning exclaimed pottle contemptuously d 'ye think know lightning when see looked more like by george there be again at same moment one of men forward hailed must not catch what said for creaking of bulk head ay ay saw answered pottle what did look like to martin thought looked like flash of firearm be reply time heard distinctly so did gruffly remarked pottle depend o mr boyne there be something going on down there to south'ard ought to be looked into just step down below give mr lascelles call will ye sprang out of cot slipped stockingless foot into shoe drew on jacket met young boyne at cabin door well mr boyne said what be news heard mr pottle ask to call sir said lad say have seen something like flash of firearm down in southern quarter lookout also have reported right said will be up in moment turning up cabin lamp for instant to take look at barometer found to be steady stumbled up companion ladder blinking like owl in daylight made way out on deck whew exclaimed be darkness indeed where be mr pottle here be sir answered quarter master turning in direction of voice saw tiny glowing spark proved to be ignited end of cigar have between teeth now said a groped way to side whereaway be flashing appearance say saw just about in direction sir be reply stay may have swung bit since saw walked aft carefully raised jacket have thrown over lighted binnacle no continued that be where be just sou ' sou west for took bearing of when saw third time thought that in case of anything being wrong must be amiss to mask binnacle light quite right said peering first at compass card then away into opaque darkness prevented seeing even surface of water alongside be manifestly hopeless to think of seeing anything through such impenetrable obscurity a surrounded be just wondering what step to take under circumstance peering meanwhile in direction indicated by pottle when caught momentary glimpse of tiny spark like flash ejaculation of comrade told also have observed in instant glare of ghastly blue white radiance streamed out over sea revealed to two vessel alongside other canvas of one large lumbering full rigged ship gleaming spectrally in light of port fire whilst sail of other brigantine happened to be on side next stood out black a ebony against light be about two mile off even at distance must see with naked eye that struggle of sort be going forward on deck of larger of two craft nature of affair be apparent in moment to one of big ship be unmistakably indiaman probably fellow countryman at least so judged by imperfect view of canvas flickering light of port fire afforded whilst if appearance be to go for anything brigantine must be nothing else than french picaroon at event duty be now plain enough ought to investigate affair without moment unnecessary delay accordingly gave order for hand to be immediately called for pinnace two gig to be lowered manned be done with alacrity venture to believe must have gratified even old friend admiral in le than quarter of hour from moment of giving order be in boat well away from schooner pinnace be in charge of boatswain pottle have command of one of gig a there seemed to be prospect of worse outcome in shape of weather than thunder storm did not hesitate to take charge of other gig leaving woodford in temporary command of schooner with instruction how to proceed in event of breeze springing up before be able to rejoin port fire on board indiaman having long before burnt out have taken precaution to provide boat with compass light of be most carefully masked precaution soon proved to be unnecessary boat having traversed le than distance between schooner other two vessel when vivid sheet lightning began to play along south western horizon lighting up scene with weird radiance frequently enough to enable to steer perfectly straight course fight be still going on when left schooner appeared to cease soon afterwards came to conclusion that crew of indiaman have be overpowered ship taken chief anxiety now be lest approach must be discovered in time to enable frenchman to make preparation for resisting attempt to board when must arrive alongside fortunately for chief play of lightning be in quarter almost opposite that from be approaching be in hope that must be too busy just then plundering prize to keep very strict lookout in however be doomed to be disappointed for when have arrived within quarter of mile of brigantine sudden flashing of light appeared on board before must get alongside broadside of four gun loaded with grape be hastily discharged at luckily beyond revealing fact that have be discovered broadside did harm with cheer tar bent to oar with few lusty stroke sent alongside with rush brigantine long exceedingly rakish looking craft sat very low in water so that appeared to be one of easiest thing in world to scramble in over bulwark from boat found bulwark lined from stem to stern with a resolute looking set of fellow a one need wish to see reception of a regard warmth left absolutely nothing to be desired evidently knew fully appreciated advantage possessed over in having good roomy deck to fight upon seemed fully resolved to retain advantage a long a possible three separate distinct attempt did make to surmount low barrier a many time be forced back into boat occasion being marked by accession of three four to number of wounded on fourth occasion however determined that gain deck of brigantine must by hook by crook so calling collins coxswain of boat man to aid ordered to seize by leg fling on board did with regular man of war man one two three heave away went in over bulwark like rocket alighting fairly on shoulder of great burly fellow who have already lodged pistol bullet in fleshy part of left arm to whom consequently owed grudge beating down to deck only to find in very thickest of crowd man of seemed more anxious than others to get fair blow at be however by time mere novice in use of sword sooner felt fairly on foot than made weapon spin about adversary head in such good earnest that be compelled to recoil meanwhile lad have sooner launched into space than sprang after pressing forward to side with cutlass advanced soon made room enough for rest of party to follow though have gained deck have by mean won ship antagonist rallying time after time a drove back stubbornly contesting with possession of inch of plank meanwhile storm have so long be brewing have at length burst almost immediately overhead lightning flashing playing about mast head of ship with dazzling vividness be almost blinding whilst thunder crashed roared rolled along heaven absolutely without intermission general effect be impressive appalling in extreme must have be have be in mood to properly appreciate just then only thought mine at least with regard to be that afforded light enough to fight by to distinguish friend from foe be by friendly aid of lightning be in midst of melee enabled to identify object have once twice kicked from under foot a flannel cartridge have already noticed several charge of grape ranged along shot rack now occurred to that one of discharged into thick of enemy might help very materially to mitigate ardour so turning to of lad behind directed to run in one of gun load slue fore aft with muzzle pointing toward taffrail in direction be slowly pressing crew of brigantine be soon done when taking advantage of momentary lull in confusion of sound raged about shouted back dolphin into waist for life be about to treat to dose of grape lad luckily heard understood pressed forward with increased energy for moment huddling frenchman up in heap together just about companion way then suddenly retired forward leaving gun nine pounder grinning open mouthed fair at moment that last of men be fairly out of danger topman who have taken charge of gun discharged immediately rushed aft again charging through smoke found foe a have expected quite confused demoralised from effect of fire pressing upon more fiercely than ever compelled to throw down arm cry for quarter though not until have be compelled in self defence to run leader through with sword brigantine be now own so leaving pottle boatswain to secure prisoner task set about without moment delay rallied own boat crew about led on board indiaman to take possession of met with opposition whilst climbing ship lofty side on gaining deck group of half dozen figure be discovered mounting guard over fore scuttle despatching coxswain three hand to secure remainder of crew to hunt up stray frenchman who might happen to be lurking about deck turned step in direction of poop cabin calling one hand to attend at once made way thither one of door be standing wide open with brilliant stream of light pouring through lighting up massive mainmast gear attached to for height of twelve foot above deck revealing fact that quarter deck gun at least of vessel have never be

also be welcome son most welcome not only to also be sure to everyone else in cabin assurance be heartily echoed by everybody present with exception of unhappy lady in whose arm lay wounded child be evidently too much absorbed in own grief to notice be conscious of what be taking place sight of misery recalled to myself reminded of many duty yet have to perform so leaning over father pressing kiss upon forehead down by way blood be slowly trickling from slight cutlas wound said thank dear father for affectionate greeting must not remain longer with however for present glad a be to have so unexpectedly met have many matter yet must be attended to will rejoin without fail moment feel at liberty to do so meanwhile have fear of further violence strong detachment of crew be in possession of vessel schooner be not far distant will send men in to release companion from bond to help in putting matter straight once more a see that several of have be wounded in defence of ship will at once despatch boat if indeed be not already gone for dolphin surgeon many thanks to young gentleman for kind offer exclaimed one of occupant of sofa if will kindly draw knife across lashing of mine need not call surgeon away from own men who will be bound stand in greater need of service than do be doctor of ship if can only get hand leg free will soon attend to share of patient then help brother saw bone to attend to a well if indeed care to accept help thank dear sir said mr sanderson will be only too glad to avail of service know for fear casualty to night will prove to be very heavy when have time to reckon up allow at once set to work to cast worthy medico adrift father at same time performing like office for nearest having released doctor then hurried out on deck to see how matter be progressing encountered coxswain several of gig crew on quarter deck be just about to enter cabin in search of to report that ship have be searched frenchman on board secured passed down side into brigantine to inquire what must next do looking over indiaman lofty bulwark down on to deck of brigantine saw that there too prisoner have be secured passed below that lad be already busy overhauling prostrate body separating living from dead thereupon directed coxswain to release crew of indiaman who be at moment lying bound hand foot down in forecastle to rout out three lantern to hang lighted one above other in ship rigging a preconcerted signal to woodford that have be successful then to take gig with eight hand pull away to dolphin for doctor next task be to send couple of trustworthy hand into indiaman cabin to assist passenger in way might be found needful after scrambled down on board brigantine to see how matter be going there have just gained deck of prize when three lantern be displayed in indiaman rigging upon hearty cheer came ringing over water from great distance though must see nothing lightning having by time ceased soon heard measured roll rattle of sweep succeeded few minute later by arrival of dolphin alongside woodford having grown impatient determined to see for be going forward of course greatly facilitated matter a be enabled to transfer wounded directly on board schooner where sanderson be ready awaiting made first task casualty be very heavy a have feared must be five of attacking party being killed seventeen of wounded severely enough to need doctor service french loss being twenty two killed forty five wounded so desperate indeed have be defence that there be only three of who have escaped completely unscathed about hour after arrival of dolphin alongside prize doctor of indiaman came down to assist surgeon at same time reporting patient with one exception including skipper chief officer of whom have supposed to be dead to be doing well one melancholy exception be poor little boy have seen lying wounded in mother lap worthy doctor feared must not outlast night brave little fellow seemed from story told by doctor have be cruelly cut down by wretch have killed in revenge for child having resented with blow attempted insult to mother made by ruffian after crew male passenger of indiaman have be secured be not ashamed to say that on hearing regretted having slain villain felt that death by sword be too good for hanging in chain being more in accordance with desert here may state that seemed more than probable must be ultimate fate of survivor of brigantine crew for although claimed that vessel be letter of marque paper must be found to substantiate claim although allowed chief officer facility to find produce if must at length having seen wounded attended to made a comfortable a possible having told off prize crew for brigantine placed woodford in command of indiaman with dozen dolphin to assist own crew in navigating vessel returned on board have short pleasant interview with father be broken in upon by woodford with report that breeze be springing up therefore bade hasty adieu to passenger most of whom have by time in great measure recovered equanimity hastened on board schooner when three vessel be cast adrift sail trimmed to gentle easterly breeze course shaped for jamaica being intention to escort prize into port on following morning weather being fine have gig lowered went on board indiaman may here mention be named truxillo brigantine being named clarice when for first time heard account of circumstance attending capture hailed appeared from london from port have originally sailed having on board twenty two adult passenger with five child specie amounting to one hundred fifty thousand pound very valuable general cargo for kingston have joined convoy at plymouth have sailed with going well with fleet until reached neighbourhood of latitude degree north longitude degree west when hurricane be encountered completely scattered convoy compelled truxillo to run to southward for three day under bare pole be of course almost hopeless to think of falling in with fleet again after hurricane have blown out fleet no longer existed in fact ship of be composed having be pretty effectually dispersed a soon therefore a must make sail again captain barnes master of truxillo determined to shape course for jamaica take chance of being able to reach unmolested determination have put into effect with most satisfactory result up to moment of capture only two sail having be sighted in interim neither of have taken slightest notice of when on preceding evening just before sunset lookout have sighted reported clarice did appearance excite least uneasiness be so small vessel compared with truxillo that nobody condescended to honour with more than glance of most cursory description moreover being discovered on starboard bow reaching out from direction wherein land be known to be with yard artfully ill braced canvas badly set running gear hanging in bight speed retarded by topmast studding sail being dropped overboard towed from lee quarter le than of veriest noah ark of north country collier be at once set down a harmless coaster further notice taken of so skilfully indeed have french skipper managed approach that even when shortly after midnight vessel dropped alongside indiaman occurrence be regarded a nothing more than accident of most trivial character be not until crew be actually swarming up truxillo lofty side that alarm be given crew snatching handspike belaying pin billet of wood from galley other weapon must first lay hand on too late bestirred in defence of ship notwithstanding total lack of preparation english made sturdy protracted resistance affording passenger ample time to arm when at indiaman crew be driven below captain chief mate retreated to cabin with assistance of male passenger successfully held for fully twenty minute after other part of ship be in possession of enemy be during resistance that two officer named received such serious wound a prostrated on saloon floor apparently lifeless be only with fall that resistance terminated fight over male passenger be promptly disarmed secured scene of pillage violence introduction to be insult offered to one of lady passenger cruel cutlas stroke inflicted upon almost infant son for resenting be just commencing when be happily cut short by appearance of dolphin boat upon scene weather continuing fine remained on board truxillo until well on in afternoon taking luncheon with passenger at one o'clock many be compliment oft reiterated thanks bestowed upon for what be pleased to term gallantry in rescuing from clutch of french desperado many of gentleman be officer belonging to various regiment quartered on island who have be home on furlough whilst of lady be wife of officer already there whom be going out to join from what gentleman said felt sure that conduct must on arrival be so well reported a to do utmost possible service with admiral father too came in for share of compliment congratulation at being parent of son gratified more than rest for must see that be proud pleased a may well be imagined be most anxious to have private chat with opportunity for have yet occurred so at length seeing that notwithstanding obvious wish on part of everybody to leave for time to ourselves be constantly being interrupted proposed to visit to dolphin saucy craft under topsail fore trysail jib only be sailing round round truxillo notwithstanding that latter craft be covered with canvas from truck down proposal be eagerly acceded to gig have be towing astern in charge of boat keeper be accordingly hauled up alongside crew tumbled down into in few minute found once more at home how different everything looked here to be sure from what did on board indiaman snow white deck unencumbered by anything save long boat pinnace stowed upon boom handsome range of formidable gun on side with gear symmetrically arranged tackle fall neatly coiled down substantial bulwark topped by immaculate hammock cloth gleaming polished brass work of various deck fitting taunt spar with orderly maze of standing running rigging broad expanse of gleaming well cut canvas last by mean least stalwart sun burned crew in neat clean fine weather suit presented striking contrast to scene on board truxillo where confusion disorder very perceptible amount of dirt still reigned supreme father however did not appear to notice difference possibly agitation be too great to permit of being keenly sensible to outward surroundings knew that moment for full complete explanation of mystery connected with strange unreasoning jealousy have cherished against mother have arrived whilst fancied that be equally eager with that explanation must be made must not help seeing that at same time shrank from ordeal be not so with instinctively felt that whatever nature of revelation about to be made to there must be sufficiently weak point somewhere in evidence to cast serious doubt upon whole must be able to discover assail weak point in such manner a not only to satisfy also father that be wrong be not entirely hopeless of being also able to discover clue patiently followed up must eventually lead to satisfactory clearing up of everything so took father arm conducted below into cabin rang for wine glass a soon a steward have disappeared leaned over table toward said well dear father at last be alone can talk unrestrainedly of course have thousand question to ask so will commence by inquiring to what happy chance be indebted for pleasure of most unexpected meeting with will tell leo said father be here because must no longer overcome longing to see that letter of yours written after escape from la guayra in reply to several of mine gathered from what said reached at same time be salvation mentally physically healthy manly common sense tone acted upon morbidly affected mind like strong tonic mingled with wine swept away mist have beclouded intellect a keen fresh mountain breeze sweep morning fog from out valley set thinking asking question have never occurred to before nay more caused sweet blossom of hope to spring up within heart finally aroused within belief superstition perhaps must be better word that if must unite force what be now dark might be made light must taste of happiness once more must begin story at beginning see that be only mystified by what have already said want explanation will have be twenty six year of age when first saw mother be staying at amalfi at time be in old chateau among hill fifteen mile so in rear of town that first met have seen portrait perhaps have still be therefore able to judge of appearance for yourself fell in love with at first sight having be fortunate enough a then thought to favourably impress old uncle only relative with whom be living followed up first accidental introduction to inmate of chateau until have ripened into close intimacy if be attracted toward mother in first instance by beauty be still more powerfully attracted afterwards by many accomplishment above by gentleness amiability of disposition charming innocence truth unsophisticated ingenuousness of character thought have discovered in be with feeling of indescribable pleasure exultation be soon able to detect in maria bisaccia beaming yet half averted eye blushing cheek when met evidence of growing attachment for did everything in power to foster strengthen uncle flavio seemed quickly to guess at wish with frankness yet at same time stately dignity greatly raised old gentleman in estimation took early opportunity to acquaint with fact that though of italy best blood flowed through niece vein be absolutely penniless that however made difference whatever to excepting that perhaps rather stimulated ardour than otherwise loved mother for even then be doing good work at event work be well spoken of fetched good price so that thought of marrying for money did not particularly commend to at length when felt sufficiently certain of own feeling to justify such step proposed be accepted with sweet half shyness half abandon of manner be a piquant charming in effect a afterwards have reason to believe be consummately skilful piece of acting now interrupt leo wait until have heard to end before attempt to judge well not to drag out story to undue length after acquaintance of six month be married be about month after date that miniature be painted gave removed to rome taking up quarter in roomy somewhat dilapidated old villa on outskirt of city where having now someone something worth working for devoted in good earnest to study pursuit of art at outset of married life perhaps must be more accurate to say happiness be complete time at length arrived when be obliged to ask whether have not after made mistake mother manner demeanour to be from very first characterised by certain shyness timidity reserve charming proper enough a might be in maiden even in new made bride fully expected hoped must gradually wear off under influence of such intimate association a of wedded life did not accorded to rather respectful anxiously timid obedience of slave to owner than frank spontaneous affection of wife for husband not that be cold unresponsive to demonstration of affection received returned with diffidence lasted longer than quite liked much longer than thought ought to last then suddenly without slightest apparent cause began to manifest symptom of restlessness anxiety preoccupation vainly strove to conceal beneath assumption of increased tenderness obviously costing very great effort uneasiness be so unmistakable that at length finding did not take into confidence seek assistance in way questioned about be shocked grieved beyond expression to meet only with equivocating evasive reply to question then for first time began to suspect that when have married be only second in affection result be that after severe struggle with took measure to have wife watched step soon resulted in discovery that woman whom loved with such extravagant devotion whom have up to then believed equally devoted to be in habit of secretly meeting young italian after nightfall in secluded spot at bottom of own garden so great even then be faith in mother leo must not credit intelligence to indignantly gave lie upon be challenged to personally test accuracy for if dared after there remained one course of action open to heaven know with what reluctance took found that what have be told be only too true for secretly witnessed no le than three meeting between mother young man whom imperfectly a must distinguish form feature in dusk felt convinced have somewhere seen before at length after so prolonged visit that be surprised by rising moon feature thus more fully revealed to identified mother visitor a young fellow named giuseppe merlani whom why what be matter leo why do look at like one must swear have seen ghost what be boy nothing nothing replied will tell by bye father go on with story now let know worst know worst already leo answered father will naturally wonder why did not break in upon first interview witnessed demand explanation will tell why did not be because there be really nothing beyond clandestine character of interview to must fairly object place of concealment be unfortunately so far distant from trysting place be only able to indistinctly catch occasional word two when spoken in incautiously loud tone of voice will do mother justice to say that there be nothing in manner to awaken anger felt that what resented a want of loyalty to consisted in mere act of clandestinely meeting conversing with young merlani whom upon recognising at once remembered a having be somewhat frequent visitor to chateau bisaccia when first made mother acquaintance at length interview took place proved to be final one at interview saw mother place package in merlani hand yield for moment to embrace then retreat precipitately to house in state of violent agitation be then that for first time clear intelligible explanation of singular meeting dawned upon realised in moment have be duped by woman whose chief attraction have for consisted not so much in surpassing loveliness of person though doubtless have have effect upon a in angelic purity fascinating simplicity truthfulness of character now discovered to be mere worthless sham be evident enough that merlani have be lover most probably accepted lover when appeared upon scene that dazzled by appearance of superior wealth have in most heartless cruel manner thrown overboard with cunning artfulness even then seemed incredible to laid out only too successfully to ensnare by becoming wife to secure for comfort luxury merlani poor shiftless scamp that be must never have afforded now of must not perhaps have vexed so much for never entertained very high opinion of feminine conscientiousness scrupulosity have when accepting be frank enough to admit that whilst be willing to do so entertained very ardent sentiment of regard for what inflicted incurable wound alike upon pride love be fact that have responded to suit with assurance of reciprocated affection be assumed with consummate art to mind made worst feature of be that by diabolical spell have won to love a verily believe woman be never loved before then to discover in moment that love for be mere fiction at rate secondary sentiment although even with such evidence before eye a what have already described to must scarcely realise that idol worshipped be at best very incarnation of falsehood unworthiness be altogether too much for brooded fretted over until must endure no longer then one day when seemed striving to weave anew round heart fatal spell of endearment broke away from embrace suddenly taxed with perfidy charging with purchasing former lover absence silence by sacrifice of jewel whole of have soon ascertained be missing hoped for moment that sudden outburst taking by surprise must startle into making confession self possession even at trying moment be perfect for perhaps minute stood speechless regarding with rapidly changing expression of countenance in incredulity surprise horror grief indignation finally withering scorn contempt be portrayed with amount of power skill have never seen equalled then retired to own apartment locked in refused to see for more than week when at length met endeavoured in somewhat calmer tone to reopen subject positively refused to listen to single word until have apologised to for what chose to designate base insulting suspicion for whom only have hitherto lived have insulted humbled to very dust ' said conduct admits of simple easy explanation will never make until have at least acknowledged hasty in bringing so shameful charge against without previous attempt to ascertain truth considered be under circumstance asking rather too much yet after hurling defiance at mother conduct be so gentle yet dignified so perfectly possessed that at time felt almost inclined to believe have be victim of horrible hallucination that wife be innocent of deceit with have charged well need not linger over part of story can easily understand that domestic happiness be destroyed month later establishment be broken up removed to england there in london in house know so well be born about six month after occurrence of circumstance have related unfortunately happened that urgent business called into country just at particular time may imagine shock received when on returning home found whole house in confusion learned that have be six hour parent one short half hour widower mother died quite suddenly without even time to leave intelligible message be told that last word be cuthbert darling cruel unjust suspicion innocent that a last word escaped lip passed away at point of narrative father voice suddenly broke with wail of uncontrollable anguish exclamation of heaven have mercy upon heal broken heart flung arm out upon cabin table laid head upon sobbed aloud chapter twenty two foundering of dolphin allowed first paroxysm of father grief to wear out unchecked uninterrupted when have somewhat recovered calmness laid hand upon shoulder said father listen to have told whole story have listened to word of most attentively though admit that be singular enough history have not yet mentioned one single circumstance directly inculpating mother for part believe be innocent of duplicity charged with that only spoke truth when asserted that conduct admitted of simple easy explanation do really believe that leo on honour a gentleman demanded father eagerly believe sir a implicitly a do fact of own existence well said father sighing heavily there have be time when have felt almost disposed to do so too what blessed relief must be to if must believe altogether be distracting doubt be wearing life reason away be same doubt prevented enjoying company when be child almost succeeded in destroying natural affection for be doubt caused to neglect a did when be most in need of parent love care be same doubt again forgive for saying leo caused almost to rejoice when first contemplated possibility of being killed in mutiny well said be strange confession for father to make to own son strange feeling for parent to entertain toward own offspring how do account for sir will tell leo said father sit down son look at so coldly if have passed through a many year of mental anguish a have endured must wonder not so much that idea have be warped distorted a reason have not altogether given way beneath strain for leo want to understand loved mother loved repeated fiercely with strange maniacal gleam flashing in eye then after pausing for moment recovering control of by powerful effort continued what be question oh yes remember in first place be a child strikingly like mother be so even now although likeness be longer so marked a be thus be constant reminder to of one who have first raised to highest pinnacle of human bliss only to hurl thence into lowest depth of grief humiliation then wonderful physical resemblance to mother caused to dread that must also inherit character that must grow up deceitful untrustworthy connect two feeling with unbalanced state of mind will easily understand rest miserable state of thing remained with up to time of receiving letter penned by after escape from la guayra will not be surprised to learn after so many year of mental anguish a acute at end a be at beginning letter found with health undermined reason tottering in hourly danger of dropping into suicide grave that letter leo aroused dispelled unhealthy vapour from mind caused to see circumstance in totally different light from in have regarded before finally impelled to take ship come out here to join a idea suddenly took hold upon that with aid of young healthy vigorous common sense intellect question have tormented year might after be definitely settled one way other now have not only bitter secret of life leo explanation of being on board indiaman warmly grasped hand father extended to across table said believe father have done well to come out here indeed might almost venture to say that decision to do so seems providential a perhaps too will think when tell that certain giuseppe merlani italian be notorious character in region not that think probable can be individual who have caused trouble for be pirate can scarcely realise possibility of anyone who have ever enjoyed poor mother acquaintance degenerating into character a of pirate let be a may now that be together have longer secret from other can talk whole affair unreservedly over together depend upon father will eventually succeed in satisfactorily demonstrating mother truthfulness groundlessness of suspicion that held subordinate place in affection may mercy grant leo fervently ejaculated father then sat down more composedly talked whole affair over again asking question on such point a seemed to need further explanation father replying to until thought have gained information be possible for to give be especially particular in question respecting man merlani though father be unable to tell much about little learned sufficed to arrive at conclusion that friend hero of conconil lagoon might after turn out to be same individual only point puzzled be if such be really case in what possible way must such man have ever be associated with mother weather continued fine on afternoon of day following long conversation little fleet sailed into port royal harbour anchored not far from mar on going on board flag ship to report learned that admiral have left for penn nearly couple of hour before whilst chatting with captain ayres however signal midshipman belonging to mar reported signal from penn turned out to be number on being answered by dolphin be followed by invitation to to join old friend at dinner having evidently noticed arrival recognised schooner on way home of course lost time in obeying signal thinking might venture upon liberty took father with be received with utmost cordiality to in own case be added many expression of warm approval of conduct then learned that have arrived day earlier must have have opportunity of once more meeting old friend courtenay who have sailed that morning after having brought in large french merchantman with valuable cargo have be lucky enough to fall in with capture mention of courtenay afforded very good opportunity to ask if anything further have be seen heard of merlani schooner in reply to admiral assured that though gallant young shipmate have most assiduously sought pirate nothing further have be seen of be thought that disheartened by destruction of stronghold have left that part of world altogether during course of evening admiral informed that return have happened most opportunely inquired of how long must be before must sail again a wished to proceed to sea with possible despatch on important mission replied that if cruise be to be only short one say of fortnight so must go to sea again next morning if be likely to be protracted beyond date must wish to replenish stock of provision water before leaving port upon that ordered to haul in alongside dockyard wharf next morning if rigging needed overhauling to see to at once a must endeavour to get off again in three day at latest father slept at penn night next morning on way down to schooner established in comfortable quarter recommended by admiral on southernmost spur of long mountain where in addition to pure healthy atmosphere must have advantage of magnificent view of harbour sea to southward a well a long range of superb tropical landscape upon to exercise power of brush during absence in course of morning after dolphin have be hauled in alongside wharf fidd have set hand to work overhauling rigging learned from admiral that be intention to send down on venezuelan coast to cruise in conjunction with former acquaintance dido on lookout for spanish treasure ship be rumoured be about to sail from cartagena with important despatch of such consequence be capture of ship considered be frankly told couple of frigate must have be sent to look after have such be available unfortunately however there be none in harbour when intelligence have be received four day before dido therefore being only ship then at liberty have be despatched forthwith be now to follow so must spaniard slip through hand of one other might have chance to pick up by afternoon of third day dolphin be once more ready for sea on reporting to admiral at once received order be directed to be off at once a have quite expected have run up during morning to see say good bye to father have nothing therefore to detain by sunset be again at sea clear of shoal standing away to southward with stitch of canvas spread that schooner must stagger under instruction be to first of proceed to coast near cartagena endeavour by mean might happen to present to obtain information of date of sailing of treasure ship in event of being successful to then cruise to eastward on lookout for dido on falling in with be to communicate to captain venn such intelligence a might have picked up thereafter act under instruction if failed to meet with dido be to do best to capture spaniard unaided if appeared too heavy for to tackle single handed to follow keep in sight until must obtain assistance a information to hand respecting treasure ship be very meagre admiral have urged to use expedition in first place to reach coast secure if possible reliable intelligence therefore carried on night whole of next day being favoured with fine breeze making such good progress twenty four hour after sailing have accomplished nearly distance towards close of afternoon watch however wind showed sign of failing did so rapidly that by two bell in first dog watch canvas be thrashing threadbare against mast schooner be rolling gunwale under a headed round compass atmosphere be hot close almost to point of suffocation sky though perfectly cloudless be thick hazy sun a drooped toward horizon glowed like red hot ball whilst vapour through be seen magnified to at least three time ordinary dimension what do think of weather mr pottle said to quarter master a left boatswain strolled aft from waist where two have be jogging fore aft together for last half hour regarding sky few minute with somewhat ostentatious glance of anxiety well sir hardly know what to make of be reply mr fidd have be comparing note together boatswain have be long time on station a perhaps know sir say doe half like look of in fact remarked to not five minute ago that must be surprised to find that hurricane be brewing have looked at glass lately sir not since noon said be pretty steady then with slight tendency to drop be true nothing to speak of let see what say now turned to open sky light looked down through barometer be for convenience hung in sky light so that might be consulted with equal facility either from deck cabin single glance sufficed to show that mercury have fallen full inch since instrument have be set in morning depend upon sir fidd be right be in for blow remarked pottle whether continued seems pity to let canvas beat to piece for good a be doing now will stow sir there be occasion to call hand watch be strong enough to tackle job looked round once more at weather there be not breath of wind anywhere water undisturbed by faintest indication of cat paw showed surface like polished steel swell be fast going down sun just touching horizon be of fierce fiery red colour apparently swollen to abnormal dimension save for angry lurid glare of luminary very perceptible thickening of atmosphere there did not appear to be anything out of common still be not altogether satisfied have feeling that something be about to happen took look at barometer mercury have visibly dropped still further in few minute have elapsed since last looked at yes said clew up furl everything mr pottle if please let watch set about job at once see that make close furl of whilst be about ay ay sir be answer hand shorten sail haul down clew up fore aft in with everything settle away peak main halliard let get big mainsail snug under cover first thing in main topmast staysail let go topgallant topsail halliard clew up furl sail man jib staysail downhauls let go halliard haul down lay out there for'ard stow jib will send royal topgallant yard down on deck sir house topmast whilst be about may a well replied if come on to blow heavily schooner will be easier if relieved of top hamper if turn out to be false alarm why can soon get ataunto again there will be harm done men many of whom be thoroughly seasoned experienced hand have evidently be feeling anxious seemed glad enough to find officer on alert if one might judge by activity with went about work eagerness evinced to get expeditiously performed by time that everything be made ship under bare pole gun secured with extra tackle what not be pitch dark darker indeed if such be possible than on night of adventure with indiaman still there be sign of change so when steward summoned to dinner have hesitation about following leaving deck in charge of gunner with instruction to keep eye ear open to call moment have reason to believe breeze be coming dinner over again went on deck still change air seemed thick hot a breath of furnace so still that flame of candle brought on deck burned straight up save when roll of vessel caused to waver to port to starboard a case might be after think be going to be anything sir unless mayhap thunder storm like one have commenced gunner a stood looking round horizon vainly endeavouring to pierce darkness enveloped hark interrupted do hear that tompion low moaning sound have become audible in atmosphere away apparently on starboard beam a listened gradually increased in intensity until have become rushing roar so loud a to almost drown human voice even when raised to highest pitch ay ay sir hear sure enough be reply be coming now look out sir lay hold on anything can put hand upon hard starboard with helm look out there for'ard louder louder grew sound until became absolutely deafening then with awful overwhelming rush gale burst upon struck schooner fair on starboard broadside stout staunch a be craft bowed beneath until larboard gunwale be buried good heaven thought be going over be going to turn turtle with a felt incline of deck getting steeper steeper beneath foot turned clawed way aft toward wheel on reaching found there be someone already there hard weather over with man hard over yelled a got hold of spoke vainly strove to move helm be hard weather sir shrieked tompion voice in reply be done for sir if wo pay off be bound to capsize stick to shouted back a threw whole weight on spoke to leeward can feel tremor in wheel be gathering head way such be indeed case after few breathless second during seemed that inch of inclination must have sufficed to turn bottom up schooner began to right recovering at last with jerk filled deck fore aft with water flying away before gale like frightened steed craft always steered like little boat once fairly before wind tompion must easily keep there single handed so letting go wheel slanting backward against force of blast pressed upon body like solid wall demanded strength to prevent being helplessly run forward made snatch at binnacle peered into be heading due east be great relief to mind a knew that have plenty of sea room in direction must run for day if need be without bringing up against anything man came working way aft hauling along by bulwark to relieve wheel tompion joined under partial shelter of companion be narrow squeak sir if ever there be one remarked when joined at wheel must have given brass farthing for chance will do well enough now at event until sea rise even then feel particular duberous schooner be a fine sea boat a ever be launched 'd sooner take chance of riding out gale in than in seventy four have known yes replied think will be right now wonder whether have sustained damage aloft impossible to say yet sir returned tompion will know soon enough however be marcy a yard be sent down on deck topmast housed if 'd be on end must have made more than extra leverage enough to have capsized be to be hoped have plenty of sea room ahead of sir satisfied mind upon point gunner then went forward to see whether men be right returning shortly afterwards with satisfactory intelligence that be sea rose with frightful rapidity notwithstanding that wind in furious career caught crest of wave a rose swept through air in drenching blinding torrent of scud water in hour from bursting of hurricane found exposed to new danger that of being pooped swamped by mountainous sea came rushing after towering high above taffrail momentarily threatening to break on board turned to tompion who be standing abaft near helmsman tompion said must get canvas of sort upon ship will be overrun by sea do think might venture to set foresail close reefed lord bless mr lascelles be reply canvas ai wove that 'd stand single minute before such howlin gale a here 'd be blown clean out of gasket if be to cast single one of loose indeed must be bit surprised to find sail blown away from spar a be when get light enough to see how little barkie have come out of scrimmage still if so be a think fit to give order look out hold on everybody fore aft here come shouted interrupting tompion for at moment caught sight of enormous wave rushing after with gleaming white phosphorescent crest towering dozen foot above taffrail curling over in such manner saw must inevitably break on board have just time to spring to foot of mainmast grasp rope end when down thundered upon deck completely burying overwhelming schooner fore aft filling deck to rail sweeping forward with such irresistible power that arm be almost torn from socket a held on for dear life to rope have grasped have heard crash even above howling of gale rush of water a be swept off foot made up mind that schooner be doomed nothing thought must withstand rush power of so tremendous body of water a have swept over ship if ever rose again be quite prepared to find that everything above level of deck have be carried away that hull be full of water ready to founder beneath next sea might strike at length half drowned once more found foot got head above water there be little more light in sky eye have become accustomed in measure to gloom perhaps be phosphorescence of sea helped at event there be light enough from source to enable to see that schooner have relieved from mountain of water have overwhelmed be still afloat first glance be aft must confess be a surprised a be pleased to see tompion helmsman be still on board that wheel be intact bulwark however excepting ten foot so on quarter be gone throughout whole length of ship so far a must see sky light be smashed to atom leaving great yawning hole in deck boat have disappeared from boom must see sign of anyone moving about on forecastle a stood bewildered trying to recover scattered sens tompion made way along deck to be right sir asked yes be believe so tompion be right tight sir thank god answered gunner be afraid be bad job with hand for'ard sir see anybody moving about yes there be there be one man two will see if ca reach fo cbe'le find out extent of damage if there be hand enough left to do must get canvas on ship at once a said sir such job a last 'd finish a be ship must be nearly half full of water must get plank tarpaulin over hole in deck first thing however will go for'ard see what can be done watching chance companion made sudden rush along deck toward forecastle gained in safety from returned in about five minute followed by carpenter several men with gratifying intelligence so far a must ascertain only two of crew be missing forecastle however be reported to be nearly three foot deep in water heavy sickly heave of ship told too plainly that whilst have already experienced very narrow escape there be undoubtedly great deal of water in hold that be in most critical situation without waiting to sound well ordered pump to be rigged manned forthwith carpenter with dozen hand at same time setting out to get lumber tarpaulin necessary for closing up yawning aperture in deck left by demolished sky light meanwhile gang of men under woodford master be busy forward trying to loose reef set foresail carpenter gang have found what wanted be busy with work when helmsman gave warning cry at same moment sea came tumbling inboard not so heavy a first certainly sufficient to flood deck to depth of couple of foot heard water pouring down into cabin like cataract happened five six time in succession men being time driven from work labour rendered of avail at length unusually heavy sea broke on board when deck be once more clear water must be plainly heard rushing about in hold with heave roll of ship be foundering be foundering man for be now cry men made rush to two boat still hanging to davit groan of despair burst from poor fellow a on one of jumping into to clear away for lowering be found that boat must swim of bottom planking being driven out in case saw now that dolphin be doomed ship awful chasm in deck must never be covered in made secure in time to prevent foundering therefore rapidly cast over in mind what must be best to do in minute have necessary idea seemed have at same moment presented to carpenter for staggered toward hoarsely shouted into ear ship ca live ten minute longer sir better cut away mast so a to leave something to cling to when go from under yes said do at once steady men continued out knife one of cut away rope attached

dropped whatever happened to have in hand sprang forward waved to helmsman who up to moment have stuck most nobly to perilous post understanding let go wheel rushed past after shipmate on swept wave water gathering up round quarter of devoted schooner until began to pour in over taffrail nothing now must save dolphin hour have come glanced wildly round deck saw indistinctly through gloom dark blot like crowd of men clustered together in gangway waiting to spring for wreck of foremast a body of wave came roaring foaming in over stern felt deck canting upward under weight too staggered up

hurled in among crowding men be jostled dragged to fro a sea closed over head end bight of rope wreathed twisted about limb body received several violent blow from what supposed be floating piece of wreckage found in moment inextricably entangled in raffle of cordage tightened about body until must move neither hand foot then there came great singing in ear felt be being dragged irresistibly

found be with number of others on wreck of foremast with attached have fortunately broken adrift from wreck a foundered be now floating with yard underneath just a have originally gone over bow be that collins asked when have at length recovered breath enough to speak ay ay sir be safe enough thank god be answer glad to find a be alive hearty sir thank collins how many do muster here there be such net work of raffle across face can scarcely see know exactly sir be too dark to count seem to muster pretty strong thing considered will soon have clear sir now then bill stand by to haul mr lascelles out of thick of bight turn whilst hold up now then haul be that better sir very much better thank said a dragged out clear of thickest of raffia if be seated firmly enough for to put arm

glad to find among mr lascelles be afraid be among missing at first be here all right said sound think with exception of few bruise be there other officer among be here replied pottle said woodford added marchmont younger of two midshipman well done thought be better than dared hope invited speaker to join in comparatively sheltered position in crosstrees when have done so effort be made to ascertain extent of loss after great deal of difficulty found consisted of surgeon boatswain senior mid fifty men leaving thirty two clinging to foremast be very heavy loss felt so bitterly that for first half hour after be ascertained almost regretted own preservation feeling however be nothing short of impious ingratitude so on reflection recognised to be with unspoken prayer therefore for pardon to great being who have so mercifully preserved strove to divert thought from melancholy reflection assailed by endeavour to devise mean for continued preservation after long consultation with woodford respecting probable position be agreed between that a soon a weather moderated sea went down sufficiently endeavour must be made to construct sort of raft out of wreckage be then supporting on to make way if possible to southward hoping to be fallen in with picked up by dido failing must try to reach mainland seize small vessel give up to spaniard according a circumstance turned out have just come to above mentioned conclusion when collins remarked hopefully gale seems to have broken sir be certainly not blowing so hard sea seem to be breaking quite so heavily look sir look lad sky be breaking away overhead can see star ah be gone again there be hurrah hearties keep up spirit hold on to spar like grim death will weather upon old davy yet bout be quite true sky be rapidly clearing hour later be brilliant starlight night wind too be dropping rapidly sea no longer broke so heavily so incessantly over a have done at first fortunately for water be quite warm therefore suffered inconvenience from immersion at length after what seemed to endless night day broke atmosphere be gloriously bright clear wind have dropped to fine topgallant breeze sea have gone down sufficiently to allow of commencing operation a therefore have breakfast to get anything else to detain started at once hand be soon busy cutting adrift spar knotting splicing cordage in other way forwarding work a actively a possible under circumstance found however that have long from lack of sufficient timber difficult job before a morning wore on be made additionally so by appearance of several ravenous shark close to be only restrained from making attack by incessant splashing maintained by hand except half dozen must spare to get on with work at length be getting well on in afternoon by appearance of sun when in despite of difficulty be beginning to bring raft into something like shape be suddenly startled from work by hoarse cry of sail ho raised by one of men lifting eye from work waited until rose to top of wave when there be sure enough large ship apparently under topsail approaching from southward westward only about five mile distant hearty cheer be at once raised by hand at unexpected prospect of rescue then went to work once more with renewed vigour activity to establish mean of making presence known a felt convinced that though be heading straight for have not yet be discovered by will be remembered that when making preparation for gale have sent down topgallant royal yard when project of cutting away mast to serve a last retreat for crew have be carried out somebody have have forethought to get spar overboard secured to wreck of foremast in subsequently planning raft have be intention to get topgallant yard on end to serve a mast with sail a mean of propulsion through water plan be not carried out to stage of completeness a when strange sail hove in sight energy be now employed to get part of work done forthwith a felt convinced that lying so low in water a be might be passed at very short distance unobserved unless must raise spar of sort to attract attention owing to very limited amount of standing room aggravating way in water still washed over structure particular task of getting topgallant yard on end proved most difficult be still struggling ineffectually for success when loud groan of disappointment instantly followed by frantic hail told that something be wrong looking again toward ship now distant only two mile saw that have altered course couple of point by proceeding must pas to southward of without approaching nearer for minute two something very like panic took possession of hand everybody began to shout gesticulate to utmost of ability without reference to effort of rest at length however woodford managed between to secure silence upon directed whilst a many a must do so must stand up wave jacket shirt other article most handy whole must at given signal unite in simultaneous hail did waiting time until rose to crest of sea soon became evident that voice be not powerful enough to reach ship never expected that must be for swept on unheeding be very soon to eastward of increasing distance minute most disheartening state of affair continued until have run about three mile to leeward of when suddenly saw round to back main yard ought to mention by bye that have ere discovered to be full rigged ship not dido a have at first declared to be with mizzen topmast fore main topgallant mast gone showing that too must have encountered hurricane have proved so disastrous to be evidently foreigner many of pronounced to be spaniard thought that if so be more than probable be identical vessel have be sent out to look for hurrah shouted tompion a stranger rounded to see hearties look if eye deceive there go one of quarter boat down into water now ai that just like lubberly spaniard to lie there with main topsail to mast give boat crew three mile pull to windward when might just a well make couple of short board heave to within cable length of by time have scrambled to foot be with dozen others watching with mingled curiosity apprehension movement of stranger be certainly not such a must have expected to make have object in heaving to be rescue boat have certainly be lowered have not a yet caught glimpse of from exasperating circumstance that whenever rose upon sea boat happened to be sunk in hollow at length however got moment view of not only of also of something else looked remarkably like raft piece of wreckage be toward that boat be steering not toward by heaven exclaimed have not seen after be not coming here unless can make hear within next ten minute chance will be lost be piece of wreckage possibly part of poor old dolphin that have stopped to examine must shout lad with will ship be to leeward of may catch sound now then when rise stand by one two three ship ahoy shouted a have probably never shouted before not once at least fifty time shouted hoarse at last have vexation to see boat being again hoisted up now fully expected to see ship immediately bear up on course did not topsail remained aback for nearly ten minute longer during continued to shout wave for very life at length however ponderous main yard swung square canvas be braced sharp up ship gathered way breathless half minute passed during eye among be unwaveringly fixed upon distant ship except when vanished behind wave crest then joyous shout went up now see be standing way hurrah hurrah in midst of boom of gun came sullenly up against wind from stranger a assurance of help rescue oh how anxiously watched noble fabric a ponderously ploughed way obliquely toward over liquid ridge now plunging to hawse hole rolling heavily to leeward a dived into trough anon raising dripping bow richly carved gilt high in air a slowly climbed to surge crest motion be slow stately for wind have dropped very considerably whilst owing to loss of upper spar be under short canvas approach consequently seemed to most tediously slow at length however arrived within biscuit throw of backed main topsail again once more lowered boat dozen oar stroke sufficed to bring alongside raft bowman laid in oar hove rope a did so officer in charge of boat young man in undress uniform of spanish naval lieutenant rose to foot in stern sheet raising hat to little cluster of uniform saw among said in spanish be portion of crew of dolphin british cruiser foundered last night be answered very much surprised at question wondering how in world came to know anything about dolphin having foundered then said will be gratified to learn that have already picked up twenty six of company discovered about three mile to leeward floating on portion of ship deck be in consequence of representation made to captain by one of officer picked up by that examination of sea be made from masthead resulting in discovery will not waste time by entering into further explanation at present have honour of addressing captain of dolphin be commanding officer replied thank greatly for pleasing intelligence have so promptly afforded how many of can take at once be afraid dare not venture alongside with more than twelve in addition to boat crew swell be still very heavy will have goodness to tell off number for first trip called out name of men one by one a boat be brought cautiously alongside raft in few minute complement be complete adieu senor lascelles said young officer raising hat again a shoved off will not leave in present uncomfortable position one moment longer than be absolutely necessary mechanically returned salute again wondering where have picked up name until occurred to that must have heard mentioned by of party taken off floating deck news that loss be not a heavy by twenty six a have supposed to be be intensely gratifying spirit rose under influence to pitch of almost extravagant hilarity twenty eight poor fellow still remained unaccounted for have undoubtedly gone down with schooner loss be after comparatively trifling taking into consideration suddenness completeness of disaster be inexpressibly thankful that matter have turned out to be worse boat be soon alongside again for second moiety of companion in misfortune third trip sufficed to clear raft of living occupant of course a in duty bound being last to leave clumsy structure have served in such good stead a sat beside young lieutenant in stern sheet of boat during journey to ship occupied about quarter of hour having drifted considerably to leeward during process of transhipment asked few question elicited from leading particular of mishap having learned informed that ship santa catalina have sailed four day previously from cartagena for cadiz that like have be caught in hurricane from however have escaped with only damage to spar already referred to a approached ship side near enough to discern crowd of curious face peering at over lofty bulwark new friend remarked with peculiar smile will find among passenger two former acquaintance of own unless be greatly mistaken be alongside before have time to ask name of two former acquaintance in moment accepting precedence courteous young spaniard with graceful wave of hand accorded found on side ladder of santa catalina a stepped in through entering port small withered up sun dried yellow complexioned man in full captain uniform met introducing somewhat pompously a don felix calderon captain of santa catalina bade through companion welcome on board ship congratulating upon speedy rescue expressing gratification felt at being mean of saving so many gallant enemy from possible watery grave made acknowledgment a gracefully a must under circumstance be about to proceed with inquiry relative to previously picked up off floating deck when ring of people who have gathered round during somewhat ceremonious exchange of compliment be abruptly broken through by female figure in instant neck be encircled by pair of lovely arm beautiful head be laid lovingly upon breast clear silvery note of dona inez de guzman voice sobbed out oh leo leo darling what joy be to meet so unexpectedly when feared that fate have separated for ever be about to reply when to horror must confess eye encountered that of don luis inez father a stepped forward laid hand somewhat sternly on daughter shoulder there inez said will do be doubtless overjoyed to again meet friend who posse so large share of regard allow enthusiasm to carry too far senor lascelles be suffering from effect of long immersion in sea be doubtless hungry thirsty be also undoubtedly anxious to make arrangement with don felix a to disposal of men come dear girl let return to cabin for present when young friend have refreshed be at liberty will be glad of opportunity to renew acquaintance to have little conversation with senor continued turning to offering hand with stately somewhat distant bow accept felicitation upon most fortunate escape beautiful inez upon released retired somewhat abashed with father a went managed to throw back parting glance from brimming eye assured that hold upon affection be still a firm a have ever be most unexpected meeting with inez father with restraint coolness of latter manner to coming a did close upon heel of several hour of exposure what be worse extreme excitement anxiety of mind rather pushed off balance for moment two after lady love vanished into cabin scarcely knew where be don felix saw coming forward placed hand under arm very kindly invited to accompany to private cabin delicately suggesting that appeared to be much exhausted that glass of wine must do good like most youngster however be too proud to yield to weakness have momentarily overpowered so rallying with effort murmured that be mere nothing turned subject by asking permission to muster men in waist might ascertain exactly who be missing one permission be at once accorded then discovered that of entire crew of dolphin surgeon boyne senior mid twenty six men still remained unaccounted for question now arose in what light must don felix regard how dispose of thought desirable that question must be settled at once be about to submit to spanish captain before dismissing men when individual most concerned forestalled by calling aside to quarter deck where several of officer have be in apparently anxious consultation whilst have be mustering remnant of schooner crew informed upon joining that pleased a be to have be mean of rescuing duty to government left alternative to regard a prisoner of war whilst must be pleased to receive parole that of other officer feared must be compelled to put seaman in close confinement below unless must undertake on behalf that attempt must be made by to capture otherwise interfere with santa catalina crew in case confinement must be merely nominal must scarcely refrain from smiling at suggestion thus thrown out for spaniard mustered twice a strong a did be moreover armed be not preserving gravity unhesitatingly replied that gratitude alone for important service rendered must have sufficed to prevent such attempt a hinted at that therefore cheerfully entered upon required undertaking matter satisfactorily settled retired below with young officer who have have charge of boat effected removal from raft name informed be silvio hermoso villacampa y albuquerque be second lieutenant of ship being very nearly size build have very kindly proffered use of suit of clothing with to replace own drenched garment be very pleasant chatty young fellow remarkably free unreserved in manner for spaniard whilst be shifting rig subsequently partaking of refreshment have be laid out for upon ward room table learned from great deal about ship skipper one item of acquired information being fact that santa catalina be undoubtedly identical vessel have be despatched to look out for learned that don felix though good enough man in main be not very greatly respected by officer who found very deficient in seamanship suspected of being also somewhat wanting in courage be new to ship seemed being first voyage in young albuquerque more than hinted suspicion that don felix owed command great deal more to influence than to merit meal ended returned to deck be then introduced in due form to of quarter deck officer in succession more than one of whom be polite enough to compliment upon spanish when have time to look about bit be greatly surprised to notice that preparation be going forward to replace spar lost by ship during hurricane upon noticing to first lieutenant replied with rather contemptuous shrug of shoulder that be captain calderon intention to put into cumana to refit also to land englishman be by mean pleasant news for be in hope must have be carried across atlantic must have afforded at least chance of recapture by one of own men of war moreover inez father be on board though augured ill from studied coolness of latter reception of thought must never have better opportunity than afforded by atlantic voyage for ingratiating with forwarding love affair thought matter over little at length hit upon plan thought might serve to render visit to cumana unnecessary at least so far a spar be concerned knew that quick passage be regarded by authority a of most vital importance for friend second lieutenant have told so therefore awaited opportunity taking advantage of moment when don felix several of officer be chatting with suddenly changed topic of conversation by thanking captain for arrangement have made for comfort of myself men begged must allow to acknowledge in only way then must namely by assisting crew to replace lost spar of ship assured must must do unaided if necessary before noon next day flushed up little stammered something unintelligible finally declined assistance rather curtly saw more of don luis daughter until after commencement of first watch that evening when former joined proposed little private chat on poop of course acceded to proposal at once followed stately friend to poop fully expecting to be severely reproached for having presumed to entangle affection of daughter quite looked for exhibition of righteous anger in be agreeably disappointed don luis ' feeling might have be remained outwardly at least perfectly calm speaking throughout short interview in low sonorous steady voice since meeting so unexpectedly on quarter deck afternoon commenced have have private conversation with daughter have resulted in full complete explanation by her of singular scene then witnessed of have led up to will not reproach with anything be past because feel that be really who be more to blame than anybody else for have never thought necessary to provide daughter with staid female companion duenna to watch control action have be allowed to run wild about place from infancy to have own way in everything ought to have remembered to have provided against have happened before ventured to introduce two young men beneath roof however there be very great harm done so far few love letter so on nothing serious now young sir wish to understand clearly be quite willing to forget everything have happened so must be fully aware that so long a remain on board same ship will be quite impossible that daughter must avoid meeting more le after scene of afternoon on quarter deck choose to excite comment curiosity by forbidding speaking to other let remind that be parent that posse right gentleman will for moment dream of infringing disputing in virtue of therefore must insist that henceforward never presume to address daughter in language of love nay look so angry young friend meant not to speak quite so harshly be be most anxious must understand that there must be end to business may venture to ask ground for insisting so strongly on what will inevitably wreck happiness of one if not of two person demanded not quite a respectfully a ought be afraid assuredly answered don luis be difference in position difference of rank exists between daughter in other respect have not fault to find be fine gallant young fellow fame have reached even to la guayra may tell believe to be perfectly honourable honest straightforward feel sure that will advance rapidly in profession dear young friend be not noble be consequently quite ineligible not noble ineligible interrupted have forgotten that be officer of british navy be that be unaware of fact that wearer of uniform be qualified by to stand in presence of king retorted with laugh oh yes know doe not alter fact one iota there continued will say no more about quite understand other be sure have demanded that will respect certain right of mine will respect a other gentleman must now let talk about something else one moment don luis said then if choose will drop subject for ever acknowledge right will respect understand sir will never give up hope of winning daughter with approval until learn that be wedded to someone else will most assuredly tell so before fall back into position of mere ordinary acquaintance to wish to relegate don luis laughed little said that after what insisted upon be perhaps only fair then subject be dropped have long quite friendly chat about other matter then learned that poor fellow be in trouble with government be going home in something almost like disgrace in obedience to unexpected most peremptory message from spain attributed whole business to machination misrepresentation of certain enemy in la guayra complained bitterly that if have be allowed little more time must have collected ample sufficiency of evidence to have refuted one of charge against explained whole affair to in full detail a have direct bearing upon story will not inflict particular upon reader upon separating somewhat late be intercepted by messenger from don felix who be informed wished to see in private cabin joined at once found that business be that after thinking matter over further be now prepared to accept offer of assistance in replacing of spar if must waive former refusal now endeavoured to explain away for very handsomely apologised assured must still be very happy to be of service possibly must upon be agreed that work must be commenced immediately after breakfast on following morning then retired quite worn out to quarter allotted to chapter twenty four capture recapture of santa catalina rather overslept night so that be close upon eight bell before be ready to go on deck a reached foot of ladder leading to upper deck officer apparently on quarter deck made remark being below did not catch did that of captain calderon who immediately replied quite loud enough for to hear schooner in water be always object to be looked upon with suspicion dolphin have gone to bottom thanks be to blessed virgin think need fear anything else of rig that may meet with hereabouts still altogether like look of fellow yonder smiled a back handed compliment to poor dolphin came floating down hatchway turned back to berth for minute two in order on deck might have cause to think have overheard remark obviously be not intended to reach ear then went on deck found skipper with two three officer grouped near capstan intently eyeing object to windward wind discovered have fallen light during night have hauled round from eastward in consequence of santa catalina be then heading due north close hauled upon larboard tack with hardly enough motion through water to give steerage way object be exciting so much interest among spanish officer be schooner broad on weather beam about eight mile distant consequently hull down from deck be steering about west north west appeared to have stitch of canvas packed upon that crew must spread including square sail topgallant topmast lower studding sail be not at surprising considering that wind be light dead fair for be apparent enough to however that spaniard did not like look of be greeted with great cordiality by little group a made appearance on deck kindest hope be expressed that have passed comfortable night be promptly invited to take breakfast with skipper in cabin compliment being duly paid acknowledged captain calderon remarked have be looking at schooner yonder wondering who what can be schooner unless happen to be british cruiser french privateer piratical craft be seldom to be met with about here though ought to have nothing to fear from second variety have named have to speak plain truth very great desire to meet with of three perhaps be american from one of island bound up into gulf suggested hardly that think answered don felix tell did ever see american trader with beautifully cut suit of canvas a fellow spread thrusting glass into hand a spoke applied instrument to eye taking good long steady look at distant vessel when have completed examination be forced to admit have never seen trader american otherwise with handsome suit of canvas with everything so snug ship shape about rigging a be craft still said be disposed to think american from enormous spread of yard have doubtless noticed if don felix continued be really anxious to ascertain fellow intention why not wear round on opposite tack will at once make declare for if be honest trader will continue to hold on present course whilst if be not will certainly alter so a to intercept will thus have plenty of time to prepare for a can not get alongside in le than couple of hour unless breeze freshens be just thinking of remarked don felix will do so for sake of ah passenger must be cautious will wear ship gentleman if please then go to breakfast be done operation occupying nearly quarter of hour in consequence of lightness of wind then party of four went below to breakfast steward be only just pouring out chocolate when first lieutenant came down to say that schooner have altered course about four point to southward evidently intended to intercept don felix looked very blank for moment two on hearing then brow cleared remarked pooh can not mean to attack merely wish to speak hoist spanish ensign sir will not interfere with when see that must say have doubt whether mere exhibition of spanish ensign must have deterrent effect captain calderon anticipated however reflected must not possibly matter to unless of course craft be british did not believe so went on composedly with breakfast companion be evidently somewhat perturbed news just brought down into cabin interfered considerably with enjoyment of meal must see that be anxiously waiting for to finish in order that might go on deck see how matter be progressing therefore brought repast to hurried conclusion returned to upper region together strange sail have by time reduced distance to five mile from santa catalina from course be steering must no longer be doubted that intended to pas close to if nothing more captain calderon lost not moment in bringing glass to bear upon so intent be scrutiny examination that be fully five minute before removed eye from tube when did so handed glass to in turn have look at have now raised hull clear of horizon owing to intense heat outline be so magnified distorted that be quite impossible to get good view of still a watched wavering image idea began to grow upon have somewhere seen craft before tried for long time to remember where be without success well what do think of friend asked don felix a replaced instrument in hand know what to think said have assuredly seen that vessel before though where can not for life of remember wish must allow to ask single question said don felix very earnestly certainly thoughtlessly replied what be be yonder schooner one of cruiser have not expected question a did not think at fair one for don felix to put scarcely knew what reply to make to in order to gain time begged loan of glass once more having obtained composedly ascended to main top from advantageous stand point renewed examination in situation obtained much better view a stood there swaying to sluggish heave of vessel with glass glued to eye memory suddenly carried back on board foam once more fancied standing on heaving deck watching approach of strange schooner running down toward pretty much a one be now doing only difference being that then have great deal more wind than now have whilst schooner in sight showed great deal more canvas than one be then so anxiously watching hull be same taunt spar especially excessive spread of yard be utterly impossible to mistake hurried down on deck with speed feeling that santa catalina soul on board be in very awkward fix to escape from must tax energy ingenuity to utmost well said don felix interrogatively a swung off rail down on deck close to don felix said when asked that question minute two ago have not succeeded in identifying yonder schooner though felt sure have seen somewhere before now know be vessel in notorious pirate merlani ply nefarious trade must therefore strongly recommend to clear for action at once merlani ejaculated skipper saint defend can not be true be surely joking with senor be never more serious in life captain calderon retorted to show how grave consider situation beg that will allow men to assist in defence of ship little gentleman turned almost livid for moment really thought be frightened after ineffectual effort two to steady voice managed to stutter out passionately senor no certainly not offer be almost insult though perhaps did not intend a such santa catalina be spanish ship be manned by crew who with officer be quite able to take care of to uphold honour dignity of yonder flag pointing a spoke to languidly floating ensign at peak very good don felix said of course know capability of crew far better than do schooner there be sure to be crowded with men who to personal knowledge be a desperate set of ruffian a ever trod deck will have work cut out to beat off if fail what be to become of warn that men will submit tamely without struggle to have throat cut if pirate gain possession of ship will fight for life if prove victorious will consider santa catalina lawful prize will be welcome to senor on condition said don felix with hauteur must muster at present must request that people will retire below consider yourselves a close prisoner until hear further from rely upon courtesy sense of honour to relieve of necessity for calling upon crew in present critical state of affair to enforce command will be instantly obeyed captain calderon said highly nettled at so very unnecessary exhibition of warmth come lad continued to own people who be lounging about deck looking somewhat wistfully at gun below with man dolphin be to have hand in fight seems come down with disobedience for shame men must disgrace before spaniard be enough few who seemed at first inclined to hang back now pressed forward eager to show obedience by being among first to pas down hatchway a turned away with bow from don felix little group of officer former gave order to clear ship for action at same moment don luis who seemed have come unobserved on deck have heard altercation between don felix pressed forward placed by side will come below with for moment if may said assuredly said will be glad to have word with don luis before action commences dolphin continued in english just look about a pas below take possession of anything can find likely to prove handy a weapon be by mean sure will not be yet obliged to fight for life though don have so scornfully refused assistance be that honest conviction asked don luis who understood english perfectly be merely expression of little bitterness at captain calderon singularly discourteous behaviour be honest conviction said may seem very impertinent thing for to say don luis from what have seen of officer crew of vessel believe will be able to withstand pirate attack longer than five minute at utmost be glad have given opportunity to say to for must not like disaster to find quite unprepared must must think of mean of providing for daughter safety saint be merciful to do really think matter be so desperate a senor lascelles ejaculated don luis do indeed replied then supposing pirate gain possession of ship what do think will happen asked friend in great perturbation will undoubtedly ransack ship plunder her of article of slightest value in first place said what will next do be not so certain dead men tell tale however chance be that male on board will be slaughtered in cold blood thrown overboard after ship will doubtless be scuttled set on fire stay be be few minute pray dear boy ejaculated don luis in tone of voice betrayed extreme consternation must go on deck have word two with captain calderon have not yet wholly lost power influence though be to extent in disgrace hurried away left standing on main deck men meanwhile have in obedience to instruction made way below to lower deck must hear now then during momentary cessation in din on deck around caused by spaniard preparation for action rummaging about below calling to other about ten minute later don luis rejoined with drawn sword in hand pair of pistol in sash girded waist showing that at event fully intended to do part in protection of ship within where be men asked gone below whither must now join said can see that countryman be already regarding prolonged presence here with jealous mistrustful eye come then said don luis will go with descended to lower deck saw by dim light of lantern suspended from beam that most of lad have provided with at least something in shape of weapon have armed with tail block have routed out from somewhere carried marlinespike others be balancing crowbar piece of old iron in hand whilst one two have dragged to light short length of chain wielded by sinewy arm might prove formidable weapon of offence don luis looked at then at smiled english be most extraordinary people said believe be never more happy than when fighting men of yours look more like parcel of schoolboy preparing for holiday than men making ready for desperate life death struggle must be brief there be time for anything like gossip now pirate schooner be within two mile of don felix expects to open fire immediately have tried to persuade that be hasty ill advised to refuse offer of assistance fellow be a obstinate a pig will not listen to reason albeit believe be growing more nervous minute now first want to ask have better do with daughter stow away a low down in run of ship a can put said will then be out of reach of shot will also be little time before can be discovered by pirate assuming of course that take ship in meantime there will be chance of men being able to do something for love of heaven don luis let not fall alive into hand of scoundrel will not if have to slay with own hand ejaculated don luis through set teeth there be one thing more continued hurriedly men can not possibly do good with makeshift weapon with have provided now if be willing to compromise to extent of providing with suitable arm will pledge sacred word of honour don leo that weapon will not be employed save against pirate only then in event of countryman proving unequal to cope with willingly said with proviso don luis if pirate conquer countryman gain possession of santa catalina after be able to recover will regard a prize retain possession of by mean in power don luis cogitated deeply for full minute be so then said that be agreed upon between don felix remember after must be infinitely preferable that must be prisoner than that must fall by murderous hand of pirate do happen to know if there be other mean of gaining deck above than ladder by descended yes said there be ladder abaft there lead to main upper deck by way of after hatchway at moment muffled boom smote ear crash somewhere above followed second two later showed that pirate have opened fire be within range be immediately succeeded by confused discharge from santa catalina of main deck gun of larboard broadside one after other don luis said for heaven sake try to persuade don felix not to return pirate fire twelve pounder carronades be of comparatively little use except at close quarter merlani be not fool enough to give chance to use to advantage will simply heave to out of range blaze away with long gun until more than crew be killed when will dash alongside carry ship without effort tell don felix to double shot gun to depress a much a can not to fire let schooner come alongside haul down ensign if can not otherwise get to come when schooner be close under muzzle of gun fire shot will go right through bottom pirate will then be obliged to board when with advantage afforded by catalina high side ought to have thing own way thanks thanks will see what can do said don luis now come way bring men with will take upon to arm then if worst come to worst will look to to save ay daughter will do perish exclaimed fervently a beckoned dolphin to follow made sail in wake of don luis led along until reached after hatchway through ascended to deck above when again turned aft until reached bulkhead inclosing room beneath don felix cabin don luis threw open door in bulkhead exclaiming there help yourselves providentially noticed room a be coming down to just now rushed away on deck room disclosed by opening of door be of extent occupying nearly breadth of vessel have evidently be fitted up a armoury when ship have be doing duty a man of war for though sundry unoccupied peg pin showed that present crew have just be armed from place there still remained weapon enough unappropriated for more than twice number weapon consisted of musket pistol sword cutlass a there be of course cartridge

permission being obtained sat down then there whilst merlani story be still fresh in memory put whole of in black white done thought high time to look in upon don luis who must perhaps otherwise think be slighting accordingly made way to private cabin knocked softly door be opened by inez who sooner saw than flung into arm full in view of father who be reclining upon couch kissed rapturously exclaimed oh leo dearest how glad be to see once more unhurt after dreadful occurrence of to day come in mio sit down papa have be longing to see have not dear proud good natured darling of father yes said don luis smiling much to astonishment for quite expected that displeasure must have be kindled by daughter demonstrative reception of yes have not from precisely same motif fancy however let that pas come in leo boy come in why look a frightened a if be not that wilful headstrong daughter of mine ought to be angry with sit down let inez pour out glass of wine whilst tell how affair have be progressing since saw last first continued offering left hand injured limb being tightly swathed in bandage therefore unavailable let express to heartfelt gratitude for prompt effective response made to appeal for help deliverance at moment that be about to fall irretrievably into hand of piratical desperado gallant follower have saved from death in daughter case from fate so much worse than death that will never be able to think of without shudder will find be not ungrateful will speak of anon now tell how have managed with miserable poltroon don felix officer crew tell in detail happened from moment be obliged to leave seating by side with inez close to gave friend full detailed account of everything have transpired omitting of course particular of interview with merlani wound up by saying of course don luis can not say how admiral may deal with matter of seizure of ship how will dispose of officer crew in case think that a dona inez be civilian will not attempt to detain even must think of doing so believe be overrating influence with when say that think must at intercession restore freedom thank leo said don luis heartily be good news have be feeling little anxious on point since have found time to think about for detention at present crisis in affair might affect most seriously if can only succeed in making way back to la guayra have doubt that in fortnight at most can collect evidence enough to completely frustrate machination of enemy set perfectly right again with authority in spain now with respect to foolish well will withdraw word foolish ' love affair between inez there be doubt brave fellow have be mean of preserving from very terrible fate a have said will not find ungrateful be not going to give unconditional consent to inez marriage with not yet at least must be rather too absurd be especially leo far too young to seriously contemplate marriage for year to come moreover be at present merely midshipman still have way to make in noble profession have chosen to follow have not slightest doubt that will make in due time have already established something more than merely local reputation a most gallant officer seaman have distinguished in most remarkable manner for so young man superior must be worse than ungrateful be to fail to duly acknowledge reward such distinguished merit have doubt will reward fully expect that when once have served time ' believe be correct expression be not rise in profession will be rapid that will not be very many year before gain post rank when day arrives if present regard for inez remains unchanged come to will find perfectly willing to incline favourable ear to proposal in meantime completely withdraw veto a to intercourse with may have a much of other society a wish during short time be likely to be together may afterwards correspond a voluminously a please understand clearly will not accede to in way countenance anything approaching to betrothal a english term engagement now dear child hope be satisfied story be ended be there need must say more well perhaps of reader may object to so abrupt termination to veracious history to please may be a well perhaps to briefly state few additional fact will add then that succeeded in carrying santa catalina safely into port royal after fine somewhat slow passage though suppose need scarcely say that to inez day sped only too fast duly reported to admiral be by received most favourably notwithstanding deplorable contre temp of loss of dolphin santa catalina be duly declared lawful prize though objection to proceeding be raised by spanish

valuable cargo have on board large quantity of bullion know what became of officer crew a be almost immediately appointed to dashing frigate fresh out from england objection be raised to departure from island of don luis daughter who managed after delay difficulty to secure passage to la guayra in neutral vessel once there soon found mean to set right with government contrary to expectation merlani survived long enough to be able to tell father all have told more thus completely for ever setting at rest harassing doubt suspicion a to sincerity of mother affection have gone so far towards making wreck of father life father remorse regret for cruel treatment of mother be keen in extreme most painful to witness faithfully strove to make what compensation must by lavishing upon love of really warm affectionate nature remained on west indian station long enough to complete time a midshipman old friend admiral lived long enough to bestow upon post rank did with almost indecent haste at least so said of who chose to feel jealous at rapid advancement however admiral stoutly maintained have faithfully earned presume be scarcely necessary to add that coveted rank once gained lost time in pressing suit for dona inez hand be then yielded to with very good grace with handsome fortune by don luis who only stipulated that must live with shortly afterwards resigning post removing to england to enable to do so
