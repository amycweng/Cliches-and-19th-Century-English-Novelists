be hailed one of be edith arbuthnot who though did not desire to put restriction on berts intimacy be lucky since berts be young gentleman hideously gifted with power of getting way loudly proclaimed that must never be friend with dodo again answer have sent to dodo remarkable telegram about combusted egoism few day before seemed to indicate that have surrendered though have subsequently announced that dodo be heartless might be regarded a convert especially since jack have at last yielded too have invited down here fortress hitherto impregnable be mr vivian for whom dodo in day gone by have felt a solid affection a be capable of consequently regretted that mr vivian be invariably unable to come dine never manifested slightest desire that dodo must come to see regret be slightly tempered by fact that mr vivian have ear trumpet in day presented to people whose conversation desired to hear rather in manner that elephant at zoo hold out trunk for refreshment somehow that seemed to make matter le dodo have not at present made determined effort to beleaguer intended when went back to town in july to capture what be now practically only remaining stronghold of disaffected when dodo drowsily awoke that night just at time that hugh nadine have finished talk be thought of jack that first stirred in mind instantly be perfectly wide awake during last year though be great friend with nadine have absolutely avoided coming into contact with never went to house where dodo be expected once finding be staying for saturday till monday with granthams have left within ten minute of arrival miss grantham have conceived misbegotten plan of bringing unexpectedly face to face with only result that party numbered thirteen father be very uncomfortable for week afterwards once again have be caught in block in taxi cab exactly opposite other dodo taking bull by horn have leaned impulsively toward with hand outstretched cried ah jack be never to meet again on bull so to speak paid fare continued journey on foot dodo have be considerably disappointed by rebuff have seemed to that man must have resisted direct appeal on other hand jack on seeing have nailed to face so curiously icy mask that appearance became quite ludicrous also knocked hat against roof of closed half of cab fell into road in middle of unusually deep puddle noticed that be not bald yet be great relief since detested sight of cranium now jack have yielded have walked out of citadel without further assault being delivered be to arrive to day at thought when woke in stillness of earliest morning dodo brain started into fullest activity a always a much interested in motif inspired action a in action set to ponder nature of impulse have caused so complete volta face action interested charmed also year have wanted to see jack again have understood better than one in spite of vile way in have used have more nearly loved than of men have married first husband have never be more to than old darling often something not nearly that of waldenech have simply be afraid under fascination of fear have done what told jack dodo felt for switch of electric light darkness be too close to eye wanted to focus on something clearly there be several possibility of must account for change in might perhaps merely wish to resume ordinary friendly relation with did not seem likely explanation since if be must more naturally have waited till returned to town again after sojourn in country there must have be in mind cause more potent than naturally more potent cause occurred to sat up in bed be too ludicrous said to herself can not possibly be yet have remained unmarried year with how many charming girl about who must have be perfectly willing to share wealth title not to speak of dodo got out of bed altogether went across room to where big looking glass set in door of wardrobe reflected entire figure wished to be quite honest in inspection of herself to see there not what wanted to see what there be to be seen room be brightly lit through thin silk nightdress must see line of figure molded in soft swelling curve of matured womanhood yet something of slimness firm elasticity of youth still dwelt there even a youth still shone in smooth unwrinkled oval of face sparkled in depth of dark eye right down to waist hung thick coil of black hair still untroubled by gray slim shapely be ankle soft rosy from warmth of bed exquisite foot at sight of mouth uncurled into smile honesty of scrutiny have produced no discouraging revelation then frankly laughing at turned away again wholly unconsciously instinctively took half dozen dance step across persian rug be laid down over polished floor must no more help that impulse of bubbling vitality than must help fact that be five foot eight in height coolness refreshment of two hour before dawn streamed in through open window put on dressing gown with cascade of lace blue riband lay on chair by dressing table supposing be case that jack be coming for that wanted now a in old day when have thrown devotion back at like pail of dirty water what answer must make really hardly knew of marriage have be conspicuous success for of husband have felt anything of quality of emotion have felt for man have treated so infamously gave great sigh began ticking off certain event on finger first of refused before married poor darling chesterford first said to herself secondly having married chesterford first asked jack to run away with be in moment of great exasperation might have happened to anybody thirdly a soon a chesterford be taken got engaged to jack ought to have done originally fourthly jilted married waldenech dodo have arrived at little finger held other hand poised over what devil be fifthly to be said aloud got out of chair again be very odd simply ca make up mind thought usually can make up without slightest trouble indeed be usually already made up just a one used to find egg already boiled in absurd machine always stood by chesterford at breakfast hate boiled egg wonder if owe to jack to marry if want to supposing say have spoiled life want to unspoil now be duty apart from inclination may be wish knew what be dodo felt quite unable to make up mind on somewhat important point felt already embarked on argument with jack a have be so often embarked in old day on how pleasant summery sea must certainly tell that nobody ought to let life be spoiled by anybody else must point to a triumphant instance of how have refused to let joy of life get ever so slightly tarnished by really trying experience in partnership with waldenech here be positively a good a new then unfortunately occurred to jack might say then did love ingenious dodo felt unable to frame reply to very bald suggestion really seemed unanswerable there be further reason might account for jack coming nadine dodo knew that two be great friend have even heard suggested that jack have serious thought with regard to very likely that be only invented by friend who be curious to know how must take suggestion clearly be not improbable far le impossible contingency that nadine have serious thought with regard to jack be le likely dodo felt that daughter took after in emotional matter be probably not at age seriously thinking about anybody yet after have married at age though without serious thought experiment seemed so sensible promising have be distinct disappointment ought to warn nadine against marrying without love must look a if for other reason did not wish to marry jack must be odious interpretation to put on worst of be that be not perfectly certain whether there be not sort of foundation for something within ever so faintly resented idea of jack marrying nadine dodo thought paused be poised over for little made eager conscious effort to root out from mind feeling of be genuinely ashamed then suddenly meditation be banished for from outside there came first faint chirrupings of awakening bird deep down in below triviality surface complication of life below warm heartedness egoism there lay strain of natural untainted simplicity first fluting of bird in bush roused went to window drew up blind dusk still hovered over sea low lying land in sky already turning dove colored late star lingered remotely burning bird have called to look at dawn have ceased again pause holy sweet magical brooded over virginal meeting of night day far off to right hill top have got earliest news of what be coming be flecked with pale orient reflection hint of gold scarlet faint crimson here below dusk lay thick still like clear dark water just below window lay lawn garlanded round with sleeping dew drenched flower bed incense of fragrant bud folded petal still slept in censer till in east must rise gold haired priest swing tossing high to heaven fragrance of burning then from out of bush beyond there scudded thrush perhaps same a have called dodo to window scurried over shimmering lawn with innumerable footfall came so close underneath window that must see eye shining then swelled throat sang one soft phrase of morning paused a if listening then repeated magic of youth joy of life be there there be also in dodo heart indefinable yearning for day be dead sense of fathomless well of time into forever dropped beauty youth soft sweet day that lasted moment for a long a thrush paused voice yet sounded from bush there be other thrush there in ivy of house arose cheerful jangling of sparrow fresh feathered form ran out upon lawn air be shrill with piping moment sky grew brighter with imminent day last star faded in glow of pink translucent alabaster in green crowned elm breeze of morning awoke stirred tree top then came lower began to move in flower bed wine of dew be spilled from chalice of new blown rose tall lily quivered there be wafted up to indescribable odor of moist earth opening flower on moment first yellow ray of sunlight shot over garden dodo stood there dim eyed unspeakably mysteriously moved thought of other dawn have seen when coming back perhaps from ball where have be central most brilliant figure night long thought of other troubled dawn when have wakened from unquiet dream yet dreaded day here be perfect dawn seemed to symbolize to beginning of life lay in front of looked forward to with eager anticipation gave rapturous welcome be in love with life still longed to see what delicious thing held in store for felt sure that god be going to be tremendously kind to in turn for have certain sense of fairness felt most whole heartedly grateful determined to deserve favor there be thing in life be very sorry for such omission commission must not occur again felt that sight of delicious dawn have be sort of revelation to with great sigh of content went back to bed without delay fell fast asleep did not awake till maid came in at eight o'clock with little tray of tea smelt too good for anything whole sheaf of attractive looking letter large stiff square one certainly contained card that bade to delightful entertainment always breakfasted in room when came downstairs about past ten looked into dining room found to surprise that waldenech be there eating sausage one after other be very strange proceeding for since in general adopted slightly shark like hour did not breakfast till at least lunch time time at rate habit

vibration like have felt then talk to doe not matter said in german to talk like be what want dodo gave one glance of extraordinary meaning little muttered speech strangely reminded of paean in thrush song at dawn recalled poignancy of emotion belonged to day long past same poignancy of feeling be hers still must easily feel habitually felt in spite of forty more year mere out bubbling of life expressed in out bubbling speech also rather welcomed presence of third party be easier for to bubble to anybody rather than to waldenech buttonholed perfectly willing john bishop algie be such dear

unreliability of april day alternate gleam of saffron sun of spring with cold rain plumping shower yet felt that there be something utterly adorable wholly womanly that lay sheathed in more superficial imperfection something stirred within conscious of coming summer just a life embalmed within chrysalis stir giving token of time when husk will burst that be gray crawling thing will be wafted on wing of silver emblazoned with scarlet gold then there be beauty too drew eye after wonder of perfection be worthy of soul that divined in finally perhaps to be supreme magnet there be

die sooner then marriage be pure farce said come laugh at said chapter vii hugh intention have be to stay several day at least with chesterfords have brought down luggage must last reasonable person fortnight unluckily have not foreseen very natural effect that sight of seymour must have on a soon a lunch be over took hostess into corner presented situation with usual simplicity be like aunt dodo said did realize exactly what meant to till saw seymour again drove up from station got worse time thought perhaps since nadine have chosen might see differently think perhaps do be worse be quite hopeless best thing can do be to go away again at once dodo have lit two cigarette by mistake since during ride jack have wantonly so thought accused of wastefulness be smoking holding one in hand in alternate whiff threw one of away at laid hand on hugh knee know dear be so dreadfully sorry said be sure must be so be why did want to come here knew be good can see feel really unwell whenever catch sight of seymour hear anything say about nadine did have nice talk with hugh considered think must quite call nice said think must call necessary anyhow have have quite understand now a be so will go away again afternoon be mistake to come at yes probably be necessary mistake in certain situation mistake be necessary mean one doe seems to be wrong if have stopped away must have felt wrong too will answer two question aunt dodo asked yes will certainly answer if be very awkward one may not answer quite truthfully well will try do approve of nadine marriage have blessing yes dear truthfully have be right to tell that give blessing rather easily when be clearly use attempting to interfere in matter be better to bless than curse if ask whether must have chosen seymour a nadine husband out of possible one why must not thought at one time perhaps be going to be jack then jack chose a know girl may not marry stepfather particularly if mother be alive well must not have chosen hughie if question implies used to think must when nadine explained to other day rather agreed with of course have explained to hugh looked at with honest trustworthy brown eye several time said if agreed must be worrying now question do think will be happy yes up to present capacity if did not think must be happy must not bless dear edith for example think be shocking terrible marriage for daresay must be then be whom seymour proposed to marry must be most remarkable couple must not think edith must kill with intention of committing suicide after then determine that there have be enough killing for one day next day suicide must appear quite out of question so must write funeral march dodo held admirable sensible view that if discussion on particular topic be hopeless be much better to abandon talk a cheerfully a may be about something different entertaining diversion altogether failed to divert hugh said must be happy up to present capacity reminded yes be simple be not develop capacity for happiness misery also develops a well whether nadine capacity will develop much can not tell if doe may not be happy up to who know can not spend life in arranging for contingency may never take place change in ourselves may never occur dodo looked in silence for moment at grave reliable face felt sudden wonder at nadine for having chosen a have done yet reason for rejecting extremely satisfactory youth be sound enough intellectual level be such mile apart dodo though did not express further thought have very distinct in mind if doe develop emotionally like woman said to herself there will not be superfluity of happiness about will look at wonder how must have refused necessarily did not say hugh got up well then at risk of appearing worse prig than john sturgis said may tell that a long a nadine be happy main object be accomplished own happiness consists so largely in fact of hers dear wonder be not sick at sententiousness be quite too noble to live really want to die must make nadine happier if told seymour must be brother to dodo laughed hughie must make afraid that brain have gone that be going to be ill must only make anxious be motor around be sorry be going think be quite right to do so always propose whenever feel like feel like at present said thanks awfully aunt dodo dodo felt extremely warmly towards young man who be behaving so very well simply god bless dear hugh said give heart desire at present heart desire appears to be making other plan for said hugh esther have said once in more than usually enlightened moment that nadine friend did feeling for observed put what felt into vivacious convincing language applied to herself certainly hugh when drove away again afternoon be keenly conscious of what nadine have talked about to edith felt lost flag have industriously waved so long for seemed to be entirely disregarded hardly knew what have hoped must have come of ill conceived visit have just ended so abruptly vague sense of nadine engagement being too nightmare like to be true have prompted to go in person find out also have seemed to that when be face to face with nadine asking at point blank range whether be going to marry seymour be impossible that must say yes something different must assuredly happen must say be mistake something inside must snap there be mistake about nothing have snapped world proposed to proceed just a usual must not decline to proceed with unless died be obliged to proceed however intolerable journey however unthinkable succession of day through be compelled to pas life be like journey in express train with communication cord be locked in must not stop train by mean people of course threw out of window so to speak made violent end to suicide be only possible to people of certain temperament hugh be incapable of even contemplating such step felt irretrievably lost profoundly wretched yet quite apart from fact that be temperamentally incapable of even wishing to commit suicide fact that nadine be in world nadine be going to do made impossible to think of quitting be manner characteristic of love own unhappiness meant le to than fact of until have suggested thought of traveling have not occurred to now a waited for train at station felt that at cost wanted to be on move to be employed in getting away from intolerable anywhere that might happen to be in wherever be seemed that other place must be preferable supposed be essence of distraction that travel be supposed to give own room in town felt must be soaked with association of nadine so too must be house where must naturally spend coming month of august september not till october when duty a clerk in foreign office called back to town have anything with felt must occupy exceptional capacity for finding day too short few even though have duty to make hour pas have hitherto be only brilliance now gift of kind seemed to have be snatched from must not conceive what to do with to morrow next day of day must follow allowance of seven day to week seemed inordinate superfluity be filled with irritation at thought of leisurely march of interminable time spent evening alone feeling that be shade le intolerable to than anybody else must have be also felt incapable of attention social intercourse demand mind seemed utterly out of control a unable to remain in one place a body even if thought of nadine wandered must notice that picture hung crooked jump up to straighten one such be charming water color sketch by esther of beach at meering with splash of sunlight low in west that shining through chimney in cloud struck sea very far out made there little island of reflected gold esther have put in golden islet with reluctance have said that even in nature looked unreal must look even more unreal in art especially when artist happened to be nadine have voted with hugh on behalf of golden island just because must appear unreal incredible be only unreal thing be vivid to have said incredible thing be just believe in be that so hughie how well remembered saying that voice rang in ear like haunting tune while esther made artistic sacrifice to god of thing a be not nadine strolled along firm sandy beach shining with moisture of receding tide have taken arm just a voice now sounded in ear so must feel pressure of hand on coat live among unreality said although be so simple practical be thinking now that day will go to live on golden island there be island really be just like rest of sea only sun shine on bitter truth of struck now a applied to though have refused before sun shone on day not until have engaged to seymour did gold fade not until to day when have definite confirmation of from own lip have really believed in rejection of well knew affection for believed rightly that if have

land longed for pity of soft rain hugh have wholesome contempt for people who pity struck at point that be in considerable danger of becoming despicable in own eye have be capable of sufficient manliness to remove from nadine that afternoon solitary evening be not up to standard might a well have remained at winston if be to endorse refusal to dangle after with nothing more virile than drawling sentimentality be not for have made expedition to day in order to convince on point already determination be showing unstable if suffered to dangle in mind though not in body yet how be possible not to nadine physically tangibly be certainly going to pas out of life to eradicate from soul must be act of spiritual suicide physically there be doubt that must continue to exist without

possessed by very genial kind of mania octave of spring like day with serene sun calm sea light breeze from southwest have decreed oasis in midwinter warm halcyon day made even in december snowdrop aconite to blossom humbly bravely set bird to busy with stick straw a if nesting time be already here new grass already sprouted green among grayness of older growth seemed almost cynical to doubt that spring be not verily here indeed where hugh nadine sat morning be may not march that seemed to have invaded conquered december there lay upon hillside vernal fragrance set stray bee two buzzing round honied sweetness of gorse with time of blossoming be never quite over to day wind be still breeze stirred in bare slender birch set spring like stalk of heather quivering only very high up in unplumbed blue of zenith thin fleecy cloud lay stretched in streamer combed feather of white showing far above river of air swept headlong swift nadine have favorite nook on steep hillside below house reached by path stretched out to south of bay be little hollow russet colored now with bracken of autumn carpeted elsewhere by short napped velvet of turf just in front cliff plunged sheer down to beach where have so often bathed in summer where reef of tumbled sandstone rock stretched out into waveless sea like brown amphibious monster be fish at high tide grazing beast at ebb down there below school of gull hovered fished with wheeling of white wing not ripple lapped edge of rock only sea breathed softly a in sleep stirring fringe of brown weed have gathered there thinnest line of white showed breaking water along sandy foreshore of bay there be same stillness heaven earth ocean lay a if under enchantment sand dune opposite hill beyond lay reflected in sea a if in tranquillity of land locked lake there be spell hush over world to be broken by god knew what gentle awakening of activity catastrophic disturbance two have walked to withdrawn hollow of hill almost in silence have offered to carry book for have said that be of weight after pause have announced fragment of current news to have comment to add have noticed windless unnatural calm of day something in unusual stillness of weather have set nerve quiver perhaps position be in bound a be to seymour not struggling against quite accepting made ordinary intercourse difficult for have all own way hugh be behaving with exemplary discretion seymour be behaving with admirable tolerance just because made own part so easy for womanlike found smoothed out performance of to be difficult have instructed of how to behave instruction be carried out to letter foot be impeccable a lover rejected lover therefore wanted something different situation be completely of own making actor played part exactly a must have play yet there be something wanting be too well drilled too word perfect too certain to say have designed for from right spot in right voice true for moment just now seymour have shown sign of individualism when called attention to fact that be behaving very nicely that must be glad when scene be over hugh have shown none except for fact that have be asked to be allowed few day like old day agone before left england have assured in summer that must never seek to get back into atmosphere of unthinking intimacy again poor fellow when there be to be so few day left before situation be sealed made irrevocable heart have cried out against edict of will foolish though might be have asked for week of meering day from point of view le than from hers have be parody of what have hoped for have be frozen congealed by reserve restraint that dared not break below surface ice knew how swiftly ran torrent in soul ice quite stretched from shore to shore be disappointed nadine for equally with hugh have expected that must realize impossible that loving a did knowing that be so soon to give to man must cast off knowledge of resume for space unshackled intimacy of old ethiopian leopard must have found appropriate feat far easier for be bone blood have to change not mere skin hair very strength of bond bound to made insuperableness of barrier felt moment utter failure of attempt while who thought understood so well have notion how radical failure be not loving must not understand knew that now thought bitterly of little firework of word have once lit for on same text believing by light of quick little squib must read heart so when be settled in nook once again tried to recapture old ease pointed downwards over edge of cliff oh hughie what morning said quiet sea gull bee gorse what summer in december truce with winter be have brought handful of nice book will read oh soon said summer in december be going to last long there be wind coming big one look at mare tail of cloud up above ca smell wind coming always can barometer have dropped nearly inch since last night put back head sniffed moving nostril rather like horse oh how fascinating said nadine if do that will smell wind made sneeze instead think much of said expect looked at barometer before smelt wind besides how be possible to smell wind before there be wind to smell when come feel instead will be big storm said hugh even a spoke current of air stirred surface of sea below shattering reflection be a if great angel of air have breathed on polished mirror of water dimming next moment breath cleared away again surface be a bright unwavering a before half dozen of gull have be hovering chiding there rose into higher air leaving feeding ground after circling round once twice glided away over sand dune inland almost immediately afterwards relay followed till bay have be so populous with bird be quite deserted did not pause in flight went straight inland in decreasing speck of white till vanished altogether gull seem to think so too said hugh then be perfectly wrong said nadine instinct nature implant in animal be almost invariably incorrect for instance siberian tiger at zoo for several year never grew winter coat naturalist went down on knee said ' o wonderful mother nature instinct tell be milder climate than siberia winter mildest ever known poor thing have grown thickest winter coat ever seen so naturalist have to get up again dust trouser where have knelt down put money on gull said hugh look there again far away along sand to nadine most attractive feature about hugh be eye have far away look in have nothing whatever spiritual sentimental in be simply due to fact that have extraordinarily long sight obediently screwed up eye followed direction saw nothing whatever of import be getting nearer will see soon said hugh soon saw whirlwind of sand be advancing towards along beach below revolving giddily a came nearer must see loose piece of seaweed jetsam being caught up into came forward in straight line perhaps a fast a man might run getting taller a approached gyrating more violently then in advance came into collision with wall of cliff on sat be shattered must hear like sound of rain sand rubbish of be composed falling upon rock oh did invent that hughie said be quite pretty trick be sign to faithless generation be that must smell wind did gull do prophesy to again lay back on dry grass trouble coming trouble coming said just storm asked be more prophecy oh just storm said always feel depressed irritated before storm be depressed irritated asked sorry thought be such nice calm morning hugh took up book at random proved to be swinburne poem ballad at random opened saw word though saw heaven in flower above must not love oh do read said nadine anything just where opened hugh sat up bitterness welling in throat read though saw heaven in flower above must not love nadine flushed slightly be annoyed with for flushing must not help knowing what must be in mind tried to make diversion think be to be blamed said quantity of flower stuck over sky must look very odd think must kindle anybody emotion that sound rather foolish poem read something else hugh shut book 'though fell on sleep must not weep ' be end of stanza said nadine looked at for long moment lip parted a if to speak only quivered word came there be doubt whatever a to what hugh meant still with love unawakened with tremendous egotism rampant saw further than be behaving very badly to have come down here to renew freedom intimacy of old day till to day have be silent stupid when spoke like silence stupidity be better be sorry for very sorry quiver of lip half at least consisted of self pity that made suffer too mean said speaking at length speaking very rapidly be odious of know quite well be sorry have told so cried remember cried when made that visit to winston cow looked at daresay be suffering damned torment be being unfair though love like wish did do think make suffer for own amusement be fun to see best friend like be fault have chosen to love heartless person if have liver lung instead of heart must be sorry for instead reproach oh not in word meant when said that where be book out of read there do to send into sea when gull come back will peck sea will drown first wind smell will blow to america understand be more stupid than gull made one swift motion with arm poem ballad flopped in sea a book dived clear of cliff into high water sea below more imminent than storm hugh have prophesied be storm in soul with love baffled raged at indifference with have given to distrusting for first time sense wisdom of gift raged at for rebellion against choice speak said for will tell more thing first be jealous of seymour hugh threw back head laughed jealous of seymour cried do really think must marry if consented in spirit in be taking once be true wanted to refused to cheat be word begged to cheat implored to cheat so long a gave did care how took so long a took now must take like now for last week have seen together know what be like have seen together much said nadine have seen enough told before marriage be farce be wrong be much worse than farce need laugh at farce ca help laughing at least ca at tragedy so ludicrous nadine got up situation be a violent sudden a electric storm what have be pent up in week have exploded something in exploded also think hate said be sure despise said got up also facing be like bursting of reservoir great sheet of quiet water be suddenly turned into torrent foam despise said again intended to love encouraged to let go time held in though there be nothing to hold in observed dissected cut down with damned scalpel lancet to heart said 'how interesting to see beating ' then looked coolly over shoulder saw seymour said 'he will do doe love love ' now doe love probably guess that so very soon lancet will come out again will see heart beating again will say 'how interesting ' there will be blood on lancet be safe of course from reprisal one can cut into see blood flow because have blood be something cold hellish often said understood too well now understand even better toast heart fry eat up be utterly at mercy have got mercy can manage to despise ca do much else nadine stood quite still breathing rather quickly that movement of nostril have tried to copy from did not make sneeze now be well must know other said with awful cold bitterness even though will know other for so little time more be always interesting to see real person if mean said hotly always showed real person have never acted to pretended have not changed be not responsible if can not see nadine passed tongue over lip seemed hard dry not flexible enough for speech be blindness then said know where be now hate despise know now then suddenly impulse wholy uncontrollable coming from knew not where seized compelled held out hand to hughie shake hand with said have be nightmare talk bad thing that one dream shake hand with will wake up what have be saying to other be impossible be real true be utter nonsense have be talking how longed to take hand clasp kiss how longed to wipe off have said have said somehow be beyond to do be by honest impulse that word of hate contempt have risen to lip word might be canceled what must not be quenched until mistake be shown in working of soul be thought fire have made boil up stood there lovely welcoming girl whom whole soul loved whose conduct whole soul despised eager for reconciliation yearning for mutual forgiveness request be impossible god must not cancel bitterness have made speak threw hand wide be good said be sorry said certain thing for there be use in saying ca help feeling that made say cancel speech by mean let word be unsaid with heart let be prepared to say again said nadine quietly come to yes come to be not jealous of seymour laughed when suggested be not jealous because love if loved must be jealous must say 'god bless ' a be a be say 'damn ' said nadine hugh shook head understand anything about love said how can until know little bit what mean must no more think say 'damn ' than must say bless ' nadine have withdrawn from welcome desire for reconciliation must make difference to said suppose must since make difference to said there be sense in adding hypocrisy to quarrel nadine sat down again on sweet turf cancel word then even if said hate ca hate more than can despise must have be talking in nightmare be used to nightmare said hugh have have six month of nightmare thought must wake thought must must pinch awake by seeing seymour together be still nightmare nadine looked up at oh hughie if loved said hugh looked at moment then turned away from outside of control certain muscle worked in throat felt strangled can say bless ' for nadine said huskily do say god bless darling nadine have leaned face on hand when turned away divined why turned from heard huskiness of voice thought of hughie wanting to cry gave pang that have never yet known like of there be long silence sitting with hand buried face seeing sunlight swim dance through tear then touched on shoulder so be friend again in spite of ourselves said just one thing more then since can talk without without hatred contempt why did refuse to marry because did not love yet consent to marry seymour like looked up at oh hughie fool said because matter so much more smiled back at want to wish mattered le said must matter le have reply to sat down again beside after little nadine turned to said thought be such calm morning said said that storm be coming said laid hand on knee will there be pleasant weather now said oh hughie what must give to get two three of old day back again when babbled chattered be so content speak for miss said hugh for god sake let begin again will quarrel with again give pain look here be bad job for came here to get oasis also to pinch awake metaphor be confusing thing bring on palm spring have put in appearance yet let try anyhow nadine sat up talking of weather began be yes be before began to exchange compliment broke off suddenly oh hughie what have happened to sun said know be moon said hugh need quote that shrew be tamed for time be shrew mouse lady mouse with foul temper do think about sun look be worth looking at right round two three diameter away ran complete halo pale white line in abyss of blue sky little feather of wind blown cloud have altogether vanished heaven be untarnished from horizon to zenith heat of ray have sensibly diminished though sunshine appeared a whole hearted a ever be warm no longer be second conjuring trick said hugh make whirlwind now make ring round sun cut off heating apparatus thing be going to happen look at sea too order sea be also worth looking at hour ago have be turquoise blue reflecting sky now seemed to reflect moonstone be gray white corpse of a have be then even a looked seemed to vanish altogether horizon line be blotted out for sky be turning gray also above below over cliff edge there be nothing invisible gray of emptiness sun halo spread inwards outwards so that sun peered like white plate through layer of vapor have suddenly formed across whole field of heaven still not whistle sigh of wind sounded hugh got up a have forgotten what third conjuring trick be said think have better go home look a if be going to be violent one paused moment peering out into invisible sea then there came shrill faint scream from somewhere out in dim immensity hold on to nadine cried lie down felt arm in stood there together scream increased in volume becoming maniac bellow then like solid wall wind hit did not begin out of dead calm a breeze did not grow from breeze to wind came from seaward like water of red sea on host of pharaoh overwhelming wall of riot motion nadine book one have cast over cliff edge turned over lay with flapping page then like wounded bird be blown along hillside hat have brought out with have not put on rose straight in air vanished hugh with nadine on arm have leaned forward against maniac blast two be not thrown down by path to house lay straight up steep hillside behind turning be so blown up that stumbled in trying to keep pace to irresistible torrent of wind hurried along took five minute to get up steep brae while have taken ten minute to walk down already there flew past seaweed sand wrack blown up from beach below above sun be completely veiled riot of cloud have already obscured higher air below be clear looked a if stone must be tossed upon hill on farther side of bay have to cross garden before came to house already two tree have fallen before hurricane blast even a hurried over lawn elm screaming in full foliaged bough leaned towards cracked fell then chimney in house wavered in outline next moment crashed down upon roof covey of flying tile fell round required hugh full strength to close door again after have entered nadine turned to flushed ecstatic hughie how divine said ca be measured that lovely force be infinite never knew there be strength like why have come in let go out again be god be just god eye too be alight with soul surged to lip yes god said be what love be rather rather big be then for first time nadine understood did not feel be able to understand oh hughie said how splendid must be to feel like section of party have gone to play golf on changeable morning be blown home few minute later met at lunch edith arbuthnot have arrived before of got back asked if world have be blown away a have not expressed ready to chaperone anybody berts be happy too said seymour when came in very late for lunch since wished to change clothes first a bemelled of wind ' because berts have at last driven ball two hundred yard let mention subject of golf must be tactless there be wind when accomplished that remarkable feat at least not more wind than there be now what there be be behind topped ball heavily said 'good shot ' have tact since have tact say to nadine that be good day to sit out on hillside read must scorn suggestion sudden sound a of drum on window interrupted tactful speech pane streamed anyhow will play golf said edith what doe little rain matter be not made of paper be good thing mother said berts if want to win match play with berts said seymour pensively if only want to be blown away killed anybody will do will get on with embroidery afternoon maid will sit by hold hand dear hope house be well built for moment certainly seemed a if be not case for whole room shook under sudden gust more appalling than anything have felt yet then died away again once more window be deluged with sheet of rain flung seemed almost horizontally against for few minute only that lasted then wind settled down so seemed to blow with steady uniform violence nadine have finished lunch gone across to window air be perfectly clear hill across bay seemed again stone throw away overhead straight across sky stretched roof of cloud away to west just above horizon line there be arch of perfectly clear sky of pale duck egg green out of seemed a out of funnel fury of gale be poured garden be strewn with branch battered foliage long gravel path flooded by tempest of rain be discharging upon lawn where pool of bright yellow water be spreading across too lay wreck of fallen tree splintered corps of what hour ago have be secure living thing waiting warm drowsy for tingle of springtime rising sap like body of young men on battlefield with potentiality of love life unfulfilled there by blast of insensate fury of wind lay stricken dead bird must no more build in branch make shadowed nook melodious with love song more must summer clothe in green autumn in livery of gold be dead thing at most must make little warmth on hearth before feathery ash be left of be dispersed on homeless wind pity of blind wantonness of destruction be more than compensated for in girl mind by savagery force of unlooked for hurricane easily persuaded hugh to come out with be beaten stormed upon always sensitive to weather portentous storm have aroused in sort of rapture of restlessness rejoiced in somehow feared for ruthlessness indifference took path led downward to beach for be tumult madness of sea nadine especially wished to observe though a yet gale have be blowing only hour two have raised monstrous sea long before came down within sight of heard hoarse thunder crash of broken water penetrating screaming bellow of gale air be salt with spray flying foam to west there be still clear that arch of open sky through gale poured somewhere behind cloud to left of sun be near to setting pale livid light shone out of catching top of breaker a streamed landwards between foam capped top lay gray hollow darkness out of must suddenly boil crest of mountainous water tide be only at half flood sea packed by astounding wind be already breaking at foot of cliff while in trough of wave a rode in there appeared disappeared again scattered rock from remote cliff fall be strewn about beach sometimes wave must strike one of full be shattered against spouting heavenwards in column of solid water oftener breaker swept over unbroken until with menace of toppling crest flung with huge tongue of hissing water on rock at foot of cliff then with scream of withdrawn shingle spent water be furiously dragged back to base of next incoming wave be caught up again to hurl against land sometimes sudden blast of wind must cut off crest of billow even a curled over fling monstrous riband of foam through air sometimes two wave converging rose up in fountain of water fell back without having reached shore way that rushing rolling in hill valley of water maddened sea crashed thundered moment spray rose more densely from infernal cauldron then a tide rose higher wave came in unbroken hurled ton of water against face of cliff above continuous a water fall rose roar scream of gale ominous insensate bewildering be a if element be being transferred back into chaos out of came nadine hugh clinging together for support stood there for minute way down side of cliff watching terror majesty of spectacle utterly absorbed in cruelly unconscious of then since must no longer get down to base of cliff skirted along till came to sandy foreshore of bay there from water level must better see hugeness of tumult strange hardness steepness of wave slope be a if line of tower great building be throwing down upon sand breaking up into wall eddy of foam sheeted water while behind there rose again street of toppling building again shattered on beach great ball of foam torn from spent water trundled by on sand bunch of brown seaweed torn from rock be flung in handful at foot once from arch in sky westward dusky crimson light suddenly burned turning wave crest to blood then a darkness of early winter sunset gathered turned be blown up steep cliff path again wet buffeted conversation have be altogether impossible must communicate with pointing finger nodding head yet somehow to be together thus cut off by rise of wind wave from sense of existence of others in pandemonium of tempest gave to hugh at least closer feeling of intimacy with nadine than have ever yet known clung to sheltered under shoulder unconsciously instinctively a animal trust master without knowing be trusting to aching hunger for be something gale be to bring closer together yet chapter x evening night long gale continued now then constant scream of must leap upwards couple of octave a shriller blast struck house again for moment mad chant must drop into silence from time to time like tattoo of drum rain battered at window pane through whether in hush of wind when fiercest squall descended beat of surf sounded ever louder through night result perhaps of agitated talk with nadine in morning of intimate gale encompassed isolation with in afternoon hugh turned tossed midway between sleeping waking sometimes seemed to to be yelling round house among spirit of air seeking admittance sometimes seemed to that be being beaten on by hammer of surf whether be homelessly wandering outside among spirit of wind be being done to death by incessant blow of beating wave be nadine that sought a night went on anguish of desire grew ever more acute beating of wave more poignant torture until while yet faintest lightening of winter dawn have touched gross blackness of night roused completely sat up in bed turned on light to awake riot outside be vastly magnified compared with dimmer trouble of dream so be yearning for nadine window looked eastward away from quarter of gale getting out of bed lifted sash peered out nothing must be seen be a if gazed into darkness of nethermost pit out of blown by blast of anger of god came shriek of soul might not rest driven forever along drenched by river of unavailing tear even though be awake strange remote horror of nightmare be on be in vain that tried to comfort by saying like child repeating senseless lesson deep depression have reached traveling eastward from atlantic tried to read still nightmare sense possessed fancied have to read whole line neither more le between pounding of wave then a usually happens towards end of walpurgis night got back to bed again slept calmly dreamlessly seymour alone out of party put in appearance at breakfast time seemed probable that others be compensating for disturbed night by breakfasting upstairs afterwards two went out together to look at doings of night by time wind have considerably moderated rain have ceased altogether thick pall of cloud have last night overlain sky be split up into fragment island flying vapor so that here there pale shaft of sunlight shone upon land sea thunder of surf have immeasurably increased when went to cliff edge nadine have passed down yesterday afternoon looked upon indescribable confusion of tremendous water tide be low bay be still packed with sea heaped up by wind end of reef with big scattered rock be out beyond wall of breaking water sea appeared to have be driven distraught by stress of night cross current carried wave in direction almost seemed that shrinking from wall of cliff in front be trying to beat out to sea again quite out away from land jousted sparred with other not jestingly seemed with grim purpose a if be practising strength for deed of earnest violence a for fierce civil war among be round furthest rock of reef that sport of billowy giant most centered right across bay ran current set on to end of reef there met with wave coming straight in shore from direction of blowing of gale then spouted foamed together yet not in play purpose so regular be round of combat seemed to underlie wrestling hugh threw away charred peninsula of paper once cigarette wind have smoked for never have felt much sense of comradeship in presence of seymour after breakfast stroll have more virtue than be reward of necessary politeness there be something rather senseless in display of wasted energy said seymour of wave must probably cook dinner if force be reasonably employed hugh in spite of restless night have something of nadine thrilled admiration for turmoil felt slightly irritated must certainly cook goose mine remarked seymour wondered whether must be well to say do allude to nadine a goose perhaps wisely refrained must be to good said goose be poor bird at time uneatable unless properly roasted hugh did not attend to polite rejoinder for have caught sight of something incredible not so far out at sea focused eye instantly on for moment what thought have seen completely vanished directly afterwards caught sight of again fishing boat with mast broken reeling drunkenly on top of huge wave quick long sighted eye told in one moment of slewing deck that presented to before be swallowed from sight in trough of next wave there be two figure on clinging to stump of broken mast look said there be boat out there rose again to crest of wave again plunged giddily out of sight incoming tide be bearing swiftly shorewards swiftly also cross current set towards end of reef be bearing there hugh did not pause laid hold of seymour by shoulder run up to house said fetch couple of men bring down with a much rope a can find say anything to nadine woman be quick ran down to beach a seymour went on errand seeing at once that there be two thing might happen to stricken wanderer of ship in one case incoming tide with following wave might bear straight on to sandy beach in other cross current in now be laboring might carry across to reef where wave be wrestling roaring together be in case of first contingency that ran down upon sand to be ready beach be steep there must ride until be flung down by fringe of toppling hard edged breaker in tumble scurry of surf might easily be that strong arm must drag out of fury of backwash be cast there boat decked fishing boat must be dumped down on sand there must be half minute quarter minute when something might be done on other hand greedy sucking current might carry on to reef then by mercy of god rope might be of avail if man must reach a ran down cliff sudden splash of sunlight broke through cloud making bright patch of illumination round boat a swung over breaker there be only one figure there now lying full length on deck clinging with hand to stump of mast then once again water broke over lucidly green in sunlight hugh heart went out to solitary prone body lying there helpless in hand of god gale heart stood still to see whether when next drifting boat reappeared must be tenantless with sob in throat oh thank god said when saw again be still doubtful whether current tide must win hugh pulled off coat waistcoat threw on beach in order to be able to rush in unimpeded of hand muscle then with strange sickness of heart saw that boat be getting in nearer moving sideways across to left where reef lay waited in suspense of powerlessness wind now have quite abated be a if have done work in making ready theater of plunging water now waited to observe what drama must be moving across stage of billow soon from behind heard across shingle at top of beach approach of others seymour have brought berts two men with brought with dozen long coil of rope part of fire rescue apparatus of house while watching waiting for plan be quite made be no longer possible to hope that boat must come to land on sandy beach where without doubt two three able bodied men must rescue one cast up be driving straight on to rock once there rescue be impossible only chance lay in reaching before be smashed to atom on immense boulder sharp toothed fang quickly tied three of rope together fastened end round body just below shoulder took off boot be going in said hold rope pay out if come near end of tie fresh piece on suddenly across shingle came footstep cry nadine ran down beach towards be clad only in dressing gown rainbow hued one in one night last june have entertained company in bedroom slipper so that ankle showed white bare saw what hugh intended something within denizen of soul who till that moment have be unknown to took possession of hughie not not screamed seymour anybody not cry have come from very heart must no more have stifled than must have stopped beating of then suddenly realized what have said sank down on beach burying face in hand take care of seymour said hugh there be more heroism required for few little word than for desperate feat be about to attempt did not look round again wish to say anything more there be time to lose now chap called out ran forward to edge of water at moment immense billow poised curled just in front of wash of covered waist deep floundered staggered a rush of water went by then a drew out to sea again ran with to where breaker be toppling in front of with low outward spring dived into hollowed water head foremost passed through beach be very steep here coming up again through beyond line of surf found in deep water behind lay breaking line of billow in front huge mountain of water rose fell unbroken a be lifted up on first of swimming strongly against saw not hundred yard from helpless drifting goal must see too who be who lay there desperately clinging to stump of mast with white slender wrist be quite young boy at sight hugh pity determination be strung higher than ever here be young creature in desperate plight among desperate waterway one who must not yet have known what peril meant at risk of spending little strength when strength be so valuable hugh gave great shout of notice encouragement then be swallowed up in trough of wave again when rose next saw that boy have raised head that saw current swept towards rock swept also little shorewards hugh measuring distance between boat fatal breaker with eye measuring again distance between boat knew that must exert to point of exhaustion to get to boat before be drifted to final destruction a swam knew have made mistake in not taking off shirt trouser also giving unimpeded use of limb trouser particularly dragged hampered then suddenly remembered water game at used to be expert at school namely taking header into bathing place in flannel undressing in water seemed worth while to sacrifice few second to accomplish a cool collected a when be doing for mere sport at school trod water slipped leg out of trouser saw float away from then twice a vigorous struck out again shirt did not bother besides rope be tied round chest there be not time for more disencumbrances for next five minute for be fighting tide just swam swam occasionally rising to wave seemed to that be making headway at somehow did not discourage only necessity concerned be that must go till must go no longer time like dream yet like draught of wine to be nadine involuntary cry hughie not did not trouble to guess what meant be only conscious that invigorated inspired minute passed once rope seemed to jerk back found swearing underneath breath then though be terribly heavy realized that be free again that be not being hampered then suddenly found much closer to boat than have idea of though be getting very tired gave new supply of nervous force swam into three valley more surmounted three ridge of water lo boat be on peak directly opposite to from opposite side plunged into same valley together not fifty yard off to left incredible fountain of foam spouted aspired then oh blessed moment caught hold of side of lurching fishing smack pale little boyish frightened face be close to clung for second to side went up down two big billow together then got breath enough to speak now little chap said be frightened for be right catch hold of rope here close to body just jump in be right plucky boy take hold with hand of rope not so cold be once again before let go of boat rose to immense wall of water hugh saw figure on beach four of standing in wash of sea paying out rope one standing there also little apart waving seaward clapping hand what said came to clear distinct across hill valley of destruction oh hughie well done well done cried now pull of pull in be glad added that for in hurry of moment have given no instruction a to what be to do when reached boat what seemed so obvious out here might not have seemed so obvious to on beach be not sure that there be enough power left in to shout to nadine understood once have said understood too well be enough now that understood enough let go of boat for moment seemed inclined to follow thought bowsprit be going to hit then felt little pull on rope under shoulder boat made sort of bow of farewell slid away towards spouting tower of foam hugh be utterly exhausted must just paddle with hand kick downwards to keep head above water gave away one breath yet nothing to be frightened at said be right now buoyant water for wickedness of foam savage hunger sustained sufficiently turned round seaward in water so that great surge did not overwhelm from behind put arm on rope underneath boy neck so a to support forced even in utter weariness to be collected to remember that for several minute yet there be nothing whatever to be done except with minimum possible of exertion to keep afloat while rope towed back towards that line of steep tower curling precipice beyond lay shore who stood on shore sometimes crest of wave broke over almost smothering then again found on downward hillside of water where panting lung must be satisfied laboring heart supplied somewhere inside of knew wanted to know where poor foundered fishing smack have come from how young boy have managed to cling to have not sufficient strength to give voice to desire for that have must be husbanded to meet that final assault of row of breaker through have to pas a got nearer began to form plan young unknown life precious to now a unborn baby to woman be given into charge seemed to that a woman have to bring life within to birth cost so have to save life of unknown little fisher boy take risk lay beyond line of breaker business be here did not for one second argue value did not forget nadine last cry to a set forth on peril for moment there be something concerned even more than nadine have to make best plan must for saving young life have be put in hand even if fought god over only question be how to get best chance of saving be close in now three minute pause of floating have restored be just conscious of bitter cold even a be conscious of group on edge of sand of hissing water none of thing seemed to have anything to do with be external phenomenon between shore be still three towering line of breaker sharp edged steep a rock third of suddenly fumbled disappeared with thick thud uprising of shattered spray suddenly plan proved fully finished to mind have be swimming for not more than quarter of hour minute of fierce outward struggle have seemed so long to have to nadine passed in flash for once have got completely outside concentrated absorbed in time have gone by in one flare of triumphant expectation for one moment after heart cry have be flung out of have sat dazed bewildered by consciousness that seemed to have revealed to for until have cried out that seymour that anybody hugh must make desperate attempt have not known own heart must have for be not till then that be unlocked to herself when looked up again hugh have already plunged through breaker be swimming instantly soul be with there in inhuman sea glorying in strength proud of splendid desperate adventure not for one moment doubtful of success none felt must do be impossible that must fail must not have have back by side saying that attempt be mere suicide for happiness that world contained have be able to change place with boy who clung to helpless boat must have sprung ecstatic to noble risk for sake of having hugh battle sea on way to rescue failing that have be gloriously ordained that must do that must stand with heart uplifted be privileged to see triumphant venture saw reach boat knowing that must clapped hand called to with bright eye laughing mouth eagerly watched getting nearer then just at moment when hugh made plan realized that between there lay that precipice of water kept flinging down in thunder on shore ever re forming again light died out of face grew ashen gray to lip watched hugh have be floating with face seaward now turned round to shore again saw smile at boy a rose on crest of wave saw speak now be right be what said get on back hold on to shoulder rope have ceased to pull men in control of just held taut waiting to pull when exact moment came boy did a be told next moment two rose up on crest of line of breaker twenty foot below a topped hugh looked over upon backwash of preceding wave be being dragged into billow bore be growing higher a rose to ruin boy fall must be broken at least plan seemed to give best chance then wave curled be flung forward twisting a fell saw slim little figure have be carrying shot over shoulder flung clear of direct impact of wave on beach heard mind say wo hurt then felt something stupendous a heavy a world strike on back after that felt nothing more at a dusk be closing in nadine sat in window of big black painted bedroom where so many well attended session have be held hugh have be in surgeon hand since carried in must be done have be done afterwards nadine have seen surgeon learned from there be to fear little there be to hope for be possible that hugh might not live till morning simply pas away from shock of injury on other hand splendid constitution might pull through given that lived through immediate danger be doubtful if must ever lead active life again boy have saved be practically unhurt be fast asleep nadine sat there very quiet in mind body did not want to rave rebel merely let mind sit a be in front of thing contemplate like picture until became familiar felt be not familiar yet though knew to be true be somehow unreal incredible did not yet grasp seemed to that mind be stunned be incapable of apprehending so have to keep attention fixed on until became real yet found difficult to control mind kept wandering off into concentric circle round center of only significant thing in world out on sea sun have set there be cloud bar of fading crimson on horizon level across field of saffron yellow yellow toned off into pale watery green high up in middle of be one little cloud like island still blazed in sunlight of upper air somehow that aroused train of half forgotten reminiscence there have be patch of sunlight once like island on gray of sea be connected with picture yes be sketch esther have made for hugh have put in island reluctantly saying looked unreal in nature must be worse in art hugh have wanted there a esther worked have walked with along beach from have be carried up to day have told that lived in unreality pictured to that day must live on golden sunlit island together remembered now mind came back to center again started off anew on splendid deed of morning have quite lost head when called out hughie not must have be hugh to do one else must have done idea of berts seymour wrestling with overcoming that mountainous maddened sea be unthinkable only hugh must have done deed be a much part of a brown eye white strong teeth if at end sea have flung down broken be after have laughed at peril snatched prey out of very jaw even a thing be now with nadine must not regret what have done if time have run back saw again plunging into riot turmoil felt that must not now cry out to like must have called godspeed to instead once again mind rippled away from center have called out to seymour berts to go at time have be quite instinctive saw now what have prompted instinct meant though then did not know meant that must spare one hugh be what came to wondered if hugh have understood that seymour without doubt must have done so be so clever probably must tell understood ask if be not that be implied such consideration seemed to to matter very little there be only one thing mattered be not whether hugh lived died even simply fact of hugh mother have telegraphed that be coming at once nadine remembering that have not told servant got up rang bell before be answered there came interruption for have be waiting one of two nurse whom surgeon from chester have brought with knocked at door have be tidying up removing trace of what have be done room be neat again now said may come just look at be conscious in pain asked nadine may regain consciousness at time think will have pain went together up long silent passage in there hung that curious hush settle down on house when death be hovering by came to door

carried not to own room to with dressing room adjoining bed stood along wall to left of door lay on back with head little sideways towards there be nothing in room suggested illness when nadine looked at face there be nothing there that suggested eye be closed face be a untroubled a of quiet sleeper in wall opposite be western looking window room be lit only by fast fading splendor cloud island

summer in ice of winter in have be broken up in rain make growth life of world frozen ground melted under soil cracked with drought drank in parody of life that have lived became farce preceded sweet serious drama tragedy might be something human dodo woman also understood that too have lived year parodied knew what awakening to womanhood be immensity of unsuspected kingdom have come late to to nadine early be almost born in consciousness of birthright others died without realizing so mother daughter sat there in silence while nadine wept fill be splendidest adventure said at length lifting

by nadine be willing to talk most outrageous nonsense to give sense of vitality to to make see that great happening like end be thing to moan brood over must be taken with much more than resignation quality despised with hardly le than gaiety such at rate be private human gospel found have not served so badly have quite missed vocation said ought to have be born in poverty stricken criminal class to show world that being hungry doe not make unhappy more than having three diamond tiara make happy have got that birthright nadine live up to never anticipate trouble if come embrace welcome be part of life thus becomes friend oh wish have be here morning must have shouted for glee to see that darling hughie go churning out to sea be jealous of just think if papa jack have come wooing of a really

promised mother not to sit up a undressed almost smiled at uselessness of going to bed so impossible did seem that sleep must come near after one outburst of cry have felt no further agitation for something so big so quiet have entered heart that poignancy of anxiety suspense be powerless to disturb a have be said be scarcely even whether hugh lived died that mattered only thing that mattered be hugh have be compelled to say whether believed must live not must have given negative yet there be quality of peace in must not be shaken be peace humbled exalted wrapped round very close yet looked up to a to mountain peak on dawn have broken despite conviction that sleep be impossible have hardly closed eye when embraced swallowed up consciousness cyclone of emotion in center of dwelt windless calm have utterly tired out though be unaware of fatigue rest be dreamless then suddenly be aware that there be light in room that be being spoken to passed from unconsciousness back to full

asking for said nurse doctor be with think have better come be possible that if see there may go off to sleep again be possible be not afraid darling nadine mouth quivered into something very like smile afraid of hughie asked went up stair along passage together moon that last night have be hidden by tempest of storm cloud perhaps blown away from sky by wind now rode high cloudlessly amid multitude of star wind moved across ample floor only from beach heard plunge thunder of sea must not so easily resume tranquillity moonlight came through window of hugh room also making on floor shadow map of bar be lying again with face towards door now eye be vacantly open whole face have changed there be agony of weariness over from eye there looked out dumb unavailing rebellion before have got to door have heard voice inside speaking voice nadine did not recognize kept saying over over again nadine nadine a came across room to bed looked straight at be clear did not see monotonous unrecognizable voice went on saying nadine nadine doctor be standing by head of bed looking intently at hugh doing nothing nurse be at foot signed to nadine to come took step towards have got to make feel be here said then with hand beckoned to nurse to dodo to stand out of sight of hugh so that by chance might think alone with girl nadine knelt down on floor so that face be close to unseeing eye mouth babbled name great peace be with still spoke in ordinary natural voice without tremor yes hughie yes said go on calling here be what be use of calling now came a soon a knew wanted nadine nadine

have nap will be ripping said nadine assuming sleepy voice there be silence for little then once again in own voice hugh spoke name time did not answer felt hand move till rested against plaited hair then in silence nadine became conscious of noise regular slow a faint hoarse thunder of sea sound of quiet breathing after while doctor came round head of bed can manage to wrap up make fairly comfortable whispered think have better chance of sleeping if stop there light radiance in nadine eye be miracle of beauty like enchanted dawn rising over virgin unknown land smiled unmistakable answer did not speak presently dodo returned with pillow blanket spread over folded round nurse will be in next room said doctor call if anything be wanted dodo doctor went back to room nadine be left alone with hugh night be birthnight bridal night of soul there be born through long hour of winter night watched beside lover beloved in stillness of surrender to absorption in lie beyond above unrest of passion amid snow sunshine of uttermost region to human spirit can aspire knew nothing of passing of hour for long time did thought desire of sleep come near eyelid dim room became to golden island of once in uncomprehending mockery have spoken to hugh knew to be golden now so far from being unreal there be nothing in experience so real a must just turn head without disturbing hugh hand lay on plaited hair from time to time looked round at face still wore sunken pallor of exhaustion a sleep so still even breathing began to restore low ebb of vital force seemed to nadine that darkness of valley of shadow to entrance of have be so near cleared off face a eclipse pass from moon how near have be guessed seemed to for present face be set other way knew too that be who have have power to make look life ward again knowledge filled with sort of abasing pride have answered to voice when be past other voice have come back in obedience to did not must not yet be troubled with thought of anything else besides fact that hugh lived a far a be known yet might never recover activity of movement again year of crippled life be lay in front of in passing away of immediate imminent fear must not weigh even consider what must mean similarly thought of seymour lay for present outside focus of mind everything fact that hugh lived be blurred have wavering outline a hour went on oblong of moonshine on floor moved across room narrowing a went then moon sank velvet of cloudless sky grew darker star more luminous one great planet tremulous twinkling made glory beside lesser light paled into insignificance wind stirred in great hall of night moan yell of unquiet soul be still boom of surf grew ever le sonorous like thunder of retreating storm occasionally night nurse appeared at doorway of room adjoining where sat a often nadine looked up at smiling once very softly came round head of bed looked at hugh then bent down towards girl wo get sleep said nadine made little gesture of raised eyebrow parted hand be characteristic of know whispered perhaps not want to then solitary night vigil began again seemed to that must not have bartered minute of for best hour that life have known before utter peace happiness of grew a night went on for still close to head there came regular uninterrupted breathing weight just weight of hand absolutely relaxed lay on hair not faintest stir of movement other than regular respiration came from bed laughter joy of day have be full be a light of remotest of star compared to glorious planet sang in windless sky when weighed against joy that quiet breathing gave did not color consciousness with hope did not illuminate by prayer there be room in mind for anything except knowledge that hugh slept lived be now near dawning of winter day star be paling in sky sky grew ensaffroned with indescribable hue herald day footfall muffled remote began to stir in house far away there came sound of crowing cock faint exultant hailing dawn about time nadine looked round once more at hugh saw in pallid light of morning that change have noticed before be more distinct there have come back to face something of firm softness of youth there have be withdrawn from droop hardness of exhaustion turning again gave one sigh fell fast asleep lover beloved lay there sleeping while dawn brightened in sky leaning against bed where be stretched with hand on hair strangely moment that slept position seemed to be reversed hugh in sleep appeared unconsciously to keep watch over guard though night have be awake for once head slipped inch two so that hand no longer lay on hair seemed a if movement reached down to fathom deep in slumber immediately afterwards hand have lain so motionless inert night moved a if to magnet after bright hair seeking finding again dawn brightened into day sun leaped up from lair in east still nadine slept hugh slept be a if until then balance of vitality have kept girl awake to pour into of superabundance now be drained sleep with level stroke of soft hand across furrow of trouble jagged edge of injury exhaustion comforted alike have be arranged after event of storm that party must disperse dodo went to early breakfast downstairs with departing guest who be leaving soon after first went into nurse room next door to where hugh lay to make enquiry be taken by to look into sick room with daylight sleep seemed only to have deepened be like slumber of lover who have be long awake in passion of mutual surrender at end have fallen asleep like child with mere effacement of consciousness nadine head be little bowed forward breath came not more evenly than be sleep of childlike content bound bound together dodo looked long then with redoubled precaution moved softly into nurse room again with mouth quivering between smile tear dear never saw anything so perfectly sweet said do let have sleep out nurse nadine have slept in hugh room night what duck please god will so often happen again nurse bryerley be not unsympathetic felt that explanation be needed understood young lady be engaged to one else said dodo smiled until now one have quite understood young lady said least of have understood

afterwards asked must like to sleep day like then see nurse be very odd woman disturb till must think soul be getting to know other may not be scientific nursing think be sound nursing be too bad ca eternalize such moment of perfect equilibrium certainly young lady be awake till nearly dawn said nurse bryerley must hurt to have good rest dodo beamed oh leave a long a possible said have idea how

have in lovely back room one remember so particularly esther berts lay on bed like sardine in evening dress have just refused to marry hugh who be playing billiards with uncle algie somehow thing like love devotion seemed to quite old fashioned anyhow seemed to sign of age did indeed thought clear brain be infinitely preferable to confused heart especially if belonged to somebody else be not used to mama still seems to very odd like hat doe fit be fact suppose will grow into not that one ever grew into hat when hugh swam out yesterday morning something came tumbling down inside be that only something cracked like shell of nut doe not much matter so long a be not mended again how queer that must happen in second like suppose time have nothing to do with what concern one soul believe plato say something about think will look up wrote wonderfully when thing happens to oneself seems to matter more than plato reflection on subject there be short pause a nadine brushed teeth dodo sitting on unslept in bed did not feel inclined to break wondered whether particular point in situation must occur to nadine whether illumination a regard woman heart threw light on very different affair man heart be not left long in doubt question of man heart be altogether unilluminated to dodo there be something poignantly pathetic about nadine blissful ignorance came sat down on bed close to mother hughie will see love said because wo be able to help will just wait oh so happily for to say again what have so often said before will know answer before give hope will say soon then will be engaged people who be engaged be little freer be mama dodo felt incapable of clouding radiant face for knew in day be coming radiance must be needed not single sparkle of light must be wasted did not seem to very likely that hugh whose joyous strength splendid activity have be so often rejected by nadine must be likely to offer to again what must be in probability crippled parody of sense of justice told that nadine owed strength encouragement eager vitality must give be only fair that must devote to let feel inspiration to live that care of must give seemed to very doubtful if hugh must consent even if perceived that be love not warm friendship that gave to let crippled body appeal to in day gone by must not marry for love seemed to dodo that real man a hugh be must not allow to marry for pity have offered best have refused must not be surprising if refused to offer worst joy have inspired dodo so that have softly melted over sight of nadine asleep by hugh have exultantly mopped up spilt ink with edith suddenly evaporated leaving dry cold must wait nadine said must make plan give hughie vitality ask more got up now darling will go downstairs said order breakfast must be hungry then can say prayer breakfast will be ready nadine absorbed in own thought felt nothing of prayer said why be praying night till dawn at least be wanting just wanting not for be that prayer dodo loved that

hugh be still so ill dodo insisted must not be played in house gave rather melancholy note be productive of moisture finished passage seemed to have end before acknowledged compliment then emptied cor anglais into heather poor bertie be drone said never think worth while to do anything well berts be better think worth while to sit on father really properly thought energy might wake bertie up be chiefly why married only made go to sleep lichfield be about level know anything about lichfield know much about bertie seem to rather suitable much more can be done with cor anglais than wagner ever imagined solo in tristan be absolute child play must perform with week practice dodo have be engaged in small incendiary operation among heather with match with have cigarette for moment seemed that incendiarism be going to fulfil on larger line than have intended jack have set fire to wale like lloyd george cried stamp on with great foot what great large strong foot how beautiful be foot of put out incendiary attempt in wale about bertie edith if will stop playing that lamentable flute for moment flute asked edith trombone if like point be that vitality have inspired bertie have only drained

nadine of course have except on first night seemed to mean much to what be that so nearly died then kept calling for in dreadful strange voice when came did know for time then put whole soul into darling made know went to sleep slept rather lay awake night by bed saved life jack said so seems rather perverse to refuse to marry when be sound moment be terribly injured to want to said jack darling be use criticizing people said dodo unless by criticism can change even then be great responsibility must no more change nadine by criticizing than must change nature of wildcat at zoo by sitting down in front of cage telling did like disposition that have not good temper may take nadine be utterly in love with a have always be utterly in love with know why want to take nadine away bell wedding cake a soon a hugh can hobble to church oh jack see said if know hughie at must dream of offering to nadine until be certain that will be able bodied man again be expecting to be worrying

hit policeman in face why must be to do asked jack because be papa jack said dodo girl listens to man when must not heed woman oh might tell be probably true that edith be going away to morrow want somebody to take care of at winston think even nadine must see that must not quite do if be left here alone with hughie at least be possible might see that must use to help to preach down stepdaugher heart must think of thing for though because in heart be really altogether on nadine side think be wonderful that must now be waiting so eagerly humbly for hugh poor crippled hugh a at present be to speak have chosen good part like mary want for present to take away from be wiser for to go be asked dodo grammatically to supply ruthless foe be with gun ammunition against daughter ca take side remarked jack jack wish be woman for one minute just to feel how ludicrous such observation be life not perhaps edith be passed in taking side whole heart go out to hugh who have be so punished for gallant recklessness then moment say 'punished think of nadine awakened love shout 'no meant rewarded then think of nadine wonder if must bear being married to cripple simultaneously now that have shown can love can not bear thought of being married to anybody else after nelson have only one eye one arm though be exactly married to lady hamilton be sure be divinely happy then best of think of hugh making complete recovery once more coming to nadine with great brown doggy eye telling then for once take side only one be theirs if must advance happiness must even take away from poor little seymour jade antoinette be nadine left with without single qualm of regret jack considered moment after have left where found said jack who have rather taken edith view about marriage have only

nadine darling said inherited run in family jack jumped up took dodo hand in will not talk horrible scandal about woman love said be true said dodo therefore be more abominable of to repeat said there be certain obstinacy about dodo that morning think be good for to keep scandal alive in heart said use monk to keep pea in boot to prevent from getting too comfortable monk be idiot said jack loudly one le like monk than never saw monk indeed besides believe used to boil pea first dodo face have be little troubled cleared considerably that showed great commonsense said think can have be such

present heard of nomenclature in fact doe credit that instantly guessed to whom allusion be being made oh be settled be said now david mother give little news of be well dodo mouth grew extraordinarily tender oh so well jesse said so well be standing foot so above on steep hillside bending down to kissed be silent moment then decided swiftly characteristically that few word like have just passed between be a eloquent a longer speech became more usual self again be such dear jack said will forgive dreadful ignorance of name of david mother oh look at sea gull fishing for lunch oh for wing of sea gull not to fly away be at rest at to take straight to dining room feel certain nadine will listen to must be good thing to take away for little be living on nerve be a expensive a

write symphony so beautiful that by common consent will throw away work of beethoven bach brahms just a throw away antiquated bradshaws be rather out of breath after delivering herself of series of remarkable statement jack got in word who be david mother asked with rather tiresome reversion to abandoned topic know care said dodo with dignity be going to be required jack wisdom to persuade nadine to go away with more particularly because at first opening of subject edith who be present whom jack have unfortunately forgotten to take into confidence gave passionate denial to fact that be departing also in end yielded for during last fortnight have felt a by illumination of love must not help doing at present beeant ' very little to hugh presence on first critical night have not done le than set face towards life instead of death have felt since then dimly troubled perplexed day have thought that must need day passed still lay there with barrier between yet day might want be loth to go knew how tired overstrained felt ingenious papa jack made use of have given can dear for present said come away rest what be dodo phrase fill pond again must become exhausted will be so much

content to do best for patient according to light will say that will be back soon asked nadine have direct reply to ah do make get well said be what be here for will say that will be back soon will if want soon said nadine that minute hugh slept long that morning dodo be not told be awake ready to receive morning call till traveler have be gone couple of hour have spent in pleasant atmosphere of conscious virtue engendered by feeling that have sent jack away when must much have preferred stopping here a dodo explained to edith took quite little thing to make feel good whereas took lot to make feel wicked nice morning for instance said sending darling jack away because be good for nadine getting postal order quite little thing like make feel perfect saint whereas power of hell have to do worst a hymn say to make feel wicked edith gave rather elaborate sigh have to sigh carefully because have cigarette pen in mouth while be scratching out blot have made on score be revising so care be needed otherwise cigarette pen might have be shot from mouth when spoke utterance be indistinct mumbling suppose infer that be more at home in heaven than hell said since just touch make feel saint must say be other way about be so at home in other place that most abysmal depth of infamy have to be presented to before know be wicked at whereas hail a divine most infinitesimal distraction break monotonous round of vice perhaps be expressing too strongly feel strongly world be more high colored to than to other people darling never heard moderate well balanced statement said dodo do go on want to thought optimism about be sickly wanted dash of discouragement nadine be same if behave charmingly tell to give praise to if behave abominably say ' ca help be nature fault for making like ' now be not like do take responsibility say ' be take leave ' have doubt that nadine belief have be too wonderful of to fall in love with hugh when jilt seymour say 'enquire at nature workshop firm be entirely independent ' bah dodo laughed laugh died rather quickly ah be hard edith said most of want encouragement at time have to encourage by making out a nice a can otherwise must look on mess make of thing a hopeless job perhaps be hopeless be one thing must allow be like dodo paused for simile be like child to whom be given quantity of lovely little square of mosaic know soul know that can be put together into most beautiful pattern begin fairly well then devil come along jog elbow smash up probably be own stupidity be more encouraging to say be devil nature something not good heaven elbow have jogged often enough when pattern get on well encourage by saying 'this be clever good wise doing now ' then perhaps something very big solemn come way bow head know be ourselves at edith have finished erasing blot be gathering sheet together tapped dramatically with inky forefinger be big solemn said be artist inspiration never come from outside be always from within be going to send to have band part copied to day at moment message came that hugh received dodo got up have received edith one morning effect be that have eaten lunch have dozed uneasily afternoon edith have be content with explanation that vitality be too strong for while ready to give dose of did not press matter anyhow have other business on hand lay propped up in bed with wad of pillow at back looked far more

dodo said be awfully brisk to day nurse bryerley put in warning word be too brisk said please let be too brisk added looking at dodo hughie dear do look better said will all be quite calm contained like flat hugh frowned for moment then face cleared again see said bright be aunt dodo have certainly woke up morning look real do know before be never quite certain about looked a if might be good forgery spurious have cigarette why must wiser not said nurse bryerley laconically be briskness did not seem to be entirely good natured how on earth must cigarette hurt said perhaps must be wiser for

thought might have seen that without annoying said hugh well well mind having one cigarette to keep lady chesterford company said nurse will be disappointed dodo took out case a nurse bryerley left room here be hughie said hugh lit one blew cloud of smoke through nostril be quite fresh aunt dodo said yes dear quite doe taste right yes delicious said hugh absolutely determined not to find disappointing say what sunny morning be too much in eye be rather will ask nurse bryerley to pull blind down why must chiefly dear because be trouble dodo pulled down blind too far on first attempt to be pleasing not far enough on second hugh felt be very clumsy be nadine coming to see morning asked daresay be tired of sitting with day dodo came back to chair by bed again went off with jack to winston morning said just for change be very much tired overdone have be fearful anxiety to dear bad boy hugh put cigarette down shut mouth a if firmly determined never to speak again came in to say

bryerley to tell so if asked hugh moved across other hand so dodo lay between must ask one more thing said be because of in way that chucked seymour entreat to say 'no if be 'no ' ca say 'no said dodo hugh drew one long sobbing breath be mere pity then said nadine always liked be always impulsive like daresay wo marry till be better if be ever better will wait till be strong enough to enjoy thoroughly dodo interrupted hughie say bitter untrue thing like said feel be not going to marry seymour now afterwards once again hugh be silent after interval dodo spoke divining exactly what be in irritable convalescent mind have never deceived before hughie said have right to distrust now be telling truth also tell truth when say must get bitter thought out of mind ah dear be not always easy there be beast within of there be beast within said hugh there be dear brave fellow whom be so proud of said dodo hugh lip quivered there be quality in silence a different from have gone before a there be between calling for nadine on night when fought death for now be enough said dodo will read to hughie will leave for present held hand moment longer think will lie still think said good luck to fishing dear said rising good luck to fishing said be on picture small boy fishing kneeling in wave dodo beat strategic retreat be said seemed to hugh that voice lacked blank enquiry tone of ignorance hugh settled little lower down on backing of pillow after dodo have left tried to arrange mind so that topic concerned stood consecutively dodo last remark certainly must have stood last also in reflection kept on shouldering forward have wished good luck to fishing must not bring to believe consciously unconsciously there be not in mind certain picture of little winged boy kneeling in wave who dropped red line into unquiet sea must not did not try to remember painter certainly picture have be at exhibition nadine have attended together little winged boy title be printed after number in catalogue nadine be not to marry seymour now afterwards there came black speck again over thought have be got rid of by crippling accident now have expunged seymour also 'and though saw heaven in flower above must not love ' line came into mind without searching for for moment must not remember where have heard then memory began to awake hitherto have not be able to recall anything of day two preceded catastrophe few of immediate event before have never forgotten remembered nadine calling out hugh not remembered cry of well done remembered that have toppled in on line of toppling water with small boy on back now fresh line of memory have be awakened connection in brain have be restored remembered quarrel reconciliation on day gale began how have said oh hughie if only loved soon after came portentous advent of wind with blotting out of sun transformation of summer sea heard with unspeakable irritation entry of nurse bryerley seemed unwarrantable intrusion for felt a if have be alone with nadine now assiduous grenadier broke in upon with hundred fidgety office to perform restored to fallen pillow closed window through breeze be blowing rather freely brought cup of chicken broth seemed eternity before asked if be comfortable made long delayed exit even then reminded that doctor be due in hour for hour must be alone now for first time since accident found that wanted to think hitherto mind have sat vacant like idle passenger who see without observation interest transit of country dodo visit morning communication to have made life appear thing once more concerned till now be manoeuver taking place round outside now warmth of reached again began to circulate through what have told be being blown out a be in brain even a lather of soapsuds be blown out into iridescent bubble on gleam hue of sunset moonrise rainbow rainbow be not one of vague dream in lately mind have moved be real thing not receding coming nearer to blown towards by steady breeze not idly vagrant in effortless air must break on heart not into nothingness into one white light out of sum of light color be made must not doubt that be dodo meant nadine have thrown over seymour concerned then swift a coming of storm have seen together came thought clear precise a row of thunder cloud that for knew barrier forever impenetrable lay between for must never offer to cripple same pride have refused to let take intimate place beside after by acceptance of seymour have definitely rejected forbade without possibility of discussion to let tie to unless must stand sound whole beside must be competent in brain bone body to be nadine husband for a yet have guarantee since accident have not up till now cared to know precisely what injury be whether must ever completely
