colin went back to room after invariable rubber of whist that evening with intention of studying plan more minutely though others have gone upstairs be not surprised to hear door open violet asking if must speak to indeed almost expected that interruption smiled to when entered there have be horrid little scene at close of dinner dovecote fluttering in menagerie arising from colins having instructed nino to dispense wine to be lavish in ministration to uncle ronalds glass wine in question be dagonet to be incapable of putting up smallest resistance nino did duty so thoroughly that uncle ronald have got on very quickly have told story might possibly have passed with snigger in smoking room of broad minded men even aunt hester who be a broad minded a most people have said better hold tongue ronald youre disgracing while perfect piece of patience aunt margaret bridled folded napkin diligently perused menu card have so neatly written out though at period of dinner information be obsolete then when woman have adjourned uncle ronald having be told that there be not much port left have partaken so freely of what there be that have become wonderfully voluble about old day when father used to sit here together colin have taken ninos place a dispenser of wine so sedulous be that uncle ronald presently lost power of coherent speech altogether when tried to rise leaned lamentably against table be assisted upstairs by butler nino again be quite in accordance with tradition of house colin have joined lady alone said that uncle have gone to bed with nasty cough troublesome cough made feel little giddy clogged free functioning of vocal chord of course be directed against violet who must be taught that if colin expressed wish that must undertake little mission like telling father mother that must no longer consider stanier house must be good wife obey colin be just unlocking drawer where kept memoir when entered hailed with smile word of welcome that vi said have come for little talk be nice sit down looked at in silence a brought book out continuing to stand thought told to sit down said ill stand said glanced at still smiling have better do what tell said thats right how simple isnt now what have come about something tedious suppose about father eh wasnt horrid at dinner made blush for dyed hair story awful for aunt margaret granny too at age servant looked at again in silence then dropped eye suppose be plan to make tipsy night said until tell that mother be not to come back here after visit to aix colin nodded at with sunny smile of absolutely correct said how well understand other dear youve come here to tell youre going to be good do a youre told be that yes cant sit by see father a saw to night what do want to say to oh just say that understand hell be settling down in london for autumn for ever ever just little tact pleasantness colin awfully hard on said mother have practically lived here since marriage yes darling nice long visit a said yesterday must put name in visitor book saturday whenever be till monday though dont often criticize must remind that shouldnt always think of do mean by asked ill explain youve got real filial feeling for father mother that prick conscience so to mollify that smart take side want to have comfortable home here that doesnt cost anything give atoning feeling inside be cheap manner of making amends to there be just grain of truth in made impossible for violet to deny completely have not consciously thought of when pointed out knew be so there be plenty of other reason kindliness affection compassion prompted with amazing subtlety have put finger on smallest meanest of be adept at seeing worst side of everybody said must be rude if suggested that reason for be that worst side of people be so much more to front than best asked colin put worst foot foremost then think of dennis vi must like to have among early recollection of boyhood memory of grandfather telling bawdy story reeling up to bed after dinner in squall of hiccup then last least there father bore disgust hinted to that be not perhaps such fixture here a seemed to imagine now please youre going to repeat timid conviction so that may see on a on point be at one mind suggestion have got to come from not from otherwise will think have asked to make now weve spent too much time speech already over trivial matter think im brute then often do im used to getting almost callous about held up sheaf of typed page have occupied morning ive have delicious day said for ive be reading memoir of old colin have type written theyre entrancing realized so wonderfully there be false shame conceit about be proud reverse of being such devil thought of letting learned antiquarian society publish odd isnt how puritanical pure minded people chiefly woman who shiver be shocked at what call bad man wont visit have to dinner heave sort of brick at greedily devour indecent memoir simply roll in like dog when theyve found putrescent muck youd have thought that if shudder at wickedness wouldnt care to read about say historical interest make devour isnt true insatiable fascination that wickedness have for prude however memoir be enchanting ring so absolutely true feel be looking at very man even found believing in literal truth of legend sit down dip into darling wont find dull page anywhere meantime im puzzling out curious plan of projected addition to house never executed wont read to night said be rather late very good wont insist on a youve be good girl otherwise must read day want to know if certain thing strike a struck what be that asked why old colin be sort of prophet felt time a if be writing not about about how type repeat there be character mention so closely resembles someone know old colins father in fact ronald stanier whom describes a drunken old sot good night darling not kiss suppose dont deserve one youre punishing for being such brute paused at door there stood looking gaily yet wistfully at with mouth little open soft fire of youth burning in eye yearned for surely be not only beauty that adored that physical perfection of there be somebody surely imprisoned there who called to through bar of nature love of evil hate of love a often a have tried to reach prisoner be a if guardian of soul monstrous terrifying pushed panic stricken away hated feared ruthless wickedness in spite of knew that must never cease from trying to get past rescuing who lay there in iron bondage turned back into room eye troubled eager full of love full of fear gust of inspiration came to colin hate love said cant help giving pity so know heart pours out round in pity youve tried to kill love cant so much stronger than whipped round on good lord must have misheard said asked for kiss not sermon dont want go to bed door closed behind stood there moment simmering with anger contempt at undesired homily with puerile message must have laughed at idea of love being strong love be most helpless defenceless of piece on savage chessboard be vulnerable at point must wound thrust at clumsy stroke penetrated made bleed must rope down to rack quite without effort pull lever wrenched distorted made white with silent agony how strange just now violet must give vent to gabble like when moment before have shrunk from brutality in dealing with father in small way be like martyr praising blessing god a limb writhed with anguish that be accounted worthy to suffer for sake be like comely smoothed limbed s sebastian in gallery for nino might have be model who seraphically smiled while be being made pin cushion for arrow certainly colin have tried a said to kill love often have wounded though none of thrust must seem have proved mortal shrugged shoulder there be plenty more weapon in armoury above there be one a yet be not ready for use for blade be still soft unannealed wondered if love must survive thrust when dennis be sword of wickedness in hand brought out again sketch plan have puzzled examined through magnifying glass certainly word have conjectured to be solarium did not stand closer scrutiny now when looked again at plan oblong room thus conjecturally labelled must not be solarium for on south where must expect to be open to present row of big window to admit sun there be two very narrow aperture marked there at east end however there be indicated very big window took up nearly whole length of wall colin turned attention to written word again solarium certainly be not for second letter be c surely not o there be faint cross stroke over l made t of letter quite illegible preceded final arium sct thought colin suddenly new solution dawned on must be sctuarium abbreviated from sanctuarium chapel shrine a scrutinized be more than ever certain that have hit on true decipherment only complicated puzzle instead of solving for how be possible to account for author of memoir planning to build sanctuary sanctuary however certainly be identification explained narrow lancet on south wall big east window considered history of ancestor last year on earth how a time approached for death turned to god not from love of from fear of hell damnation broke off chronicle of iniquity built almshouses indulged in fasting charity with view to avert destiny that have chosen rejoiced in fell in with notion of building chapel communicated with own room in house so that must go there by day night for cowardly prayer search for forgiveness of trespass then too on assumption little dwelling place adjoined must be explained doubt intended that priest must reside there a domestic physician of soul for moment hypothesis seemed to account for whole project colin unwillingly accepted be disappointing be just instance of collapse cowardice came over ancestor made last year on earth pitiful surrender yet why did not then put plan into execution if be design of for whole year after date recorded on drawing practised belated piety yet never sod be cut brick laid in erection of chapel surely must have hastened on building of with same speed enthusiasm with have built house for own glory clearly if solution be correct have intended to build chapel here with lodging for priest abandoned why if soul be set on piety repentance colin got up from chair in have be sitting for last half hour since violet have left frowning puzzling over riddle felt that there be key must fit fact that be hovering round discovery be close at hand sluggish mist of own mind obscured paced up down room for minute two then went to window open behind tapping blind drew half up only faintest night wind stirred sky be bare full moon rode high in south among star just in front terrace lay grey garden dark beyond square black line of yew hedge lake shone so bright in moonlight that seemed sheet of pale flame brimming molten to right left rose swelling upland of park spacious stateliness within without be creation of ancestor of who have planned sanctuary colin felt doubt that spirit survived in remorseful hell what more poignant hell must there be for now shorn of pomp prosperity naked in immaterial world than splendour of earthly habitation where no longer have place somehow spirit seemed close ready to communicate must not give to one who so rapturously claimed kinship sympathy with hint expression of must awake in comprehension of strange desire to build sanctuary colin stood quite still looking out on to silent tranquillity not cudgelling brain with conjecture more letting lie open quiet to midnight to see if from outside from own subconscious activity there did not emerge what be seeking for be curious that satisfactory solution of point seemed of such immense importance rightly wrongly believed that held great significance certainly there be power abroad to night something tingled throbbed in vein be hard to keep still under not to let brain busy with ingenious surmise have done that already to utmost of power now with stir of force round must let stay passive receptive suddenly faint stirring of night breeze grew stronger ruffled hair blew cracking flapping blind out horizontal into room page of manuscript on table whispered shivered a if be talking to giggling together then mist have obscured mind be whisked away knew have explanation for have be seeking in couple of step be back at table open in manuscript have be reading day there lay before eye final word of have read uncomprehendingly before now saw to contain key looked for how must rejoice said aloud to build shrine in honour of lord where must worship who have wrought so great benefit upon sanctuary where might worthily adore there be need to search further be clear be indeed sanctuary have planned in honour not of god of who have given that soul desired clear too at last be reason why have never built for just then when be freshly planned fear began to darken round shadow to stalk turned from lord benefactor wrote more in praise prayed fasted in impious piety one oclock have already sounded colin replaced memoir in drawer turned key on gust from outside seemed literally to have blown mist from so that saw sharp distinct across sundering century purpose of design sure reason for abandonment died into stillness again night seemed charged alive with consciousness day have put to soak so to speak in spirit infused memoir with so sympathetic vitality now even when book be finished be friendly round stimulating quickening so that reinforced with vigour idea of physical refreshment of sleep seemed ludicrous to sleep be to abandon consciousness for sake of recuperation be expression of consciousness that needed put hand on low window sill vaulted out on to terrace where have watched denniss early essay in locomotion in stillness past present seemed melted into one century no longer represented movement of time have not be borne away on stream be static a if portrayed in picture might have be on very night that original bargain be made might have be here now that ancestor be devising sanctuary on little plateau that lay among oak have planted in moonlight colin must almost visualize windowed corridor have be planned to run from corner of room have just quitted till joined among tree west wall of sanctuary what symbol must shrine have be of old colins life what jubilee of dedication of there without doubt intended to celebrate satanic rite that worship of evil for evil sake in to whom sacred service of love be thing abhorred derided renewed allegiance to enemy of god in blasphemy of black mass drew near to lord benefactor who strengthened refreshed soul willow indifferent who just made a pleasant pilgrimage a possible out of life who from vague instinct tried to be good merely fell into evil because be weak self indulgent must have part in must be savourless a bran to who have living belief in god in satan for blasphemy signified nothing to soul who did not hate sublime majesty of love who took part in dark mystery be who believed in god who by deliberate choice rejected hated defied old colin must have be fit worshipper there have not that senile panic hoisting white flag of surrender overtaken before bond be due be craven pitiful end be not love of life long enemy that drove to camp fear of who have so magnificently befriended colin have wandered in moonlight past end of terrace now stood on plateau where according to plan sanctuary be to have be built round rose tranced forest tree grass drenched with dew glimmered like spread sheet of moonstone then suddenly springing up again wind warm caressing made branch of oak whisper sway through ran great exaltation raised hand spreading arm out wide o lord benefactor said how will rejoice to build shrine in honour of thee colin woke from dreamless sleep next morning to find ninos hand on bare shoulder gently stirring clothes be in heap on floor by bedside for when came in have stripped wrapped sheet round in cocoon like have lain unstirring be conscious of strong glow of happiness a be thus recalled lazy strength came soaking into oh nino what nuisance be said spend beastly life in waking will sleep again then asked nino mischief be done now whats morning like whats news telephone message from mr hunt said nino must know if may come down to day for sunday colin grinned moment nino have said telephone message have guessed from whom came well then maynt said damned cheek must never do must nino will be very happy said if may come observed nino colin raised little drew hand down arm fact that have decided that pamela hunt must not come made see cause for re consideration just rub arm said ive be sleeping on isnt awake of course if must make happy thats different thing ought always to make people happy nino except when be making miserable tell can come then whats morning like splendore said nino will bathe wish youd carry straight down to lake drop into sicuro said nino colin looked at yawning get on then said wondering what must do nino bent down putting one arm below neck other under knee lifted up right about turn said colin march nino carried a far a door be evidently perfectly ready to bear with sheet folded round down to lake held a easily a child face be wreathed with merriment be nurse said be bambino signor colin laughed oh wont do said put

allow pamela hunt to be happy not friendship quite recent one have be founded on laughter good look high spirit since then have become aware that be searching for more from than be digging below flimsy foundation of liking laughter for something more profound did not really care about in least be eminently ornamental liked bland unscrupulousness with pursued way suggestion indeed that must come down to stanier for sunday where knew be in retreat in bosom of family have daring innocence about be rather attractive friendship have already be matter of extensive public comment in london showed charming disregard of usual convention that must propose to share domestic tranquillity be secret from that be in love with be guilty of fatuous gratification about in fact seemed to pity for have nothing whatever for beyond doubt be getting serious eager however have proposed herself have permitted after there might be amusement out of chilling disappointment for ludicrous dnouement derived from own indifference possibly exasperation if became tedious have not given smallest encouragement that of laughter chatter if chose to attempt to hunt down consequence be of own seeking then too how must violet take in case kind friend have whispered warning to might be amusing sunday stepped out on to terrace already grilling in sunshine looked le real now than few hour ago under moon stage then have be alive with dark force brewing drama whereas now in sane freshness of day be mere paint pasteboard like same stage seen next morning when actor have left drama vivified splendid setting a walked along terrace to yew hedge gained reality again just there must be windowed corridor there close at hand be plateau among oak yes be growing real again at that remembered what have wanted to ask nino couple of year ago when be staying for night with very lively little english consul at naples who have shewn such curious neapolitan diversion remembered having said something about

from close at hand little bubbling laugh name softly called sheer happiness of love sounded in whisper might have be violet voice speaking to on one of night of honeymoon here hated inimitable thrill of reached hand to switch turned on be standing in middle of room just under light from ceiling in strong illumination thin silk nightdress be that covered be transparent a veil of sun pierced mist figure crowned by bright flame of face be clearly visible apparelled magnificence be pale beside luminous revealed perfection colin almost regretted that have prepared hellish surprise for to night to morrow must have done a well yet what thrill of physical love must rival gorgeous humiliation how superbly moral be woman have tempted coming to at solitary midnight in blaze of beauty for once man master of soul derided seduction infamy of brothel of sodom be nearer salvation than chastity heard stir behind half turned there be nino sitting upright in bed simultaneously colin spoke hullo here pretty lady said have come to visit nino ill pretend to be asleep if like turned back towards colin a spoke there came over face just blanching just stark terror a have struck colour from mr cecils colins laughing mouth dancing blue eye be close to in hurry to be ready for have not put on nightclothes over slim suntanned body a sat up in bed skin sheathed muscle rippled a breathed at sight a if horror of gorgon head have be shewn turned to stone arm made one stiff movement a if drawing cloak round to hide went back to door through have come violent trembling seized must scarcely grasp key in finger lock little stiff said colin ah thats right what short visit good night dear pamela colin jumped out of bed moment have gone briskly turned key well have more visitor to night nino said bold slut there lesson for whats matter nino ninos face be buried in pillow have given that one glance at a stood under light then for very pity have hidden eye from intolerable shame now at colins voice looked up ah poor lady said be terrible to signor ecstasy of wickedness possessed colin naked a young greek god a fair capered round room in abandonment of glee oh poor pretty lady cried what pleasant hour have planned what disappointment how naughty of shocked what will plan next do think must bet on slight headache in morning breakfast in room will make effort catch early boat chi sa good night nino jumped into bed nino must hear shaking under gust of smothered laughter colin according to wont slept dreamlessly woke to find ninos hand on shoulder rousing wake signor said colin yawned stretched ill raise wage nino if youll go away said signora began nino colin broke off yawn began to laugh good lord yes said well what about signora hope have a good night a did not sleep in bed said nino be not in house well what then shes gone by early boat thought very likely must so cool in early morning probably have left note for maid to say so look find ill have breakfast out of door got out of bed while dressed basked in wonderful memory of night before just here have stood for short moment then with odd gesture of folding something round have turned what horrid humiliated night must have passed too badly stung to sleep only eager for morning boat left at six oclock must carry away from island wondered whether if have received slap like that must have turned tail certainly must have be embarrassing breakfast next morning must have have to talk with great perseverance animation rather thought that must have stopped brazened out to show didnt care nino entered again ive found note signor said be addressed to not to maid be on breakfast table in pergola colin held out hand for opened be quite short be terribly happy here ran have be terribly unhappy so be good bye colin knitted brow surely have heard something very like only few hour before then remembered one know of nino asked signor found brought to colin stood crumpling note in hand contingency have presented with reading of note wished to be prepared for if implication there hinted at be true did not want to stew in ebullition of scandal gossip must boil up if last night adventure be known three people knew of possibly only two now nino for few second thought intently then face cleared now listen to nino said have found note for have brought note last saw of signora be when brought coffee last night after dinner in garden thats know ah wait moment bed move back to room where of course slept last night a usual ill help now colin laid hand on boy shoulder looked in face when did see signora last said ninos eye be wide with unspoken terror last night said when brought coffee after dinner found nothing on table when went to lay breakfast morning signor good boy now be quick with coffee long to be in sea morning colin swam basked swam again spending whole morning on beach be convinced that when pamela wrote that note to have intended at rate to take own life for wording of reproduced too closely for explanation of fortuitous resemblance what have said to evening before a came home very likely have not done so for there be big gulf between intention execution be one thing to feel that be terribly unhappy quite to put end to unhappiness most people preferred amount of unhappiness to forcing entry through door led man knew whither even if led into nothingness anything must happen to be better than nothingness colin came up out of water after brushing wetness off sat down on hot shingle supposing pamela have done what melodramatic little note implied what must think of what concerned more must think of of course have never dreamed of such possibility if have done what swift surprising drama yet how abominably stupid how if looked at clearly how self conscious there be revenge in too meant at fatal cost to herself to overwhelm with remorse at great final gesture be sign of love to do might be calculated however mistakenly to bring misery on adored yet after be not love of might have driven to desperate act be no more than self love pity for unexpected exposure remembered just how have looked when turned up light heard nino stir if have supplied determining motive at be fear misery remorse what have done to be miserable remorseful for woman be slut have come to stay with respectable married man who have assured that heart devotion be consecrated to wife knowing that have deliberately tried to seduce coming into room at midnight offering there be fine story to tell world if so chose nino with wink from must testify to veracity of crucial episode stern morality of own attitude scorn of intrusion be cream of missal of wonderful blasphemy contained mockery so distilled then supposing have done nothing desperate at simply gone for nice walk to think thing over console wounded vanity be easy to realize what must feel then mockery sheer mockery contempt at fiasco have written that note to indicate what meant to do when came to doing of have squealed shied off at idea of going out alone into dark of nothingness imagined be next scene probably thought that nothingness came next be usual conclusion of such willow folk knew better than that dense stupidity blindness of who did not believe in hereafter of heaven hell knew hereafter well enough eternal hate if love be too strong eternal spectacle of love to have share in to sit in cave of ice in everlasting numbness of cold to behold sun very thought of that certainty that in end god must somehow beat gave spice to defiance safe in protection of evil a long a life lasted must enjoy deride without remorse fear chose evil because loved because hated love even when be such love a pamela have tried to enchain with for partook in narrow greedy sphere of true essence in wanted somebody not if longed to get also longed to give through windless calm there came sound of rhythmical movement sitting up saw boat approaching with swiftly dipping oar sun be bright on water be only vague black speck soon saw who be rowing in such hurry have said must come back for lunch so why have nino come down to bathing place news of kind perhaps nino beached boat jumped out signora said so shes come back said colin knew must nino looked at with wide eye of horror brought back said two fisherman found in water below high cliff where tiberios palace be palace call sunday palace part ii

melted rim of sea warm spring air out of south west flowed up from plain seasoned with saltness drew in long breath of refreshment ten minute more brisk walking along height brought to end of ridge below saw roof of stanier red wall smouldering in clear dusk thrill of home vibrated in must never look on stanier after absence without smile of pleasure welcome on lip there came into mind vaguely distantly memory of someone looking at stanier with ironically saying to be ever so humble there place like home have happened on terrace one night in after dinner stroll almost immediately recalled incident wondering at tenacity of memory be pamela hunt who have said that when came down here at own suggestion for domestic sunday in country how infinitely remote meaningless be recollection of pamela did not suppose have thought of half dozen time in last half dozen year after there be reason why must have thought of for must be close on twelve year since have seen yes when august came must be twelve year since have paid that visit in capri have be affair of ludicrous tragedy long ago have lost personal connection with have become no more than sensational episode though doubt have happened to might equally well have be something have be told something have read in book of short story book of sketch episode sat down on fallen tree trunk several of old colins oak have blown down in fierce gale of march a eye wandered over wide plain distant sea below mind dwelt idly on remote month in capri what have affected far more intimately than pamelas death be sequel that nino have refused to stay in service nino have be utterly devoted to something strange have come over fellow from hour that learned of pamelas melodramatic suicide have simply frozen up gaiety devotion have be replaced by sort of abject terror of colin have become like one of woman on whom frost blight of stanier have fallen started stammered if be spoken to looked at with eye behind lurked deadly fear have answer to give when be asked what ailed said nieute signor quaked finally within week have said must stop with no longer colin have used utmost persuasion without avail from persuasion passed to warning to threat reminding that did not go well with who crossed a nino have seen not so long ago there be keeping colin naturally resented ninos desertion for companionship gay paganism thoroughly suited yet seemed to to have done more than let resentment flow where willed without conscious direction certainly did not concentrate aim at nino shrugged shoulder said to well ninos fault if anything happens sure enough nino sickened of ill defined fever be rife in island in naples that summer not long afterwards colin have to give cook housemaid half day holiday to attend funeral have served nino right thought colin for if have remained up at villa must not have gone back to live in insanitary hovel by marina where fever be so prevalent wondered whether in sense have served right too for there be denying that have be really fond of be offence to lord benefactor to day memory of nino be far more vivid than of pamela who be tiresome woman greedy graceless often even now when lazily awoke in morning found sleepily imagining that be nino who be moving about room have be very stupid of to behave like colin have always be kind to need never have feared for be ninos fear have driven into danger if have only stopped where be remained gay companionable must have run risk fright mad attempt at escape have be undoing have run underneath very wheel like startled fowl on high road month in fact have be full of incident tragic for others strangely prosperous for episode have taken place then far reaching in consequence fitted into other with more than casual coincidence at stanier before left for instance there have be discovery certain solution of pencil plan in ancestor diary followed when got to capri by finding of what beyond doubt be old colins book of wondrous blasphemy of have so easily possessed chain of odd occurrence have not be broken there for within week of having obtained that saw for first time hugh douglas now librarian at stanier memory of be very vivid have none of episodic insignificance of recollection about pamela indeed about nino have gone down to marina one evening to meet violet from whom have received telegram immediately after catastrophe saying that be starting at once for capri have be wise kind of have not previously known that pamela be there have seen one day in daily press notice of pamelas death when staying with lord yardley at villa at capri with quite admirable wisdom have thereupon sent notice to half dozen paper that be returning from capri in fortnight time have instantly started colin have taste for foolish scandal of wagging tongue violet prompt action making appear for benefit of world at large that have be with time be most effectual silencer even who knew that have not be there when catastrophe occurred must look on with quite different eye when knew that have gone there at once colin have unreservedly applauded intuition doubt by now scandal might then have arisen must have be a episodic obsolete a cause of colin in lazy retrospect of marvellous month permitted to stand aside moment say well done violet took up thread of far more significant happening let mind dwell on recalling detail fingering like rosary have gone down a have recalled to meet waited on quay for disembarkation in small boat of passenger from steamer there be a stepped out of boat at quay side saw young man put out to assisting hand did not avail herself of colins eye met that of man who must have helped instantly knew that glance have significance for face saw be alert clean shaven have

sitting at caf in street so happened that priest came by at sight of douglas rose to foot deliberately spat on ground in eye be smoking blaze of hatred so be priest thought colin with love for priesthood then colin asked up to dine one evening after violet departure set wonderful example of frankness unreserve told about legend saw interest kindle felt be somehow on right track though still did not guess where led old fellow be craven at last said tried to escape from lord benefactor abandoned building of shrine have planned where beyond doubt meant to celebrate satanic rite paused moment with intention other turned quickly to be most interesting lord yardley said have notion suppose of what contemplated colin laughed indeed have said in fact there have lately come into hand book beyond doubt be actually for bear coronet arm of correct date feel sure intended to use in chapel missal in fact though following english use refers to in memoir douglas face be alight with

be late for be going on indeed have particular mind to be present felt a if force like of great engine beat in pulsation momently increasing in power be at work there then bell in turret sounded three stroke in pause followed before stroke be repeated felt thrilled charged with mysterious dynamic energy spread through still air in invisible wave of inspiration into mind there came vision of kneeling there at such moment a with dennis by that of course must not be yet boy be at present far too young to understand even nature of moral choice on rite be based not yet did know force of love hate only liked disliked have to feel power of love before must loathe comprehend infinite seduction of evil essential quality of love have to be apprehended before must be rejected mocked at must know first must know too what hate meant before must realize presence of inspirer that thing day dennis must see with father in chapel there must be inexplicable indeed meaningless to until in blood there be developed perception gave life certain of rite must seem to merely grotesque disgusting till be hot with passion of be symbol must be puzzled might even be amused at grimace contortion of

principle let into door on garden front opened into long gallery principle must take care of provided practice be in accordance with with thrill of home coming to beloved stanier stepped out of glimmering dusk into lit house got one comprehensive glance at two who be there before entrance be perceived violet be sitting in low chair by fireplace at far end of gallery face alight with love on

for though be shrouded like gleam of fire through smoke by blight frost ah colin said there be get up dennis here father for moment sharp a stabbed nerve coming from ice bound cave of consciousness pang of regret shot through colin that be not in nature in theirs that must join group of mother son partake of mood laughter ease that implied looked so jolly hunger for pleasure always envied who be enjoying for enjoyment ought to belong to instantaneousness with violet care free laughter have withered from face shewed that instinctively recognized inconceivableness of that be not to be wondered at after always froze in presence then looked at boy who have jumped to foot pride at having begotten anyone so beautiful supplanted for moment other consideration be very tall for age already head be

down to long gallery five minute before dinner time sat by fireplace near dining room till others have assembled then with aid of two stick went in to dinner afterwards played phantom game of whist be now over ninety year of age ate slept have sight hearing lived in withdrawn twilight peopled must seem by shadowy figure of century of memory certain ray must still illuminate that crepuscular kingdom colins presence be sure lamp there dennis be beginning to be perhaps from likeness to colin twenty year ago perhaps because realized that in lay perpetuation of house for dim archive of mind contained only record concerned stanier strangely enough hugh douglas be third who must lighten black darkness probably did not know name belonged to later year of have normally no memory be clear that regarded a somehow significant often if dined with must sit looking at with unwinking gaze saw one knew what begin speaking of day of fifty sixty seventy year ago others nurse for instance violet made reaction on mind be more directly conscious of than be of chair where sat carpet walked on cast shining glimmer on memory reached back back to year when not only be none of present born not even own child of generation before colins father violet aunt hester when be newly come a bride to stanier physically by miracle of vitality be upright still skin instead of hanging in parchment like lap fold over face be one with looked a if be made of bloodless imperishable alabaster when sat motionless without speech seemed scarcely alive then wrinkled eyelid must lift spoke in quiet uninflected voice of who have

legend especially legend wonder if signed bond too to night be in place when violet came in a usual took notice of violet sat down with evening paper did not see douglas entrance till suddenly old lady yardley began to talk grandson colin came home from school to day said have grown violet looked up ah good evening mr douglas said colin dennis have be playing billiards theyll be here in moment

marvellously dramatic too that dennis still hardly free from soft enveloping sheath of childhood must learn beginning of wisdom from aged sibyl be like taking child to learn about druid from

most impressionable age agree distort said agree oh distortion said everyone el point of view be distorted when viewed from one own have own individual perspective shews everybody el out of drawing a agree have to give other reason gave one naturally occurred to namely that resented found unforgivable something poor aunt hester have done be pleased when thought of that always think of everything said yes darling be pretty thorough see why be pleased dont perfectly well wanted to give dennis new impression of a being hard unforgiving of a kind colin softly clapped hand ah knew really understood said knew didnt need explanation why not have said so at first shewed knew at dinner moved screen stood by might have be to shut out of eye flame have broken out from smouldering log might have be to shut out face didnt mean that when asked for explanation said explanation wanted if there be one be justification for what did colin stretched out hand to blaze shapely smooth finger looked redly luminous a fire shone through justification be that be part of policy said dennis be devoted to at present must detach must be devoted to must love what love hate what hate man can serve two

oh youre inconsistent said youve told that love be stronger than that im powerless now seem to be afraid that there be something pretty powerful to back have faith darling have personal fear of now that dennis be in question instinct of protection swallowed up know youve got something powerful to back said youve got power of hell to back one who belief in god dare despise that hate fear colin drove poker into blazing log squib of spark shot up face in brightness seemed to shine from inward illumination very wise said now thing clear to that know about sanctuary clever of darling because ive only once mentioned to when settled to build telling old colin have planned for private devotion did guess then wonder did imagine for what purpose have planned for what purpose carried out plan

abroad hail listen isnt that even to ear something more than common wind know be fear loathe worship adore dont deny ah thrill of splendid pentecost never have seen like whether be that exaltation

still letting hand still rest on arm sundering from distraction of flood of desire yearning of fear of terror have be streaming from did not articulately pray did not implore agonize for protection simply spread out soul with act of unreserved surrender to spirit of god in turmoil within without let peace passed understanding seek her of own accord encompassingly hold only effort be to make effort to make utterly helpless timeless moment passed knew that stress of spiritual crisis be over wind outside seemed to have be raging round very fortress of soul died down ceased colin spoke again ecstasy of direct inspiration have died out of voice for little while have be like one possessed now be again terrible indeed not terror satanic not satan violet if dont come said will go get dennis said must go up say good night to will dress come with to chapel rather like abraham taking isaac to sacrifice rather biblical mean precisely what say will obey violet choice made without question be made under compulsion of love under love protection then of course will come said youve given choice there be wont like if come colin must only despise scoff at what believe in power on lean be failing know wheres ecstasy filled just now have all evaporated have leaked away rage rebel a might knew truth of what said reading in quiet eye pitiful mouth definitely for first time to full

quality with have heard wind rise roar do suppose youve beaten said be really fool a moved step nearer to pointed to curtained door out on to terrace colin said do remember coming in at door evening finding dennis talking by fire be jealous of then jealous of because knew why be so happy together wanted in spite of to have share in chapter ii denniss holiday sped in orgie of delightful amusement there be splendour of having gun of own being allowed to go out with keeper father to blaze at rabbit pigeon among tree in old park there be splendour of motor bicycle given by father that of dining downstairs night among experience there be none so enchanting a father companionship colin have suffered defeat knew understood why learned larger wisdom from have be altogether too abrupt excited possessed have expected violet to leap at once in surrender panic over huge gulf separated when asked to come to chapel with must have known better told be demanding impossible effect have be that in vital recoil have accomplished supreme feat in completion of self abandonment to power of love have made reservation have cast on spread arm of sustaining force be quite consistent too that moment afterwards when have told that if refused to come must take dennis with have said must come love still upheld chose for force knew have drained of so that no longer cared at moment whether came not whether be worth while even to fetch dennis must have done must have be mere repetition of original mistake dennis must no more leap to sacrament of evil than violet worship of evil demanded dedication of soul dennis must be wooed like shy maiden boyish heart be affianced to mother clinging tentacle vigorous a young shoot of ivy must be ever so gently detached so that boy must scarcely know that detachment be going on laid full of sap of spring round father encircling arm until be done dennis must turn puzzled incurious ear to anything of ultimate significance colin must abound in wholesome school boy topic interest until ivy clung close to leaned on for support of growth then not till then must education enlistment of instinct begin must be rather bore colin thought must have

time consciously noticed sapphire buckled cloak gave measure of absorption in dennis for have given stone to wear with definite object now saw how stale unluminous be blaze of light burned within brilliance be dim compared to what must be be splendid still more than shadow of real self knew own idea about stone to be quite fantastic felt sudden spasm of anger with boy that great blue cornflower be so faded yet felt might have known ill see to bed said here be turn up light room flashed into brightness colin closed door undo cloak dennis said give sapphire boy stood in full light of lamp above dressing table fumbling with rather said like bit of ice on throat almost took off during ball supposed wasnt thing to leave about oh cant unfasten do for father held head up smiling into father eye moved by uncontrollable impulse colin kissed that smooth cheek boy be so splendidly handsome of so winning charm after a colin thought to a if in excuse of affection of caress he own son then raised hand to undo fastening at dennis fumbled even a touched light seemed to dawn somewhere deep in heart of sapphire there be said there ice bag removed doesnt look much like ice doe dennis shook off cloak o oh doesnt look very icy said have really be wearing that evening why alive burning be only that look so bright against black clothes ought to have worn tell about said must colin looked at ray danced in blue furnace that held be scarcely possible to believe that awakened lustre be purely imagined effect not imagined surely be counsel that splendour gave to tell dennis little more about birthright well be last thing most splendid that queen ever gave old colin said speaks of in memoir ill shew oh do shew to morrow must love to see old rip sorry father about sapphire colin let eye rest again on great stone then looked straight at dennis say that lord benefactor caused so mightily to please queen that gave said must learn to love dennis for call finest fruit of bargain dennis looked puzzled bargain asked oh legend then do think really believed in legend certainly did wise be too will read how satan came to one night a slept dennis have taken off tunic stood there stock still face now more definitely troubled like horrible nightmare asked colin came step nearer black a pit fair of face with stone gleaming in hand nightmare good heaven said like wonderful dream if like be dream be gloriously real cant understand yet what bargain meant for youre only boy there nothing that really want dont get imagine what must be when grew up to have wish gratified bargain hold not for old colin alone for who come after for instance who by own choice claim right to share in legend be fairy tale dennis be sober serious truth be miracle if like evidence for be conclusive trouble deepened in denniss eye when colin first spoke of visitor coming to ancestor a slept there have started unbidden into mind remembrance of nightmare from father have rescued now again felt that invasion pressing on though be surely father who stood there yet somehow black robe red feathered cap that blue blazing gift of satan in hand seemed to obscure be a if shadow have passed over behind shadow be changing oh dont father cried hate awfully stupid of do hate please there be doubt that boy be vaguely yet deeply frightened voice rose shrilly hand be trembling once again colin recoiled from idea of denniss terror when have directed force towards before in defencelessness of sleep be easily intelligible that invasion of must alarm now speaking to in own person with authority denniss love for gave have hoped that boy must at rate sip at cup held out to still be troubled alarmed be not mature enough yet to guess lure of dream of desire yet be not that made colin pause if have be all must have persisted must have induced dennis somehow to taste sweetness of evil must have pricked arm to let just one drop of blood flow in so to speak must begin to write name to everlasting bond bargain to initial at least dennis might be little frightened beginning must have be made what withheld be not wickedness of intention yet unwisdom of frightening dennis with own damnable squirming weakness in minding boy terror be cowardly be even apostate of to recoil from wavered before lacked firmness indifference must get rid of scruple hateful tenderness prompted there dennis stood bare arm stretched out to half imploring seemed yet by same action keeping off throat apple in soft neck moved up down in agitation a if struggling to keep panting breath steady red flower of mouth quivered great sapphire slipped from colins hand rolled on floor let lie there unheeding unknowing came close to dennis putting arm round neck dennis dear said whats matter what ail why youre having nightmare again while youre awake will never do boy attitude of defence of keeping father away from collapsed suddenly threw out arm caught father round shoulder im awful fool said be frightened cant think why just a if werent protection enough against anything oh father youre brick do love colin drew boy down on edge of bed sat close to what be matter darling said tell about wasnt anything said dennis im bloody fool sorry just for second be nightmare again thought somehow wasnt standing there be like awful conjuring trick wanted ive got wont be such as again sure youre right said colin cant have getting panic dennis being as dennis laughed shant said gone say im keeping up must undress go to bed youll never get there dennis got up stood there between father knee erect tranquil again peeled off hose vest put on pyjama just then eye fell on great sapphire lay on floor why youve dropped sapphire father said so see never mind that ill pick up now into bed with how can when youre sitting there dont get up ill crawl in dennis inserted one leg between pillow where colin sat drew into bed curling against father there thats snug said good night then said colin dennis raised in bed kissed be lovely evening said itll be just a lovely to morrow with wish wasnt going back to eton on thursday colin with stone in hand went out down few step of corridor to door of room once again time with more direct personal defeat dennis have routed before have directed force governed protected on boy a slept who must tell in what fury of lambent evil have begun to encompass now whom above dennis loved trusted have approached with same initiation yet love trust have not given dennis confidence spiritual semaphore of instinct have hung out red light of danger boy have recoiled from what brought with shrinking be not reassured by fact that be father who brought have detected nature of affection must not suffer to take even from hand loved time dennis have be broad awake knowing well what be doing here then be more personal rebuff appeared that colins trouble to endear to boy with what success have accomplished that be useless for purpose for have intended indeed be far worse than useless for in process dennis have somehow entered heart for second time have be unable to persist fault then in great part lay with made doubt that if with denniss love for to assist have reasoned persuaded telling that in sober truth ancient bargain be valid still that when day of choice came must have have be so richly showered on father something of what said must have remained in boy mind quietly fermenting there have failed to do anything of kind incalculable impulse have seized have thought of nothing except to reassure stood in room door of have not even closed looking at sapphire blazed in hand that azure fire bade go back to dennis now conquering despicable softness in tell with gusto of splendid surprise knew that tongue of skill persuasion must be given that legend be alive to day that power mightier than king of earth be alert eager to befriend at so cheap cost for price be more than that must root out of heart sickly sentimental stuff injurious weakness called love sap strength of man enslaves to others be be meant by bargain signing of soul away be true sensible way to look at who talked of a being consignment to outer darkness eternal damnation be merely trying to frighten people by hoisting bogy dennis must not understand wonderful impressionable thing boy memory must retain letter form of till bit by bit began to understand then from having dwelt long in mind must appear familiar friendly dennis must already be half asleep father must just sit talk to minute two quietly affectionately sowing seed smoothing rich fruitful earth of boy mind over moved towards door opened went into passage then a hand be on latch of denniss door knew that even if went in with intention hot within expedition must be in vain dennis must sit up in bed sleepily smiling welcoming intrusion on excuse so long a intruder be once more must be disarmed by defenceless change have to be wrought must begin with there be doubt that have allowed to get fond of boy for reason winced at thought of first incision must anneal to gay ruthlessness with dealt with others with have mocked pamela to doom jeered at brother raymond struggling with broken lid of ice before attempted to deal with dennis again if only boy be not so affectionate how easy must be have thought of denniss affection for a weapon in own hand at present be weapon in denniss perhaps must have to snap wresting from turn against at rate must anneal must weld armour of hate against love general dispersal took place next morning for hour almost incessant stream of motor left door dennis father be like ferry boat conveying visitor from gallery where said good bye to violet to hall vastly a boy have enjoyed fortnight of crowd turmoil got even gayer a streamed away when last have left executed wild rampageous dance in hall hurrah theyve gone cried now just father what will do day last day know must let have time what will do first what be use of spoiling denniss last day colin asked boy must be gone to morrow for next twelve week then must be time to rout out intruder indeed that uprooting must begin to night change in that recantation of recent apostasy at midnight when dennis have gone to bed must renew vow partake in mockery of love dennis dont whirl round like that said make giddy very grumpy of do know to be glad that friend have gone how many tipped oh frightful lot said dennis im rolling in rich will come play golf tennis do think what about potting rabbit dont want to be bothered with well do just what like said colin sit down make up mind oh made up said

be of vanished fear oh id sooner play golf said day two be together at dinner for aunt hester have gone back with rest to london there be just four of at small round table in dining room last night have resounded to gaiety of fifty blazed with costume of elizabeth yet be essentially stanier be gathered undiluted there splendour sparkle of last day have be no more than casual decoration have plucked for worn little while thrown away again last night old lady yardley have sat up till very end of ball week have attended whatever entertainment be provided unusual hour seemed to have made call on strength now bright eyed somehow terribly alive beneath that immobile alabastrine sheath of body looked from dennis to father back again a if searching searching for assurance confirmation of what desired of violet a usual seemed unconscious ball of laughter talk have be thrown hither merrily enough dinner time dennis colin be chief performer violet have taken little part in day have wrestled with secret jealousy not once have dennis to whose last day at home usually devoted appeared to want since guest have left in morning have be exclusively with father be very natural exuberance wanted golf rabbit shooting activity of budding manhood yet be not boy fault that have not spared half hour out of day for at conclusion of diversion colin have be at hand with be simply for discomfiture exhibition of own triumphant rivalry that have done that certainly must have be sufficient motive for felt there be something else a well larger issue ampler cause if have be that alone must have have little oblique mockery for must have called attention to success must even have told dennis to go talk to that when have have nice talk be ready to fish play tennis then like blown flame little surface jealousy went out be colin planning final employment for dennis to night knew have sent for mr douglas evening have have private interview with for have unwittingly interrupted seen breaking off of topic when entered room at thought that small green flame be quenched cold apprehension gripped a dinner went on ceased to take part in gay crossing volley became like old lady yardley silent watchful aware seemed to enter into spirit of generation of silent frozen woman who be wife mother of race have always be like who be knit into line through legend be transmitted now seemed to comprehend nature of vesture of ice clothed for knew that be through blood love of conceiving body that satanic bargain be kept alive son be inheritor of bond be that not enough to freeze mother fruit of whose womb must be dedicated to hell who watched growing strength beauty of son knew consecration of evil to at choice gave soul must see prosperous beyond other heritor beauty health honour wealth must be spirit must freeze burn in ice of knowing that be payment in dross for in eye of god be worth ransom of precious blood must get used to wondered so that knowledge became part of nature a flock of grey winged year passed over head must become so one with stanier that prosperity continuance of house must grow into very fibre of nature be so guessed with old lady yardley colin dennis be connotation of world to over else penumbra eclipse of age have passed just rim nothing else be illuminated neither evil good love hate perhaps existed for more sense of stanier be only reaction to exterior world dinner be over coffee handed still lady yardley have not broken that frost of silence now there came sudden uncongealment stanier be again to night said have gone fine folk who come like dog when colin whistle to lick hand feed colin turned to granny dear what nonsense said shouldnt call distinguished guest dog didnt like having here thought be enjoying that wraith of smile dimpled mouth yes enjoyed said enjoyed seeing doing homage to stanier to colin looked from to dennis here be colin a be when be boy said when grows up will do homage to too before then must know legend instead of only hearing read mark learn inwardly digest prayer book say that about legend colin pushed back chair granny be charming said settled first night be here that be to have prophesying at dinner be not prophesying said be only saying what know what presently will know will be pleasant when know for then can talk freely will tell now colin will break sheet of ice must be out in sun then instead of being cold will melt frost took stick put into hand get up said go melt frost by fire in gallery where card table be ready for now not word more rose still smiling a if content with what have said have borne witness to what knew what colin knew whether be sharp with not be insignificant compared to leaning on stick went out followed by violet colin watched denniss troubled face a came back to table after closing door behind others when first three week ago old lady yardley have prophesied have be puzzled excited fascinated since then have learned something waking asleep have seen outline of terrible shadow seemed to be same a whatever be of have just spoken what doe mean said what be that about telling melting frost dottiness said colin at once discovered be dotty week ago just now remember thought that be a boy again that wasnt very clear headed be rest be just a muddled dont think anything more about dennis that cloud did not clear away at once from denniss forehead father have clearly wanted to tell something last night by unerring instinct divined that same something lurked behind what have just stopped old lady yardley from saying concerned legend clearly practical personal application of legend dennis youre not doing what told said colin sharply youre thinking of granny dottiness dennis pulled in sail of mind be still catching that mysterious breeze righto said come sit next then exclusive brute said colin instead of sitting at other side of table youve liked last day have dennis oh father have be lovely said dennis drawing chair quite close to why went away at eleven ive be with ever since except when have bath even then came in in middle ten solid hour with not bad no not very bad youve made elderly gent

whist will rook mother granny then after being up till nearly four last night will go softly silently to bed like snark not silent come talk wont perhaps ill look in dont promise must sit up do job why said dennis because youve prevented doing day colin smiled to a said that be most emphatically true must concentrate on job to night violet went upstairs with dennis at bed time relieved of immediate fear for colin made move to detain boy whatever have planned for did not look for denniss partnership colin sat in room when others have gone up for hour while be waiting for midnight read mused over memoir of ancestor how symmetrical consistent have be till that senile ague of terror palsied in last year of life never once in fascinating page be there hint of struggle in soul stirring of compassion love disturbed poise of undivided allegiance even at end did waver in spirit for be easy to see that belated piety formal act of pity charity sprang not from turning of in spirit towards god from mere physical terror of approaching doom only added cowardice in fact to other sin went forth with blacker load than ever so early too must have initiated two son into doctrine of gospel for long before time came for choice be ripe ready colin dropped reading there be yet time to go upstairs bid dennis dress come with still excuse held that boy soul be not ready for sacrament of evil have to learn sweetness of evil for evil sake before must take part in worship must understand nothing rite must be meaningless worse than must perhaps disgust horrify be not in disgust horror that must be drawn must spring with leap of spirit towards congenial mystery still colin knew that be excuse only reason for not fetching boy be that obstinate intruder in own heart made recoil from notion of dennis being frightened revolted be in fact with whom have to deal must cleanse own heart of tenderness be in bud there by inspiration of evil root out alien weed must concentrate mind on defiance hate there came tap at door led into corridor up to chapel be always kept locked key to like latch key wore on watch chain otherwise chapel must only be approached through mr douglas lodging opened door found vincenzo standing there pronto signor said vincenzo fell behind a walked up corridor leaving at door into chapel while went through to priest dwelling to vest a server colin entered chapel be redolent of stale incense soon to be refreshed renewed blazed with light presently priest entered served by vincenzo be robed in wonderful cope once stolen from italian sacristy have be bought by colin in naples for minute so knelt with back to altar then making sign of cross reversed rose began though knew ritual well colin closely followed service in vellum leaved book on faldstool douglas have copied in exquisite formal handwriting from missal of wondrous blasphemy illuminating initial letter with appropriate decoration sacrilegious parody of holy scene two year have taken labour of love colin by keeping attention on book strove to devote mind to spirit of blasphemy confessed fallings lapse from vowed life tried to root dennis out of heart let mind dwell on evil cruelty hate now new cloud of incense rose from censer vincenzo altar gleamed through fragrant sanctification supreme moment approached colin felt stir of power seething round knew no longer went out to meet with welcome heart surrender pressure of will be bent on doing so be a if grain of grit have got into psychic mechanism of soul checked laboured did not respond with full smooth stroke why must not be like vincenzo who knelt there face working with diabolical rapture vincenzos hand be clasped in front of mouth grinned slavered shook swayed in fierce gale of possession priest arm be raised now for consecration vincenzos eye be fixed on in moment more on completion of act must pull rope of bell that hung by three muffled stroke even a colin looked half envying half horrified at tension of man face vincenzo suddenly rose to foot with hand stretched out in front of swayed a stood a if blown by great wind then crashed forward fell full length on altar step priest with wafer still unconsecrated in hand turned at thud of fall placed wafer back on paten beckoning to colin stooped down by man side vincenzo have rolled on to face lay there trembling twitching turned over eye wide open seemed to be focussed in blank terror at something close in front of at corner of mouth foam have gathered priest felt for pulse what happened said to colin fell forward well be alive be dead cant find flicker of pulse said douglas can get brandy ive got none yes there sure to be tray in gallery ill go get colin nodded towards altar take vessel back to room said disrobe ill be back in

send for doctor said douglas colin nodded understanding yes not here of course said must move now for hell sake dont let make mistake cant correct afterwards first of must take cotta cassock off get pair of scissors quick must cut sleeve colin be perfectly alert collected coolly swiftly thought over what be to be done just one glance of angry disgust gave to distorted whitening face be cause of trouble for present needed wit to grapple with disposition must be made instantly without possibility of correction afterwards brain be busy a slipped severed vestment off vincenzo began to see road lay down again said when be done mustnt move at till weve settled everything cover face though hate dimmed glass eye god what terror be there sat down on step with back to body want to smoke said nothing like cigarette for filtering thought now look here douglas of course mustnt be found here at doctor anybody else must come in here therefore clear weve got to move luckily late servant will

business then waited in hall where must hear doctor wheel there on floor lay body curiously insignificant now noticed that famous picture of old colin with supposed deed of bargain let into frame be on wall just above where lay there be something rather suitable about gave further thought to over over in mind conned what be going to say framing answer to question might be put above rehearsing own initial statement be important thing be that must make so familiar to that really believed to be true for doubt must have to repeat again at inquest over else though teemed with surmise wonder drew impenetrable curtain nothing else mattered just now what must say to doctor before have begun to expect arrival heard crunch of motor wheel undid bolt of door come in doctor said be good of to have be so quick servant vincenzo who have be with long time there lie exactly a fell thought wise not to move in way tried to get to swallow mouthful of brandy couldnt very wise of lord yardley said doctor

martin yes yes let come into room sit down doctor now let think for moment wit seem abroad colin covered eye with hand moment clock on mantelpiece chimed three quarter after twelve pointed to spoke vincenzo always sat up till went to bed said often if be sitting up late must ring for tell neednt wait evening when wife boy went upstairs came in here must have be not long after eleven began reading type written copy of old family memoir got interested in did not notice how time went when looked up saw that be late twenty minute past twelve thereabouts have not finished reading so rang bell here in order to tell vincenzo that need not sit up almost immediately heard noise of heavy fall house have be silent for time startled considerably went out into hall have just quitted found poor fellow lying there from fact that heard noise immediately after ringing bell suppose that have be waiting in hall where must hear bell instantly rang up remained there with till came thought perhaps might come to must be of use occurred to to call of other servant since felt sure that must be safer not to move there seemed to be object in ah yes tried to make swallow brandy quite so acted

fell there be question two must like to ask when rang up said have have sort of fit have suffered from fit before colin almost smiled with pleasure at question told once that when be boy be subject to said supposed have outgrown see of course be not fit medically speaking sign of epileptic seizure anything of kind sudden death thats can say at present from what do conjecture asked colin be quite impossible to say that of course will have to be ascertained can form idea one must imagine have terrible shock there be expression in eye of most abject terror dr martin got up now must like to summon one of men to help said must move body of course be there room near at hand where can place till morning when will be back early to make arrangement room can lock up give key keep yes there smoking room close at hand said colin there be need to call anybody will help laid on sofa there covering face with rug presently after key be turned colin have taken from lock saw doctor to door in admirable way have conveyed impression of being terribly shocked keeping firm hand on can rest assured lord yardley said doctor that did must be done acted with great wisdom in not moving in sending at once for wish must have be of use put mind quite at rest about youll sleep hope colin raised soft swimming eye feel a if must said now be over feel most awfully tired good night dr martin ever so many thanks colin bolted barred door switched off light in hall went upstairs passing denniss door saw that still stood ajar line of brightness be rectangled round pushed quietly open expecting to see that dennis have again fallen asleep while waiting for to come say good night time however boy be wide awake oh father what age youve be said what have be doing be a if shutter have be snapped down in colins mind behind lay have happened in last hour bright vivid a in decked shop window now cut off from view dennis little wretch said ought to have be asleep long ago dennis laughed oh dont be silly said didnt think be going to sleep without saying good night to on last night did come sit down for two minute dennis wriggled away to middle of bed leaving room for father to sit on edge of put up knee to form back for expected to be snoring said colin never snore said indignant dennis a for being asleep didnt want to go to sleep finished job pretty well can leave rest till morning dennis sniffed wrinkling up nose like young terrier where have be said coat smell of roman catholic church rot dear cigarette isnt rot well never mind say father have have ripping holiday to day be best of ever so much nicer here than in london love stanier thats family affliction said colin wonder what youll do with when im dead get oh shut up a if must care about without dennis what compliment said colin colin went to room let shutter in mind rattle up looked into lighted window between catastrophe coming of doctor acuteness have be entirely busy over account must be called upon to give there cool ingenuity have served well story have be coherent consistent have eliminated from everyone dead man who must bring forward conflicting testimony for moment looked only absently at sensationally decked window for congratulated on wisdom in rejecting that wayward thought of taking dennis with at midnight only little more than hour ago into chapel if have done that what face must dennis be wearing now must have curled down in bed so quietly followed father a went to door with shining of tranquil affectionate eye already knew have shuddered to know that there be in legend something more than fairy story something alive satanic from touch of shrank when came near colin must have told that what be to see in chapel be worship of power through century have so wonderfully befriended house while quivered in face of initiation there must have come appalling unexpected stroke boy must have be distraught with terror evil for own sake must sometime choose a guardian of soul body must have be to for ever force smote suppliant with death sudden terrific must have be disastrous if dennis have seen that colin looked into lighted window there vivid a when scene be before amazed eye scrutinized image of vincenzo already writhing in ecstasy of possession then falling forward like why have happened what be psychical significance have died appeared of shock of terror panic yelled in wide silent eye have there come to appalling revelation of ultimate absolute evil even a have come to old colin when at birthday feast have shrieked out with repelling hand have fallen dead across table have looked in eye of god seen there infinite love of at whom mocked colin felt shudder at thought that indeed must be enough to shrivel spirit of man like burnt feather in furnace hell must not contain such torment a to realize that through night blackness of absolute evil love of god still shone without change dimness even a light of steadfast star burn unblown by puny violence of terrestrial tempest if there have come to vincenzo at moment of death only vision internal realization of wrath of god surely to one whose joy be to mock defy must have be like waved banner of victory sign that mockery have reached mark god anger must be testimonial to success must have be hell indeed to know that defiance rebellion have never caused infinite love pity to waver for still christ blood streamed in firmament must have be sufficient to glaze with terror of utter ultimate defeat dying eye see where christ blood stream be firmament colin muttered word to came remembered now from last scene in marlowe faustus just before stroke of midnight on mephistopheles came to exact payment of faustus soul to faustus have be ultimate anguish what if have be so too to who now lay in locked room downstairs colin shrank from thought even a dennis have shrunk from terror of nightmare be better to suppose that there have come to man fresh intuition into power of evil that in panic of eye be knowledge that time be come that be eternally consigned to protection of what have worshipped at so easily flesh might quaver in dissolution of body from spirit that in comparison be comforting thought felt at home there not afraid have chosen evil for good hell surely must be no other than eternal severance of soul from god be physical terror merely that have distorted vincenzos face with thought there sprang up in desire to look on dead once more convince that there be imprinted on just token of natural cowering before face of death have with key of locked smoking room where body lay now taking off shoe so that step must be noiseless let out into passage again switch be to hand just outside door at touch passage hall below flashed into light paused after fitting key into door of smoking room great portrait of old colin seemed to smile on on floor in front of be rug on vincenzos body have sprawled be crumpled into ridge where have taken up again entered death chamber there on sofa with face covered lay body standing there beside told again what have come to see namely token of physical terror shrinking of flesh at touch of death then drew covering away vincenzos eye be closed perhaps doctor have done that face be perfectly composed tranquil looked younger than year did not seem to be dead be more reasonable to think that be asleep mouth slightly smiling suggested that dreamed of happy affair of friend of home in life there have be something little sinister about expression now looked contented kind colin covered face again with sullen spasm of misgiving feared that tranquillity hated conjectured cause of death have stamped that face with terror something stronger than death have smoothed that terror out again went have event of evening begun to get on nerve spurring to unreal imaginings perhaps be normal that after death face must grow tranquil again tranquillity be more disturbing by far than distortion of terror have be chapter iv colin went into wife room early next morning gave official version of vincenzos death be agreed that dennis must be told nothing of before hour for removal of body came to await inquest in rye took boy out for final morning of rabbit shooting have slept well woke with nerve quieted refreshed denniss ignorance too of what have actually occurred what be supposed to have occurred be in healing to troubled fancy of midnight just a warm april morning be healing in physical tonic to nerve indeed stanier have never seemed so tranquil serene abode of prosperous peace a now when walked with tall fair son of along terrace up wooded slope beyond chapel where ruby glass of window be penetrated by gleaming sunshine shone like fire to be out of door morning be better than being within better be to walk in warm wind than to breathe stale incense smoke below broad lake glittered for moment in gap between rhododendron bush along sluice wall figure of priest black against vivid green of young leafed tree beyond came into sight vanished again have gone down there doubt to do part concerning secret version of event of night colin be pleased to have caught that glimpse of later when dennis have gone must have to see just for present let concerned drowning of slit cassock cotta slip down into depth of mind even a relic with weight to sink have dwindled into darkness of deep water where once raymond lay soon must have to fish problem perplexity up again discus with priest for hour two till dennis departed must keep on sunny surface of windy morning there lay house that loved more than anything anyone in world must almost fancy if april day be only eternal being happy here a deer be happy browsing on fresh growth of spring time letting that love of hate of evil in heart sink into quiescence even evaporate away must life lose effervescence without supposing now that whole history of legend from inception to own passionate participation in be dream supposing rolled away like moving mist hour ago lay fleecy thick over plain that with opening of eye tranquil awakening found just here mounting steep slope with dennis chattering by house gleaming rosy red below that have given to thrill motive of life passed into unsubstantial nothingness so that even memory of be elusive hard to capture must look forward over coming year a over desert featurelessness of barren sand notion occurred to for just long enough to frame into definite mental question moment presented like that saw that answer to must be inconceivable simply because question be so must not with deliberation even frame question for in presupposed obliteration of consciousness implied might a well ask what must think about if brain be incapable of thought took dennis down to station after lunch on return meaning to ask douglas to come to see be told that have already asked if must do so be waiting in room went there have met in crowd away from stanier figure rose on entrance must scarcely have recognized man upright athletic carriage be bowed bent stumbled a walked fresh coloured face be drawn white mask so be diver with whose help have to try to bring up to surface submerged burden of night colin did not mind other people looking ill weakness only emphasized to own superb health hullo said look rather poorly douglas might almost say look ghastly oh by way caught glimpse of morning telling bead doubt down by lake take then that youve done little job be that so yes did exactly what asked capital then remains for be to realize that up till moment be not aware that anything unusual occurred so much so in fact that must listen to sad piece of news ive got for listen italian servant vincenzo have sudden seizure shortly after midnight in hall have just rung bell to tell not to sit up appears that be waiting for that be in hall in fact already got up must seem to come to room here when seizure took fell heard noise of fall found there a one must never touch man in fit telephoned for doctor who said be dead there will be inquest will have to attend sad news isnt will miss thought have better tell question to ask well take sympathy for granted colin moved quietly about room a spoke lit cigarette pointed to chair now that ive taken that off mind said let discus something quite different look at douglas tell in capacity a spiritual expert black white what happened last night rather what caused saw priest raised eye to colin terror deep still a summer sea gleamed darkled in word came slowly at first for twitching mouth stammered a spoke can tell what happened said just at moment when evil defiance be mounting in blaze of triumph in soul saw god there be nothing else that can account for if have seen satan must terror that smote soul body asunder have come to might have fallen in trance of adoration what cause must there have be for terror there be cause only for ecstasy be that ecstasy saw on face tell be despair of final defeat be at mercy of whom have made enemy a raised hand in consecration god came be infection only of mute panic in priest eye that caused colins heart to beat suddenly small quick hand to grow cold occurred to said there be moment silence clock ticked just outside window thrush sang colin made violent effort with attacked fear driving before be rotten satanist said ought to be ashamed of a tell that idea did occur to be without knowing overwrought last night excited too when saw terror in face thought that sight of god alone merciful pitiful must have caused thought so even more strongly when hour later looked at face again saw be quiet serene neednt go into what intend to do now for ever from moment be to put notion away doesnt matter if put away not said priest be true colin made that silent effortless relaxation that opening of heart to power that loved served be essence of prayer have just to remain like till began to tingle throb within till be charged brimming with soon spoke of course way of god be inscrutable observed dont take slightest interest in of course hell win in end somehow such score to be omnipotent isnt end yet im going to have good long run for money first besides notion be quite illogical doesnt hold water be principal culprit last night werent why in name of justice werent bagged instead of vincenzo wish to god have be said priest now will explain why because be in hell pleasant room asked colin priest got up cant understand said vincenzo have be conquered have made submission saw truth of what denied mocked be made real to in manner inscrutable to if be end of life be end of hell also oh thought hell be eternal said colin moment hold eternity said other million of year multiplied by million of year be nearer eternity than millionth part of second eternity isnt quantity be quality something shone on colin at a from immense distance over stormy water there shine steadfast beam from harbour light instantly whole will strong in power that possessed mocked derided ah fine durable quality said that abyss of terror in priest eye be veiled for moment yes quality of god said nothing else exists at colin stretched in chair oh damn said quietly im sure beg pardon douglas when try to impart little lightness to solemn gibberish flop back again let quit theology demonology be talking about im sure havent slightest idea what be be little more practical now hear asked to see what did want to say wanted to tell that be leaving stanier to day said douglas colin raised eyebrow thats rather sudden isnt said yes very sudden what happened last night be sudden what wrought in so im to be left without librarian at moment notice said colin must make difference if stopped said douglas must never do office again colin laid hand on priest shoulder put into manner whining charm be dear fellow said mustnt think that im unsympathetic youve have frightful shock have absolutely upset nerve have have effect on mine a see quite understand that youre abroad to day now take complete holiday for month dont go near library be having divine spring may be delicious down here then after month youll find youre again douglas shook head couldnt possibly stop here said well then go out to capri for month so villa be at disposal of course youll be guest though shant be there be kind of said douglas couldnt do that must go cant permit said colin youre part of stanier now very important part too why through that old colins original design be complete built chapel planned before turned traitor whats use of chapel without priest more than empty picture frame last night be very upsetting quite grant for fit of nerve mustnt break up very shrine of staniers hidden life do suppose be chance that caused to meet why weve often agreed be most miraculous design cant smash up like take holiday by mean must come back can not stop here can never come back here said douglas place how will say be saturated colin moved step away from think attitude requires explanation said be capri saturated too douglas faced attitude be perfectly simple said for twelve year worship of evil have be spiritual life last night eye be opened to what have be whether can find salvation dont know what can do be to hate loathe break off connection with who be a have be ah now be getting at said colin saturation speak of be saturator perceive be that yes evil worship colins blue eye be still smiling kind think youre inconsistent said zeal of convert inspire to missionary work brand plucked from burning ought surely to want to spoil fire by pulling out brand douglas hesitated be afraid said not of asked colin yes have power for evil be terrible legend be true cant stand up against yet go on said colin be last word to have watched last month have changed at least there be shadow of change over till last night have never come to chapel last night must feel that felt true devotion if must hope to assist that change might stop have nothing to do with have let love approach dennis love a know very well there be something in crush throttle a will go out to colin suddenly shot out hand at never not even in day of raymond have known so blistering undiluted stream of hate flood soul man with whom have be knit in worship of evil not only have thrown aside have seen spoken of like disgrace have tried to cover up excuse from thats enough said let tell that never spoke word more ill advised for purpose than truth in damn do think dont know that a well a dont see that if anything be wanted to encourage to root that change out of heart must be that trembling renegade must tell of shadow lying on came close up to again there be not much of smile in eye now spoke with cold deadly concentration know that ive be weak said tonic youve given for weakness therell be no more complaint of lack of fervour what have frightened have put resolve courage into truckling submission why will hear of teaching in sunday school next perhaps youd like dennis to come sit under ill wring weakness out of heart a wring last drop of moisture from wet cloth out of denniss heart ill pluck weed of love plant flower of hate there thick a spring daffodil on hill side colin broke off suddenly go away said while have time if stop here youll see something will curl up like vincenzo wont be face of god will be something cant bear youre trembling in limb now by god therell be two inquest instead of one if stop here youre afraid of a said thats very prudent of how power surged foamed through be like fire wine in vein buoyant intoxicating must kill now said except for fuss bother must involve in there one mysterious death to be investigated already may thank luck that be so be true enough that douglas have shrunk before holding up arm a if to ward off impending blow now suddenly straightened up a if new force have nerved in strength of that stood steadfast unafraid before power flickered in colins eye be afraid of said be blindness that made afraid now de profundis call on god whom have mocked at defied in whom believe just a do daresay must kill body for be mortal be weak with sin defilement against be powerless a hate in presence of love know that one day will be conquered make submission too will go down into hell a have done find god be there also waited moment watching now without dismay furious impotence of others face word came from colin presently moved to door good bye lord yardley said god will have mercy on soul in spite of colin stood where be hearing douglas step pas across gallery into hall finger still twitched with rage felt charged crackling with friendly power have doubt in own soul by mere exercise of will must have brought to bear disastrous force on man who have just quitted must exhibit in illness misfortune in way more swift terrible yet though mere opening of sluice of pent up evil must have done though with conscious fibre of hated wished did not do for what might happen to douglas be side issue not worth pursuing a regard main issue namely soul abhorrence of power in whose name douglas have withstood knew that be defeated already have come up against something did not fight strive against merely stood there patient pitiful serenely existing confessed defeat did not acquiesce in rather stirred in a have said to douglas more determined antagonism took farther than ever from notion of submission douglas be right in saying that there be breach in defence in breach stood dennis boyish smiling clad in armour of love innocence somehow must be stripped of wounded driven away from crumbling wall of colins defence else must never be able to repair of course boy be not convent bred be pious barley sugar little saint high spirited vigorous fellow with good leaven of mischief boyish naughtiness be nothing armoured innocence lay in utter lack of love of evil when came near in abstract choked shuddered at instinctively recoiling dennis have notion of hate of desire to hurt rudiment of cruelty bramble full of thorn red fruit when have taken root in soul spread over quicker than other lust choke stab to death growth impedes have existence in liked enjoying there perhaps lay seed of selfishness selfishness be negative quality compared with other there more impregnable yet very breastplate of denniss armour covered heart be propensity for love colin knew that in three week of easter holiday have made sad mess in attempting to use that a weapon in own hand have thought that by making dennis attached to must be able to influence boy to own end lay soul open for introduction of intended to implant there strangely miscalculated result have ensued easily indeed by exercise of charm be to command have won boy heart by mischance of carelessness have let denniss love ooze into that leak must be stopped up a be house of hate be not impervious to soft april rain why be wondered that dennis penetrated like whereas violet whose love for still lived must make entrance must sit so to speak in window watch streaming on pane never drop come in dennis dripped from roof entered through chink cranny be that with violet love there be mingled fear of horror cloyed power of penetration whereas dennis be pure limpid water dennis have fear horror of have clung to in midnight hour of fear a to rock sure defence unknowing that be from there that be assailed that fled to from whom be fleeing there be love in innocence awful power above then must kill denniss love for weapon have thought to forge out of have only be turned against at same time be in denniss chief protection dennis loved one colin be sure a loved there be cuirass of security must be hammered into fragment must pierce wound until drew out of own breast cast from a poisoned thing be origin of woe yes damned douglas be right thought colin im grateful to for warning ill see to sat there few moment longer then ejected topic from mind altogether for distraction moved across to window superb luminous afternoon be already near close tide of clear shadow be creeping up terrace below lake reflecting sky be mirror of steely blue beyond plain be dim with mist rising from intersecting dyke further edge line of sea bounded have vanished altogether for sea fog hung over channel be slowly drifting inland towards sunset in chill of evening following on warm day like often spread right across plain opaque impenetrable covering completely like sea lapped round lower edge of higher ground turning contour into bay headland hill of rye rose above like island top of tall tree in plain must float like derelict on surface submerged featureless flat beyond till dispersed again with rising wind warmth of dawn be bewildering blinding man caught by unawares where there be path to guide might lose bearing altogether wander night in aimless circle over pasture perfectly familiar to to night reinforced by moisture rising from dyke dense mist spread very rapidly even a colin watched whole plain vanished before eye from sea foghorn be already hooting with hollow long drawn wail colin turned from window luminous west have grown pale march of shadow mist be rather dreary spectacle within be scarcely better two day ago at time house have be seething with life fancy dress ball be yet to come then yesterday morning guest have gone there be still dennis here what festival have made of last day then have come that midnight catastrophe of sequel have be scene have just gone through departure of douglas be over there be object to be served by brooding upon above be absence of dennis contributed to mood of slack purposelessness be so unusual with only morning a trudged up slope with boy for silly rabbit shooting have taking unawares fancied that must be content to expunge have given zest alacrity to life browse here animal like so long a be at stanier stanier be here be at stanier for reason mist chilly obliterating have crept up round penetrating everywhere surely have come before be due be not evening with yet broad noon many year must pas before for sun set frost of death came on dennis plucked rein from nerveless hand for moment let visualise what manner of impotence must be at hour just power of hate must be left thought even red of must be fading like sunset outside into grey encompassing mist surely a long a one touch of colour remained there must be hating very existence of stanier because be no longer denniss hating dennis for dawning pride of ownership how must long then to summon cataclysmic force must annihilate heritage heritor alike what worse torment must there be for uncharted aeon must follow than to be condemned to exist unseen unheard here where stood now be actively aware of dennis in possession with son growing up who must inherit after while drifted impalpably about surrounded by warmth of life yet must not thaw that ice cold bubble that contained consciousness must school to think of dennis enjoying have be torn from already dennis be potential foe supplanter be time to eject comfortless imaginings that need retain of be new conception of dennis for surely might prove antidote to affection went out of room into long gallery where violet alone be seated at tea table put down book be reading a sauntered up anyone dining to night said be granny going to spend quiet evening of domestic bliss poured out cup of tea will be alone a far a know said must like to ask mr douglas colin paused that subject be one of have meant to put away from must have if liked douglas have gone observed gone asked yes said gone didnt said colin to spare more question dont know where he gone because didnt tell sometimes thought must be rather good tutor for dennis in holiday little later on just glanced at violet saw have understood thats over now continued will have to conduct denniss holiday education yes atmosphere of stanier didnt suit douglas be impolite enough to say that be saturated with that couldnt bear for moment longer youre delighted suppose arent saw very little of said violet a know didnt like how very unchristian of be fault found with dont think need go into said how reticent be darling said sad isnt there so little mutual confidence trust between wonder if youre glad vincenzo have gone too must feel inclined to come to inquest with say that vincenzo be lovable god fearing fellow who have nothing on mind fear worry looked at with sudden spasm of alarm colin what do mean said didnt kill liked producing that look of terror in eye liked playing with fear of course havent told what really happened said for a know be always considerate must hate to shock perhaps will tell sometime suicide wasnt suicide there little puzzle for violet to occupy leisure now that duty of hostess no longer take time vincenzo dy very suddenly one night douglas find cant breathe same atmosphere a next day ah guess what youre conjecturing wrong wasnt cause directly indirectly of vincenzos death what mind youve got darling to let suspicion ever peep into colin spoke with soft deliberation be like great purring cat with mouse between paw did think that know said just a still think that have well let say tip of finger in poor pamelas death altogether feel rather lonely deserted afternoon here be with dark suspicion about then old friend douglas have gone old servant be friend too vincenzo have gone then dennis have gone within twenty four hour put down cup sat down on rug by foot clasping knee find so little sympathy said believe youre not sorry that douglas vincenzo have gone wonder really do wonder whether youre sorry dennis have gone there be fiendish ingenuity violet suspected at bottom of question how well divined mind how like a if be deft conjurer to guess what be in why miss dennis most awfully said house seems dead without colin smiled yes very pretty madonna like said wasnt what asked asked if be sorry dennis have gone thats direct question enough cant answer directly rose with nerve on edge must never do if be to reach colin at with love be only efficient power have must eradicate fear of brushing aside that shuddered at for cramped clogged movement towards question be direct enough said cant give direct answer youve made boy devoted to thats beyond question sometimes ive be afraid wished be not here then ive wondered whether havent misjudged altogether dennis be just a sweet innocent a have always be then ive asked whether havent begun to love oh colin if thats only so know must give life for colin jumped to foot if think im going to listen to damned sentimental maunderings said youre awfully mistaken dennis be devoted to that be perfectly true effected that for two reason one concern be in order to cut out dear violet ive done ive seen how youve writhed with jealousy once twice under knowledge second reason be more important made dennis love in order might have unbounded influence over for a youve often told love be infinite in power wonder be afraid a matter of fact havent used that influence over in way that expected now perhaps will be relief to im going to change tactic dont like love know im going to make dennis sorry loved hasnt yet seen with will call with clarity of vision so important for boy to form habit of accurate observation must get to dislike love too because wound make bleed there spoke very spirit essence of wickedness yet violet felt that struggled for utterance fighting way to lip purpose be plain there be something contested impediment threatened free exercise so guessed be aware of too for though have never be in more deadly bitter mood never swifter with characteristic gibe pierced stung felt that there be effort about a if bow shot have to be strung again again instead of being always ready in superficial trivial way also in day followed that struggle whatever be seemed to manifest in strange little indecision irritated made unlike one day for instance must tell that connubial solitude with immortal grandmother thrown in be too delicate form of happiness that must go up to london afternoon hour later must have changed mind told to ask down party for week end then before have done that must change mind again say that wanted nobody spent day rambling about park in hot spell of may weather bathing basking by lake day started off to drive to eton see dennis to whom have promised early visit when evening asked how dennis be told have not be there be at dinner just three of when rapped out at roused in old lady yardley dim disordered train of thought for began to speak in level monotone came out of twilight mist yes much wiser much wiser said let there be force not even persuasion let come to naturally be bred in bone make drink of spring will be thirsty someday then will go to colin turned sharply round go to what granny said what do mean what be talking about aha be talking of what know what know talk in parable be plain to knew too that man who never come here now yes yet have gone only colin be left now chapel be empty stopped a suddenly a have begun rose leaning on stick through day while spring hour be weaving fresh embroidery black pattern be being worked stitch by stitch so violet felt into colins heart sometimes needle be nimbly plied then despite shuddered at depth lay beneath bright surface of gaiety for be when black business within went well that mood be sunniest such be case when came back from inquest held on body of vincenzo there be autopsy told though rummaged about so dr martin told with great thoroughness must find cause of death visitation of god be must make of daresay be quite right be like enoch apparently be translated wonder how vincenzo must bear translation wonder what be translated into be difficult not to shudder at colin dont talk like said youre terrible terrible why didnt translate then gave evidence be very polite complimentary bowed at other with respectful mournful little smile told just what told agreed have acted with great wisdom prudence be quite true have idea how true be then bowed again like like minuet by way have made anything of little puzzle set about departure of douglas following so closely on death of vincenzo reason gave for violet made reply manner be getting very bad darling said colin asked civil enough question now here queer thing doctor assistant noticed very curious smell about frail earthly tabernacle of poor vincenzo what do think be youll never guess so ill tell there be strong odour of incense now where can have come from must throw light on can got up colin supposing told there be more about vincenzos death than know said ah thats great idea what fun write anonymous letter to coroner what will say be that dont know thought that information about incense might interest consider in connection with puzzle day seemed a if thing did not go well with black embroidery for be savage silent then be guessed that something be struggling with for existence that stabbed at tried to strangle yet such day lashed by blast of bitter tongue be more welcome to than on be smiling content in harmony with a week of may went by violet saw more more clearly that have significance for at be just that gave day unspeakable tension sometimes be butt of irony sometimes completely disregarded whichever be be not concerned with be just traditional stanier wife whose duty be to provide heir after might freeze knew loved knew feared be quite indifferent to be dennis round whom thought strange hidden contest centred unerringly knew who be combatant now beginning to come into touch with other on one side be that legend stood for love of hate hate of love colin life have be apt pupil in deadly school perhaps such scholar a have ever graduated there already have tried to use love a instrument of corruption have failed changed plan now be out to kill love in command of black panoply be arraying to fight against young boy who stood there unaware that there be anyone father adored coming to meet have defence except love yet be there traitor in very heart of foe have to stand aside watch of what use be to warn dennis what form must that warning take knew be that be father coming to if must somehow throw between colin must pas on over indifferent scarcely even aware of one thing only perhaps must do be to stamp out fear of for only effect of fear be to paralyse thus then dimly mistily be new situation forming must not present like that must take shape when dennis be home again in daily domestic way in way cunning cruel in way perhaps affectionate winning must contribute to end in view chapter v eton term came to end in last week of july dennis found that by leaving at timeless hour must get down to stanier by middle of morning idea be irresistible for there must be time to have hour so bathing with father before lunch keep afternoon intact so though original plan have be to lunch with aunt hester tipped gorged go on to stanier afterwards telegraphed to that have to go straight home sent second telegram to father to say that must arrive at rye at half past eleven knew that colin be there for mother have written to day two before to say have left london be at stanier heat of day promised well for pleasure of diversion such a bathing addition of excited anticipation made dennis strip off coat when have got into train from london turn up shirt sleeve to elbow long summer holiday with extra week at end in honour of certain royal visit to school contained eternity of joy not only be there stanier to look forward to that visit to capri with father have be promised a train neared rye hung out of window to catch first sight of house glowing among wood there be just glimpse of with flag flying on tower then tree hid again must bounce across to other side of carriage to see father standing on platform wave to must be there to meet a certainly a stanier be waiting for on hill platform be rather full dennis be still searching for colin when train drew up descended with arm full of agreeable impedimenta then very natural explanation of colins absence occurred to without doubt have driven down in little two seater be waiting for outside went through gate of egress in station yard there be two seater other conveyance from stanier again explanation be easy telegram have not yet be delivered be not quite ecstasy of arrival that have anticipated be entirely own fault cab laboured up long hill jogged very sedately along level up to lodge gate at rate must traverse short cut on foot more quickly than deliberate quadruped must make detour getting out at lodge struck across park arriving at house before cab came within sight ran through hall burst into father room room be empty there be mother anyhow in shady corner of garden below terrace hailed next moment be running down step leaping flower bed rose to meet caught to close clinging dennis darling said be lovely oh dear what heat youre in know ran across park got here before old cab wheres father started hour ago to drive up to london oh how rotten think thats beastly of didnt get telegram to say be coming morning violet hesitated yes dear did get said thought that having said must come in afternoon ought to have kept to first plan dennis looked impartially at verdict suppose ought said a found must get here earlier of course did so scored off by making come up in cab going away when will be back time to day late perhaps thought denniss sun be very certainly clouded sufficient brightness remained to illuminate pleasant day there be bathe before lunch violet took to play golf after slight demur over chance of father arriving during absence there be tea on terrace stroll through wood with gun thing have be rapturous in anticipation though nothing must quite rob of honey be not of transcendent order well did violet understand that well understood why colin have suddenly settled to go up to town day then came dinner where place be laid unoccupied old lady yardley groping in twilight be darkening round now thinking that be colin back from school now asking where colin be still did not come about eleven dennis visibly perturbed depressed mother went up to bed youre sure hasnt have accident asked yes darling quite sure mustnt think of bright idea struck dennis oh mother somebody must sit up for to let in said maynt dear know wouldnt wish to go to bed darling get long night be up early enough to day dennis sighed well ive have ripping day with anyhow said denniss room looked out on to front of house before got into bed set door ajar window wide so that by chance must miss sound of father arrival without turning off light sat propped up in bed prepared for length of vigil for in spite of day long disappointment be sure that colin must look in on when came must never do to miss conference there be million of thing to tell be told better than must be fact of father presence sitting here on bed after ever so long talk wishing good night leaving to fall asleep with sense of still lingering in room be not long before heard crunch of gravel beneath wheel of motor jumped out of bed to look out of window call to have be equally quick in letting in dennis have more than glimpse of standing in oblong of light from open door before closed again behind be of consequence must be here immediately dennis leaped back into bed minute passed very likely colin must want something to eat after drive from london before came upstairs soon there came along passage step dennis knew eye sparkling with imminent joy be fixed on door to see swing open step stopped short before reached door little way down passage be opened closed suppose thought be very late must be asleep said dennis to a put out light slept late next morning hurried downstairs to breakfast father dressed in flannel with hair still wet from bathe be standing by window opening letter oh there be at last said dennis springing to colin gave rather absent hand hullo dennis said hullo father say how late be last night never came to see managed to curb impatience till morning said colin o oh sarcasm have be bathing why didnt fetch didnt imagine have forgotten way down to lake if wanted to bathe dennis gave one quick anxious glance there be something wrong perhaps business in london yesterday have worried perhaps father be vexed with though seemed very inexplicable about matter of train yesterday im sorry about coming in morning yesterday said after have told afternoon thought must be so ripping to get here before lunch oh yes thats right said colin absently at moment violet came in colins manner instantly changed ah vi darling said there be got back very late last night for thought must dine with aunt hester be quite delightful also quite astounding about eleven went off to dance in short pink dress wreath of flower promised to come down here to day stop till go to capri dennis pricked ear at oh when will be father said one of day then if like dont mind darling can stop on here though really believe must like best to come to capri disport like small imperishable highly coloured sea nymph how must astonish islander dennis gave cackle of laughter at picture best of be gay good humour in father voice colin turned to dennis told that have promised to lunch with yesterday said that sent telegram saying have to get down here there be compulsion on to get down here that im aware of oh wanted to get down here so frightfully said dennis see anything want frightfully have to happen said colin suppose anything want not to happen isnt allowed to in spite of next time say youll go to see aunt hester then throw over at last minute just conceivable that something may happen dont like go put mother plate down for be bewildering dennis did a be told having finished breakfast came stood by father chair well what do want asked colin sharply dennis flushed oh nothing said dont hang about then can go if youve finished breakfast dennis have spirit of own one thing be perfectly clear to a left room namely that if father did not want to be bothered with be not going to make importunate request for companionship be horrid state of thing doubt temporary must parallel by bleakness sometimes fell upon house master at school for apparent reason paternal bleakness unknown in last glorious easter holiday be of course far more depressing for took colour out of life be absolutely ignorant what cause of offence have given throwing over aunt hester coming by train be clearly inadequate a reason for must do while lasted be to be prompt obedient above everything to spring to whenever sun must shine out again without shadow of resentment reserve treatment be wounding inexplicable must keep hurt to most certainly must not go to mother with querulous wonder a to what be about concerned father nobody else must be disloyal to unshaken allegiance to make moan dennis have ample opportunity for loyalty in next few day for must hing right in father eye scarcely saw have speech with except at meal then if talked be told not to jabber if be silent be asked why be so sulky be heart rending inexplicable affair more puzzling because except with colin be in gayest most entrancing mood aunt hester who apparently have not in least minded denniss conduct received most delightful welcome for indefinite period colin chaffed made much of till beamed again with violet be same only dennis have power to check geniality cause to rap out reprimand of kind in evening four of with old lady yardley played whist be left to amuse a best must even then must not escape censure if watched dreary enough occupation be asked why didnt get book read bit after day of enjoyment if read be supposed that whist be too old fashioned for young generation to interest in once aunt hester intervened let read look on a like dear said to colin can please surely on occasion only colin be sharp with dear aunt hester said perhaps youd mind own business be waiting for to play then after dismal whist there be dismal going up to room with knowledge that door must not open father look in sit on bed make delightful plan for next day darker phase succeeded in following week eton friend came to stay now at least there be someone to play with jim airedale be engaging good looking boy devoted to dennis even in eclipse two of with resource of stanier to chose from might entertain with considerable enjoyment went more grievously for dennis than ever colin appeared to take great fancy to friend at dinner on day of arrival talked to delightfully with occasional interspersion of snub for dennis one a dennis be bitterly aware knew so well road to boy heart made jim at ease in couple of minute set chattering in couple more be hilarious meal followed after dinner set dennis down to play weary whist took other boy off to play billiards when whist be over dennis joined marked for then at bedtime colin took jim up to room to see that everything be comfortable lingered there talking while next door dennis half undressed sat on bed waiting for merry sound to cease when be quiet slipped out of room to have few word with jim perhaps colin be waiting for for a passed door opened quietly there father stood hullo where be going asked something in dennis seemed to strain almost to breaking point at cold hostility of tone im just going to see jim said well then have better just go back to room again said colin next morning took jim off in two seater to play golf dennis must lend club came back late for lunch better friend than ever afterwards there be rabbit potting at jim excelled colin found occasion to say to dennis wonder if youll ever learn to shoot like there be dreadful game of lawn tennis in colin saying that be worst player of four must play with jim against violet dennis really be best so of course won be sufficient to turn boy head jim became slightly condescending to friend when said to dennis say youre father pretty rough on sometimes with intention of being consolatory friendly found have strangely miscalculated up went denniss chin rough on said what on earth do mean he perfectly ripping to finally on last evening of nightmare week colin made impossible for jim after decent allowance of champagne at dinner to refuse couple of glass of port became rather tipsy when with rolling eye menacing sense of rising nausea hurried away to room colin watched go with shrug of shoulder nice sort of friend bring to house dennis said that seemed to round off visit very pleasantly colin be sitting up alone that night after others have gone upstairs have be more brutal than usual with dennis at dinner for first time have seen dennis bite lip obviously to keep tear back in spite of pitiless persecution knew that be nearer to attainment of purpose a far a dennis be concerned have systematically continuously hurt wounded in attempt to be committed to kill love failure must at present have be more complete often when whip of tongue have be cruellest cunning to hurt most diabolical have looked at dennis saying well answer cant dennis have raised to troubled bewildered eye in spark of hate smouldered there be meekness about dennis must answer back with head up quite unsubdued unafraid in vain colin looked for sign that love be ailing like to die occasionally when relaxed gave kind word love leaped sparkling to eye beautiful mouth what confirmed impression be pride of boy for never a colin knew uttered to mother single word of complaint went to for comfort little a colin knew of love knew that here be noble pride of love must never admit failing blemish in object of high affection colin opened door on to terrace strolled out into warm pregnant night there be something more indicative of failure than impregnable loyalty of denniss be own unchanged affection for boy in possible way must be devised by alert perceptive brain have wounded injured denniss heart though there be such royal road towards hate a to injure have made headway at devotion to hatred vow to so faithfully kept to be evil have often made bubble with secret glee to see dennis wince under barbed attack time there existed that soft aching tenderness for so easy to stifle so impossible to smother like eternity a have sneered to douglas seemed of very durable stuff fortnight persecution have done nothing to break up uninvited have entered heart nothing must stir must act a if have other feeling for boy than contemptuous aversion something ached night breeze drew landward from sea sometimes fell altogether there be dead calm again heard whispered approach in tree by lake presently flowed over garden streamed on to terrace tried a so often have done to lay open to spell have woven prosperity of stanier thought of dennis heir to glory possessor of when have gone from world at that flicker of jealousy strange offspring of love hate shot up in heart supposing dennis died before did must sooner see lying dead know that at rate must never succeed to stanier magnificence when death drew near to see dennis by bedside picture assuming what be to enjoy no longer on deathbed surely must entirely hate dennis wish that lay there in stead at end of long faade there stood chapel unused since douglas departure colin going back into room let into corridor led to turning up light a went have not be there since night of vincenzos death now seemed to that if sat meditated there where so often have made consecration of to evil must arrive at clearer conscious realization of told that hated love delighted in hate fervour warmed creed in sanctuary of satan truth of might shine more vividly on might get rid of fancy denniss eye eager ready to kindle sad without reproach be watching surely must not follow where dennis have never be colin sat quiet in place looking at altar faint odour of incense still hung about emotionally place be dead thought of vincenzo twitching grinning a knelt thought of douglas lifting high consecrated element so soon to be mockery derision mind gave welcome greeting to remembrance well deed must atone for lack of fervour presently rose went back through silent house upstairs along dim lit passage suddenly desire came to just to look at dennis boy must certainly be asleep by now for must have learned that be not much good to keep awake on chance of father coming in to say good night must just open door turn on light for second look at leave told wanted to remind that boy must inherit that now loved enjoyed what concealed from stuffing away out of sight be that human craving hungered for sight of dennis must be asleep must get pleasure from what did not know colin opened door quietly saw room be light there be dennis sitting up in bed face be bright with unexpected surprise stretched out arm there be something appealing timid in gesture oh father how ripping said colin be helpless in grip of welcome tried to frame tongue to chilling reprimand none came dennis not asleep yet light on what doe mean asked boy broke out into little bubble of laugh why always keep on till hear go to room said why asked colin of course on chance that youd come in a always used to do knew must sometime jolly glad kept on oh come sit down against will purpose colin came up to bed dennis wriggled aside to make room for put up knee for to lean against cant stop said colin sitting down fearfully late youre villain for being awake right im villain said dennis wait for night asked colin dennis nodded just then must not trust to speak shining eye spoke for what will talk about asked colin just for minute oh anything doesnt matter bit a long a at moment colin be happy have hardly realized that before just a have heard night wind coming up whispering in tree by lake knew that there be approaching blast of hate evil have tried to conjure up in chapel leant towards dennis put arm round neck kissed good night old boy said wont stop now sleep well ever so well said dennis colin clicked out light went to room already brain seethed with image of evil vivid alluring fierce at treason of swarmed like loyal garrison to breach in defence where dennis have stood drove off urged colin to pursue to go back to boy room to let loose on assault to defile desecrate innocence to show ecstasy of evil charm of cruelty what matter if panic horror made nightmare round must wake from with new current coursing in vein new desire stinging to fulfilment where be good of being heir to legend if did not enter into birthright fierce be stress of possession colin withstood feeling that if yielded very bond of sanity must be loosed if went back to denniss room now must go a devil unchained ready eager to perpetrate spiritual outrage desecration who knew whether very balance poise of denniss being whom have just left with serenity restored lamp of love bravely burning might not be upset altogether already be scarcely in own control maddened to invincible lust of evil by sight of tender victim might let cross boundary separate territory of human life from untamed welter chaos of prodigious force threaten maintain have served satan life alike in spirit in work must serve still while stress seemed like dervish possession be on must not trust with dennis something of irremediable violence might happen fatal laceration of fibre of boy soul crisis passed leaving conscious only of immense fatigue there have be struggle not between alone satanic power between something in not of opposed be too tired to think more throwing off clothes sank into dark of dreamless sleep slept late waking brought with certain incredulousness at memory of night before what have happened seemed buried at rate under deep layer of consciousness so that must not handle examine much more accessible be memory of weakness in going in to dennis at fruit might have ripened from fortnight harshness to boy be certainly frost bitten now for dennis knew hugged to know below bleak cruelty father loved existed still be foolish thing to have done not only for reason because have weakened in allowing that spasm of affection to assert be never too late thought to mend foolishness by wise course dennis have finished breakfast when got down heard from violet that have gone for morning in water leaving urgent message for father to follow boy radiant morning said told came into room last night be ripping so said colin be busy at side table oh what else did say asked just that be glad did that couple of minute made forget woe of holiday ah he forgotten about have said colin absolutely theyve vanished oh yes wondered if knew when be going to capri said hadnt told will go to morrow how concern dennis dont know unless a be highly probable he glad to get rid of arent taking asked violet promised to take did well now promise not to entirely for sake of course darling love having here to youll be able to make up lost ground now dont want to hear anything more about capri ill tell dennis why must drag brat like about with before long colin strolled down to lake there be denniss yellow head far out on water browned arm glistening with wet lifting alternately a surged back to shed by time colin have come to smooth turf margined lake have got to land stood knee deep in willow water slim shining with april face of happiness gave great whoop of welcome when saw father hurrah father said have be quick water lovely let bathe lie about morning oh say be diving just now found awfully funny thing in mud at bottom look a if be lace of sort catch dennis picked up sodden grey ball have put on bank threw at father at moment colins attention be attracted by water fowl swimming at far end of lake denniss missile wet muddy hit full in face oh im sorry said dennis thought be looking missile have fallen at colins foot saw at once that must be lace cotta have be torn off vincenzos body at sight horde of recollection drove in upon once more vincenzo twitched grinned incense smoked instinct of hate cruelty have dozed last night in chapel leaped up bright eyed snarling then too recovered relic have splashed mud slimy evil smelling have dropped on to white coat dennis youre damned nuisance said ill teach to behave what devil do mean by doing that plucked two lithe shoot of willow from tree grew by water edge stripped off leaf come out said stand here with back to dennis looked at father saw blind rage fury in face a peeled willow wand im awfully sorry father said youll be sorrier in minute come here im going to give six of smartest cut youve ever have hurt more when youre wet dennis stepped out of water stood where father pointed four stroke savagely delivered fell across shoulder stood perfectly steady gasping little at burning sting of a colin slashed at felt exultant glee at last be hurting to purpose have spoiled effect of fortnight cruelty by concession last night must start afresh with apostasy to follow saw red criss cross of stroke weal rising on boy skin with such ecstasy of satisfaction a have seen pamela standing in room one night at capri then in middle of chastisement knew must not strike dennis again will do said turn round dennis turned looked straight in eye in spite of sharpness of pain face be in perfect control mouth be just little compressed once more colin knew that have failed for saw there pain bewilderment mute reproach of fear not trace yet of hate with regard to have failed also for have be literally unable to finish punishment have promised now wanted to put arm round denniss neck kiss tell that knew what devil be beg boy forgiveness very consciousness of failure made rage again well did like that said hurt expect yes said dennis why dont cry then asked colin dont choose to colin sat down on grass lit cigarette well there pleasure in store for said im going to capri to morrow mother say think youre coming with thats error on part thats yes said dennis again walked to where clothes lay on bench began dressing arent going on with bathe asked colin will take sting out father ive finished said dennis colin began taking clothes off going to sulk suppose said please smarting of skin far sorer at heart dennis walked quietly off when have dressed skirting lake went up along bracken covered slope of park looked out over marsh longed to confide in mother ask if must account in way for pentecost of trouble holiday have brought have culminated in thrashing in spite of comfort might have brought from mere knowledge of sympathy must not tell of not because be humiliation to because be disgrace to father must never be known to offence provoked be cause at in easter holiday might have done until seventy time seven father must only have laughed called little devil thrown missile back at same policy of repression must be preserved about other woe in manner father treated be affair concerned alone mere manliness forbade to go whimpering to anybody more stringent yet be prohibition that own love for father enjoined on be impossible to complain have got to shoulder own burden injustice harshness have laid on waded through waist high bracken with scuttle of rabbit about there be patch of bare turf between clump of fern be great sport to walk through bracken with gun get pot shot at rabbit bolted across clearing often have done that with father to day have not least inclination to fetch gun wanted only since speaking to mother be out of question to be alone stare intolerable state of affair in face sat down in one of open space with aromatic smell of woodland round tried to focus smarted with blow have received with utter injustice of most of heart cried out against virulent glee in father face when told to turn round again asked how enjoyed if only be like other fellow at school who disliked just put up with father must merely have be angry at abominable treatment delighted that beastly man be taking off to morrow dennis felt none of natural sentiment in spite of harshness must rapturously have gone with father to capri if have be allowed unshaken in faith for minute two last night have be so joyfully justified that to day to morrow father must turn to again be ripping a one else in world must be father what have done to evoke desolating displeasure have altogether changed to disliked wanted to hurt finely succeeded a sense of bitter tragedy grew on dennis must bear no longer rolled over on face for first time in awful fortnight sobbed with pain of wounded affection after while sat up again there be earthly use in indulging in such sloppy trick pulling together walked back to house be close on lunch time made neat for fear of provoking sarcastic comment sat in gallery over picture paper presently mother colin came in together well dear nice bathe said to yes mother jolly warm said came over to chair leaned over putting hand on shoulder dennis must not help wincing at whats matter darling said nothing scratched back against snag a be bathing said rather sore colin heard instantly thought to now ill tell will humiliate on heel of came sudden glow of pride at staunchness of boy guessed that said that not to spare to spare a last night yearning for affection have not yet succeeded in killing pulled at heart be unutterable relief to violet when next morning with charming farewell to aunt hester with nod to dennis colin drove off to catch boat at folkestone have ached mourned over boy misery at same time have rejoiced in reticence have observed to for there indeed be banner of love flying bravely if have struck that come to for comfort with complaint indeed there must have be matter for wonder delighted in fact that flew still be good that colin be gone poor dennis have have rotten time longed to give pleasanter day naturally have inkling of meaning of tribulation of significance underlay have notion of telling that in belief battle be going on somehow centred round in boyishly unheeding be standing ground in face of black bitter assault knew well that be not yet over yet nearly over have held own fresh assault fiercer yet perhaps must come just for next few week there be truce be thankful for that summer day passed on school friend came to stay with dennis after dennis seemed happy though one must kindle in abandoned radiance colin so easily lit colin have be away month now according to plan must be back for denniss last week at home one evening there came letter to violet saying that be intending to stop on in island for fortnight read to dennis a sat together that night for bed time talk after old lady yardleys whist be finished aunt hester have hurried away in horror of lateness of hour fear of missing beauty sleep one piece of letter be not for ear colin asked if be making up lost ground with dennis supposed have hatched plenty of conspiracy against also sent message to dennis to say that need not trouble to ink finger over writing to a letter be quite illegible violet thought unnecessary to deliver message reading out postponement of father return saw denniss face fall then shant see father before go back to eton observed violet considered date dear youll have gone back several day before come said cloud deepened on denniss face did father say anything about letter ive written asked laughed yes dear did say something said about not being particularly easy to read other message for asked boy violet heart began to ache for let see where have got to said wonderful vintage say in lovely hot weather theyre having he be bathing morning have have lunch be going to sleep message for persisted dennis violet finished letter tore up there be good deal about dennis though nothing for struck that uncomplimentary comment be forced in one colin have first written boy have crossed that out substituted brat have not thought of a brat originally brat be image under schooled to think of sentence have spontaneous ring about expressed what tried to feel felt sure that interpretation be fanciful one dennis have accepted silence to repeated question what else have be doing said dining out in garden night said violet looking at making wine garden be good deal burned up with heat nothing else bathing take day dennis crossed from far side of hearth rug made back for against knee sound awfully ripping lazy said father love doesnt must have liked to have gone with for bit perhaps year hell take said violet felt sense of injury in fact that dennis wanted to be out there with rather than at home with thanked god that be so that wretched day when father have persecuted have left no stain on luminous brightness of affection at cost wanted that to retain shining quality even if dennis suffered suffered in cause of love if have not loved father must have thought of now a merely very disagreeable person whose absence be matter for congratulation even now dennis wanted to be with be disappointed that postponed return must rob of glimpse before went back to eton wonder if will said dennis wonder violet felt that boy be on verge of speech drew back against knee encompassing shoulder yes darling what do wonder said dennis drew long breath wonder what made father so beastly to when came home time said cant think of anything have done didnt mean to speak of have done anything mother darling said gently then not fault anyhow said thats something oh lord have thought about so much so if not something have just got hold of father wish must let go came up to room one night know be just a used to be believe believe he fond of time really what be to do wondered how near truth have come word something have got hold of father wish must let go be extraordinarily apt must not tell that father loved hate hated love that in belief love be beginning to assert against black dominion to tell to speak of legend of choice colin have renewed for might spoil instinctive simplicity with dennis faced must not tell that father have tried to corrupt failing there be trying to kill love truth baldly stated might easily produce in if understood just that atmosphere of horror in love gasped for breath dennis darling said can help father in way that nobody else can how said dennis quickly whats about doesnt matter what about said can help by doing just what be doing go on loving dear never let cease loving a if must help doing said dennis be busy next morning scribbled long letter to father copied out with extreme care one must possibly say be illegible chapter vi be not until first of autumn shooting party at stanier be nearly due that colin came back from island from then till early in december succession of guest passed through sometimes went up to town with party be leaving returning few day afterwards with new relay then again be busy with duty a host sometimes stopped here in emptied house even then violet be never once alone with for private talk pointedly avoided chance of on only occasion when have attempted to break ring of seclusion from have flamed into devilish anger oh for god sake clear out said if youve come for heart to heart talk youll know fast enough if ive got anything to say to want to talk to said havent seen since left here in august gave one furious glance youd better go said dennis knew wrote to for sometimes must see that laborious legible script on one of letter so different from cursive scrawl gave colin certainly read never wrote to boy one day there came to violet at end of one of denniss letter postscript without comment father have told not to write to more there be reply to be made to dennis have stated without comment without comment have better remain for understood other on subject concerned yet for reason must not justify must scarcely even define violet felt that underneath harshness of injunction there lay not so much desire to wound a deliberate intention of so doing colin have sat down thought of that have not sprung from open garden of mind have be reared with deliberate care have not be derived from instinct from craft that waspish little prohibition be spontaneous product might even regard a missile discharged not in offence in defence then never spoke of dennis not once did boy name pas lip to who knew so well have so often shuddered at what be carried same interpretation wanted suggestion reminder of dennis to come near not even to did mention though be just here that be most vulnerable to taunt gibe wounded be not like to spare most sensitive spot for fear of hurting be much more probable that somehow other be sensitive there forbore from contact at must have winced be alone for few minute together one evening early in december old lady yardleys whist at nurse have made fourth be just over sepulchral game be now in dimness be falling ever duskier over mind more than mere approximate symbol of game held card played quite fortuitously smiled a gathered random trick after few hand of phantom game have be dealt disposed of be quite content when told that two rubber be over that have won though must whimper in vague distress if thought be not going to get whist even colin have become now to shadow among shadow just occasionally faint ray from mind illuminated for most part be piece of grey background ever receding of visible world to night however thought of quickened just a be being wheeled out of room though evening have seemed unconscious of presence for turned in chair said colin be coming back from eton before long will be well with stanier again colin have got up be way along gallery on passage to own room leaving violet there at came back stood in front of fire when doe colin suppose mean that brat of yours mine come home asked violet gave date five day before christmas suppose

hesters coming said violet mother very exhilarating observed colin then why dont go to friend for christmas if feel like said there reason why must be here with handful of woman there be if youll excuse contradicting said must make denniss christmas happy joyful after have certain right to be at stanier if like have planned to give dennis taste of what will be like to be master here when im out of way just a father gave taste of one year after discarded raymond be out of way how well remember that somehow raymond be still at cambridge father made hostess host at big party before raymond came down perhaps youve counted on absence at christmas knowing how exhilarating find company of aunt be asking large party with dennis to play host sure havent question be too preposterous to need answer continued will be here for christmas with permission said just to give dennis treat may have alone bit first tonic up for so much pleasure kept writing to when be in capri saying wished be here that be sorry must not be back before went to eton there be sarcastic touch about made laugh violet shook head youre wrong there said there be nothing sarcastic about looked at with sort of malignant pity make feel sick sometimes said with sort of remark suppose dennis thought positive joy to be thrashed by thrashed said do really expect to believe hasnt told that sneered colin that havent wept over for doesnt matter to whether believe not said dennis never said word about have done colin smiled nothing very particular so thrashed be brutal of thank for kind word said wish wouldnt interrupt in middle of sentence didnt thrash for what did for what be be just on occasion like when colin a now be in most fiendish mood that felt sudden pang of compassion for oh poor colin said thats what be matter with isnt what do what be noble art of tu quoque remarked colin rather meaningless art dont action express pretty well fancied shewed fairly frankly to dennis in summer only shewed what youre trying to be said violet will explain that in minute said be saying that gave sincere exposition of hate dennis see hate fact of existence stanier will be when ive gone to hell probably knowledge of will be what constitutes hell for allow will be damnable until then can make pretty damnable for colin took cigarette there more than that said hate love if youre right thanks for hint dennis love im going to kill that not only because abominate because will help to wither denniss soul want to make like must delight in then might even be pleased to know stanier must be be that clear if so might explain what meant when said only shewed what im trying to be looked at a might have looked at sick child very simple said youre trying to hate dennis youre trying to make hate youre acting a if hated youre not succeeding felt that have never known till then so nakedly soul leaped into eye have physical fear of did not seem to matter if struck if killed at moment looked into nethermost pit spirit cried out for horror of reacted on physically knew turned a white a paper that heart fluttered in throat like bird ready to take wing be secondary effect knew that have spoken truly knew also that recognized that for otherwise must not have flamed into icy fire of anger took step towards saw clench fist so that knuckle shewed white on brown hand stand up said be mad that speak to like with violent effort controlled shaking of knee stood in front of with hand hanging defencelessly by side colin im not mad at said drew back arm a if to strike ill give one chance said be sorry if youre going to knock down do so shant tell dennis looked perfectly straight in face waiting for blow then suddenly perceived that defencelessness have beaten youd better go said havent made thing easier for dennis may tell instantly courage have sufficed for surrendered colin nothing to do with said do what like to dont strike through think will hurt most said there be use in saying anything further moved towards door be going back to london to morrow said violet heard nothing more from during day intervened before denniss arrival a knew date of expected to come back day there be still sign from boy have to few day before mother aunt hester came out of door there be windless sunny wintry weather night there be frost bare tree be decked with whiteness of lay thick over lawn grassy slope till sun resolved below on marsh there be spread mantle of dense mist through ray must not penetrate when on third day breeze from east folded up whole plain from edge to edge be dazzling with glistening fall of hoar frost on lake lid of ice shooting out from willow water have already roofed whole surface with promise of skating imminent wind with veiled sun though chillier by sensation than briskness of still clear frost melted frozen floor brought up flock of grey cloud that evening snowfall began for two day night beneath bitter wind fell without intermission lying in thick drift in hollow place giving yew hedge unbroken coat of white then a wind dropped snow ceased sky cleared again great frost black of exceeding sharpness set in once more time very swiftly chilled water of lake be congealed surface be dark like steel transparent a water over lay two day before christmas already bore at willow end dennis frenziedly began hunting for skate there must be mother said if one only look in right place find with broken golf club old croquet mallet ran off to explore suitable region there have be no further talk between about relation with father morning asked if there be news of coming there have be none violet have suggested getting eton friend to stay with then only distantly dennis have answered with seemed to recollection of last holiday oh think wont thanks have said father may come day maynt apart from that have said nothing whatever to violet day of colins absence be so much remission old lady yardley seemed to accept boy a being colin back from school again day seemed to violet like hour of calm lit with pale cold sunshine preceded inconjecturable tempest aunt hester mother arrived that afternoon aunt hester instantly have snow boot unpacked went for walk while light still lingered hate seeing window shuttered lamp lit dear said make feel that be being put in box im too near latter end to waste time now over box if get bit of walk while theyre shutting up box seems pleasant enough when get back to ill be ready for tea too such esquimaux practice of course made appeal to violet brought down from room patience card altar frontal be embroidering for winchester cathedral hoped to have ready by easter of two for immediate employment settled on altar frontal a have vague idea that violet must have great deal to say to other be impossible to talk while be playing patience rather be impossible to play patience if talked have grown shade greyer shade more ladylike shade more inaccessible always did everything slowly dennis will be quite big boy observed have not seen since last year at time yes he grown great deal said violet must be possible that colin be not coming for christmas colin be well asked mr stanier hope so have be away for last fortnight wretch have never even said when will be coming back be pity that must miss denniss holiday said mr stanier violet have sympathetic contribution to give to sentiment mother moistened lip with tip of tongue got dry little cracked in very cold weather have brought wreath for father grave said made entirely from flower in greenhouse gardener be very clever at getting plenty of flower throughout winter violet rummaged mind for ardent rejoinder be always nice said flower be guarantee that spring will come poor thing will wither very quickly when put out in icy air yes dear must feel very remiss hard if did not always put wreath on father grave whenever come to stanier daresay will not be for many more year that will do so violet laughed dear mother what nonsense said why there grandmother who be married before be born play whist still walk in to dinner mind suppose be now completely gone said mr stanier did not recognize at last time be here occasionally mentioned father a if be with still arrival of tea interrupted lugubrious interchange of thought followed by dennis triumphantly clashing pair of skate be screwed on to boot leather of be perished wrinkled like withered fungus theyre old enough said theyre right im going to put on to boot so that theyll be ready in morning found in cupboard upstairs instantly occurred to violet whose skate have be for more than dozen year now there have be no skating at stanier probably last person who have skated on lake be raymond almost certainly skate be for be workmanlike blade screwed on to boot whereas rest of used to shoe with strange antiquated wooden concern skate with key catch invariably came undone raymond have spent winter vacation once at davos violet remembered laughing at when one of skate unclasped slithered across ice somehow with fantastic disquiet hated idea of dennis using raymonds skate arent too big for asked lord yes said dennis theyre better than nothing hefty skate too wonder whose be mr stanier put small saccharine lozenge into tea lake have not borne for many year said think used to have harder winter once than have now last year bore ah dear yes return of aunt hester from tramp in snow be welcome advent professed vastly refreshed have very pretty colour in check nothing like frosty air for giving appetite said say that microbe get killed in though for part never believed much in microbe everythings microbe nowadays if youve got pain in stomach from eating what shouldnt microbe if covet neighbour wife theyll make out to be microbe soon give good strong cup of tea violet dear hope be standing whats that youre working at shawl for cold evening mr stanier drew in breath with sound of shocked sipping hester altar cloth for winchester cathedral said well couldnt see pattern looked to like shawl whens that wretch colin coming back thought must find here ive not heard word from said violet ive be expecting for day well will have to flirt with dennis till come said aunt hester rather said dennis there telephone ringing will go see what be dennis ran into hall leaving skate be transferring to own boot on floor yes who be asked there be moment silence hullo be that dennis asked father voice yes father well tell to send down to station to meet train im coming by oh ripping said dennis ill tell colin rang off again without word colins train be very late did not get up to house till be half way through dinner came in a be be clearly in best of spirit dont get up anybody said violet darling how go aunt hester aunt margaret granny awful journey always cut off heating apparatus when more than usually cold dennis waited for greeting there be none for colin ignored altogether a if have not be present to others doubt in intentional contrast be extraordinarily cordial a spoke now to one now to with affection for violet with extravagant compliment for aunt hester sympathetic enquiry about girl friendly society for aunt margaret who be pillar of admirable institution violet saw eye a flitted by dennis pause on boy face from time to time with look peeped out like lizard from crevice whisked in again then for first time spoke to tipsy school friend coming christmas dennis said word be beauty treated to in summer dennis raised eye to father even a met violet saw look pop out again instantly sheathing in iron of colins voice father havent asked anybody holiday said quietly colin paid more attention to till woman got up to leave table then watched to see what dennis must do dennis stood by door have opened not knowing whether father expected to go with others stay hesitation be enough perhaps youd kindly shut that door said can leave on whichever side of like dennis shut came back to table looking out for drink suppose said colin rising ring bell when youve finished im going into other room dennis went to door again to open for father followed colin sat up late that night thinking of dennis of little else thought of a always did now a survivor supplanter who in probability must rule at stanier for twenty year after be dead unless lingered on like own grandmother till fire of life have grown cold then possibly might out live son possibly there might be enough heat in grey ember to chuckle at for must sooner be last of race than be succeeded by dennis who must come after wondered in case knew there be small homestead in marsh just outside property where there lived farmer called stanier with brood of scarecrow child perhaps must establish claim there must be romantic sequel to century of direct line ever increasing prosperity must sooner have reigning here than dennis of course there be chance leaven of evil might yet work in boy for be young still turn sour that sweet milk of love with dripped meant to make more experiment with regard to dennis must come to because loved evil must only struggle against abhor if be forced to besides colin knew must not do must bully ill treat striving to kill love in ultimate direct initiative be beyond must wish dead must wish corrupted must not take on actual sacrifice be own fault have allowed dennis to enter heart where one else have ever be now with vigour of evil soul be a much a must do to stop advance never must allow love be stronger than must fight till lay bleeding helpless at foot have grown cold in room fancied there be draught from door led into corridor to now disused chapel a tried door found shut notion came to to visit chapel where have not be since last easter fetched key turned up light must be christmas eve to morrow remembered last year have held midnight mass there sacring bell have rung simultaneously with peal from church near by be bitter to night in chapel shivered a stood there in air there still hung faint stale odour of incense faint too hardly to be recalled be thrill of satisfied evil with once have knelt there there be step off vincenzo have rolled when slavering ecstasy in face be struck from by mortal terror how horrible to think that perhaps have seen god at moment poor vincenzo colin have sneering smile at thought of god did not come to unless permitted for otherwise there be such thing a free will vincenzo must have have weak spot somewhere must have loved somebody for own sake that perhaps gave permit must be careful then went back into silent house upstairs saw that denniss door be ajar that there be light within morning brought such deplorable disaster a thaw soon after breakfast dennis came into gallery with skate in hand colin be by fire looking at paper glanced up at skating said yes lake bear said dennis colin looked at rusty skate on boot be carrying where did get asked found in cupboard said dennis be on pair of very old boot so took off put on mine flashed through colins mind that be raymonds have meant to stop dennis skating just for mere sake of spoiling enjoyment now rather liked idea of doing so well dont go out through here said let in cold air go round by hall perhaps ill come presently colin put paper down on just morning a clear sunny after night hard frost have raymond gone down alone to lake have strolled after in time to see white face already blue lipped rise out of hole in broken ice where lake lay deepest sink again before eye a leaned on parapet by sluice asked if be not rather cold ice be always treacherous near where stream came out of lake inward certainty took possession of preposterous though such coincidence must be found believing that dennis be now gaily tramping over hard frozen snow to death that must be there to see out of window saw boy running down white slope beyond yew hedge with great coat on reached nearly to heel breath smoking in bitter air three minute later be walking down over same slope dennis have gone into bathing shed to put on skate presently when got warm must divest of great coat be too cold for yet besides must make fall softer tried edge of lake found firm a floor beneath soon extended field of manuvres colin ring of skate a came down to lake did not go to bathing shed kept straight on along retaining bank hidden from denniss view by rhododendron felt be going to happen a expected chain of coincidence be already strong for be not dennis alone on virgin ice just a raymond have be be not marvellous that wearing skate raymond have worn there must be no more struggle to hate boy more looking on a survivor supplanter thing did not go well with who crossed colin who shuddered with nightmare at approach of protector there came sudden crack sharp a rifle shot from lake heard splash open gap in rhododendron bush where sluice gate stood be now only few yard in front of ran there ten twelve yard from bank where water be deepest there be jagged hole in ice denniss cap floated on bubbling water next moment rose only just face thrown back appeared above water for coat heavily weighted eye be staring with fright mouth already blue with cold saw colin father called now in moment colin must be rid of supplanter have happened without plan effort of have only got to stop still for few second fill mind with image of hate hated dennis smiled to a repeated that while met boy eye dennis still looked at have clutched rim of broken ice in one hand broke a tried to raise still struggling head sank little lower in water now covered chin mouth then with flood bore opposition way knowledge burst on colin that loved already perhaps be too late knew well too that be risking own life to jump into deep water paralyzingly cold swim out to knew that life be sweet believed that death must be to open door through must go into outer darkness of damnation swiftly tore off coat for arm must have to be strong for two of hold on old boy shouted well have out in jiffy dont be frightened be sweet word to dennis sweeter yet to who spoke colin vaulted over parapet of sluice breaking hole in ice before have come to surface be striking out for boy did not know whether water be hot cold

to counter that always slipped under guard stabbed be forced to admit to for wound made bled instinctively covered from others even a from dennis to whom moment after danger be over have addressed

warm caressing weather borrowed from may time so mild sunny be tree be bursting into early bud sallow be hung with catkin primrose be bloom over marsh ewe be with young shepherd there remembered so early lambing season one more fruitful colin have spent month on beloved island recuperating very successfully after illness then one day after week of london that longing for stanier overcame drove down alone with plan to stay there a long a be content must find there only grandmother now kept to room entirely more preposterous rubber of whist must be demanded in evening after have played two rubber night for seventy year thought colin tried to work out portentous sum of total on arrival nurse came down to tell that be mysteriously aware seemed that be coming for kept restlessly muttering to colin will be here soon perhaps must be quieted by sight of so rather grudgingly for must surely be sheer waste of time went up to see there lay in bed pallid immobile with pearl round neck looked at with disconcerting unwinking gaze behind there seemed to lie frozen consciousness knowledge be still repeating even while gazed at colin will be here soon suddenly stopped gave that smile looked a if be blurred reflection of something very far away muttered more surely spell of stanier thought colin a left that nameless magic of legend gift have so penetrated now when ultimate mist thickened about be last illumination dimly piercing cold shadow shone on still have consciousness of a inheritor of remained last link now wearing so thin of connection with visible world must imagine that spell of stanier be strong must be so still thought a closed dying eye on splendour doom long way off seemed on young morning of spring have started early from town day be yet at noon when arrived reserving for long outing after lunch wandered about house soaking in inhaling association went into violet room went into room where raymonds dead body have lain thought of fortunate morning brought inheritance denniss room passed without entering twitch of exasperation took at thought of dennis be forever checking that truancy of mind overhauling bringing back when went on illicit excursion must belong anyhow before saw boy for in easter holiday must be in italy again assuredly dennis must not accompany went down broad staircase into hall with portrait of old colin facing with parchment of legendary contract have made let into frame o bonum commercium thought picture smiled back at across prosperous century near by be smoking room that too be place where dead have lain recalled how good unsuspecting doctor martin have moved remains of vincenzo there then came long gallery with sunshine pouring in outside terrace yew hedge where beneath summer night violet have said loved there have walked with pamela too that silly pamela might have be alive to day young still if have only not be so reckless a to love never know into what dangerous place love might lead into depth of unsubstantial air depth of icy water there none too soon for appetite door of dining room be opened new valet whom have brought from italy told that be served boy be rather like nino drove out after lunch in little two seater went lightly over road in marsh rough with scouring of winter storm out past golf link along sandy road towards lydd intended to walk home across marsh presently got out for tramp dyke be full of water be always possible to find way over footbridge culvert might be devious zig zag must progress in required direction how more pleasantly after grime of london must pas couple of hour than by strolling through pasture bright with young growth of spring populous with anxious ewe new born lamb there be rye on edge of plain above wood of stanier with glimpse of house among must be general line with afternoon before must strike romney road before dusk follow along to outskirt of town where car must be waiting for have be walking for hour with sunlight warm on lark carolling in lucent air when brightness began to grow dim looking up saw that sky be veiled with mist through sun peered whitely little breeze have sprung up from seaward there be drifting in fog off channel where already siren be hooting warmth of day have drawn up much moisture from marsh into air now in chill of veiled sun be rapidly condensing into one of thick white mist while stanier on hill still basked in sunshine enveloped lower ground be annoying for have still mile to go before struck road hurried on to cover ground a quickly a must before have gone half distance mist thickened to so dense opacity that be impossible to see more than yard two ahead before closed down on have seen gate hundred yard in front be clearly outlet from pasture in direction of rye walked a thought straight towards presently came to stop instead of there being gate in front of there be broad dyke followed along to left seemed to run on indefinitely retracing step tried other direction brought to gate through passed orientating from started off afresh now have visible mark to guide for encompassing mist have closed white wall impenetrably round before long in baffling dimness knew have lost bearing altogether whether rye be to left right of straight ahead have idea must just hope to find gate footbridge across dyke till came to road searching blindfold for be growing dark daylight of clear air above fog be fading have passed ten minute before shepherd hut put up for lambing now determined to retrace step to see if there be anyone there from whom must get guidance for at season of year farmer shepherd often sat up all night a once old colin have done a boy for need of midwifery now must not find hut giving up search a vain thought that must again retrace step of fruitless exploration push on a best might then with sudden springing up of hope saw gate close ahead of when came to found familiar in bewildering manner staple be stiff just a be that of last gate have passed through on lowest bar of be caught piece of white sheep wool have noticed before must have come round in circle to point from have started when mist grew thick be very uncomfortable paused wondering what to do next if must not find way across mile of pasture must be mere folly to attempt to go back on course have come must have be infinitely better to have gone into shepherd hut when have chance waited for mist to lift now wisest thing must be to try again to find way back there for be somewhere close to gate to have inadvertently returned set off now with clearer recollection of bearing met with better success presently found hut again there be one there there be door to at rate there be roof to cover wooden wall for shelter inside there be pile of straw dry plentiful into must burrow for warmth while waited moisture of mist be thick on clothes like dew on fleece face hand be chilled wet with long walk have tired relief of finding shelter rest be great sat down on straw made a comfortable a must what time be have idea for be without match be now so dark that must not see watch doorless entrance be glimmering greyness against blackness of interior wondered whether even if mist cleared must find way home before morning perhaps there be moon time alone must show that thought began to stray in other direction be odd adventure just so have old colin when shepherd boy passed night in such hut a probably within few hundred yard of where now sat that certainly have be no unfortunate experience for for on night splendid fortune prosperity of house of now be head have be founded health wealth honour that heart desired have be granted to ancestor on night of legend into inheritance of have entered by love of evil hate of love then thought of dennis came up like bubble to surface of mind dennis whom hated have tried to corrupt who be heir to splendour colin be getting drowsy in warmth of straw bed for moment a token of that thought heard denniss voice roused again sleep be most reasonable manner of passing hour of waiting might be long be certainly better than thinking about dennis thicker thicker like mist outside dusk of sleep darkened round slept soundly dreamlessly woke after interval of length of have idea into full possession of faculty so that have puzzled bewilderment a to where be how have come here waking consciousness dovetailed precisely into have preceded sleep probably have slept long for woke alert refreshed warm comfortable under straw that have pulled over close on heel of waking there came conviction that be not alone here have gone to sleep alone far away from haunt of men in isolation of mist while slept someone have come sat up turning looked towards blank doorway be still faintly visible dusky oblong in blackness now framed figure a of man stood there in entry shepherd be who like sought shelter hullo who be said colin have lost way be sheltering here till mist clear lord yardley from stanier there be silence then very quietly voice spoke know who be said colin felt breath catch in throat pulse beat there be not voice of shepherd come here for lambing for shelter fantastic notion flashed into head here be sleeping in remote hut in marsh at lambing time even a old colin have done asked whether renewal re enactment of legend be at hand idea scarcely seemed strange so intimately did belief in legend beat in blood be shepherd who spoke that shape in doorway seemed to rather larger than have be at first perhaps have moved silent step nearer have outlined little more clearly now shape of shoulder head be more sharply defined round head there be faint luminousness like halo moonlight cast round man shadow on grass in silence followed colin asked whether be still asleep whether whole adventure be dream whether must presently wake up find in bed at stanier then voice spoke again knew that whether dreamed whether indeed be awake substance of thing unseen be in manifestation why did save dennis asked quiet voice question be utterly unexpected whoever be have claim to be answered lord benefactor if be knew that soul be set on evil hate what right have other power in heaven earth in dark place to question why answered at did not know voice seemed to take upon to do so saved dennis said just simply because chose to be own business will be free might easily have be drowned said voice did consider knew be taking that risk said colin did consider what doom awaited yes then why did save dennis colin began to catch glimpse of purport of question nothing determined must make give answer that felt be required of besides such answer told be not true have be guilty at most of momentary weakness saved tell said because chose to be only son be not reasonable must wish to live continue line be definitely uneasy now uneasiness irritated into flippancy perhaps be bachelor said so cant be expected to understand in case dont know what right have to ask have other answer for once more there be silence then quiet voice spoke again why did save dennis asked question be beginning to frighten felt a if be on rack that time question came lever be pulled cog clicked rope round wrist ankle be getting more taut must just feel strain of must presently increase why did save dennis asked voice again time colin clenched teeth torture might be in store must never answer that there be actual pain yet only anticipation of surely year have passed since found way through mist into shed must not only have be last evening a dusk of present night began to fall that have come here covered up in straw be on very spot that let brother raymond drown said voice why did let raymond drown without effort to save for moment relieved tension because hated raymond said colin because stood between inheritance hate dennis too will not inherit be yours yes hate dennis said colin of course tried to corrupt tried to make miserable tried to kill love for be agreed on then hate dennis voice be silent again figure surely have moved closer for now towered above faint luminousness round head be brighter must see boarding of hut grey glimmer of straw where sat then again voice spoke colin knew what be about to say why did save dennis asked at that pain began hot shooting stab of agony must bear worse than moment now seemed to have quality have never possessed before second must hear watch ticking out be not long exactly be eternal tension relaxed again hated nino said voice when turned back on wickedness let die did not hate nino yes hated nino then said colin hated pamela mocked drove to death be never sorry amused did not hate pamela yes hated pamela said hate violet hate whole world hate love have be squandered on do not hate love yes hate love again came terrible pause bit lip tried to brace muscle against wrench be coming why did save dennis came question rope be tight now pull made gasp cry out in god name who be that torture screamed will know presently when have broken colin clenched hand tight still utterly steadfast untamed dont imagine youll do that said if thats what expect youre wasting time again silence of eternity fell do believe in god colin stanier said voice yes said know do hate god with heart yes said figure receded little perhaps thought now that have made final complete repudiation surely included else torture be over for cruel wrench of repeated question came more sank back utterly exhausted on straw bed sleep such anodyne to sensation came over then once more came to alert wholly awake outside mist have cleared must see through empty door space pasture covered with thick dew few scattered sheep with lamb beside must be close on dawn for in east there be long line of cloud flushed red with sun have not yet risen on earth for moment with pang of exquisite relief thought be alone that inquisition of night be over how terribly real dream must be dennis have known that when woke from nightmare threw into father arm for protection dream even though now be awake have still that quality of eternity about sat up then saw that figure be by once more close to now be still shadow dark undecipherable in spite of flushed twilight of coming day why did save dennis asked torture shot through again more poignant than ever to racked spirit bowed head felt drop of agony grow thick on forehead still made answer raised eye a if in obedience to command saw line of cloud red in dawn voice spoke see where christ blood stream in firmament one drop must save soul must never call on colin because hate must not answer so rending be torture waited writhing stiffened against what be coming why did save dennis asked voice at that full fierceness of mortal agony be let loose on that agony be eternal have existed before ever time began evil of that have done utter depravity of soul with lust for hate hate of love be torn wrenched by inflexible power of have made so lightly vault over parapet of sluice strike out across icy water towards dennis with force with will resisted force faded will faltered collapsed with wail of pain surrendered saved because loved cried give in devil from pit for christ sake dont torture more rending agony in writhed ceased strain relaxed blinded with sweat tear looked at figure stood close to now still be no more than shadow to who be sobbed why have tortured like be lord whom have served so well who be at that shadow brightened into beam dimmed line of morning filled hut with radiance on must not look once more for last time quiet voice spoke be love said end
