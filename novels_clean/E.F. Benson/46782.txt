ahead with net wound round shoulder be to begin evening work with spear later when moon be up to sail across far side of bay where must use sweep net in willow water where bottom be sandy shelving nearer shore of bay be rocky descending rapidly into deep water be place for netting nicholas however got into boat in order to arrange net dispose lead in what considered more satisfactory manner leaving boy to do spearing alone mitsos took off linen trouser fastening shirt round waist with leather belt then slung creel bag round neck putting half handful of resin into ladle set light to took spear in right hand rolling up sleeve to shoulder stepped into sea held flare close to surface so that light showed clearly on bottom of willow water luminous lure for fish spear held ready to bring down if saw anything be scene rembrandt must have painted with hand of love moon be not yet risen in clear starlight edge of serrated hill be sharply etched against sky water of bay just curdled by wind lay vast sombre across to farther shore light from resin flare vaguely showed line of boat in nicholas be preparing net be dim except mitsos figure few foot of glittering flame scribbled water round highest light be cast on brown down bent face on left arm bared to shoulder stood out a clear cut a cameo against darkness behind a moved water lapped about knee be stirred into fire crested ripple sea be slightly phosphorescent trail be palely luminous like milky way now again with sudden splendid motion down went poised spear with splashing cluck into sea must draw up again sometimes with red mullet sometimes with thin brill flapping struggling on point more rarely missed aim looked up at nicholas smiling showing white teeth at end of hour latter have finished fresh leading of net a stiffer breeze have awoke ruffling surface of water making difficult to see fish distinctly started to sail across bay mitsos waded out to boat trouser shoe in hand set big brown sail giving vigorous shove two with oar sent boat round so that caught wind in moment heeled over without stirring then whisper of moving came sibilantly from forefoot gathering speed glided on across dark water nicholas have taken rudder mitsos sat down beside eight mullet dozen other fish said that be bad catch for hour put head for under point uncle nicholas do see there be house with light burning little above see will take nearly hour with wind well what be will tell of new story uncle nicholas will keep story for when go home will take twice a long to get back against wind be long story for nearly hour sailed on in comparative silence wind have freshened from over hill towards tripoli there came blinking flash of summer lightning lamp in house above point to be steering have be put out in half darkness of summer night promontory be clearly visible towards east hill be blocked out with strange intensity of blackness for moon be on point of rising behind deep velvet blue of zenith have turned to dove color now for fishing mitsos said nicholas a drew near to shore can run boat in behind promontory yes there be four foot of water right up to land just there shore be steep will take in sail there be need a soon a pas corner will be dead calm nicholas put helm hard to port a soon a be opposite little point next moment sail flapped like wounded bird against mast ran up to rock mitsos jumped out tied boat up lifted net on shore made way round wooded headland to little bay be to fish here shore be sandy shelving sprinkled with clump of succulent seaweed grew up from rock below favorite feeding ground a mitsos knew for mullet sole nicholas have put on constantine long fishing boot reaching up to hip before left boat mitsos a before merely taking off shoe trouser net be twenty five yard long mitsos taking one end into hand stepped into water at right angle to shore waded out till net be taut between then nicholas followed a soon a latter be ten yard from land moved shorewards up little bay lay in front of getting gradually nearer to other a approached beach till when be within five six yard of land be walking together net trailing in great bagging oval behind resistance of water dragging of lead along bottom be to be hoped spoil enclosed made small weight be quarter of hour so before got in moon have risen be easy to see silvery glitter of fish a lay fluttering in dark mesh of net flat brown sol however required more careful search sound of flapping rather than eye led to discovery fished for hour two with only moderate success until mitsos proposed must try little farther down coast where shoal of certain fish a small a whitebait a sweet grazed watery pasture here depth be somewhat greater before going in mitsos divested of shirt leaving on rock went in completely naked nicholas who have put entirely under direction waited in willower water near shore till boy have waded out to where water covered to waist then a before moved in converging line towards shore have approached to within about twenty yard of beach within about five yard of other when mitsos stopped pointed back upper edge of net fitted at interval with cork to keep floating be visible on bright surface of sea trailing in irregular oval inside oval moonlit water be strangely agitated unquiet quivering like jarred metal plate from moment to moment little silvery speck must glitter on look said to nicholas little fish be there must be a quick a can sometimes if shoal begin jumping will jump out bending forward to get whole weight into work pushed forward towards land moonlight fell full on body dripping glistening from waist downwards with salt water threw straining muscle line spine chord behind shoulder blade painter love into strong light shadow a pulled against weight of dragging net already water came only to knee catch be imminent when suddenly from net there came rustle splash like myriad little pebble being thrown into sea turned round just in time to see whole shoal glistened like silver sheet rise drop into water outside little turk said angrily be gone better to pull net in look said nicholas part only may have leaped shook head when go like be of said mitsos be quite right there be stray fish two still in net so few that be hardly worth picking out will do for to night wo said have fished best place nicholas assenting lay down rolled over in warm dry sand once twice then standing up brushed wet stuff off body then spreading net out on rock higher up on beach mitsos went off to fetch shirt nicholas employed in picking up few stray fish put into creel then rolling up net walked back to boat chapter iii story of brigand wind have taken straight across bay still blew freshening from same quarter be dead against must have to make two long tack to get home first right across to island in middle of bay second back again to head of a soon a be well off on outward tack mitsos went to stern of boat sat

known suspected among turk that movement of friendly sort be on foot among have several time happened before now that attack have be made upon countryman who be waylaid stopped in solitary mountain path by band of turkish soldier be questioned about suspected design of nation on subject for most part be entirely ignorant a plan of leader be at present sparingly known interview often ended with shot dangling body through incredible indolence laziness of turk while feared suspected what be going on contented with stopping questioning traveller whom chanced on made increase in local garrison kept watch upon road at night nicholas of course knew when a now be making long journey into disaffected part of country where presence must at once have aroused suspicion indeed a have told mitsos there have be price put on head twenty year ago travelled by night reaching village where be to stay before daybreak not moving again till after dark accordingly mitsos set off after sunset across plain towards corinth main road led through argo avoided keeping well to right of river bed horse be fresh stepped out at amble covered ground nearly a quickly a trot by ten o'clock moon be swung high in bare heaven saw in front of blot of huddled house in white light village of phyctia again made detour to right in order to avoid for garrison of turk be stationed there turning off mile before outlying farm began so a not even to run risk of awakening dog way lay close under wall of ancient mycenae where be reported that antique treasure of curious gold have lately be found a be in plenty of time to reach nemea by midnight nicholas halted here for few minute mitsos looked wonderingly at great wall of citadel say king of greece be buried here little mitsos said perhaps beard will scarce be grown before there be king of greece once more beyond mycenae followed mountain path leading through wood joined few mile farther up main road from corinth to argo a be now late way be quiet nicholas saw reason for not taking road a soon a struck wound way up along steep narrow path towards moon have cleared top of mount elia behind moon of midsummer southern night shone with great light a clear a running water turning everything to ebony gleaming cream colored ivory mitsos be riding first more than half asleep letting pony pick own way among big stone bowlder strewed rough path when suddenly shied violently nearly unseating wheeled sheer round woke with start grasped at rope bridle have tied to wooden pommel on saddle board to check be pony have shied too be first to head round again mitsos who have be carried past dismounted led pony trembling restive up to other nicholas have dismounted too be standing at point where bridle path led into main road when mitsos came up what did shy at mitsos began when suddenly saw that stopped word on tongue from tree at juncture of path in full white blaze of moonlight hung figure of man arm be dropped limply by side foot dangled two foot from ground on shoulder be deep gash speaking of struggle before be secured blood in black clot be sprinkled on front of white linen tunic above strangling line went round neck muscle be thick swollen gland of throat congested into monstrous lump nicholas only stopped space of deep drawn breath then throwing bridle to mitsos drew knife cut rope two horse shied so violently a nicholas staggered forward with murdered burden mitsos unable to hold let go of own clung with hand to bridle of nicholas horse while own animal clattered off down path homeward then soothing terror from other led past into main road where tied up to tree twenty yard on returned to where nicholas be kneeling over body looked up spoke with deadly calm be too late said be quite dead suddenly after hot blooded warm hearted nature of race strong man who have lived life with blood death murder to be companion of day night burst into tear mitsos be awed silent do know uncle nicholas asked at length know be one of unhappy race whom brood of devil oppresses treat a must not treat dog mitsos said with gesture of fire swear that will never forget look here look here cried look how have made of offence to light look how killed by disgraceful death why for reason because be greek look at face force to look at lip be purple eye a dead a grape start from head be killed like dog if catch alone in such place will do same to to whose only offence be a poor burden have be that be greek look at neck swollen in death struggle do know how accursed men killed katzantones brother beat to death with wooden hammer sparing head only so that might live longer katzantones be ill weak cried out with pain yorgi a lay on ground with arm leg ankle hand broken lying out of semblance of man only laughed told must not kill fly with such puny blow boy suddenly turned away enough enough said wish to look be too horrible why do make more frightful to nicholas did not seem to hear what said went on in sort of savage frenzy look look tell cried then swear in name of god remembering also what told of wife child that will have pity on race have done on man woman child not even on poor weak woman for be mother of monster who do thing be work of men bear outrage infamous lust sin of city god destroyed be silent moment then spoke more calmly so swear mitsos in name of god mitsos with quivering lip of horror suddenly steeled looked at dead thing swore now said nicholas take hold of foot will give what burial can stay wait moment tore off piece of man tunic dipping finger in blood still be wet on shoulder wrote in turkish word revenge fastened to end of rope still dangled from tree then mitsos took body yard distant into copse lined road tearing up brushwood gave covering on laid stone until be completely concealed defended against preying creature of mountain then nicholas bared head god forgive sin said impute double of to murderer ah god cried voice rose to yell grant may kill kill kill soul leave to thee most just most terrible went to where nicholas horse be tied up hearing other have bolted made mitsos mount a must have to walk back went on foot be in silence that climbed pas in hour came to junction of two road from nemea corinth nicholas told nephew to go farther be safer must go alone here said be already late will have to walk waste time about getting back to plain night be short paused for moment looking affectionately at boy thus be baptized in blood said then paused moistened lip great deal may depend on little one went on have watched growing up be growing up a must have grow distrust everything everybody except perhaps father be afraid of nothing while suspect everything at same time want many will want so take care put hand on shoulder will be back in year six month perhaps to morrow perhaps never that doe not concern father will always tell what to do now good bye kissed on cheek mounted horse rode off never looking behind mitsos stopped still for moment looking after then turned to go home five minute more brought nicholas to edge of village where three men whom demetri have sent be waiting for one of be greek servant who held nicholas horse while dismounted changed albanian costume for turkish dress others be leader of local movement against turk be going with to corinth like nicholas spoke turkish nicholas dressed quickly then stopped for moment irresolute then take horse on said to servant will go on foot awhile mitsos meantime be walking quickly along road back towards argo must scarcely acknowledge to how very much disliked thought of taking bridle path through wood for recollection retained of end of rope dangling from tree with fragment of tunic fluttering in breeze that heap of white stone glimmering among bush be too vivid for liking even pony must have be companionable pony a hoped be near home by time once twice thought heard movement whispered rustling in bush made heart beat rather quicker than wont ordinarily must not have noticed such thing scene at crossroad still twanged string of horror within however road must be trod keeping eye steadily averted for like race held ghost in accredited horror marched with show of courage past spot began making way down rough bridle path thin skein of cloud have risen from sea moon be travelling swiftly through casting only diffused aqueous light path with glimmering white stone of cobbling showed clearly enough there be fear of missing way about couple of hundred yard down path heard noise made heart spring suddenly into throat stay there poised for moment giving little cracking sound at beat sound needed not interpretation two men if not three be running down main road have just left instantly have left path striking into bush at side moved quickly up hill again hoping to turn off scent a came nearer stopped still crouching in bush though be a knew very indifferently concealed dared not go farther among tree for fear that sound of step crackling among dry brushwood must lead to remembering nicholas lesson in art of keeping still waited pursuer if pursuer be seemed to go more slowly a turned into path have just left soon caught sight of through tree trunk there be two of saw be turk a came nearer must hear speaking together in low tone then one ran off down path in order so supposed to see whether be still on ahead mitsos drew long breath there be only one to be reckoned with now stealing out of bush where have be crouching moved a quietly a must farther into cover twig cracking with sharp report under foot revealed hiding man who have waited in path shouted out to other next moment be in pursuit a pushed through tree seemed to stretch out finger to clutch mitsos felt in belt for knife always carried with to wondering dismay found have gone never in life must remember being without be season to waste time knowing that only chance lay in running plunged along through bush in order to get back to path match speed against pursuer be close behind in jumping trying to jump small thicket closed path caught foot fell then came cold fear with clutch before have time to recover have seized once let out with right hand at face of one of men who just avoided blow then wrist be seized whipped cord round leg tied hand behind back carried off straight to tree from end of rope ghastly legend be still hanging third turk be sitting there on ground in shadow smoking a others came up said word to in turkish mitsos did not understand then one of captor turned to speaking in greek tell where nicholas vidalis be said will let go silence know who be be mitsos codones son of constantine from nauplia be uncle mitsos looked up be so have not seen for year more than year said one of men laughed tell where be said will let go for information for be seen with yesterday in nauplia held out handful of piastre time mitsos laughed though laughing be not in thought sound be strange to own ear be lie said have not be at nauplia for year a for piastre if think be telling lie do suppose must speak differently for sake of be damned to piastre laughed again will give one minute said other then will hang from tree if tell one of countryman see have cut rope there will be enough for tall boy like strolled away towards where third man be sitting leaving there bound perhaps end of rope might help to speak said one third man shook head what mitsos thought of during few second never clearly knew a far a wished for anything wished to be quick noticed that edge of moon be free of cloud again must soon be lighter felt breeze come up from east fluttered rag of tunic hanging from rope once small bird clucking frightened flew out of thicket near then two men came up pulled under tree end of piece of tunic flapped against forehead untied rope one made noose in while other turned back collar of coat then rope be passed round throat tightened till felt knot behind just where hair grows short on neck one more chance said man will tell mitsos have shut eye clinched teeth to help not to speak for moment waited quite still then up with said man waited for choking tension of rope still silent still with clinched teeth eyelid instead of that felt two hand on shoulder finger at knot behind opened eye third man who have be silent be standing in front of mitsos said great little mitsos for moment world spun dizzily round half fell half staggered against nicholas said yes mitsos will forgive ought to have be certain of indeed in heart be wanted to test to full to put fear of death before for be needful must give convincing proof to others poor boy tremble so be necessary believe by virgin mitsos if have hit one hundredth part of second sooner one of men must have gone home with nose fewer teeth hit straight from shoulder with weight in fist that double made up hill be splendid mitsos speak to boy pale trembling have sunk down on ground with bent head said nothing here spirit said nicholas made mitsos drink sat down by with almost womanly tenderness be stroking hair be a firm a rock said when stood there saw muscle of jaw clinch mitsos to whom spirit be new thing recovered quickly with little choking be frightened at moment said be only frightened before when knew be caught then a boyish spirit began to reassert did did behave right uncle nicholas wish to see better behavior be even a father told that be fit for keeping of secret mitsos flushed with pleasure then mind if have made think that though by virgin stomach be cold if have have knife there must have be blood let can not think how lost nicholas laughed here be said be even who took away from while be dozing a rode thought might be dangerous in barbarous young hand mitsos put back in belt be ready now will start off again nicholas rose too will come with a far a plain then road be forward piastre be poor trick eh very poor indeed thought said mitsos grinning uncle nephew walked on together other two men strolled more slowly after nicholas must have shouted aloud for joy have found what have sought with such fastidiousness one whom must trust unreservedly over whom have influence to do justice cruelty of what have done made stomach turn against be associated with men who rightly mistrusted everybody except on convincing proof of trustworthiness mitsos have stood severest test must be devised without flinching be one of ten thousand at end of wood parted mitsos ' nerve have come back to knowledge that have won nicholas trust combined with fascination man exercised over quite overscored grudge might have felt for nicholas last word to be word to be remembered now good bye said have behaved in way scarce dared to hope must though think believed must have be through man test test of strong faithful man others will soon know of know to be trustworthy to uttermost greece will be revenged will be among foremost of avenger so nicholas went way northward mitsos towards home just a earliest streak of dawn lit sky reached father house truant pony be standing by way side cropping dew drenched grass chapter v mitsos pick cherry for maria at summer passed quietly though from other part of country came fresh tale of intolerable taxation cruelty outrage hideous beyond belief argive district be exceptionally lucky in having for governor man who saw that be possible to overstep mark even in dealing with infidel dog partly also nicholas visit injunction to leading greek to keep quiet hint that must not need to keep quiet long produced certain effect a also did exhortation delivered by father andrea in spoke of blessing of peace with ferocious tranquillity left loop hole for misconstruction july august be tale of scorched burning day vine be doing well heat only served to ripen sooner in year when summer month have be cold unseasonable grape must not swell to full ripeness till latter day of october thus there be danger of first autumn storm wrecking maturing crop year thanks to heat there be doubt that must be ripe for gathering by third week in september humanly speaking fine grape harvest be assured certain change have come over mitsos since event of night recorded in last chapter suddenly seemed to have awoke to sense of budding manhood cat much to sedately minded creature satisfaction be allowed to shape soft padded basking life a pleased used to go out in dewiness of dawn while be still scarce light to try for shot at hare came down from hill at night to feed in vineyard at evening again must lie in wait near spring below mount elia to shoot roe when came to water during day there be mark for gun for game went high away among hill to avoid broiling heat of plain stayed in cover of pine wood upon mountain side where growth be too thick for shooting where cracking twig must ever advertise footstep however stealthy sudden violent wind of summer month have set in sailing gave day long occupation made business to know birth hour of land breeze length of dead calm follows hour when sea breeze again winnow windless heaven to read sign of thread like streamer in upper air mean strong breeze vibration on sea horizon like trembling of steel spring mean heat calm soft feathered cloud with dim blurred outline tell of moisture in air will fall hour after sunset in fine warm needle pointed rain boat might often be seen scudding across bay into water of gulf outside skirting round promontory running up into creek inlet until a nicholas have told must do got to know shape of land a knew shape of own head above must practise beating out to sea in teeth of sea breeze running out to given point in a few tack a possible then when sea breeze died away must put into inlet fish for little sleep curled up in bottom of boat awake with awakening of land breeze run back again close hauled past nauplia up to side of bay where beached boat in long hour alone on sea must sit in stern when boat be steady on two mile tack thinking intently of new life for be preparing though nicholas story tale of oppression outrage with mouth be full made personal to longing for vengeance on bestial breed be nicholas who be inspirer indignation be scarce more than image in mirror of nicholas uncle have long be acquiring that domination man can have for boy main desire resolve of mind be to obey nicholas order might lay on resolve to obey be rapidly becoming instinct over mastering unique father far from making objection to spending time in sailing shooting encouraged thereto for nicholas have bade hire labor whenever wanted lad in mitsos ' place saying that club at athens have authorized to make payment for such thing mitsos in fact have definitely entered into service of country be only right that father must be compensated for loss of hand during month there be little farm work to be done early in july constantine have put up little reed built shed to overlook vineyard there spent most of day scaring away bird came to eat grape playing with string of polished bead passed to fro between hand now then stopping to sling pebble at bird saw settling in vine sparrow be greatest enemy for must fly over in flock of eighty hundred settle in different part of vineyard when cleared one quarter turned to clear first covey must be back renewing depredation on grape have almost exaggerated repugnance in taking fund of club unless be absolutely necessary to hire extra hand until last week before harvest managed alone then for grape be tight skinned juicy single bird holding on to bunch with claw feeding indiscriminately from grape must spoil hundredfold of what ate hired boy from nauplia erected shed fifty yard off there must sit from sunrise to sunset at sunset mitsos returned brown fresh with song from sea with black hair drying back into crisp curl after evening bathe enormous appetite constantine sat together till about nine then mitsos must go off to cafe following nicholas instruction play card draught ever pricking attentive ear when comment on turk be on board nicholas direction however that there must be talking of great matter be being obeyed too implicitly for mitsos to pick up much acquired great skill at game of draught even being able to play three game at time one evening just before vintage began returned earlier than usual with frown on face father be sitting on veranda not expecting yet have heard said mitsos what turk have in hand about vintage about vintage instead of paying one tenth to tax collector be to pay one seventh instead of paying in grape pay in wine one seventh be impossible be true where did hear in last hour at cafe in square be clacking swearing right left soldier be patrolling street constantine got up must go then said be

black head broken will keep for worthier cause constantine hurried off caught father andrea up before entered town father said can stop for will listen to remember what nicholas said father andrea nodded heard there be loud talk blow in town be on road for reason nicholas be right must pay extra tax for pint of wine pay will exact gallon of blood ah god how have fasted prayed one prayer to wash hand in blood of turk softly said constantine here be guard guard at gate be unwilling at first to let pas andrea without moment hesitation said that be priest going to visit dying man who wished to make confession with constantine a witness be admitted god will forgive that lie said a passed on be for cause that lied since mitsos ' departure disturbance have increased there be forty fifty greek collected in centre of square turkish soldier be coming out one by one from barrack mingling with crowd greek according to custom carried knife be otherwise unarmed turk have gun pistol there be low

shouted priest priest of god let pas greek in crowd parted making way for a pushed through conspicuous by great height though here there turkish soldier tried to stop andrea demanded to be let into middle of with such authority that too fell back continued to elbow way on be already well among people when two voice detached a be from angry low murmur shrilling up apart in loud violent altercation next moment greek just in front of rushed forward stabbed turk in arm soldier raised pistol fired man turned over on face with grunt one stretching convulsion dead there be moment silence

father andrea smiled for reason gave to rioter be not sufficient quite sufficient only occurred to there might be further reason further reaching reason so to speak will not detain longer be sure

larger half of hour picked together until two of big basket be full treading must begin press old stone built construction moss ridden creviced outside coated inside with fine stucco stood close to house bottom of sloped down towards small wooden sluice opened from lower end must be raised from inside when there be sufficient must trodden to fill one of big willow cask in be fermented mitsos have spent previous day in washing scouring with avuncular thoroughness scrubbing side with powdered resin when spero have wanted to assist in treading grape instead of gathering looked scornful only said make wine for to wash in get back to picking poured first two big pannier of grape into press just a sun rose stalk after turning trouser up to knee scrubbing foot leg in hot water mitsos stepped in began treading purple fruit be ripe tight skinned red stuff soon began to splash spurt up staining leg basket came before have got first two well under by degree picker gained on day promised scorching press have at first stood in shade have be swung round into full blaze of sun before couple of hour be over about nine o'clock constantine who have just carried up basket with spero stayed for moment looking at mitsos dancing fantastically in sun saw that there be already stuff enough to fill cask there be food for cask there said to mitsos be not trodden enough yet will not keep pace without one to help mitsos paused moment wiped face with back of hand be broiled meat said yes send one of girl make wash first constantine smiled there speaks nicholas remarked who be always right so maria be sent to help mitsos be pretty girl about seventeen year old fawn eyed olive skinned a stood on edge of press before stepping in with shoe off skirt tucked up mitsos found noticing gentle curve of calf muscle from ankle to behind knee how prettily one foot pink from hot water broadened a rested weight on for moment gave hand to help down into press eye met will do nicely now said constantine meantime have fetched one of cask open at top with tap at bottom about six inch above other end from fermented liquid must be drawn off when be clear placing under sluice looked over to see if must be sufficiently trodden basket have come in for quarter of hour mitsos maria between have reduced whole must to one consistency be ready now said to mitsos raise sluice must have risen above ring by sluice be raised at lower end of press mitsos maria groped about for minute so before found once tightly grasped other finger exclaimed triumphantly have got found first wood have swollen with scouring of day before be stiff so mitsos have to raise then with gurgle gulp purple mass of pulp juice stalk skin poured riotously out splashing constantine foaming into cask with lusty noise when be three quarter full mitsos closed sluice again for in process of fermentation must must swell to top constantine spero took barrel clucking a be moved off into veranda out of sun covered with cloth rested for hour at mid day ate dinner in shade of poplar by spring others have brought food with with exception of maria who said be not hungry did not care to eat mitsos pausing for moment in own meal saw sitting close to looking rather tired fagged from morning work fetched bread fresh cheese cool sweet from cellar maria want of appetite vanished before thing after dinner lay down dozed for hour of fiercest heat when a poet of south say even cicala be still in veranda in shade of poplar be first to wake under stern sense of duty aroused others maria have disposed under farther tree where lay with hand clasped behind head mouth half open set with rim of white teeth have drawn up one leg short skirt showed bare to above knee mitsos stood looking at moment thinking how pretty be long eyelash slightly parted mouth wondering why have never occurred to before be pretty when woke saw standing in front of sat up quickly drew skirt down over leg faint tinge of red showed under skin be time to go on said be nothing bag of sleep will help up said mitsos putting out hand stretched smiling got up without assistance then work went on till nearly sunset second cask third be filled be taken away to veranda where be put on trestle covered like first a there must not be time to fill fourth before sunset stopped work for day mitsos constantine ate supper together afterwards mitsos said must not go to cafe to night be sleepy to morrow must be a to day two sat there in silence for most part father smoking playing with bead mitsos lying full length on floor of veranda intermittently eating cherry from remains of supper about nine got up stretched be for bed said how pretty maria be wonder why never noticed before girl be pretty constantine smiled notice sooner later said noticed when be about a old a did what did do then god granted to marry one thought prettiest mother be little remember of be not going to marry maria yet be even very pretty second day be devoted to picking remainder of ordinary grape mitsos maria trod a on day before mitsos feeling desire to have hitherto be stranger to look well in girl eye told story about shooting own prowess therein for world like young cock bird in spring mating time strutting before lady girl be not required for third day picking in evening constantine paid two day wage mitsos walked back with maria through garden together washed foot of must at spring little further on came to cherry tree here told to hold out apron while picked little supper for again taking pride to swing with unnecessary display of gymnastics from one bough to while maria looked on from below with up turned eye bidding be careful saying a be indeed true that there be plenty of cherry on lower bough exertion be needle something in conduct seemed to amuse for a said good night at gate broke out into laugh with air of great fine lady to pretty boy good night little mitsos said will come to wedding mitsos in spite of determination of night before felt perceptible shock wedding whom be going to marry yanko at least so think have asked have not said yanko vlachos ugly brute maria laughed again find ugly at least not to matter mitsos recollected manner beg pardon said like yanko very much knocked turkish soldier down last week bang on back of head oh be very good man said maria walking off with great important air mitsos went slowly back to house strutting over third day be devoted to gathering of finer grape be fermented by in separate cask two boy constantine picked together until tree one be stripped instead of throwing in stalk picked grape separately off bunch shed into cask until there be layer fifteen inch deep mitsos trod a before while father spero went on picking when be sufficiently pulped poured on to about quart of brandy more grape be then put in trodden more brandy added when cask be three quarter full moved away with others covered more closely with two layer of thick woollen blanket remainder of fine grape be sufficient to fill half cask then there came final act of grape gathering page of pagan ritual surviving from time when rout of dionysus laughed rioted through vineyard mitsos fetched big bowl from house constantine cut grape from remaining vine placed in bowl left in middle of vineyard for bird to eat for next two day must required attention though fermentation owing to heat of weather be going on very rapidly by end of second day thin acrid smell mingled strongly with garden scent once twice constantine raised cloth covered cask to see what progress made drew little from tap at bottom stuff be still thick have not cleared sufficiently to be disturbed yet on second day mitsos went off to get fresh resin for wine ordinary pine resin be generally used by greek for constantine always preferred resin from dwarf pine be le bitter finer in quality side of mount elia be plentiful with common pine dwarf pine only grew on hill round epidaurus five hour journey mitsos took gun with on chance of sighting slaying game started off on pony before dawn for way wound over low unsheltered hill day long target for sun before reached shoulder of mountain in be cut old grass grown theatre about dwarf pine grew sun already high have drawn up heavy dew of night before air be quivering with heat like man in ague fit growth of pine be that of bush rather than tree of covering space of ten yard square gnarl trunked sprawling along ground on dozen of selected place near root cut off piece of bark few inch square in order that resin might ooze from lip of wounded trunk placing below flat stone to catch dripping in few day time there must be sufficient resin collected for year wine on several tree found incision have made in previous year in of where flow of resin have continued after have removed for wine have gone on dripping until little pillar like slag wax from candle stood up between stone tree cut off one of to see whether be still good damp have soaked into outside surface be covered with gray fungus growth rendered useless ate dinner under shelter of more shady tree grew higher up slope waited till sun have lost noonday heat listening lazily to bell on neck of pony be grazing on hill side above dozing wondering what next year must bring for have idea what nicholas must call on to do be willing to wait love of adventure excitement be fermenting in though be contented to go on living usual life from day to day nicholas knew must not fail day knew not when summons must come must obey blindly then thought of horrible scene nicholas have looked on three month ago when saw that dead misshapen thing dangling from tree blood began to boil desire to avenge wrong done to race stirred in spare not man woman child nicholas have said lay back on short turf began to think about maria supposing maria have be turkish woman nicholas have put knife into hand while be looking at mid day sleep beneath poplar told to kill must have be able must have struck anything so soft pretty fancy heavy lout yanko marrying maria be fat sat drinking day at wine shop yet be never drunk like proper man be seldom sober then mitsos for first time in life became analytical though vocabulary boasted such word why be that since day stood in front of maria a lay asleep have regarded woman somehow with different eye what be to whether yanko have hitherto have thought of woman in obvious work day light in be presented to greek boy a beast of burden hewer of wood drawer of water inferior being who waited on men when alone chattered shrilly volubly to other like jay bushful of silly jabbering sparrow creature altogether unfit for companionship of men since moment have changed there be something wonderful about men did not share something demanding protection even tenderness affording food for vague disquieting thought have not understood at not having known mother why nicholas have spoken a have of wife except in so far that be possession of turk have robbed mitsos must think of nothing loss of must make devote life to extermination of race have robbed of even if turk took away gun realized that must not wish to destroy whole race for brutal hanging of man be different matter man be man woman well that woman be nicholas wife suppose turk killed maria must that be worse than if killed say nicholas well not worse not nearly so bad in fact somehow different thus knocked mitsos at door of habitation called love waited for sesame chapter vi song from darkness when constantine looked at one of cask of fermenting wine on fourth day saw that crust of skin stalk stone have risen to within six inch of top like coffee on boil be thickly covered with pink sour smelling fermentation be at height be time to mix up crust with fluid again to excite even further in one cask into ripest fruit from more sun baked corner of vineyard have be put crust have risen even higher threatened to overflow ordinary custom in greece at time be for naked man to get into cask stir up again remnant doubt of now insignificant superstition constantine though still put grape of one vine in bowl for bird to eat did not think necessary to make further concession only stirred up frothing mass with instrument like wooden pavier crust be already growing thick compacted be ten minute work to get thoroughly mixed up again with fluid in case from seething bubbling surface there rose thickly sour fume of decomposing matter heavily laden with carbonic acid gas one cask leaked slightly round tap at bottom be dripping on floor little red stream have trickled down to edge of veranda noticed that be full of small bubble like water have stood in sun showing that fermentation be not yet over caulked up with lump of resin then moved cask out of shade for hour two so that heat might hasten second fermentation naturally be slower le violent than first cask half of fine wine however did not touch there be better that fermentation must go on slowly naturally that evening mitsos went out fishing a work of wine making be over for present in four five day must have to go over to epidaurus to get resin from pine tree just now there be nothing more to be done later on vine must have to be cut back constantine preferred delaying till leaf fell sap have sunk back again into root main stem though day be one of early autumn in most year serenity of summer must continue into middle end of october top of hill above farther side of gulf have be shrouded day in thick storm boding cloud a sunset drew near spread eastward making sullen sky sun a dropped behind illumined edge turning to dark translucent amber afterglow spread slowly across heaven cast strange lurid light through half opaque floor of cloud night must soon fall dark perhaps with storm be very hot land breeze be languid air blew a if weary with travel over broiling plain there be quite enough of with mitsos ' economical method to send boat along at good pace sailed almost before out seaward for two mile so meaning to fish from island then changed mind went back on tedious tack to head of bay water seeming to thick thing boat going heavily dark fell dense premature when hour later put boat about on last tack have to keep two eye open a neared land a there be other boat abroad did not think necessary to light lantern at bow against dark sky dark water must hardly have be possible to see brown sailed craft from more than forty yard distant even then if thin white line of broken water at forefoot have not caught eye stealthy subdued hiss a cut through sea fallen on ear might have passed close unnoticed then with curious suddenness saw faintly white glimmer of sea wall of abdul achmet house straight in front of knew that in dead darkness have taken too starboard course however by running up a close a possible to one tack more must certainly take across to fishing bay where be bound sitting rudder in hand waited till last possible moment before putting about have however forgotten that wall must take wind from when be about fifty yard off sail flapped once fell dead against mast boom swung straight line of white water faded from under forefoot hiss of motion be quenched got up for oar so a to pull round again when quite suddenly heard sound of woman voice from terrace singing for moment so stood still then ear focussed to sound be singing song mitsos knew well song vine tender sing a be digging vine in spring of year sang in greek dig deep around vine give sweet spring shower home else fairest sun that shine sends sparkle to wine light lustre in foam must not see singer saw be circle of black night faint line of boat shade blacker against just ahead white glimmer of wall voice low sweet came out of darkness like bird flying through desert living thing amid death mitsos stood perfectly still strangely bewilderingly excited then took up oar turned boat head round rowed few stroke out waited again voice have ceased felt somehow unaccountably shy a if have intruded into privacy having intruded be determined to make presence known so just a sail caught wind again stood up in stern in boyish voice answered unseen singer with second verse dig deep summer here saw not among eaves summer messenger appear swallow flitting here there through budding almond leaf boat bent over to wind white line streaked water hissed off into night again sat down let go of tiller let boat run on by have never known that common country song be beautiful till have heard voice out of darkness sing voice low sweet soft might have be darkness made audible who be woman how did greek come to be in house of turk then with flash of awakened memory brought to mind evening when nicholas have sailed home after fishing how man came up struck woman who be leaning on sea wall how have cried out said in greek what be for flapping of sail in last breath of wind roused looked up breeze have died out be floating in middle of shell of blackness have idea where be until saw light of nauplia where least expected on left of boat instead of behind dim far away for craft left to have of course run straight before land breeze out into mouth of gulf now breeze have died out be mile from land did not trouble much fishing be minor consideration spending night in boat be paid for by shrug of shoulder wanted one thing only to get back to white glimmering wall to voice from darkness puff of hot air wandered by boat sail shivered for moment be still again veiled flash of lightning gleamed through cloud over tripoli hill be reflected sombrely across sky peal of thunder droned tardy answer faint rim of light like raising of tired eyelid opened over sea saw rope of boat stand out sharp against then suddenly there came from hill sound knew knew to be dangerous shrill scream of mountain squall from highland to west of gulf sprang to rope have sail down just before struck in le than minute bow be driven round white top of little wave began to fleck bay felt salt spray on face hand laughed exultantly be what wanted with joy in danger of thing hoisted sail struggling pulling to be free in moment be tearing back straight to head of gulf with rudder pushed hard port at pace be going boat be quite steady cutting through wave instead of rising to now then one be flung over bow like white rag wind screamed white snake of foam flew by bareheaded mitsos clung with hand to rudder controlling course of boat like rider of restive horse laughing to for secret glee now then shouting out verse of vine digger song before long wall appeared again took in sail water be already rough be dashing up against let boat drift on till be within thirty yard of rim of light over sea have widened must see edge of top of wall quite distinctly behind tall sombre cypress in row there be one there just then rain began hissing into sea like shot for few minute turning whole surface milky white mitsos frowning peering awhile into darkness put up collar with difficulty proceeded to put about wind be blowing hard ashore have to take down sail altogether row even then seemed hardly to be making way against maddened air be quarter of hour hard work to get far enough from shore to sail again then fetched long tack towards nauplia from there managed to handle boat back opposite shore where house stood surf be breaking nastily on rock ridden beach have to get through narrow channel side of be shoal water not sufficiently deep to allow boat to pas have light from own house that from cafe opposite to steer by knew that must run in when be in line a neared shore must see be impossible to bring boat round sharply enough while there be yet time beat out again for quarter of mile approached more directly time be successful boat skimmed past tumbled water on side a passed saw sharp toothed rock foaming gnashing at safe into smoother water of anchorage constantine be waiting up for when tall figure appeared in doorway looked up with relief mitsos must sail on night like said best seaman in world might not be able to handle boat in such squall how did get in be easy enough when get light from house cafe in line said mitsos besides be six mile out in bay when squall came down six mile out have not be long getting back said father marvelling at lad knowledge mitsos walked to door to close turning back on constantine there be fine wind to sail on said whistled vine digger song beneath breath constantine did not ask more question mitsos went to make hot coffee get out of wet clothes for be drenched from head to foot two day after ordinary wine have cleared completely be racked into fresh cask for if stood too long on lee in contact with skin stalk must become bitter crust constantine removed from barrel put into still for making of spirit only required one man to look after on day mitsos went to epidaurus to get resin employed with apparatus be of simplest placed crust from barrel in big iron pot under lit slow charcoal fire into hole in lid of screwed on to body inserted bent iron pipe on to screwed pipe made in spiral big wooden tub filled with water through bottom of passed third pipe fitting at one end into spiral lay in water communicating at other with glazed jar into spirit be to be stored completed apparatus fire drove off alcohol from fermented crust in vapor distilled into spirit a passed through tube lay in cold water dripped out at farther end into jar finished day work by soon after five having business in nauplia set off there at once so mitsos returning little later from epidaurus with resin found out without waiting to get food set off again at once down to bay be drawing near moment when beauty of day in sea land sky be gathered into ten minute of sunset sun declining to setting be dropping slowly above low pas in hill shining with exceeding clearness be still hour above horizon when mitsos got into boat land breeze be blowing temperate firm boat dipped to gently glided steadily on outward tack between argive hill hung palpable haze of thinnest blue whole plain slept in garment of gold woven by level ray surface of water unruffled under shadow of land be green burnished like plate of patinated bronze ripple from bow broke creamily flowed out behind boat in long feather like line a sun neared setting golden mist grew more intense in color higher slope of mountain turned pink behind veil of blue sky be cloudless from rim to rim except where low in west there floated few thin skein of vapor visible against incredible blue only because be touched with red just a mitsos neared wall on second tack sun edge be cut by ragged outline of mountain in ten minute more must have set nameless ineffable mitsos never questioned that be sweet singer be leaning on edge of wall looking seaward saw mitsos sitting in stern of boat guessed at once for few boat passed so close that be who have sung second verse of vineyard song two night ago that be boat passed close under wall last night when other woman of harem be there with have not known till saw that wished to see owner of half formed boyish voice have come so pleasantly out of darkness now when did see looked long too be looking eye made bridge over golden air lay between brought close together boat drew nearer dropped eye began playing with spray of rose trailed along top of wall picked couple of bud smelled then very softly began first verse of vine digger song illustration half carelessly threw into boat rose have picked boat have got under shelter of wall drifted windlessly near mitsos be still looking at eye be still cast down sang first verse through first two line of second verse then apparently recollected more for stopped from boat mitsos sang very softly two line followed still without looking up sang after finished verse sang whole through from bay sun have set mountain on east glowed rosier rosier moment mitsos saw be girl slender figure wrapped in loose white cloak with gold band round waist hand held two rosebud face veiled up to eye eye down dropped eyelash swept cheek there be third verse said then looked up eye smiled at be a black a shadow beneath moon will learn that night said softly if be will teach be for teaching go now others be coming half carelessly threw into boat rose have picked turned away mitsos waited moment longer then hearing voice in garden behind wall rowed quickly away thought be song mind one sweet secret frenzy made heart quick eye bright common detail of life be seen taken in by dimly a sound come dimly to sleeper be material out of weave golden vision for first splendor of love hackneyed a theme a experience from generation to generation ever new be dawning on maria be married next morning mitsos went without emotion to wedding bride bridegroom appeared to to be admirably suited to other about four o'clock afternoon lad be just about to set off down to shore when father appeared will finish with wine evening said come begin at once mitsos mitsos paused moment be just going sailing said can not wait till to morrow have better be finished now besides can sail afterwards come wo take couple of hour uncle nicholas told to sail day began to obey mitsos mitsos stood for moment irresolute soon habit of obedience reasserted yes father said be sorry will come cask in first fermentation have taken place have be thoroughly scoured with boiling water have quite got rid of sour smelling fermented stuff be to rack cleared resinated wine back into filled cask again three quarter full into remaining space poured portion of fine wine dividing equally among to mitsos process seemed insufferably long tedious sun have set before cask be filled be dark before work be over never before seemed to have tap dribbled so dispiritingly father now then addressed remark to barely answered after time lapsed into silence mitsos knew that be behaving badly thought must not help perhaps be there perhaps bewildering thought be even wondering why did not come how must simulate slightest interest in wine of grape when wine of love be fermenting within driving mad with sweet intoxicating fume for there be amethyst at last be over must not eat now must eat when came in ten minute later be on way soon wall began to glimmer in front of something looked only like white shadow be leaning on a drew nearer heard again voice singing low in darkness singing common country song have become so beautiful chapter vii port due of corinth nicholas got safely across to corinth early in morning after have parted from mitsos be obliged to wait there two day for caique to take to patras revolution for leading greek throughout peloponnese be preparing be there in hand of archbishop germanos like nicholas too have felt cruel appetite of turk like nicholas be willing to leave revenge unplucked until whole scheme be ripe to core agent of have met latter at corinth bidding come if have few day to spare at once if not a soon a must a nicholas have left nauplia with idea of proceeding to patras at once sent messenger back saying be on way that for greater security must come by sea that be suspected of being concerned in intrigue against turk knew a plan be now already beginning to be thoroughly organized club have made principal agent in morea wished to avoid needle risk in passing through garrisoned town on gulf on second day however greek caique laden with fig be starting from corinth nicholas went on board soon after dark about midnight started for few hour easterly breeze drew up from narrow end of gulf slackened dropped between three four in morning daylight found becalmed with slack sail eight mile out to sea nearly opposite itea to north top of parnassus wore morning on face stood high above rose flushed with dawn while still lay on dark polished plain of water a a glass on opposite side of gulf farther ahead cyllene helmos on north side of last winter snow still lay heraldically in bar bezant have also caught light a sun rose higher flowed like luminous liquid down slope wooded below with great pine forest nicholas have pillowed on deck woke when sun have risen high enough to touch caique captain owner of boat who have be night in little close cabin below came up a roused sat down near wind have dropped altogether said may be here for hour be in hurry to get on nicholas filled pipe very carefully be never in hurry said if be going a quick a can must make wind if must can not so be content to wait if swearing must do good must even swear find have effect on element have good heavy cargo good heavy cargo said man yes must have dipping gunwale if devil have not seized six crate of fig at corinth turk asked nicholas who else port due call much of port be corinth heap of stone tumbled into water five rickety step harbor due be new institution be not month old only said man if hear right will not be very much older when be taken off again taken off how be that asked nicholas blandly say there will soon be great cutting of swine throat spend life on sea for most part ear be empty of news surely know what be being said at corinth that before year be out greek will not have master longer one of crew be standing near captain motioned to go farther off like to say before own men said why must not tell will be landed at patras will go way mine besides for turkish clothes be turk for be short legged folk heard at cafe last night four turk be talking about arm say peasant be collecting spoke of one nicholas vidalis a leader expected to take for word have come to that be travelling to corinth thus there be disappointed men thought nicholas then aloud who be nicholas nay know not said man be from island thought might be must tell of from island asked nicholas from psara nicholas lit pipe with lump of charcoal inhaled couple of long breath silent with matter in balance then looking straight at man said be nicholas vidalis man whom turk must dearly like to catch at present catch not for be clean god fearing man hate turk even a hate devil for two be one now there be two way open to one be to give up at patras other to try to help others in what be doing for will be time for saying ' have nothing to do with let who will fight out ' will have to take one side have better begin at once see have trusted with secret because may be of use to come from psara probably know coast of greece a man know shape of boot gaiter have got plenty of men to fight on land plenty to pay with what want be little ship in case of need will hang about turk if try to escape from destruction sting a mosquito sting slow cattle in evening nicholas paused for moment face lit up with blaze of hatred for be already evening with cried when day dawn night will have swallowed will awake more do know what be strongest feeling that ever grip man heart no not love yet fear revenge if have suffered a have suffered must know what be to be filled with one thought only to see blood in sunrise blood in setting of sun to feel that have ceased to be man have become sword be what be hand hold be right hand of god by will smite spare not when there be more to smite perhaps will become man again live to see peace plenty bless free people of know nothing greatly care come now what answer do give nicholas rose to foot other have risen too faced other there be something in earnestness intensity of man with one idea must not be felt for enthusiasm be one fact can not be gainsaid noble disease in contagion ever make infection companion felt tell more said eagerly wait moment here be wind hurried aft to give order to men far away on polished surface of water behind shining a sealskin line have appeared a if fur have be stroked wrong way in couple of minute men be busy with rope two stood ready to slacken sheet of heavy square sail if squall be violent one stood at tiller for cross current have turned boat round must be necessary to put about meantime rough line have crept nearer behind must see top of little wave cut off by wind blown about in spray couple of men have put out long sweep oar be tugging hurriedly at to get head of boat straight before wind before struck be not in time wind came down with scream boat heeled over till leeward gunwale touched water mast bent then with perfect precision sheet be slackened for moment to let right herself braced again began to make way in few second be scudding straight down gulf almost directly before wind till with increasing speed seemed to die down again water round be broken up into infinite number of little green foam embroidered wave trough through at pace be going moved a quietly a skater over smooth ice nicholas have careful eye to handling of boat during operation saw that little crew of six men knew work perfectly that be quick prompt at moment when mishap might easily have occurred never let slip smallest opportunity might day prove to be useful knew that for anything like united action must be necessary for greek to have if not command of sea coast at rate power to communicate with other outbreak a must have must take place first in peloponnesus not to fail of completeness must have to spread over north patras missolonghi be within few mile of other by sea unless there be free communication by waterway must be powerless for mutual support to extent fear hope be realized hour later kanaris captain of boat be breakfasting together nicholas be explaining to exactly what weakness of movement be necessity for conjunction between sea land force wished said to continue to exercise trade for sake of appearance always to be ready at moment notice when outbreak took place be quite certain that many of turk especially on sea coast must try to escape by sea must not be be polite diplomatic war on be to embark aim from first must be annihilation of turk told in detail how mean of escape be to be cut off a will appear later a unfolded bloody plan kanaris heart burned within promised in name of god to help gather that red vintage about mid day wind went down lay becalmed again nicholas who a have said be never in hurry when be going a quick a must felt that time must hardly have be better employed kanaris appeared be of large psarian clan for generation have be seafaring folk men of wind wave whose help nicholas knew to be so essential promised if possible to come to psara before year be out said that hand be very full must pledge certainty for three hour so lay on tossing water for wind of morning have roughened narrow sea so quickly get up under squall from mountain great green billow came chasing other down from east beneath brilliant noonday sun turned into jubilant company of living thing boat lying low in water with heavy cargo reeled rolled with jovial boisterousness alternately lifting up side ashine with sea over crest of wave burying again with choking hiccough in trough sun drew out from crate of fig odor of mellow luxuriance hung heavy round boat dispersed now then by puff of wind blew in salt freshness of sea by four o'clock however wind still favorable sprang up again on went into sunset black nose of boat pushing burrowing through wave throwing off from side sheet of spent foam a hour passed kanaris felt ever more keenly fascination strength of strange man after supper sat together in stern watching heaven reel roll above top of mast striking wildly right left across hundred star nicholas perched on taffrail balancing with exquisite precision to movement of boat talked in deep low voice of thousand scheme blood stirring with turk for target for one knew better than value of personal power success of proselytizing have be to large extent even a in case of mitsos outcome of own individuality must so stir mind of men fan to flame smouldering hatred against turk cause to leap up in fire germanos metropolitan bishop of patras have only just risen next morning when messenger came back having travelled through night to announce nicholas coming also report same talk in cafe kanaris have heard bishop smiled to at idea of untoward fate laying hand on nicholas told servant to let be widely known that nicholas have be taken killed for a said turk will be delighted to believe men always succeed in believing what wish greek to whom nicholas be more than name will know that be one of thing occur be ready for breakfast let room for poor dead friend be got ready also bath in body may be washed germanos be splendid specimen of greek of unmixed blood now nearly quite extinct family came from island delos still unviolated by unspeakable race from generation to generation have only married with islander be rather above middle height long black cassock made appear taller in accordance with greek rite hair beard have ever be cut former flowed black thick onto shoulder beard fell in full rippling line down a far a waist though for three four year life have be one long effort of organizing countryman against turk latter have never suspected complicity intended to take fullest advantage of misplaced confidence in though germanos have not trodden world so widely a nicholas have done be nevertheless man of culture shrewd witty educated nicholas too though for sake of great cause must have condemned cheerfully never to speak to man of own rank breeding again found pleasant change after incessant wandering among peasant to mix with own kind again few day with constantine at nauplia be true have much enjoyed for be impossible not to be happy when apostle of happiness little mitsos be by constantine too be of salt of earth only arrived in evening just before dinner sat down together a soon a have washed there be good man to hand think to day captain of boat came by said suggested must come talk with to morrow must have brought with be busy with fig cargo dear nicholas be indefatigable believe there be man in world who must wake at dawn on gulf instantly set about making proselyte must have be priest what made see patriot in be long shot said nicholas spoke without sympathy of new turkish harbor due at corinth told capture be imminent risked on that archbishop frowned new harbor due be time to think of harbor due when there be harbor so said answered nicholas method have simplicity seized six crate of fig be commanded remarked germanos to love men hope love turk be certain that like desire that will please god to remove a many a possible of kind to kingdom of blest elsewhere without delay say so in prayer nicholas smiled give double sound said pray not for destruction for speedy salvation be that to love men be hard saying for indeed love nation be sure that removal of turk will be for permanent good what doe psalmist say though be not acquainted with turk will wash footstep in blood of ungodly a far a can learn ungodly be expecting to wash footstep in blood at corinth said nicholas behaved a be only granted to turk to behave expected twenty four hour after have gone away how did thing go at nauplia better than must possibly have expected found very man rather boy wanted in young nephew little mitsos how old be eighteen six foot high with foot of roe deer on mountain can trust to death eighteen be too young surely said germanos again can trust many people to just short of point be most dangerous of to work with must sooner work with man must not trust a far a toothache in answer nicholas told of midnight test germanos listened with interest horror be probably right then be wrong said boy can move about country without suspicion where man must not go how must do so cruel thing be flesh blood young boy like yes be horrible said nicholas want none who be made of steel knew by that be one in thousand clinched teeth never word what do propose to do with now be came to talk to about be time to set to work in earnest club a know have given free hand open purse mitsos must

summer drank in feverishly a sick man drain glass by bedside turn to sleep again mitsos have many round oath for horrible weather like wise lad cursed have done with bay sweet possibility of bay be only in range of thought woodcock be more accessible with something of air of martyr must pas long day on upland towards epidaurus come back after fall of dark with leash of woodcock appetite bordered on grotesque singing contented later in evening must be twitched by eager restlessness make many journey to door to see if weather have cleared showed sign of clearing only to be met by buffeting clap of windy rain in face made close again quickly for where be use argued of lying rolling rocking off white wall if be to be alone there once twice during fortnight have sailed by wage be only wetting constantine be somewhat puzzled perplexed at mitsos ' behavior about time took all with habitual serenity of tolerance likened in own mind to colt who be just beginning to find out that be horse knowing own strength learning need whinny kick up heel knew that must be useless to try to extract unvolunteered information out of mitsos guessed more nearly to truth than knew that mitsos ' somewhat spasmodic mood be merely natural result of budding manhood be a inexplicable to a be to father meantime though have heard seen anything more of nicholas constantine felt that mitsos be growing in way must have grow be increasing in self reliance surefootedness of mind just a be increasing in bodily strength stature mitsos be exercising more self control than father gave credit for acquaintance with greek girl in harem of turk begun so strangely have ripened no le strangely have sat below wall night after night talked to from boat rocking gently in swell standing still steady in calm water till with sign motioned away seeing other woman of harem one of servant come out into garden then suleima have made confidante of one of elder woman who seeing mitsos ' handsome laughing face have given sympathy what be better practical exhibition of have promised to watch in garden so that might talk without fear of interruption stipulating however through suleima a interpreter half laughing yet half in earnest that mitsos must give kiss for time watched for suleima have felt flushing a interpreted into greek mitsos ' tone reassured a answered might a well do for nothing oh translate say be very much obliged pay day be long in house of turk then there came evening only just before weather have broken when mitsos took down to boat little rope ladder suleima have told that be to come there late not before midnight must have gone to room early saying be not well then if possible must come out to must go for sail together be evening to be remembered to be lived over again in memory reluctance eagerness to come terrorizing risk of discovery none le be whetstone to enjoyment delight at getting out though only for hour two half frightened childish exclamation of dismay a mitsos put about when water began to curl back from forefoot of boat a went hissing out to sea before wind face looking a if be made of ebony ivory beneath moonlight with thin black eyebrow long black eyelash sense of innocent wickedness a in response to mitsos entreaty unveiled altogether curious fantastic story of how be carried off year ago by turk have forgotten about home except father be tall man with long black dress pretty hesitating pronunciation of greek bewildering treatment of a if be boy a be person of mature experience a be not being year younger than view took of moonlight sail a just childish freak heavily paid for if discovered to be repeated if not while to be opening of heaven then a still remained serious looking at with wide eye of shy adoration too became just little serious a turned homewards said that liked very much that old abdul achmet be fat pig then in answer to oh be quite content where be except when abdul be in bad temper eunuch beat there be plenty to eat nothing to do be all much le strictly looked after than in other harem for abdul be old only cared for one of for be favorite servant of chief wife not really in harem be not very exciting if mitsos must come again now then take for sail must be quite happy finally be useless for to come except when be fine for harem be always locked up in wet weather must not be able to get into garden also hated rain like cat then intervened fortnight when climate of nauplia for most part be that of valley of avilion gave way to angry mood of child to screaming sobbing steady weeping surface of bay be churned up by rain streaked with foam by wind big poplar tree under maria have slept shook free of summer foliage stood forth in naked gnarled appeal to element for fortnight deluge continued on night of st of december mitsos waking at strange moment when earth turn in sleep cattle horse stand up graze for moment before lying down again saw with eye shadow of bar of window cast sharply onto floor of bedroom by slip of crescent moon rode high in starry sky when woke again be to see heaven of unsullied blue washed clean by rain day spent dreaming dozing in veranda for meant to be out on bay night after mid day dinner went down to overhaul boat taking with fishing net bag of resin have wrapped up in centre of net pillow from bed for suleima have said that net on sat before smelled fishy

on eventually took out put on new clothes only worn on festa day be thoroughly unsuitable for rough fishing by night brushed hair with extreme care wished be sleek smooth like yanko instead of growing in crisp strong curl put red cap rakishly on side of head laced up brown cloth legging to very top be done with greatest precision seriousness went down stair on tiptoe for fear of wakening father who be already abed have left injunction with to lock door take key with if be likely to be late be about half past ten when set off moon have risen took hour more to reach dim white wall for breeze be yet light variable a neared began to feel heart pulsing in throat a have done one night before when passed scene of hanging by wayside somehow differently peered out anxiously into darkness to see if there be one there something white glimmered on wall down went sail few minute later nose of boat grated against stone work gave little chuckling laugh thought must come said on first night of star be in bed listened at be door be mohammed no more only grunt snore mitsos said nothing threw ladder rope on wall sprang up yes have come said ah how have be cursing rain may saint forgive cared not cursed suleima looked at moment why how smart be said be greek use that man go fishing in best clothes oh clean fustanella cried looking sideways on mitsos smiled best clothes have be good thought in spite of momentary confusion hush whispered will talk in boat will hold ladder there be quite steady girl stepped lightly down rung mitsos directing to sit still threw ladder rope back let down onto side of boat where will go to night asked girl laughed gently echo a be of laugh oh out out to sea said right away from horrible place where will sit mitsos took pillow out of net put for at stern of boat see said remembered that said net smelled fishy have brought pillow to sit on there be there more comfortable seat in greece sat down boy busied with boat for few minute have to row out dozen stroke so until got from under lee of wall wind catching sail slowly bulged out taut boat dipped bowed moment then began to move quickly forward towards mouth of bay stood few second irresolute until suleima spoke well have finished asked yes will run straight before wind a far a like pointed with hand to seat beside come sit by said there be silence between for several minute with smile hiding in depth of dark eye serious tongue tied air be full of freshness of night of sea across that there came to faint odor from warm smell of live thing too delicate to describe then drew from pocket small box opened see what have brought said rahat la koom how do call in greece sweet anyhow do like sweet took lump of sticky fragrant stuff out of box offered to mitsos a child offer sweet to child do like asked again abdul gave stuff last night be afraid when gave to did not stop a told be not of harem mitsos flushed suleima spoke with naivete of child yet somehow made ashamed to think that even be sitting alone with furious at thought that fat turk whom have seen at nauplia only few day before must dare to give sweet how silent be mitsos went on tell what have be doing time for have done nothing nothing nothing have never be so dull mitsos looked up suddenly be le dull now said do care to come out like with surely else must not come think have even missed be odd for never missed one

drawing finger up down did bleed much bucketful must put boat on other tack take care sail will come across again air struck cold a went more into wind suleima wrapped black bernouse more closely round nestled under shelter of lad be cold asked suddenly no mitsos not if sit like be ice to have piece of rahat la koom illustration kissed lightly on forehead mitsos grinned showing white teeth will keep out cold finely said give be rapidly approaching wall in ten minute more mitsos stood up took in sail speed slackened standing at bow leaned forward thrusting out with pole brought boat alongside then springing up again with rope in hand told suleima to throw up end of ladder held down with foot on far side of wall while climbed up pleasantly feeling muscle of leg strain a stepped onto rope ground on inside be foot two below top of wall standing on top moment before stepping down suddenly bent head down to brushing back curl with hand kissed lightly on forehead good night little mitsos whispered then in flash face flushed mitsos said quickly with curious shyness promise will never kiss zuleika be old witch without waiting for reply ran across to dark house mitsos sat perfectly still tingling alert felt blood throb beat in temple half started from place to run after half raised voice to call remembered in time that be close to turk house something let two sit together like child be dead something have taken place heart sang to dropped down again into boat for hour more sat there without stirring hearing ripple against side seeing break in dim phosphorescent gleam of light then with wonder on lip smile in eye went silently home through still night be night of st of january mitsos suleima be again sailing across bay time however not out to

coming in from garden luckily for mitsos have not be seen excuse be that have headache must not sleep so have sat in garden for while nothing more must be got out of zuleika for one reason have be loyal enough to preserve silence suleima got beaten judged more prudent not to have more headache for time a fate watch over wooing must have one night fortnight afterwards eunuch be found drunk particularly heinous crime to one of religion blasphemous be therefore dismissed suleima be sedulous to note habit of successor observed with much approval that went to bed early slept soundly at length ventured to resume excursion have more leisure than usual after detection for be solitary behind lock key have sweet to eat thought be ever with mitsos who have hardly seen man have certainly never in last ten year spoken to one except to black thick lipped eunuch abdul achmet whose small sensual eye looked at like mole about fat pendulous cheek must hardly believe that mitsos with sun browned boyish face fit slender limb be creature of same race from first time that have seen only dimly a sat in boat swaying regularly gracefully to motion heard singing old song remembered from childhood have thought how charming must be to live on pattern a free a spring swallow wholesomely cleanly in open air surely have caught something indefinable perhaps none le certain from wind sun something reminded of clear light summer morning when be so pleasant to come out of close perfumed house to have breath of more airy fragrance thrown at by sea breeze feel with cool shock few dew drop from great climbing rose about door shaken onto bare flesh by wind for unlike turk came of outdoor race inherited instinct have not be altogether eradicated by hot house enclosed life then by degree feeling have grown le general more personal be doubly delightful to be able to talk confidentially naturally a one child talk to to one of own age liked talking to zuleika preferred talking to mitsos be pleasure to make laugh show milkiness of white teeth must always make laugh zuleika have hideous teeth one be black discolored for whole day together must sit sloppy dishevelled object by fire saying ached felt quite sure that mitsos ' teeth never ached for did not know what aching meant again when abdul achmet laughed cheek wrinkled up till eye be nearly closed two queerest little dimple be dug one on side of mouth what must happen have thought once if made laugh then held eye open so that must not shut must have liked to try then mitsos felt in bone evidently liked very much in quite different way from one have liked before zuleika liked in tepid intermittent manner when tooth ached ignored altogether have once slapped in face for too obtrusive sympathy when abdul came took chin between finger turned up face to told that be getting very pretty turned cold over reminded of way have pointed at one of turkey in yard said be becoming beautifully fat again have be quite unaccountably delightful to sit close to mitsos shelter under from wind to be close to know near finally when parted that night have brushed back curl from forehead kissed feeling have be more unaccountable still have done unthinkingly moment be done whole mill race of thought went bubbling unbidden through head wanted to do again wanted to take in arm press close to must not mind if hurt hated zuleika understood in moment why if mitsos knew least part of what felt must have be angry when told what zuleika said next word have come out of mouth outstripping so seemed thought then have felt suddenly shy frightened longed to stop where be for surely mitsos understood what be so intimate to so being woman instantly ran away never looked behind to night have sat by wall for hour before came thought perhaps must not come have brought into eye silent childish tear must come must not do without for herself must have sat on wall night for month to go out with surely must not be tired in week two of coming not finding there with rising of moon have seen sail far away that got at last boat grated gently against wall be mitsos whispered for answer rope be flung up to young black eyed lover sprang to side descended ladder silently stood in stern while joined with vigorous push be floating again alone in centre of vast dim immensity set sail came stood in front of suleima whispered last time kissed will let kiss mitsos said with great shy bold joy in heart put face up must have kissed lightly on forehead a have kissed suddenly be impossible be no longer child lover next moment arm be flung round neck mouth pressed close to kiss left hungrier for next wind be straight behind sat where have sat before talked in low voice a if in fear of jealousy of star night mitsos have got fishing spear bag of resin on board after while at suleima suggestion went straight before wind to bay where mitsos said must catch fish if cared to see hour sail brought across grounding boat by bush of blackthorn that grew thick on top of rock on edge of tideless sea took suleima in arm waded through willow water to head of bay where must fish to save tramp through undergrowth be thick soaked with night dew be feather weight in strong arm head lay on shoulder threw one arm round neck for greater security made nest under clump of rush grew on edge of dry sand then went back for fishing thing to carry suleima to land have only willowest water at edge of sea to walk through have just turned up bottom of trouser where be going to fish must be deeper a usual slipped off buckling shirt reached to knee round waist then lit flare stepping off into deeper water be half thigh deep went slowly along peering cautiously at bright circle of light cast by resin fish be plentiful suleima from nest near clapped hand laughed delightedly when mitsos speared one larger than usual held up flapping wriggling to show got so excited in proceeding that left seat walked along edge of sand parallel with observing with keenest interest what did then when got tired of watching mitsos declared be tired of fishing waded to shore with creel full of fish suleima have brought with turkish tobacco have taken from house gave to mitsos to smoke other woman of harem smoked said for have tried once thought horrid to taste mitsos might smoke must even light pipe for with little pout of disgust lit at flare handed to smoked while looked fish over be night for great lover of romance to be abroad in air be of wonderful briskness making pulse go quick yet gentle soft moon have set behind hill to west sat close together beneath wonderful twilight of star in little sheltered nook beneath great clump of tall singing rush on ground in front lay resin flare already burning low a mitsos must fish more that night did not replenish lower lower burned now then must shoot up with sudden leap of flame revealing to other suleima must smile at mitsos before must see mouth smile in answer flame must die down again into flickering spot on glowing bubbling ash in darkness knew smiled back at whispered word must pas from one to other last flicker of flame showed lover to sight of then drawing closer in darkness a if by law be moving equally lip met again in kiss seemed to have never ceased between wind sang gently in rush while before spread broad water of bay just curdled over by breeze above austere star burned down on behind rose empty wooded hill where once soft army of dionysus revelled in love wine rising into peak above tripoli wind dropped for moment rush be silent in lull mitsos heard mule bell behind great way off sat up peered across vine grown strip of plain lay between mountain skein of night mist hung opaque pearly gray above in few minute however sound got sensibly nearer two rose moved score of yard farther down beach for footpath round head of bay to nauplia led across top of then across sound of bell must hear pattering footstep of mule in few minute more rider emerged from path lay through vineyard onto open ground at head of beach just then rider checked beast dismounted tied grass round tongue of bell in order to muffle struck light with flint steel caught in tinder blew gently till sufficed to light short chibouk face be towards in glow of kindled tobacco stood out vividly from dark be nicholas mounted again rode on mitsos sat still breathing hard vacantly seeing only nicholas face standing out like ghost in darkness suleima touched gently on arm who be said did not see be uncle said mitsos in dry voice no did not see then self control gave way flung back on ground be afraid said know what be going to happen have come for know for asked suleima what do mean will have to go said mitsos holy virgin can not know nothing about what want to do only know may that will have to go away that will have to leave perhaps never see again oh cried can not can not suleima be frightened mitsos talk like said half sobbing be so unkind mitsos recovered felt ashamed oh dearest of littlest said soothingly be stupid brute to frighten everything will be right will come back be sure will come back only promised to do what told help in something doe not matter what expect have come to tell want help will not tell what be asked suleima willing to be comforted promised must keep secret may tell know say never repeat that greek be going to rise

one thing if ever be attacked be afraid call out in greek that be greek turk oh suleima pray to virgin blessed child that day may come soon for will be thus then that will be able to go together always be about that be going away said suleima with sudden intuition mitsos longed to tell promise to nicholas kept dumb then a have to answer lied boldly unreservedly have nothing to do with said oh suleima forgive for so frightening did not mean what said will come to wall again a often a can may have to go away indeed be afraid be sure know for how long first night be back will come again to wall dear white wall where first met suleima felt quite comforted be sure that nothing must go really wrong a long a mitsos drew breath bent down head kissed yes mitsos will come to wall whenever can hoping only that may be there because know care for more than rest of world now carry back to boat strong armed one be time went back mitsos stooped lifted up a hand be full hung creel round neck suleima carried extinguished flare heart be dead weight within for felt certain why nicholas have come be apparently old cheery self suleima forgot about rather disquieting moment just after nicholas have passed what must do must not form least idea at present seemed to impossible that must go away leave felt willing to throw to wind have promised nicholas nicholas have told that must be one of foremost of country avenger shrugged shoulder for just now desire for vengeance on turk be le than memory of dream be there not plenty of others to avenge greece why must give up be dearest to dear burden be go out on undesired adventure a long a suleima be with stifled thought while boat skimmed seaward on outward tack put about island ran straight for wall wind have freshened to mitsos boat seemed to be going terribly fast for grudged moment have quite lulled suleima disquietude if not own lay with head on shoulder half asleep looking up now then into wide open eye pressing arm more closely round neck have to rouse when must get up to take in sail smiled at sleepily like child just wakened then fixed ladder climbed up clung to for moment without word for there be need of speech between went quickly silently across garden be after two when mitsos landed opposite house saw with surprise that there be light still burning opened door bending head to pas under low jamb entered constantine nicholas be sitting there constantine silent nicholas talking eagerly mitsos observed that held pipe unlit in hand uncle sprang up when came in ah be here mitsos time have come must go at

accredited leader of revolution turk through whose kismet truth of ever increasing rumor have begun to break have long held in indolent suspicion have taken no step to counteract report of death for hoped if turk can be said to hope somewhat ingeniously wholly mistakenly that such news must prove to be cooling draught to ill defined fever of revolution greek however a germanos have said knew that nicholas be not sort of man who died turkish ingenuity went strangely wide of aim in fact enabled nicholas to move about more freely to take liberal advantage of fact that be supposed to be beyond reach of war rumor of war indeed in october finding back at corinth where have business with one of fellow worker have filled idle afternoon with carving little wooden cross on painted name below with two handled meaning text trumpet will sound dead will be raised be to leave corinth that night after dark have fallen host went to greek cemetery planted eloquent little monument over newly made grave

greek bey of district petros mavromichales usually known a petrobey that must be given up on old charge of brigandage petrobey like germanos be of high rank turk seemed to have have suspicion that be leader of revolution a matter of fact nicholas who be staying with at time read letter together consulted what must be done be disposed to shrug at altogether merely to send back answer that be officially declared to be dead buried witness grave monument petrobey thought otherwise own usefulness to cause be immensely increased by fact that at present stood outside suspicion advised nicholas to retire where be not likely to look for while must prosecute vigorous indubitably unsuccessful search elsewhere a evidence of own unimpeachable fidelity have not nicholas got brother in law own cousin at nauplia nauplia be excellent hiding place for be under very nose of turkish governor people always looked everywhere else first must be necessary to have extremely trustworthy person who must communicate between nicholas have spoken to of nephew nephew lived at nauplia did not how very convenient nicholas must go to nauplia send nephew back to maina where must be very useful with

see without flaw seemed to solve difficulty made whole action of primate a planned inevitable must be impossible for to go to tripoli by time demand for safety have reached mehemet salik be granted must have dispersed second piece of business be to let know at monastery that arm men must not be needed a nicholas have expected in south for simultaneous outbreak in north there be also to be arranged code of signal must travel in hour two from one end of peloponnesus to other simplest system that of beacon fire seemed to be best be peculiarly well suited to country like peloponnesus where there be several range of mountain overtopped long intervening tract of hill valley be clearly visible from one from taygetus three intermediate beacon must probably carry news to hill above megaspelaion two beacon more to patras there be then two message to be conveyed to megaspelaion first that arm must be required in north so that there be need of beginning to make depot of southward a nicholas have suggested in last visit there second to arrange system of beacon with be not necessary that mitsos must give first message a nicholas have told to be ready to receive messenger man woman child who spoke of black corn for turk though must be delivered at once for second be better that carried with not only letter from nicholas also one from germanos with whom must have to arrange beacon between patras monastery also wished mitsos to take message to corinth go from there to patras where must see germanos thence return by megaspelaion not to nauplia for nicholas must already have joined petrobey back to panitza mitsos nodded who will take first message to megaspelaion asked nicholas turned to constantine whom do know there stay did not one yanko vlachos with wife maria move on to monastery land month two ago maria said mitsos maria be very good woman doubt if vlachos be use be wine bibbing mule where doe live asked nicholas at goura day journey from nemea goura

pay horse hire wage for four day if be wanted will give letter to priketes germanos what else be there only business of devil ship of know nothing to get out of kennel devil ship can wait till panitza when will be ready to start mitsos thought of white wall heartstrings throbbed within must go to morrow said pony will need day to rest nicholas rose from table walked up down once twice want yanni to stop at house of turk longer than be necessary said be bold move clever one of petrobey may become dangerous mitsos said nothing for be hard moment have not thought of evening white wall dark house on bay with suleima be honey in mouth for day past become ineffable sweetness a time drew nearer yet on other hand have not sworn to yanni oath of clan that man woman child must make tarry desired definite assurance on one point uncle nicholas said at length if went to day must yanni get out of tripoli day sooner nicholas turned round briskly why surely said when business be put through there be still little more to do until be done yanni be clapped in kennel moment be over be out mitsos sat still moment longer will start to day said be only short day journey to nemea write letter please uncle nicholas then will go know whether really matter if go to day to morrow said nicholas seeing that boy for reason wished to stop broke out mitsos think be better for to go to day sooner business be over sooner yanni come out said so nicholas raised eyebrow at outburst did not understand in least will write then at once said be true that sooner yanni come out better mitsos stood with back to looking out of window two great tear rose in eye be giving up more than one knew nicholas saw that something be wrong a mitsos did not care to enlighten be none of business have great affection for lad a passed laid hand on shoulder be good little mitsos said letter will be ready in hour will have dinner here will not set out afterwards can not go farther than nemea to night so after dinner mitsos set out again seemed to a went that heart within be being torn up a weed in vineyard be rooted for burning on journey there be thought that must soon come back be to return nicholas told not to nauplia to panitza where there must be work for to do until time came for to get out of tripoli by then everything must be ready beacon must flare across peloponnesus simultaneously in north at outbreak must begin reason for be twofold greek force be not yet sufficiently organized to conduct siege of tripoli be strongly fortified well watered heavily garrisoned kalamata however be more pregnable place water supply be bad inside citadel garrison not numerous again be port by getting possession of harbor be not defended separate from citadel must drive who escaped inland to tripoli movement in north too must have same effect tripoli be strongest fortress in peloponnesus by autumn when a nicholas hoped greek must be sufficiently organized to undertake siege must be only refuge left for turk who be still in country then must be that great blow must be struck must free whole peloponnesus in interval plan be a far a possible to cut country off from rest of world by fleet be being organized in island by mean of fire ship must destroy turkish vessel seeking to leave prevent others from coming into port for practical purpose there be only four port at corinth patras nauplia kalamata first two must be care of leader of revolution in north for kalamata nauplia nicholas petrobey have arrangement in hand night mitsos slept at nemea next day travelled across great inland plain where lie lake through length breadth of delectable country spirit of spring be abroad crocus early anemone burned in thicket dim purple iris cradled bee in chalice of gold brimming stream crossed path sunlight lay on pebbly bed in diaper of amber stencilled shadow mitsos ' pony at mid day halt ate fill of young juicy grass in lad heart spring woke echo went heavily glorious adventure to have sacrificed new found manhood fully indeed without murmur seemed to thing of little profit if have known what hard day be waiting for blank agony bitterness through be to fulfil destiny must be to be feared have turned pony head round said that impossible thing be asked of knew nothing beyond two week task now set to be committed not only by promise to nicholas to do justice own self respect by oath of clan rather than fail in must have sooner died second evening little before sunset saw goura close before standing free roomily on breezy hill side ringed with vineyard behind lay great giant of mountain range helmos cowled in snow cyllene sunset flushed be house proved to be at top of village there found maria with face smile for welcoming yanko be still in field mitsos maria talked up to date with other till came home oh yes be good husband said maria earned fine wage be a strong a horse when let wine shop alone did work of two men be strong too said when doe come home by ten in evening will be rare thing for to bring back with clout over head for foolishness why be here mitsos business said business for nicholas be yanko who can do for may tell about maria for so nicholas said be wanted to take message to monastery four day horse hire if wish will be paid will be doing good work for many on business against turk asked maria surely maria shook head doubtfully yanko be good man said be man of belly so long a there be food in plenty plenty of wine doe not care will not be long will ask be so good to see again mitsos do remember treading grape together in autumn how have grown since then height be two of yanko then yanko be very fat maria looked at approvingly with head on one side distinctly felt little sentimental mitsos reminded of nauplia of day when be so proud of being engaged to yanko while still only seventeen of having mitsos whom have always thought wonderfully good looking pleasant if not at foot at rate interested in have be more than half disposed a far a personal inclination have gone to put yanko off for bit try chance with other be safe with yanko did quite well hurt pleased to see mitsos again be better looking than ever have wonderful way with air of breeding maria did not analyze closely be what meant to estimable yanko be quite stranger brave adventure of of told main outline kinship to rapturous adoption by great mavromichales clan lent new powerful attraction when yanko heavy step be heard outside maria turned away with sigh thought seemed earlier fatter than usual illustration after supper mitsos expounded yanko always sleek have grown rather gross red shiny face small boiled looking eye presented strong contrast to mitsos ' thin bronzed cheek clear iris husband seemed glad to see agreed that mitsos ' errand have best wait till after supper so after supper mitsos expounded yanko shifted from one foot to other seemed uncomfortable said mitsos in conclusion can give horse hire for four day yanko sat silent for while then abruptly told wife to draw jug of wine maria have sharp tongue when view be dissentient from must speak more easily if be not there maria who have listened to mitsos with wide eager eye heightened color went off quickly returned in equal haste anxious not to lose anything be like yanko be saying what with that have lot of farm work on hand to tell truth little wish to mix up in affair a for four day horse hire will pay way where profit mitsos frowned wo go said half rising then must wait find one else at maria burst out shame yanko said have mule man for husband be that think of nothing piastre be afraid of taking on for two day such work a mitsos spends month in be to sit here see drinking eating sleeping never lift hand for sake of ah if be man must not have chosen wife with a little spirit a husband have maria banged wine jug down on table cast scornful look at yanko then crossed over to mitsos took glass to fill filling own at same time to said clinking glass at to health of brave men then with scowl at yanko ca even drink to who be made different to yourself if be of finer bake said be there not spirit in for must have be mile on way by time said to mitsos if have pleased good god to make man send with message to maria said mitsos suddenly yes how many day of horse hire doe yanko think must have asked for pain nay must have lit candle to virgin in joy of having such work given to do if have have to beg way mitsos remembered nicholas direction will go said must do a well a man be just father priketes have to ask for give message nonsense maria said woman ca do thing like maria indignant speech have touch of high rhetorical about be remark just stamped into earnestness will be drawing own wine for next few day said will be over hill doing what be afraid of be blithe to go said to mitsos to morrow daybreak will see on way yanko on whole be relieved must have be poor thing to send mitsos to house in quest of sturdier patriot than be offer have obviated without entailing journey on poor yanko have be born of meek quiet spirit possession of earth in company with like minded men must have seemed to sufficiently beatified prospect have desire for brave boisterous adventure new experience held for ecstasy even in matter of drinking be chiefest pleasure of life maintained certain formula of moderation never passing beyond stage of slightly fuddled head wholesome fear of maria not acute steady a rule drove home while be still perfectly capable of getting there rule of life be certain sordid mean have be subject for praise in mouth of poet who have even gone so far a to call golden be strikingly exemplified in life of cow other ruminating animal be possessed of certain admirable quality capacity for hard work real affection for eminent wife being among be surely cast in heroic mould have fine heady virtue carry own reward in constant admiration excite of more inglorious excellence have average share mitsos arrived at corinth next night after very long day found caique starting in hour two for patras have just time to leave nicholas message to mayor of town get food bargain for passage to patras for pony wind be light variable through night next day brought fine singing breeze from east about time that landed at patras maria saw below from top of pas roof of monastery ashine with evening sun from squall of rain have crossed hill afternoon little pinch eared mule went gayly down through sweet smelling pine forest clothed upper slope below monastery stood now then passed one two of monk engaged on work burning charcoal cleaning out channel led from snow water stream milky hurrying after day of sun down to vineyard others with cassock kilted up for going piloting timber laden mule down home gave maria good day good journey outside gate score so of elder men be enjoying last hour of sunlight sitting on stone bench by fountain smoking talking together one of tall white bearded let glance rest on maria a rode jauntily down path when instead of passing by on road turned mule aside up terrace in front of gate got up quickly with kindled eye spoke to brother next have come said even a nicholas told might went to meet maria god bless journey daughter said what need of maria glanced round little nervously want to speak to father priketes father said speak to have corn father said curious hush have fallen on others maria word be audible to at question rose to foot came little nearer buzzing whisper rose died away again corn for needy corn for turk asked priketes while round there be silence must have be cut with knife black corn for turk let there be famine have fifteen hundred men ready to carry when signal come will be soon not far will have to go will be needed here at kalavryta maria slipped down from mule spoke low to priketes father there be something more can not remember word be to use know what mean for mitsos nephew of nicholas told father priketes smiled say then daughter be if have gun stored in readiness southward get back will not happen just a nicholas expected will want men arm here be well what will signal be know not in few day mitsos will come from patras oh will know when see a tall a pillar face like spring morning wind on hill to see doe body good know will tell will expect mitsos then said priketes will stay here to night there will be made ready for great guest room for be honored guest room where daughter of emperor once lodged maria hesitated must get back to village to night said ought not to delay longer than need shame hospitality said priketes besides be conspirator now daughter must use circumspection of one manner of return must make at dead of night to where slept before with cause to give to morrow will go back say how pleased novice brother be to see lie be laid to account of turk who fill mouth perforce with thing how have honor of monk give mule to lad daughter will be well cared for so maria have chance took adventure quest for good of country be offered embraced for moment rose to rank of who work personally for good of country great community then passed back into level peasant life again goura a turned out took part in deed be coming land be land of monastery turk never visited sequestered valley with cruelty oppression lustful appetite yet great swelling news came to inhabitant of little mountain village only a in ear of child sea shell speaks of remotely breaking wave have to maria reality nearness that lacked to others life be crowned with knowledge that have for moment laid finger harmoniously on harp made that glorious symphony mitsos work at patras be easily done germanos be delighted with idea of forged letter from turk be frankly surprised to hear that notion be born of boy brain being something of scholar quoted very elegantly kindred notion of athene who be wisdom springing full grown from brain of zeus for mitsos ' idea so be pleased to say be complete in mature from birth mitsos did not know legend to primate referred so merely expressed gratification that scheme be considered satisfactory affair of beacon took more time for mitsos on journey south back to panitza must have to make arrangement for kindling be thus necessary that situation must be accessible to village where nicholas be known where boy must find one to undertake to fire beacon a soon a next beacon south be kindled furthermore though germanos knew country well must be best for mitsos to verify suitability of place chosen for a archbishop said might burn down pine wood on taygetus little must reck of if taygetus did not happen to be visible from lycaon must stand here like child with toy sword till good black corn grew damp hair whitened on temple a at present arranged mitsos must be back at panitza on th of march after a nicholas have told there must be more work to do before must go for yanni at tripoli be therefore certain taking shortest estimate that beacon signal must not possibly occur till march th on evening evening after signalman must be at post waiting for flame to spring up on taygetus for beacon between patras megaspelaion there must be difficulty two at high point on mountain must send message way only doubtful point be where to put beacon must be intermediate between on taygetus that on helmos latter must signal to one directly above monastery germanos be inclined to think that certain spur of lycaon lying off path to right four mile from andritsaena standing directly above old temple must serve mitsos a guiding point must answer purpose if so must be worked from andritsaena priest there at whose house mitsos must find warm welcome if stayed for night must certainly undertake mitsos went off again next day with solemn blessing of archbishop in ear touch of kindly hand in reached megaspelaion in two day here have news of maria safe arrival brave lass be said father priketes business of beacon be soon explained next morning father priketes accompanied mitsos on journey to top of pas above monastery in order to satisfy that from there point fixed upon on spur of helmos also towards patras be visible way lay through pine wood where maria have come three day before hundred little stream ran bubbling down through glen thick lush grass of spring time be starred with primrose sweet smelling violet above lay upland valley in cultivation beyond large bleak plateau of rock on top of beacon be to burn hour climb saw there strange unfriendly place with long parallel stratum of gray rock tipped by primeval convulsion onto side lying like row of razor in hollow of rock snow be still lying place be alive with whisper of new born stream few pine tree only be scattered over gaunt surface in shelter of sprang scarlet wind flower hare bell shivered on springlike stalk few minute inspection be enough to show that place be well chosen to south rose great mass of helmos must clearly see sugarcone rock proposed beacon site standing rather apart from main mountain fifteen mile to south just below lay village of leondari whither mitsos be bound towards patras contorted crag above mavromati here so priketes promised must well trusted monk watch evening from march th onward a soon a saw blaze on helmos must light own beacon waiting only to see echoed above mavromati go straight back with news to monastery turk at kalavryta so said priketes for be on kalavryta that first blow be to descend must have cause to remember vengeance of sword of god son must wield chapter v vision at bassae from village of leondari held in half circle of foothill of helmos where be to be second link in chain of beacon be impossible to see andritsaena mass of mount lycaon stood up fine clear behind where andritsaena be series of smaller peak little to west must prove so mitsos hoped to be hill above temple host climbed beacon hill took very sedulous note of next morning lad set off at daybreak to andritsaena reached in day half country through travelled unkind naked tract be not suspected by turk to be tinged with disaffection to benignant rule going be made without difficulty accident found welcome at house of priest to whom germanos have given letter after dinner two rode off on fair cloudless afternoon to hill above temple to verify visibility from taygetus on south crag of helmos on north englishman whom priest described a tall man covered with strap machine have be there year two before making wonderful drawing of place have told be temple to apollo that ancient greek name for be bassae yet like not place said father zervas hour so after departure fleecy cloud began to spin in sky a went higher found involved in fold of white fabric of mist lay a thick a blanket over hill side through sun seemed to hang white unluminous like china plate promised ill for profit of ride zervas said be worth while to push on mist must be scattered in moment if wind got up have seen roll away a housewife roll up bed linen a got higher mist seemed to thicken sun be expunged when by priest computation must be near temple must scarcely see ten yard before gaunt contorted oak tree marched swiftly into narrow field of vision out again like ghost in torment shoulder after shoulder of gray hill side sank beneath dripping with cold thick mist unutterably waste when after moving ten minute more across featureless flank of hill gigantic shadow peered at from in front great range of column faced be there mitsos ' pony tired with four day journey be lagging behind mitsos have got off to relieve on steeper part of ascent when suddenly there came from out of chill blank scream like of lost soul for one moment superstitious fear clutched at boy pony startled went off at nimbler pace to join other mitsos have to break into run to keep up then suddenly sun stared whitely through mist in five second more wind have screamed so shrilly be upon in moment hill side be covered with flying wreath of vapor wind tore smaller smaller till there be nothing left of ripped off ribbon from skirt of larger cloud drove like herded sheep down valley a mitsos gained ridge where temple stood brilliant sun sat in cloudless blue looking down upon great gray column at foot in direction new valley moment before muffled in mist be being carved out among hill side already far to south plain of kalamata rimmed with dim dark sea sparkled green through thirty mile of crisp air down in valley through have come conflicting current of air tilted mist up in tall column of whirling vapor a if from great stewing pot below a streamed up into higher air melted dissolved away in five minute whole land north south east west be naked to incomparable blue mitsos gazed in wonder at gray column seemed more to have grown out of hill than to have be built by hand of men priest hurried on be a hoped said wind have driven cloud off may come back must go quickly to top of hill lad left pony grazing by column ran up brow of hill two hundred foot above end of temple northward helmos lifted snowy finger into sky clean a cameo on south eastern face stood cone above leondari a if when hill be set upon earth by stir of force of morning have be placed there for purpose then looking southward saw taygetus rise shoulder above shoulder into blue offering dozen vantage point father zervas be cautious man seems clear enough mitsos said taygetus be big place will do for greater safety go straight south say will be at kalamata two evening from now on third night will sleep at village on pas crossing taygetus over to sparta on night directly after sundown will kindle beacon here keep kindled for two hour in time will be able to choose well seen place for blaze on taygetus look be even a said mist gather again wind of god have favored work be done even a spoke long tongue of mist shot up from valley below came licking up hill like spent water of wave on level beach mitsos ran down quickly in order to find pony in case have strayed even thirty forty yard before cloud swallowed up again found where have left browsing contentedly on spicy tuft of thyme sweet mountain grass for couple of minute more before earth sky be blotted out stared amazedly at tall gray ruin stood there crowning silence strength of hill still unknown to few traveller to shepherd fed flock in summer on hill top memorial of life death of worship of beauty god of sunlight health imperishable youth waited there till priest joined be surprised to see cross a passed by door into temple asked why did so be story of devil said folk tell about here whether believe know not so be careful will make haste down valley for be not good to be here after night mist have risen again over whole hill side not thickly a turned to go mitsos looking back saw strange shaft of light streaming directly out of ruined door of temple effect doubt of sun be near setting striking through thin layer of cloud look said to priest one might almost think temple be lit from within father zervas looked round when saw dropped lamentably off horse onto knee on ground began muttering prayer crossing while mitsos looked at in surprise saw that face be deadly pale strangling anguish gripped at muscle of throat light cast through temple door meantime have be choked by gathering mist when father zervas looked up from prayer be gone quick quick cried to mitsos be not good to be here mounting on pony fairly clattered down hill side did not draw bridle till have reached main road from andritsaena mitsos followed half amused conscious of lurking fear in mind fear bred by memory of winter evening of childhood when used to hear strange story of shape larger than human have be seen floating like leaf in wind round old temple on acropolis cry came from hill of aegina where stood house of god human habitation at sound of villager in hamlet below must bolt door crouch fearfully round fire making house good a said by reiterated sign of cross then a grew older familiarity with morning evening night in lonely place have caused story to be half forgotten remembered only a remembered other terror pain of childhood general distrust of dark storm came swooping down from gaunt hill above nauplia now when saw flying skirt of father zervas waving dimly from mist in front heard hurried clatter of pony foot followed at good speed in confusion of mind zervas have stopped on reaching high road here mitsos caught up ah ah gasped be sore trial lord have sent for be braver than hare when come to dealing with be human thing be even a demetri said for evil one be there one whom saw under form of young man very fair to look upon evil altogether son of devil wiped dew of horror from brow mitsos must have felt disposed to laugh have not man terror be so real what did see father asked for saw naught light shining through door be be said zervas have promised germanos to see to beacon business on hill will have to watch while perhaps young man evil fair watch for below can not pas way for heart be cold water at thought will have to climb up from other valley so pas not place then perhaps with holy cross on breast image of crucified in hand will go unhurt what be demetri saw asked mitsos be way said father zervas who be growing little more collected a attained greater distance from temple one evening spring evening a might be to day demetri of village whom know be driving sheep down from hill above temple where beacon will be being later than knew sun have set ere came down to where temple stand therefore a must not herd sheep in dark down glen bethought to encamp there for night be warm have food enough with wine for two men inside temple be of two room into hindermost of penned sheep in other lit sparkle of fire sat down to eat supper having finished supper lay down to sleep wink of sleep came near feeling restless sat up smoked awhile unrest gained on twitching at limb bidding go so out fared on hill side to see if must find sleep there at rate get air for seemed to that temple have grown unseasonably warm that be filled with sweet subtle perfume outside be cooler so laying in hollow of hill opposite temple gate nestled down among grass again tried to sleep illustration in centre of great chamber stood one whom dazzled eye to look upon seemed to that from below there came dim song such a men sing on feast day looking down to see whence such voice came saw even a saw strong great light shining out of temple door next moment came clattering pattering of foot out through door rushed sheep must have leaped barrier of bough have put up ran scattering dumb frightened in direction got up hurried down to stop be left for a for herding be gone might a well have tried to herd moon beam for night be dark for space illuminated by great light shone out from temple so down ran at temple door stopped for in centre of great chamber stood one whom dazzled eye to look upon fair be young lithe a deer on mountain from face there shone beauty glory belong not to mortal man line of body be soft with graciousness of youth firm with strength of man over one shoulder be slung quiver of gold left hand held golden bow golden sandal be on foot on head wreath of wild laurel for rest be a naked a night of full moon in may a glorious two finger of hand held bow be rested on head of one of demetri ram father of flock beast stood there quiet not afraid other light be there in temple splendor turned place to summer noonday sprang from only in front of youth still smouldered fire by demetri have eaten supper seemed in blaze filled temple to have burned low dim like candle in sunlight little blue smoke from came towards full of wonderful sweet perfume sheep frightened have collected again round in light must see to right left score upon score of white head twitching ear stood close to huddled yet looked at immortal thing within temple a stood there stricken to stone marvelling at beauty of youth forgetting in wonder to be afraid god yet god be only evil said zervas hastily again crossing raised eye to said 'thou makest sheep pen of sanctuary art thou not afraid to do thing spoke so said demetri not harshly in lustre of eye there be something so matchless beyond compare that knelt down said 'forgive lord for knew not that be thine ' then said other penalty yet for thine honor ram be mine ' struck beast lightly on head at sank down moved more then said god again 'it be long since have looked on race not so fair be now a be in olden day in truth demetri be ugly loon 'but shalt thou learn of how joy be better than self sacrifice beauty than wisdom fear of god look at only proof be here ' at held out hand to demetri be suddenly smitten by knowledge that beautiful youth be more evil than beast of field in wild despair bethought of only safety made in air though feebly for heart be nigh surrendered sign of cross with shuddering blackness came over spirit eye when came to be lying on dew drenched pavement of temple close to ram dead with violent mark upon looking in at temple door coming not in rest of flock of none be missing morning be red in east be ten year ago demetri will scarce speak of even to day have half thought before that be idle tale when saw light shining out through temple door hour ago be freshly borne to that be true albeit one of dark thing of world at can not even guess yet a christ protected demetri will surely protect when go on beacon work for be work lest tempt god will climb up hill on other side keep eye away from temple plant holy cross between mitsos knew not what to make of fact that demetri have in zervas phrase wine for two men with might have explained significance of what have seen being greek mind be fruitful soil for thing ghostly superstitious be very strange said yet father will not go back from work will do faithfully said zervas for thus will be in hand of lord chapter vi three little men fall off horse be middle of march when mitsos again found climbing steep hill side into panitza night have fallen two hour before clear keen be sky keen vigor of mountain air crescent moon early setting have slipped behind snowy spearhead of taygetus heaven be aglow with star burning frostily work have be done quickly well after have seen beacon at bassae three night before shine like glowworm to north then shoot out little tongue of flame lick low lying star have travelled night day only giving minimum of sleep walking a much a rode to spare pony seemed a came into panitza with mitsos only resting hand on neck to be more weary of two went up village street to petrobey house found door into court yard closed only osman at first answered knocking by furious barking osman oh osman called mitsos be quiet boy let hear within osman recognized voice whined impatiently while mitsos knocked again at last heard house door open petrobey voice calling out who be there be cousin shouted boy be mitsos petrobey ran across court yard next moment osman tumbled out to welcome mitsos of clan led pony in ah be good to see little mitsos said petrobey have come very quick did not expect till to morrow yes have come quick said mitsos oh cousin talk to before have eaten for be hungrier than hare in winter pony be weaker than for weariness give said petrobey go inside will find supper ready nicholas be here nay be not fitting that must look to pony said mitsos little mitsos get in said petrobey there be woodcock for supper haunch of roe deer nicholas have eaten eel led pony off for have heard from nicholas of mitsos ' oath to yanni how though for reason nicholas did not understand mitsos have be very loath to leave nauplia have gone at once with fine instinct so unreasonable yet so beautiful to wait on man admires wished to do little service for boy nicholas have talked matter over petrobey said be clear that mitsos be in love nicholas be inclined to agree though a to engager of affection must risk guess mitsos ate prodigious supper nicholas having given handful of tobacco for pipe declared capable of talking put forth to full account of journey in turn asked what news much news said little bad great deal good bad come first be nicholas be afraid that will soon be known at tripoli that be here will be unseasonable thing four day ago met two turkish soldier think recognized be going to tripoli will not suit at if send again to ask to find for have other work to do already clan be moving up into mountain so a to be ready for work to send twenty men again after nicholas be what will not do be small thing cousin said nicholas be thought of yanni in tripoli sits heavy on at present of course be perfectly safe supposing message come that be ordered to be at tripoli in three day petrobey laughed mehemet salik dare not said absolutely dare not how fat little yanni will be when come out turk eat five time day have cause to suspect if worst come to worst can send out men to search for mitsos yawned yet wish yanni be here said for love yanni have sworn to oath of clan be sleepier than wintering dormouse when do suppose may go for cousin in week le hope in interval there be fire ship work for to learn of to morrow so get to bed little mitsos mitsos got up with eye full of sleep stretched bed with sheet said oh thank mother of god for bed also for woodcock roe deer remarked petrobey good night little one next two day mitsos spent in learning working of fire ship morning before daybreak nicholas used to leave village lie hidden in pine wood on hill above returning with mitsos at on second evening a got near house saw turkish soldier in road on horseback holding two other horse nicholas stepped quickly out of moonlight into shadow beckoned to mitsos to do same mean trouble said knew knew go in mitsos will wait in alder clump by mill going out of village for there will be news for to bring stole along in shadow of wall until be out of sight mitsos waited till be gone then walked unconcernedly forward whistling while at gate soldier stopped yassak said mean there be passing mitsos stared stood silent moment running over in mind small vocabulary of turkish abuse ugh cross legged one where be hat said rudely cheerfully why must not see cousin there be passing said turk with drew out pistol mitsos hesitated moment be quite willing to rush in take chance of bullet going wide for held turk in light esteem a marksman since adventure with yanni doubted wisdom of scheme for there be a horse showed at least two more inside so turned on heel will go back home then said will find more little men there saying may not see father go home too little man if be a wise a be little eat sweet with woman of master harem wash dirty face man answered nothing for knew well that to fire shot in village of mavromichales be to put own head into nest of hornet must sting sore others have entered village very quietly after dark so a not to provoke attention have be fortunate enough to get to petrobey house without being noticed mitsos went along quietly enough till be out of sight then ran a have never run before to alder clump where must find nicholas quick quick whispered tell what to do there be turkish soldier at petrobey will not let in oh uncle bodes good for yanni what will do ah be even so said nicholas sit mitsos let think for five minute so sat quite silent at last nicholas spoke make doubt what have happened said be bad men have come to petrobey from mehemet salik mean arrest have in hollow of hand for if go not there be yanni in tripoli go must what be before be yanni must be got out of tripoli at once petrobey must escape on way there how will do oh little mitsos think a thought before ask blessed saint to speak to nicholas crushed hand to temple be not all added clan must be warned at once what have happened be useless for to attempt rescue of petros before yanni be out of tripoli for so life will be forfeit too must ah will give up to turk why uncle nicholas asked mitsos fairly puzzled because be easier for two men to escape than one also because if get away from village with petrobey without alarm given to clan will make le haste to tripoli for if be with will not fear must get to yanni first oh mitsos be good thought of mine clan must keep very quiet let little men think know what be happening then be off for yanni asked mitsos on instant where be horse at petrobey then go round to house of cousin go to demetri get horse off with there be time to lose stay know where be to go from tripoli must escape by night go

will be there will go round village see that whole clan know have happened where will join on taygetus then will give up now little mitsos god speed remember that love be very careful very quiet yanni life depends on so mitsos stole off in darkness to go to demetri house nicholas went back to village to warn clan in hour time messenger have started to village round saying what have happened giving clan to know where be to go when few preparation remained with regard to storing of powder be completed also definitely saying that outbreak must begin a soon a possible by siege of kalamata then nicholas went to petrobey house found soldier still in road opposite with horse there be passing said know to whom be speaking said nicholas haughtily be nicholas vidalis of whom may have heard answer be what anticipated found covered by soldier pistol while latter shouted to inside here be nicholas vidalis then addressing nicholas said move shoot nicholas stood quite still for have wish to move to be shot while soldier ran out from house suppose have authority for said there will be settling between authority of mehemet salik said second soldier governor of tripoli to arrest petros mavromichales bring to tripoli have be speaking in turkish nicholas with intention asked next question in greek for what be arrested know greek said soldier god be praised for thought nicholas repeated question in turkish for seditious design against sovereign power of sultan deputy in tripoli mehemet salik nicholas laughed that sound serious will go inside gentleman be prisoner deliver up arm handed soldier pistol knife stepped in must advise added to come in too for if of hot headed clan see turk standing there will not stand there long entire come in friend for though be maliciously accused be fault of yours must not see blood blood of clan shed soldier followed advice led horse inside barring gate behind petrobey have heard nicholas voice great wave of relief came over have be sitting there quite silent guarded by two soldier in dumb agony of fear not for for yanni that must escape somehow other on way to tripoli did not doubt escape meant death to yanni if still in town a letter from mehemet said while if delivered up at tripoli moment war of independence began death to of only consolation have be that nicholas at least be safe must have be back hour before unless in way alarm have be given appearance now coming in peacefully calmly must mean that knew what have happened have wise thought within mitsos at thought of mitsos looked up suddenly at nicholas in sudden hope that mitsos have started for tripoli a caught be eye latter nodded smiled petrobey felt certain that nicholas have answered question have silently asked nicholas sat down cheerfully continued to speak in turkish be strange mistake said will not be sorry to pay respect to excellency in tripoli duty have hitherto neglected one of soldier smiled excellency will not be sorry to see sent for if remember last autumn cousin wrote letter saying that bastard kinsman must be sought for sent when found be little disconcerting nicholas waved hand lightly private quarrel merely between cousin said have long ago be made up eh cousin then in greek talk greek god be thanked petrobey nodded assent set off to morrow nicholas said very early in morning to night have guest with be time for supper please seat yourselves gentleman poor fare be afraid did not know that must be honored by presence to night petrobey clapped hand servant brought supper be big strong lad of yanni age son of small farm holding tenant on petrobey land who have be left orphan while still quite young boy petrobey have brought up in own house a half servant half companion to yanni exacting little service receiving complete devotion put on supper said in greek keep ear well open boy brought in food sat down together meal have only be prepared for three a mitsos be to have be one of three turk be small eater there seemed to be plenty of food three soldier from living among greek have relaxed religious abstinence from wine where wine be good meal went on merrily enough nicholas in particular talking laughing with speaking turkish with wonderful fluency accuracy under pretext of petrobey not speaking turkish at easily be soon arranged between nicholas that must speak in greek nicholas act a interpreter translating into turkish remark made to guest guest conversation into greek so came about long before meal be over petrobey be fully acquainted with mitsos departure for tripoli also nicholas idea for next day discussed at length without arousing least suspicion own manner of escape nicholas suggested must be made a soon a possible on journey if must be managed at first halt for mitsos must have have twelve hour start must have have time to get yanni safely out advantage of doing early must be that must still be travelling in country of clan who must be necessary turn out to cover retreat nicholas suggested that must have recourse to very simple expedient have tried with success once before lad constantine must come with proposed carrying food for mid day meal a be six hour to next village nicholas petrobey boy must be quite unarmed turk secure in knowledge that yanni be still hostage must not thought attempt to bind however must ascertain during meal must be ample full of wine boy must be instructed to cut girth of turk horse get away home a fast a might be then after decent interval must think about going on petrobey mounting a quick a must must ride cheerfully off at full speed across country towards taygetus soldier added nicholas with admirable gravity will attempt to do same wish little mitsos be here to see for doe good to see mitsos laugh be conveyed in short sentence interpolated with petrobey supposed reply to turk petrobey who have taken care constantine must be in room while be going on said to carelessly holding out glass if completely understand constantine fill glass with water then go if not give wine to nicholas constantine took water jug in hand filled petrobey glass left room incidentally nicholas while speaking in turkish have begged soldier that might start very early for there must be big trouble thought among clan if saw chief riding off guarded by turk desire explained be to get to tripoli a soon a possible for a knew petrobey only son be held hostage there by mehemet salik feared that if there be disturbance among mavromichales if god forbid clan be so foolish a to fire upon petrobey might be held responsible must go hardly with son to assented saying also provided two prisoner must come unarmed hostage in tripoli must be considered security enough must go like gentleman upon journey though be not very early next morning when started village following nicholas direction of night before showed sign of life closer observer might have noticed stealthy face at window hastily suddenly withdrawn for clan who must have laid money on nicholas petrobey if ottoman force be out against who have keen sense of humor regarded affair a practical joke of most magnificent order for nicholas have told night before what method of escape be to be so procession with one soldier in front nicholas petrobey in centre guarded on outside by other two with constantine behind driving pony laden with food wine for mid day meal went unmolested though watched by appreciative audience out of village down steep hill into plain nicholas relieved tedium of way with most racy delightful story then went on in utmost harmony three hour later be come to large pleasant smelling pine wood about half way through where bridle path joined one be in leading up towards farther hill village of taygetus chanced upon clear way side stream here petrobey proposed must halt for dinner abundance of juicy grass grew round water thirty yard farther down tethering horse there so that must not stray for must be just out of sight of place where master ate petrobey told constantine to get ready food however sun shone rather warm on spot at suggestion of one of soldier moved little higher up into shade of tree constantine waited assiduously on guest until have eaten fill then bringing more wine from cold basin in stream where have put to regain coolness retired little distance off to eat of remains of dinner execute order steal homeward others drank smoked chatted for quarter of hour more till nicholas observing that sun have already passed meridian suggested that a have long day before if be a trusted to reach tripoli next night must be wise to start soldier assented drowsily for have again drunk somewhat freely at prisoner expense moved off to where have left horse accoutrement nicholas must not suppress chuckle of amusement when saw that constantine have taken precaution of loosening flint from hammer of gun then saying suddenly to petrobey now two ran forward unpicketed horse swinging into saddle spurred through belt of tree separated from pathway towards taygetus heard exclamation of dismay surprise from soldier feeble click of loose flint against steel next moment be off full gallop up steep hill road then followed scene must have made mouth of clan to be full of laughter for first soldier vaulted with agility into saddle started gallantly off in pursuit closely followed by second who have done same first went bravely for about six yard second for rather le then rolled off right left clutching wildly at horse mane one into stream other into fine furze bush third bulky man be rather more fortunate for being incapable of jumping into saddle put foot nimbly into stirrup only to find horse standing beside barebacked with expression of innocent surprise with curious feeling experienced when be fain to walk up step find there be step to walk up next half hour went wearily hotly for by sacrificing one girth patched up other two one went up pathway towards taygetus in pursuit while other rode on to tripoli two most agile a being lighter weight took task upon while heavier one who must not ride bareback without pain to person walked sorrowfully on heavy saddle in one hand horse bridle in other three hour tramp to next village where hoped to have dilapidation repaired adventure of first who rode after escaped prisoner be short hour ride brought to outskirt of village be humming like hive of bee humorous mavromichales who inhabited in number who be excellent marksman sent few bullet whistling close round one went little to right slightly to left third sang sweetly over head fourth raised little puff of dust at foot occurred to that might perhaps be able to aim straighter if wished for there be devilish precision about closeness of shot made heart turn cold with one more glance sufficient however to show nicholas petrobey bowing politely in midst of clan turned tail just galloped back along road have come chapter vii mitsos disarranges house roof from panitza to grythium be reckoned two day of twelve hour three of eight mitsos who set off about ten at night got there within thirty hour of time started thus arriving well before daybreak on second morning at sundown day looking over valley of sparta from hill leading up to pas into plain of tripoli timed to be there two hour before sunrise thus allowing plenty of time for yanni to get out of town before folk be awake for present a moon be up pushed forward along road reserving halt for two dark hour after midnight have eaten little day eyelid felt like eye of doll laden with weight must drag down knowing that if slept must gravely risk over sleeping paced up down by edge of field where have tethered demetri pony eating crust of bread washed down with rather sour wine have got at gythium now then must pause for moment felt physically incapable of keeping awake except by moving fearing to fall down sleep if stopped began tramping up down without cessation luckily have pouch of tobacco pipe tinder box smoked continuously be better to be moving than waiting when judged that pony of like wise men be more careful than of have have sufficient rest set out again have wrapped capote close round for night be cold be just beginning to feel that if hoped to keep awake have better get down trot by pony side when beast stumbled on heap of stone in trying to recover stumbled again pitched forward right onto knee throwing mitsos off mitsos be unhurt picked up quickly poor brute be cut to bone stood trembling with pain terror a mitsos examined for one moment boy broke down oh holy virgin cried what will do next moment steadied paused to think be still four hour before daybreak by time must have to be out of town tripoli be still two hour ride distant to get there in time with pony be hopelessly out of question to get there on own leg seemed out of question too for be a weary a young man need ever hope to feel if there be choice lay there meanwhile what to do with beast to leave there cut bleeding in pain through night only to die on bare hill be cruel thing mitsos decided quickly led very gently off road among tree with strange feeling of tenderness for that have carried gallantly done must do for yanni have met death in doing kissed white star on down dropped head then drawing pistol put to ear turning eye away fired poor beast dropped like log mitsos with sob in throat looked not behind went back through tree throwing away coat only encumbered set teeth went jog trotting to tripoli how next hour passed scarcely knew felt so utterly tired beaten that be hardly conscious of very weariness probably dulled power of sensation knew be that a pushed on with limb dropping from fatigue eye aching for very weariness hammering of pulse in temple tree by road side seemed to pas of own movement by like ghost now then tripped over uneven stony road scarce seemed worth while to make effort to recover more than once felt knew only dimly that trouser be torn on stone knee be cut bleeding thought of pony have fallen cut felt vaguely envious of fate lower down pas where hill began to melt into plain grew warmer in half dream of exhaustion for moment thought that treeless hollow of hill be bay of nauplia lying cool dark beneath night nauplia bay white wall seemed that time belonged to boy called mitsos not boy who have be happier than king of earth whereas be foot sore utterly beaten piece of consciousness must plod along white ribbon of road forever then suddenly a thought sky lightened grew gray with dawn next moment day have broken with swiftness of south when sun lifted above hill to east showed tripoli shining in dawn still about mile off mitsos stopped dead be too late during day must be impossible for to get into governor house during day time before blessed night fell again soldier from panitza must be there petrobey must have escaped trusting to getting to tripoli first must be who be yanni oh boy have travelled with once have have fine time believed have promised to come get out of tripoli then suddenly with sob beat hand together oh yanni yanni cried little yanni there have be white frost during night field be stiff glistening have just enough sense to strike off road lie down under shade of tree sheltered from sun untouched by frost there rolled over on side next moment be sleeping deep dreamlessly like child tired with play there lay without moving one arm shielding face from light when woke be past mid day blessed gift of sleep have restored body mind trouble in brain have run down like tainted water of spate leaving clear lucent strength have come back to limb sat there quarter of hour longer thinking intently have self reproach to interpose between quest accident have be purely out of own control have done what must have seemed to impossible if have not done then took stock of position position be that soldier might be expected at time after four afternoon a must not be dark till six there be nothing to do go on to tripoli wait watching road from sparta if came before dark determined to make attempt to get in desperate though might be for when once have given report to mehemet salik there must be no more yanni so went on ate at greek khan within town then strolled back to square examined house again once door opened went quickly down side street for fear porter who have seen before might recognize then took look at wall by hoped to get access to house under influence of food sleep spirit of courage have revived about two o'clock went back again down street leading into sparta road sitting down little distance from kept eye fixed on point where vanished round first hill side three o'clock passed four five thin white cloud in west began to be tinged with rose mitsos heart tapped quicker in hour must be dark time for attempt sat on there till nearly six darkness began to fall in layer over sky color to fade out of thing then giving one last look up road turned went into town again when arrived at square little oil lamp at corner be already lit figure of men seemed like shadow turned down street where low wall stood found to annoyance that only few pace down be cafe have be empty during day be now beginning to fill with guest for most part turkish soldier be obliged to wait have apparently only come in for glass of mastic before dinner in quarter of hour there be only left there cafe keeper who seemed to be dozing over glass old greek countryman in fustanella dress mitsos who have stationed hundred yard off drew deep breath stole noiselessly back in shadow of wall by standing on heap of rubbish lay there must get finger on top of wall slipping off shoe so that toe might more easily make use of crevice between stone worked slowly up in moment be crouching on top then came easier more dangerous task for a crept along roof of house where yanni be figure must be silhouetted against sky roof be not more than four foot above top of lower garden wall bending over raised up wriggled snake wise along edge yanni room in front of stood pillar by meant to climb down into balcony be second room from end judging distance a well a must glided along for about nine foot then began to make way slowly down roof have calculated distance well when be about half way down tiled roof be lightly built over lath be not constructed to bear weight of superincumbent giant suddenly creaked beneath next moment gave way with crash fit to wake dead be precipitated with shower of tile right into yanni room within few foot of where yanni be sitting with arm tied behind mitsos did not think whether be hurt not picked up showed to yanni yanni gave one wild gasp of astonishment oh dear mitsos said have not come too soon quick cut rope whipped out knife have hardly cut rope when heard key grate in lock mitsos taking one step to behind door sprang out like wild cat on yanni keeper who lived next door have not unnaturally come in to see what have happened threw to ground while yanni without second hesitation bound thick scarf round mouth by way of gag now rope said mitsos tied arm to side leg together looked at other moment there be porter said yanni will be here shut door mitsos lock inside next moved bedstead furniture must against door barred window yanni gave additional twist to scarf bound turk mouth there be not much time said mitsos pulling table out of heap of furniture have piled at door climbed onto with one vigorous effort brought down tile be lying loosely between hole entrance have made outside wall from table must easily spring up onto top of wall lying along reached down two great hand to yanni yanni grasped with much kicking struggling not having mitsos ' inch got on top mitsos turned to with suppressed bubble of laughter eh yanni whispered be truth said when told must grow very fat come quickly ah there be porter at door one outside one inside two on roof descent be easily accomplished by good luck street be empty waiting moment for mitsos to put on shoe again two ran a hard a must down away from square keeping in shadow of wall from end of cross street led out to western gate of town drawing near cautiously saw have be already shut sentry be standing by once again be wit wedded to mitsos ' strength be to stand in good stead mitsos whispered will open gate for for have be market day go then down road will follow in shadow of wall then when open gate to hold very fast will take key from run through oh cousin must be quick mitsos did not quite understand object of taking key walking straight on asked to be let out from market asked sentry surely going home to thana said mitsos naming village near man took out key unbarred unbolted door moment lock be turned mitsos grasped tightly round arm from behind sentry be little man struggle in mitsos ' grasp be of faintest when mitsos with brilliant smile whispered scream kill enforcing fragmentary turkish with precautionary nudge of elbow be a silent a grave in mean time yanni have passed taking key from lock fitted into outside of gate said hurriedly to mitsos quick cousin throw away mitsos still smiling kindly lifted turk off foot with mighty swing threw a yanni suggested onto road where fell pitiably in heap once free from mitsos called in lamentable voice for mohammed prophet next moment yanni have shut gate locked thrown key away into bush lined road two looked at other for moment then mitsos broke into roar of good wholesome laughter a unlike a possible to exhibition to have treated yanni after affair of powder mill yanni joined in for few second stood there shaking helpless mitsos recovered first oh yanni cried must laugh till morning be there not other thing to do come away there will be sleep for night keep to road at present go westward come will talk afterwards for two hour jogged on a fast a yanni must for month of living in confinement of house garden have made hole a said in bellow a for fat of why mitsos be thing of shame there be wind in for more than running be in silence climbed steep road into mountain between tripoli plain of megalopolis be cut in half by small valley lying between two row of hill with sharp descent into from side going down into yanni recovered wind little on edge of valley a mitsos knew stood small khan keeper of be father friend a light still shone in window yanni entered to rest awhile get provision for morning anastasis be glad to see asked what be doing there at time mitsos knowing man told in few word story of escape begged if there be pursuit from tripoli to say that have just passed going to megalopolis for see put in yanni observing that host wit be not of quickest be not going to megalopolis will be fine gain of time to if seek there after interval appeared to anastasis to be most admirable joke for five minute more a be cutting bread meat kept bursting out into chuckle of delight turned to mitsos saying then will find not at megalopolis eh who must have thought mitsos hurried yanni off again have not probably more than hour start though will take not little time to clear way into room said mitsos though through steepness of ascent horse must go quicker than man there be time to waste struck off road little southward straight in direction of taygetus night went sometimes walking more often running when morning dawned found on lower foot hill of taygetus still day journey from rendezvous yanni declared must go farther for present eye be full of sleep stomach be dust within leg be one ache so mitsos after five minute climb to top of neighboring ridge came back with tidings that must not discern man beast village decreed that must lie here day not start again till near sunset then said yanni will be long talk will have before sunset mitsos if day of judgment be breaking not one word must say for have slept ah be good to be with again turned over be asleep at once mitsos be not long in following example woke first seeing by sun that be not much after mid day got up quietly so a not to disturb yanni went in search of water found quarter of mile below returned to yanni who have just awoke took food down to spring ate there then at mitsos suggestion went back again to first camping place for where there be spring said there may be folk want folk little now said yanni a settled again begin at beginning mitsos tell went straight to nauplia first night said arrived there very late after midnight then next day went off next day asked yanni be that care about suleima oh tell how be suleima mitsos frowned oh never mind suleima said be affair well next day yanni interrupted did not see suleima asked why did not wait that night see uncle nicholas have other work for to do yanni looked at mitsos moment then laid hand on shoulder mitsos dear mitsos said oh be so sorry be not that know that made go be oath of clan swore to mitsos hate for surely there be one like mitsos looked up smiling nonsense yanni be promise oath thing to make break besides seems to be pretty lucky came when did what do suppose must be thinking now if have got back to panitza found be too late for in truth be not much too soon what if have come to tripoli a be to night instead of last night illustration be good to be with again ' will tell afterwards what must have found said yanni

panitza for rest concluded will have to ask uncle nicholas father there be not many thing in world of be certain yanni one be that will find safe sound on taygetus yanni pulled up handful of sweet smelling thyme buried face in for moment ah be good to be on hill again mitsos said to be with will not forget mother of god story be very short be glad have not be longer tell said mitsos well for week perhaps fortnight ate slept one day be like saw mehemet salik not more than once twice used always to ask if be comfortable have that wished for be true that wished for hill for be thing must not have given so always said wanted nothing then for week so must come see oftener asked about father clan whether nicholas have be seen there again may be sure always told that clan be good men quiet liver who worked hard in field thanked god day that master turk be kind just to that seems be mistake for smiled turk know not how to laugh mitsos not with open mouth said be very interesting to hear that from one of clan about nicholas said have seen when be little be never otherwise remarked mitsos oh cousin said yanni mother bore silly loon be not to go on with story then go on big yanni said mitsos so went till five six day ago then on one morning said yanni suddenly flushing with anger came in looking white cunning with evil face turk who be guardian followed be good man mitsos save that come of accursed race mehemet said to beo clan be good men quiet thank god that have such kind master yanni who be of clan think do wisely think answered for seemed to wished for answer at anger suddenly flared up said 'answer dog will have hide flayed off noticed a curious mitsos that face grew white a got angry whereas when proper man be angry face be a sunset did not give time to answer for went on 'you be dog though be handsome dog greek be necessary to tie dog up sometimes thank god have kind master yanni let hand be tied behind quietly ' must do ' asked wise ' said ' threaten twice ' so a there be none to help let be done mitsos gave great gulp oh yanni by cross legged turk said what be to do must have helped to fight afterwards to be beaten mehemet saw be more at ease when be done drew chair little closer will soon teach to be quiet obedient like rest of clan ' said 'and now for what came to say will soon see nicholas again for have sent for for father if come well good really care whether come not for barking dog hurt nobody however have be barking too loud if come little yanni will have to think what to do with have not decided yet devil came closer to mitsos looked at a man look at fowl sheep in market there will be rope for big brown neck of yours yet know for be handsome boy must like to see about house perhaps to hand rose water after dinner let see must dress in blue waistcoat with silver braid red kaftan think red legging with yellow shoe think must give knife pistol in belt for fancy have temper of own be pity that handsome boy like must be so fierce perhaps might even arrange that be fitted to attend on woman folk in case will be mine will belong to good kind master yanni voice have risen spoke quickly with red hot anger vibrating growing said to cried rising to foot to free born of clan who have never have dealing with accursed race except to spit at a went by sat there said nothing for reason mitsos remembered oath of clan have sworn believed a believe that holy mother of god hears that must come be soon late that must eat word with sauce of death to black curse of who mocked at christ upon steady yanni said mitsos looking up at blazing eye sit down tell rest what mitsos cried yanni be block of stone log who be of blood with know be not mehemet salik be not on hill side tell rest if be here must never more return to bestiality of daily life yanni sat down again even so then day after day must come in white cursing a before say 'the time be drawing near little yanni will be here to morrow next day a might be yesterday morning said 'they will be here to night ' for never doubted mitsos thought to myself 'then will not be here to night ' a for knew that must never sit in house of turk be think there be short silence yanni stretched out hand to mitsos so to dearest of said life once at mill now once again life honor freedom yet be debt burden to because love still must be other way have skill of speech mitsos know certainly that gladly must give eye right hand for be figure of talk only mitsos took hand held out to shut between looking at yanni with serious mouth smile in dark eye god send tear for water salt for bread said again quoting oath of clan if fail in need love not who love hate not who hate sun be already declining to western hill presently after went down to spring to eat drink before began tramp through night neither of have be over ground before be likely that must soon come into path leading from arcadian plain to one other of village near langarda pas in case even though there be night plunging through heather undergrowth before must scarcely be more than twelve hour journey thus starting at six must be at place by dawn after stowing remains of provision in pocket began ascent upward went out of day into sunset through sunset into moonrise from moonrise into declining of moon air warm below soon grew colder breath a walked hung frostily in still night now then whiff of sweet smelling shrub streamed across again roosting pigeon with bold noise of uprising started still sleepy from perch in among whisper of fir hawk more cautious slid into air to yanni born on mountain bred in open spell of sound scent wander along hill side at night be unutterably sweet sweet comradeship of incomparable cousin in mitsos too feeling towards friend have saved from death worse than death be father to very tender affection for be gentle heart beat so boldly at hint of danger sweetness of self sacrifice made most content child within spoke to spirit of suleima boy found want fulfilled in comradeship of yanni made answer with talk of brave adventure done in part more to do about midnight halted already must see height long distance above dappled with snow mitsos observing knew that have come a high a have need to go for beacon ground remembered be just below line where fresh snow lay have hour before struck sort of sheep track led in right direction found that here went still upward leaving to climb by struck off to right after eating remains of food to follow contour of mountain through tract of pine open place across scolding stream that rattled down from snow above round deep cut ravine broadened out into larger valley by degree star paled at approach of day dark velvet blue of southern night brightened to dove color few bird awoke in bush with sleepy half tuned twitterings then sun great bold looked up over rim of mountain look be day said yanni be nearly there yes said mitsos there be beacon hill who be swiftly down hill side towards came great man leaping running like boy oh quick down with said mitsos think there be one man who can go like be best ah thought so show can run too in two minute nicholas with face a welcome a morning be with chapter viii message of fire greek camp be being formed here nestled airily on unfrequented side of taygetus be square half of lying on side of rattling stream loud at time from melting snow flowed down steep ravine into plain of kalamata lay about five hundred yard below site of beacon conspicuous stony plateau on top of isolated hill separated on side by steep narrow gully from main mass of mountain be nicholas who have chosen spot chosen wisely for while camp lay concealed sheltered from northern wind top of hill just above from man must run down in two minute to headquarters be eyry for observation on north commanded arcadian plain corner of mitsos yanni have just crossed on west whole valley of messenia with capital kalamata lay unfurled like map directly under to south wound langarda pas over taygetus from messenia to sparta camp be walled with robust barrier of brushwood peopled with small hut built on framework of pole between be interwoven branch of fir heather roofed with reed furze in centre just on right of stream stood hut shared by petrobey nicholas built in exactly same manner a others only distinguished by blue white flag floated over bearing prophetically cross of greece risen above crescent of turkey towards top of enclosure have stood belt of pine most of have be felled for building purpose one here there only having be left to give support to structure of much more solid weather proof workmanship be divided inside into two chamber in one of be stored powder ammunition in other rifle sword additional protection be given to powder magazine by coat of felt be nailed on above board of roof camp be alive humming like hive of bee when three arrived for train of mule from district round yanni mitsos have made first journey have just come in bringing secret grinding of mill from kalyvia tsimova be first consignment of powder have arrived petrobey be superintending stowage in magazine elsewhere thin blue smoke of wood fire over men be cooking coffee for breakfast rose up straight into air flicking flashing of ax in morning sun showed others still at work on pine felling during last two night many party of clan patriot from village round have be arriving with arm provision herd of sheep goat be browsing on scrub clad side of ravine below camp already there be not fewer than two hundred men there before three day petrobey hoped that whole depot consisting of eight hundred men with arm ammunition must be assembled farther along side of mountain there be three similar camp thus total number of men who must march down from taygetus onto kalamata must be tale of over three thousand be drawn from laconia argolis south of arcadia number must be raised to close on five thousand by addition from populous messenian plain patriot in north of greece must at beacon signal rise simultaneously in achaia a soon a camp contained complement of men in camp discipline organization be thoroughly ordered carried out body of younger more active be stationed on top of hill with instruction to report at once movement might observe in country round to stop vi et armis turk who be seen going up pas from messenia into sparta for fear of news being taken to tripoli of assembling of patriot danger however be inconsiderable camp be nestled away from view in hollow of unvisited mountain side only circumstance of suspicion be that within few day many greek have left village with laden mule with flock even be not unusual at spring time of year for be common when april opened up hill to drive flock higher up to juicier mountain pasture where shepherd must spend week at time cutting down pine burning for charcoal flight of petrobey nicholas escape of yanni might easily have become signal of warning to turk until be ready be most important that communication of alarm must pas from kalamata to tripoli for last few week fortification of tripoli have be undergoing repair be evidently expected that if rising took place first attack must be directed there at rate turk thought be safer to have fortress in fairly central position where family of countryman scattered about country must take refuge from local disturbance cattle arm mule horse brought to camp be put under disposal of petrobey a be head of clan of mavromichales of whom camp be chiefly composed nicholas have felt better that must have absolute supremacy in matter a have said to priketes that asked for be right to serve petrobey be loath to take advantage of generosity only did so on condition that nicholas must promise to give advice counsel on point dissent from freely promptly where judgment did not coincide with own at wish of men be willing to take over sole command meantime must take in charge outpost messenger corp of camp on devolved duty of watching road of carrying news from one camp to nicholas company have be relieved at watch on beacon station when two boy arrived three went together to petrobey be busy with unlading of powder carrying mule when came up a drew near saw ran towards now blessed virgin be praised cried that have come expected earlier how be did not come before ah yanni father have wearied for be long bill have with mehemet oh admirable little mitsos holy father reward for bringing safe will breakfast together when have finished job get to tent with unlading of powder be operation in so petrobey thought caution must be superfluous arrived in big mule pannier covered over with charcoal country produce pannier be taken off carried singly by men barefoot into magazine here others be stationed whose duty be to take off stuff under powder be concealed empty into small skin bottle must be carried by man held more than ordinary powder flask there be eight hundred of one for man in camp when be full remainder be to be stored in light wooden box of handier shape than pannier for transport on ammunition mule day fresh band of men in eight ten from maina country arrived in camp news be passed from other station along mountain side that too be filling rapidly among others fifty men have joined patriot from nauplia plain of argo one of whom be father andrea incarnated vengeance more than priest be mitsos ' father mitsos however be to remain in camp of mavromichales acting a aide de camp to nicholas otherwise disposition of men be strictly geographical since petrobey experience told that men who have known other fight best side by side camp be organized on pattern of mavromichales captain of have voluntarily put under supreme command of petrobey for dissension subsequently broke out in army have not yet appeared moreover hetairist club since flight of prince alexander ypsilanti have given express order that direction of affair in south be to be in hand of local chieftain suggesting for office either petrobey nicholas week passed camp be nearly full petrobey waited impatiently for completion of preparation partly by extreme caution partly by good luck there have a yet be collision with turk apparently uneasiness felt in kalamata report have come in couple of day before two turkish ship of war have be ordered there for defence of town to carry off turkish inhabitant in case of outbreak though bay be carefully watched by on beacon point sign of have be seen about mid day on d of april scout from beacon came into camp saying that small band of turk twelve in number under arm followed by train of baggage mule be coming up pas from kalamata petrobey answer be short decisive stop twenty men be sent out to reinforce outpost at beacon from camp nothing must be seen of road dozen more men be told off to hold in readiness then after long pause in man eye sought eye of fellow in fever of expectation shot be heard in hour time message came back to petrobey nicholas who be at dinner that have be stopped then petrobey rose gray eye be fire at last at last cried oh nicholas vintage be ripe waited no longer yanni who be aide de camp be despatched at top speed to next station with order hour before sunset army be to start on march to kalamata afternoon stir of going be shrill clan be half wild with excitement eagerness be absolutely in control went about duty methodically in perfect order work of lading marwilling ammunition baggage mule be finished by four o'clock meanwhile party have carried up to top of hill fuel for beacon petrobey have arranged be to be signal not only across to hill above bassae to patriot collected lower down in village of messenian plain mitsos who be charged with lighting of be to let loose tongue of fire must shout word over greece a soon a dark fell then follow straight down hill side after main body whole disposition of force round kalamata route by converging a went be to march there have be already arranged by five o'clock clan set out spreading in open order over hill side mule alone following road of pas so a to prevent one leaving town by other mountain path over taygetus a soon a clan have started mitsos left to ate supper sat down to wait till darkness of birthnight of greece must fall have be hot sultry day with heavy air have packed up sent on with mule heavy woollen cloak nicholas have given to replace one have left behind in race to tripoli be dressed only in linen trouser shirt open albanian jacket still air hung like blanket on mountain side saw that cloud have gathered on top of taygetus be moving down westward in direction of camp remained a yet high though before sunset have stretched right over from mountain top behind to peak of ithome in west gray floor of mottled marble flushed here there where be thinner with reflected fire of angry sunset northern heaven be still clear beacon point close above stood out black sharp cut long before dark fell have already be up to beacon in order to arrange brushwood firing most handily lighter drier wood put on windward side so that such breeze a there be might drive flame inward against larger bush must take flame le easily also tore quantity of dry moss from side of couple of plane tree grew to leeward of hill made core of within brushwood adding train in manner of fuse leading outward to where must apply light have just finished to satisfaction be about to return to camp to fetch up burning lump of charcoal have fed during afternoon in wind have sprung up must soon kindle moss into flame when few large raindrop fell splashing on ground hurriedly covered dry tinder like furze with thick branch of pine in order to keep protected then for few moment rain ceased again mitsos looking up saw that cloud have grown black swollen with imminent downpour that storm might break minute next thought be for burning charcoal below ran quickly down hill side in order to carry under cover of ammunition magazine before have gone fifty yard storm broke in sheet of hissing rain driven little aslant in wind for heaviness shower of lead however in hope of saving charcoal ran on raking about in ember of fire already turning to black slush under volleying rain found lump of charcoal not yet extinguished then sheltering in cap nursed tenderly carried into ammunition magazine there sat for hour from managed to kindle few more lump while noise of rain continued a of musketry on resounding roof then looking out saw that night have come heavy lowering position be sufficiently critical beacon fuel must be soaked dry kindling in centre thought must be insufficient to start blaze then remembered flask of spirit petrobey have told to keep with in case of emergency ran across to fetch from hut cloud have lifted little though downpour be still heavy looking up still saw outline of beacon hill shade blacker than sky showing that be clear at rate of mist groped about wall of hut for little time before finding flask just a put hand on wind fell dead rain stopped a when tap be turned back in stillness heard sound of footstep of man unfamiliarly stumbling up stony hill side just below at that stopped then creeping cautiously to entrance of hut peered out must see nothing step still advanced drawing nearer who must be be hardly possible though still just possible that man be greek of clan yet such must surely have shouted to coming from petrobey with message might be benighted peasant yet again for fear might be turk must need go carefully with redoubled caution crept out of hut still keeping in shadow looked round corner whether be rustle of moving in dead silence faint shimmering of white trouser in darkness betrayed be only thing for conjecture next moment from fifty yard in front saw flash of gun bullet sang viciously by cracking in half one of upright post bound side of hut together mitsos stood up a knew be seen called out cocking pistol yet seeing one speak fire in answer heard sound of charge being rammed home at that bolted back round corner of tent waited step advanced closer clearly man whoever be finding that did not fire concluded that have arm truth however being that mitsos having seen nothing flash of gun thought more prudent to wait until have more localized target presently step paused after moment heard retreating with doubled quickness up hill towards pas then solution flashed upon must be patriot must wandering peasant have fired at must only be turk who have seen greek army advancing have somehow eluded be going hotfoot to sparta with news must be stopped at cost next moment mitsos be stretched in pursuit up hill after keeping a much a possible in cover of tree clearly man have missed way in darkness have come unexpectedly upon greek camp seeing one there have fired in three minute so mitsos ' long leg have gained considerably on now saw though duskily with gun on shoulder still making up hill minute saw within about fifty yard of other mitsos have advantage of position for while be running between scattered tree other be in open apparently recognized changed course towards belt of wood then suddenly seeing mitsos so near halted fired mitsos felt bullet just graze arm on that ran forward while man still stayed reloading piece sent pistol bullet at shot went wide mitsos with grunt of rage ran desperately on to close with other while be still yard distant finished loading gun be already on way to shoulder when mitsos partly in mere animal fury at imminence of death in part with reasonable aim took hold of heavy pistol by barrel flung with force in turk face reeled for moment blood like red of morning streaming over face in torrent blinded mitsos be on have closed with when came to mere physical strength odds be vastly in favor in moment in blind gust of fury of fighting wrested man gun from without thinking of firing have banged over head with butt end fell with sound of breaking mitsos still drunk beside with lust of slaughter laughed loud hit again with full force a lay on ground there be crack spurt of something warm thick came out in jet against trouser over hand paused only one moment to make sure that be turk have killed then without giving thought waiting to brush clotted mess off clothes ran down again to set about beacon wound on arm be slight though bled profusely smarted like burn only stopping to tear off piece from shirt sleeve bound tightly round tying knot with teeth right hand again put charcoal be burning well into cap with flask of brandy set off for top of hill rain have come on again hissing down in torrent mitsos knowing that fear of failure strode faster moment tore cover of bough off from core of moss furze found to dismay be quite damp must not light be necessary to get flame somehow spirit moss must do rest if once must get to get flame must have something dry though be twig there be time to waste already big raindrop have made ominous black spot on middle of glowing charcoal meantime everything be getting rapidly wetter in moment of hopelessness clutched at hair despairingly thing seemed impossibility then suddenly idea struck tearing off jacket removed shirt have be kept quite dry kneeling down with back bare to cold scourging rain put two lump of charcoal in fold of blew on for couple of second linen smouldered only then angel gabriel must have be gladder sight to little tongue of flame shot up mitsos took brandy bottle with utmost care shook out few drop onto edge of flame licked up burning brighter soon whole of back of shirt took fire crammed under thick core of moss brushwood feeding plentifully with brandy coaxed flame into driest part of stuff now then little spark must go running like fiery insect through fibre leaving gray path of ash behind only to perish when reached damper stuff once even flame seemed to die down altogether meantime have penetrated into centre of pile suddenly yellow blade of smoky fire leaped out licked dripping branch of fir outside only fumed cracked mitsos pulled off for be choking flame running down to edge of wood tore up great handful of undergrowth have be partially protected from rain by tree threw on then fire began to take hold in earnest through thick volume of stinging smoke be streaming away westward shot lurid gleam of flame now then with great crash puff of vapor thicker branch of timber must split break throwing out cloud of ignited fragment again there must rise up hissing simmering of damp leaf like sound of great stewing over hot fire place where have first lit beacon be consumed only heap of white frothy ash now then flushing red again with half consumed particle a breeze fanned remained from fir branch mitsos have taken off ten minute ago now replaced a moment hold of fire grew steadier there be bursting little fan shaped bouquet of flame meantime with skin of chest down to band of trouser reddened scorched by heat back cold dripping lashed with heavy whisp of rain have so belabored in first few moment of struggle between fire water hair tangled steaming with heat shower eye blackened burned with firing mitsos worked like man struggling for life now pushing half burned branch back into fire now lifting new bundle of fuel a much a must carry in arm pricked scratched scorched bleeding skin of chest now glancing northward to see whether bassae have answered with savage frenzy of haste excitement of deed fury madness of blood have shed dancing in black eye looked more like ancient greek spirit of mountain than lover of suleima boy who be so tender for yanni in ten minute more rain have stopped mitsos still labored on until heat of beacon be so great that must scarcely approach to throw on fresh fuel flame leaped higher higher wind dropping shower of red hot piece of half burned leaf bark be continually carried upward peopling night with fiery spark falling round in blackened particle floating away feathery white ash like mote in sunbeam a stood there grimy panting scorched chilled throwing new bundle of fuel onto furnace seeing smoke fizz then break out flaring glory splendor of deed be helping in burst in upon with one blinding flash that banished other memory for moment even suleima be shadow of shadow beacon have kindled seemed to illuminate depth of soul saw by light cruelty accursed lust of hated race greatness of freedom be coming then blackened burned sodden drenched sat down for few moment to north of beacon to get breath scoured night be that star burning so low on horizon surely be too red for star on night what star must pierce cloud besides be not that mountain stood up dimly behind then presently after grew glowed be star fiery mouth of message shouting north south bessae have answered illustration mitsos tore up great handful of undergrowth threw on there be still little spirit left between wetting scorching mitsos felt that must be none worse for left jacket to dry by beacon while went back to where body of turkish soldier lay to look for pistol have till then forgotten searched about for little while without finding for have fallen in tangle of undergrowth taking man gun might come in useful turned to go then for first time sudden feeling of compassion came over broke off armful of branch from tree round threw over body in order to cover from marauding feeder of mountain then crossing a greek do in presence of dead turned away going once more up to beacon to fetch jacket have grown dry almost singed in fierce heat ran off down hill to join clan have gone slowly for did not wish to reach kalamata till hour before daybreak have when mitsos came up halted at bottom of range where foot hill begin to rise towards taygetus be challenged by one of sentry for reply shouted own name to finding demetri be challenger stopped to tell of success of beacon answer flared back from bassae then went on to seek for nicholas petrobey to report return petrobey be sitting by camp fire when came up talking earnestly to nicholas father andrea who have come in from nauplia contingent only smiled at mitsos a entered be order father be saying want to take place at cost le cost better must prefer if capitulated not waste life can ill spare over turk inside wall will be prisoner yes perhaps moon will devour said petrobey will make condition about surrender good night father now little mitsos beacon know got lit how in name of virgin did manage to do mitsos unbuttoned jacket showed sore reddened skin beneath there be much in shirt said laughing told story when have finished petrobey looked at nicholas with wonder something like awe in eye surely blessing of holy saint be on lad said in low voice part iii treading of grape chapter te deum laudamus during night wind swept floor of heaven clean of cloud hour of clear starlight setting moon preceded dawn before starting after hour halt about midnight petrobey called together captain of other three camp gave final instruction three company from maina argolis laconia be to besiege citadel while company from arcadia be to join two from messenia must meet on plain invest harbor destroy shipping except three four light built boat be to be kept in readiness for other purpose watch for coming of two turkish ship of war messenians with loyal patriotic spirit have asked petrobey to name captain for three company must be employed on work instead of pressing local candidate in order to prevent jealousy dissent among nominated one niketas of sparta who be well known to most of men popular have seen service on english ship where have worked for two year abroad for price have be placed on head by turk for supposed brigandage have returned to country month ago from ionian isle have hastened to put in service of patriot citadel of kalamata stood on rising ground about mile from harbor be small large unfortified suburb chiefly employed in commerce silk industry have spread out southward from base making continuous street between harbor citadel latter be defended by complete circuit of wall on three side out of four rock on edge of wall stood be precipitous for thirty foot under western of directly below wall ran torrent bed bringing down stream from mountain to north dry in summer now flowing full turbid with melting of winter snow on height on side town be impregnable to greek who at present have field piece arm of kind larger than ordinary musket then in use similarly must have be waste of time life to attack on north east on north however be picket gate in wall communicating with steep flight of step cut in rock petrobey plan therefore be to take possession at once of lower undefended town blockade citadel from side for thus with body of men to guard northern picket east west side being impassable from within without blockade must be complete meantime three company consisting of messenians arcadian must cut off harbor from town leaving mainats argive laconian to deal with citadel when day broke secrecy of advance be favored by thick mist rose ten foot high from plain under cover of manoeuvring in field about mile eastward from town army split in two one half marched straight down to shore of bay from there turning along coast ranged along harbor shore on breakwater made of large rough block of stone sheltered harbor from southerly wind other three leaving citadel on right hand went straight for lower town hour afterwards heat of sun began to disperse morning mist a got to outskirt of town vast vapor be rolled away sentry on citadel looking out southward saw three company of soldier not mile off alarm be given at once spread through lower town like fire from house rushed out men woman child still half clad just awakened from morning sleep mother with baby in arm old men almost a helpless who ran way that in first panic terror gradually settled down into two steady stream one up to citadel to find refuge there other to harbor to seek mean of flight army came on in silence making way slowly up narrow street towards citadel without being attacked by terrified unarmed inhabitant in turn striking blow firing shot two company only have entered town third remaining on outskirt to east acting like stop in cover shooting to drive inhabitant back again lest must convey alarm to tripoli from west of town bridge led over torrent here petrobey stationed hundred men to prevent one leaving town across river before long wishing to concentrate force in town yanni be sent to party picketed there with order to destroy bridge be made of wood preparation be in hand for replacing with one of iron several girder be lying about on bank for approaching work with one of a lever twenty men to work be affair of ten minute only to prize up half dozen plank of wooden structure after to saw in couple of timber pole on rested bridge thus weakened drooped towards water soon be caught by swift stream below then a monstrous fish pluck at swimmer limb twitched fretted against remaining portion soon with rush swirl of timber plank tore away gap of twenty foot across sufficient to stop must be fugitive here there in passage up town house be shut barred against for most part inhabitant streamed out like ant when hill be disturbed once only be resistance offered when from upper window of house turk fired upon soldier killing one man petrobey heading charge burst in door couple of shot be heard from inside then without word three others who have gone in with took place again column moved forward up street square of lower town stood just at base of rising ground leading up to citadel on north side be built row of big silk mill of have be deserted by owner on first alarm in maina division took up quarter a soon a argive have made passage through town driving inhabitant up into citadel down to harbor where be taken by messenian division petrobey sent to laconian corp who have be acting a stop on east to prevent people escaping into country brought up on right to complete line have drawn along south front of citadel argive corp meantime have be divided into two one half of blockaded picket gate on north while other be drawn up on left of mainats between river done blockade of citadel be complete on west besieged be hemmed in by own impregnable rock below ran current on south southeast by greek army on east again by precipitous crag on north escape through picket gate be impracticable owing to detachment of argive guarding three course be open to to make sortie a soon a expected turkish ship must appear regain communication with sea by engaging defeating greek establish connection with tripoli to support siege until help came in utter confusion panic caused by sudden appearance of greek inhabitant have simply fled like quail flock citadel be crammed with crowd of unarmed civilian thought only for own personal protection mixed in crowd of fugitive have be hundred of greek resident of whom possessed merely by wild force of panic without waiting to think what army be have rushed blindly with others into citadel larger number have joined countryman men woman child together imploring protection with horrible tale of outrage cruelty on lip who be fit for active service willing petrobey enlisted employed in making more careful search through town for turk who might remain in hiding be not to be killed ill treated merely kept a prisoner wild vengeance of who have so long be slave burst bound when saw master in power who be found be secretly put to death weakness of citadel lay in bad water supply there be only one well in place be not nearly sufficient for want of crowd who have taken refuge within about mid day demetri mayor of nauplia who be in charge of division on north observed bucket being let down from top of citadel wall into river drawn up again full rock here overhung little taking with ten men dashed right under wall to corner abutting on river at moment two more bucket appeared close in front of taking hold of quietly undid knot tied to rope grim humor of amused in hour there be row of twenty bucket have untied cut besieged then attempted to get water farther down rock there being not so precipitous sloping outward bucket stuck on projection of rock before reaching water meantime column of smoke rising from harbor showed that messenians be at work one corp have deployed along shore took in hand work of burning shipping while other be employed in making prisoner of fugitive from lower town who hoped to escape by sea few of striking eastward across plain tried to get into mountain be shot majority finding between two division of army cut off from citadel by petrobey division from sea by messenians also being unarmed surrendered to niketas who knowing turkish being proud of english merely said right to entreaty prayer have incontinently stowed away in batch in harbor building arcadian meantime have ranged along breakwater where kept watch for turkish ship having work to hand spent morning in smoking singing about two in afternoon word be brought to captain of troop within citadel one ali aga that two turkish ship have be seen in offing approaching kalamata steady south breeze be blowing couple of hour must see arrival ali have watched in white contemptuous anger morning destruction of shipping by greek ammunition within wall be very scanty water supply for irruption of fugitive be wholly inadequate indeed unless news of strait be already on road to tripoli must scarce hope so swift complete have be beleaguer unless relief expedition be even now imminently starting saw that only chance of saving town lay in concerted action with approaching ship thus making attack on greek line from side citadel sea thus determined to wait until ship came up engaged detachment of greek on shore wind still holding in hour arcadian contingent on breakwater must see even from beach hull of approaching ship beyond doubt turkish men of war breakwater along greek be ranged be still only half completed mass of rough masonry lay piled tumbled on seaward end niketas rubbed hand gleefully a made disposition for welcome exclaimed many time be very right then relapsing into greek gave order mingled with chuckling homily turk made breakwater said god holy saint having greek in mind be designer hide yourselves ever so thickly among beautiful great stone like anchovy in barrel when ship turn into harbor will talk loud to together water be very deep here will sail close to anchovy barrel will see none of till turn corner for breakwater god planned hide from sea called up one division of messenians to join arcadian corp leaving other to guard beach sixteen hundred men ranged among block of masonry along inside of breakwater so until ship turned corner not one must be seen once round must be exposed to broadside of musket at close range from marksman concealed by stone niketas for foremost ship be now not more than few hundred yard out crawled with infinite precaution to end of breakwater smilingly watched unsuspicious approach carried saw many heavy gun be small matter wind be now light ship be nearly opposite end of breakwater when began to take in sail moment afterwards helm be put hard aport slowly swung round crumpling smooth water beneath bow came straight alongside wall at distance of not more than fifty yard niketas have told men to fire exactly when ship came opposite must pas slowly down line must be raked fore aft again again a went along sixteen hundred men be crowded like swarming bee among lump of tumbled stone a many musket waited hungrily overhead above shelter of breakwater hummed breeze little wavelet tapped on edge of masonry stage be ready tall beautiful came slowly on till whole length appeared opposite ambush deck rigging be alive with sailor who be swarming over mast furling sail stood ready to drop anchor on word of command on bridge stood captain with two other officer marwilled in row on aft deck about two hundred soldier carrying arm simultaneously through ambushed greek same thought ran soldier first a great ship glided steadily past end of breakwater fire of hundred men broke out went down like ninepin ship moved on like echo of first volley second swept deck close on second third captain fell two officer with panic seized crew ran hither thither seeking refuge below jumping overboard standing where be wide eyed terror stricken few of soldier only retained presence of mind with perfect calmness a if be practising at sham fight brought gun into position proceeded to load again again be mowed down by deadly short range fire of greek while others took up ramrod charge from clinched hand only to deliver up from death grip to others still great ship went on running gauntlet of whole ambush while moment deck grew more populous with ghastly crew of death well directed low fire of greek have left half furled sail untouched wind still blew steadily in few moment more there be none left to take helm swinging round to wind changed course went straight for low sandy beach on other side of harbor there fifty yard off shore grounded heavily with slight list to starboard striking sand bank on port side there afternoon stood white stately with sail bulging with wind moving not like painted phantom ship with wing feel not wind gale not till then did niketas indeed of ambushed party give thought to other ship when first ship with crew of dead turned in wind sailed ashore looked round corner for other be still quarter of mile away there seemed to be commotion on deck be uncertain for moment whether be preparing to bring big gun into play be not left long in doubt for in couple of minute more ship swung round beat out to sea again disgraceful piece of cowardice raised from greek howl partly of derision partly of rage at being balked of prey few discharged musket at fleeing enemy until niketas stopped telling not to waste good powder on runaway dog on first ship body of soldier have literally be destroyed of two hundred not more than thirty remained with courageous despair after first few minute of wild confusion be over have sheltered at different point behind bulwark furniture of ship be returning fire coolly while others began preparing big gun for action be easy mark for greek for be unprotected after five six more men have be shot down abandoned attempt confined to musket be however fighting with cruel odds against for men on whom be firing be sheltered by block of masonry on pier hardly more must be seen than bristling row of gun barrel hardly of who have flung into sea lived to reach shore for also be shot down a swam over bay be stain of crimson blood clothes have flung off into water one man indeed landed two hundred yard away even a stood there wringing water out of clothes must clog running be shot dead fell back into water again meantime from citadel ali aga have watched destruction of one ship flight of other at moment when first have entered harbor have opened fire on mainat corp obeying petrobey direction merely sheltered behind mill did not even take trouble to return encouraged by seeing heavy fighting going on below ali be just preparing to make dash for harbor with half of troop in order to establish communication when firing on shore suddenly slackened saw one ship sail off without firing shot while other drifted with half furled sail across bay then grounded at that resolved again to wait for have intention of going to rescue of who must have rescued indeed without co operation from ship attempt must have be madness at dusk firing below ceased altogether for boat have put off from ship bearing white flag of surrender who be left on board be removed arm taken from be put into custody niketas who boarded ship felt sudden unwilling admiration for man who have gone on fighting against such fearful odds deck presented fearful sight be shamble nothing list of ship a struck have drained blood in oily half congealed stream through scupper be dripping sullenly into sea small arm powder greek transferred in boat to land where be added to stock made several unsuccessful attempt to get out one two of larger gun might prove useful if kalamata refused to capitulate effort in absence of fit tackling lifting apparatus be useless after emptying ship of must be of service to including sum of five hundred turkish pound be found in captain cabin set light to for fear must be got off by sister ship so return into enemy fleet night long hull blazed about midnight be pillar of fire for sail caught flame went roaring upward mast high thus ended first day of siege next day blockade continued without incident attempt be made on part of turk to deliver attack on of besieger to force way into citadel pas from arcadia that over taygetus across of relief expedition from tripoli must march be carefully watched before such appeared petrobey declined to make attack must be expensive to greek army when simply waiting must do work for while ali on side must sooner capitulate if worst came to worst than with fifteen hundred men ill supplied with ammunition engage six regiment of wolf for such engagement a knew must only end in utter defeat massacre in probability of turk in town early on third morning be clear that help be not coming from tripoli at rate that must come too late water supply have entirely given out famine a well be beginning to make felt for two day night citadel have be packed like crate of fig with defenceless civilian humanity more than half of whom have to lie out under cold of spring night exposed to dew sun of barely half clad just a have be awakened from sleep when have fled panic stricken to citadel below in greek army utmost content harmony still reigned men be well quartered have supply of town in hand considerable amount of booty have be taken half of be divided between men half reserved by petrobey for war fund first bugle have sounded hour be preparing breakfast when white flag be hoisted on corner tower gate opened ali aga alone unattended except for page who carried chibouk walked down into camp greek who have lived under have felt cruel outrageous rule saw coming surrounded spitting at reviling here devilish coolness of man came to front matter for admiration turning round on cursed at so fiercely calling dog son of dog that fell back by side of road be sitting blind greek begging ali with splendid unconcern paused threw open red cloak trimmed with fur of yellow fox have wrapped closely about against chill of morning taking pistol string of amber bead out of belt felt in corner of for small coin gave man passed deliberately on adjusting fez with one hand once again before reached petrobey quarter paused time to take off one of red shoe shake pebble out of have blanched wavered for moment life must have be forfeit dozen time before reached petrobey quarter treated howling crowd a man treat snarling cur silently commanded one of loudest mouthed to show way to commander petrobey have seen ali coming be sitting outside house where have taken up quarter when turk appeared arose saluted telling servant to bring pipe for ali did not return salute merely indicated with one hand that have brought own pipe with insult of most potent nature to greek be of one bake looked at petrobey spoke a if be speaking to one of own slave find necessary for to capitulate said in excellent greek be here to settle condition petrobey flushed angrily be not meek man have stomach for insult so sat down again leaving ali standing crossed one leg over other make condition said except one will order general massacre at same time must be safer for of not to assume insolent overbearing air ali raised eyebrow before speaking again sat down beckoned to page who carried pipe will not give safe conduct to tripoli for instance will not allow to retain arm petrobey laughed such be not intention will do anger suddenly flared up at perfectly unassumed insolence of man will do be to forbid men to shoot down in cold blood will be wise to consider for may not care to grant such term yet be able to enforce obedience to if did on day when tripoli be crushed like beetle below heel ali shrugged shoulder took chibouk from hand of page who carried oblige with piece of charcoal said to one of greek who stood by lit pipe slowly deliberately before replying term be preposterous said however say will not accept wish for five hour more for consideration five hour more for relief from tripoli in poor judgment remarked petrobey be afraid will not be convenient to require 'yes ' more le ali inhaled two long breath of smoke if will give 'yes 'no what then will go back in safety then when be starved out when take place will not grant term have long score against rule have not be popular among countryman who have lived here under be full of very pretty tale suppose dog be accept term petrobey rose consider prisoner said not even looking at take charge of christos yorgi order three corp out yanni piece of charcoal one of said ali tobacco be little damp in hour

voice of great multitude answered sound be a sound of many water ardor hot blood of greek leaped like blush to surface on side mixed with noise of singing rose one great sob of thankful people born again petrobey with nicholas on one side mitsos yanni on other hardly knew that tear be streaming down tanned weather beaten cheek to others a to memory expectation be merged sunk in present ineffable moment there be before after be there men of free people conscious only of one thing that first blow have be struck struck home true that thanked god for power have given to use when be over petrobey turned to nicholas smiling at through tear old friend said nicholas echoed word echoed that be too deep for word old friend replied chapter ii two silver candlestick for two day longer army remained at kalamata in ecstasy of success petrobey posted several company of men on lower hill of taygetus at top of plain from pas led into arcadia in ambush for relieving force from tripoli must such be sent flushed with victory a be nothing seemed impossible spirit of men be to march straight on stronghold of turkish power petrobey be wiser knew that affair at kalamata have be no real test of army capacity have stood with folded arm prey have dropped at foot to attack strongly fortified place competently held be to adventure far more seriously at present have men arm enough only sane course be to wait embarking might be on enterprise of smaller sort till with news of exploit rising became more general in mean time remained at kalamata in order to get tidings from north of morea a to sequel of beacon there if expedient to unite troop with contingent from patras megaspelaion a commander in chief of first army in field issued proclamation declaring that greek be determined to throw off yoke of turk asking for aid of christian in giving liberty to who be enslaved to worshipper of alien god primate principal clergy of morea will be remembered have be summoned to tripoli for meeting at end of march scheme that wisdom of mitsos have hatched to give excuse for disobedience have met with entire success germanos who spoke wrote turkish forged letter purporting to come from friendly mussulman at tripoli warning to beware for mehemet salik thinking that rising of greek be imminent have determined to put one two of principal men to death in order to terrorize people with same stone to deprive of leader with in pocket set out travelled quietly to kalavryta where found other of principal clergy assembled at house of zaimes primate of place germanos arrived there in evening before going to bed gave forged letter to lambros servant telling to start early next morning ride in direction of tripoli then turn back meet party at mid day halt be then to give letter to master saying that have received from turk on road who hearing that be germanos servant told a valued life life of master not to spare spur till have given on account to hint word of matter to one lambros who have southern palate for anything smacking of drama mystery obeyed in letter spirit at mid day while primate be halting spurred jaded foam streaked horse up road flung quickly off gave forged communication to master germanos glanced through with well feigned dismay exclamation of astonished horror at once read aloud to assembled primate who be struck with consternation suggested one thing one looked to germanos for authoritative word will do brother said if seems good to will send letter to admirable friend so still think mehemet salik ask for promise of safety matter of form merely yet may not disregard what other admirable friend have said for if a god forbid be true where must flock be without shepherd if be false mehemet will at once send promise of safety meantime must act a if truth of letter be possible suggest that disperse for greater safety surround with small guard before answer come back may be looked round saw only face of patriot may be that there will be other business on

that be to be trusted put up arched confiding back against mitsos leg made poker of tail below house be of three room outer of looking over plain be full of sign of flight long turkish narghile with amber mouth piece be overturned on floor on one of little coffee table stood pipe half filled with unsmoked tobacco while silk pouch from be supplied lay unrolled beside on shelf be four five long stemmed chibouks long divan smothered in cushion ran round three side of room cat in belief that friend be coming back jumped lightly into accustomed place looked at boy blinking purring contentedly second room be full of can of coffee tobacco on table in centre stood dish with two chicken one wholly plucked other half denuded by earthenware bowl of water in be cool green lettuce third room be stable for horse manger full of fresh hay ran down one side in opposite corner be oven heap of charcoal fire have gone out be only heap of white feathery ash while on extinguished ember still stood two little brass coffee jug content half boiled away yanni smiled serenely when have finished examination will sup with to night cousin asked pompously oh mitsos be soft thing have hit upon mitsos walked back into outer room where closed wooden shutter lit candle nice little candlestick said approvingly how wish owner of house must see must howl up stair there be two room one with two bed in other with one bed be still unmade just a have be slept in mitsos pulled off sheet disdainfully for must not lie where turk have be then while yanni kindled fire to boil chicken rummaged in store room pot of little anchovy yanni remarked will come first to give appetite thus will have two appetite for have one already by virgin there be tobacco too ready in pipe will pas very pleasant evening hope oh there be horse still waiting at gate will go fetch be quick with supper pig yanni laughed really turk be very convenient man said like war can take provision from here will last to nauplia there will be skulking about village after dark to buy bread wine without being noticed yanni put chicken to boil while mitsos fetched horse having nothing more to do amused by trying on dress of turkish woman have found in street big black bernous concealed deficiency of skirt only came to knee have finished adjusting veil have sat down chastely on corner of settee when heard mitsos come up street call to from stable so got up went on tiptoe out of house round to other door mitsos looking up saw turkish woman peeping in who screamed in shrill falsetto when saw for one moment thought that somehow other be suleima next moment have rushed after yanni hauled in be not supper ready woman cried why do not attend to master ate dinner in best of spirit for that hated despised turk whose destruction be mission must board lodge so handsomely seemed one of best joke mitsos now then broke into huge grin a made fearful inroad upon food wine yanni kept ejaculating very good chicken of turk best wine of turk give lettuce of turk wish must take candlestick mitsos perhaps two peasant boy with heavy silver stick four foot high slung on mule might attract attention moon have risen soon after sunset after dinner sat smoking in garden be planted with pomegranate peach tree fringed by row of cypress looked black in moonlight be perfectly still for sleepy prattle of stream below now then nightingale gave out throatful of song spray of asphodel ripe to core cracked scattered seed round cat prowled about garden now creeping through shadow of tree flattening out on ground now making spring at imaginary prey in moonlight when went up stair preceded jumping onto mitsos ' bed lay purring like tea kettle chapter iii adventure of fire ship started again early next morning having loaded pony with provision for yanni preferred to suffer from blister than from hunger struck in southeasterly direction across plain leaving sparta with red roof olive grove on left over low hill of red earth covered in spring time with cistus in full flower tall white heather myrtle in freshness of fragrant leaf about two hour going brought to eurotas flowing clear bright over shining pebble bed on sunlight drew diaper of light shade sliding on from pool to willow willow to rapid ford to ford here mitsos who in inland life pined for amphibious existence of nauplia came upon deep pool in moment be stripped swimming from there two hour led across plain to foot of hill where halted ate midday meal looking across green plain to where taygetus rising in gray shoulder over shoulder met sky in spear head of snow so for two more day went on sleeping sometimes during middle of day under shade of aromatic pine behind bluff of earth in dry torrent bed a got nearer to tripoli argo marching through cool still night over shoulder outstretched limb of mountain range down through silent valley aflush with spring spending daylight hour in sheltered nook cave keeping alternate watch while other slept thus came down to myloi where be to get boat must take across bay early one morning while be still dark so once again in sweetness of sunrise mitsos saw blue mirror of bay spread out smooth clear at foot first ray of morning sparkling on town at other side turning damp roof to sheet of gold on white house at head of bay where heart be be home by nine o'clock from there must see plainly great turkish ship a large a church lying close to quay showing that be in time attack a petrobey have told mitsos must of course be at night through cafe keeper lelas learned that must sail same evening at midnight thereabouts be quite to convenience for have sailed during day must have have to follow till fall of night gave cover to approach thus perhaps attracting suspicion certainly finding many mile from home out at sea when work be done cafe keeper to whom be referred showed caique nicholas have told to keep for mitsos boy saying that must go out little way at once to see how sailed got into leaving yanni on shore latter winked at mitsos a got in remarking be sorry can not go with for knew precisely where mitsos be going though chance of seeing suleima by day be absolutely nil went back to constantine house waited patiently for return lelas who be arrant gossip monger have news of town turk be flying in direction to tripoli to constantinople to athens such be consternation at taking of kalamata many of about nauplia be going on board war ship be bound for piraeus to return with arm tell said what be mitsos going to do with caique be sure be plot against turk yanni seeing nicholas have not thought fit to tell denied knowledge of purpose of boat meantime mitsos have put out be sailing straight to white wall wind be blowing lightly from east ran straight before boat slimly built carrying more sail than be certainly faster goer than own before wind suspected must sail closer to certainly took air like bird though breeze be light be very sea gull for moving that doubt be why nicholas whose knowledge of boat be a of one who have never set foot on dry land have chosen mitsos glanced towards big ship moored off quay at nauplia mentally gave fifteen minute start in hour run oh love blaze thought twenty minute scudding brought nearly up to wall there took in sail drifted there be one on terrace be unusual on fine morning when there be often two three of servant about woman from harem how quiet looked yet though did not see suleima be something to know be near sitting might be at back of garden in door perhaps zuleika have toothache be unapproachable perhaps two be talking together perhaps be talking of wondering when must come again in farther of two wall running back from sea be small door mitsos ' boat have drifted till appeared in view looking up from revery saw that be open be even more unusual never have seen open before sat for moment two frowning wondering at then suddenly smile be struck dead on face possibility too horrible for thought suggested by open door at mistra have dawned on regardless of imprudence took up oar put boat to land tying up went straight to open door garden be empty house door be open more convincing than hare ran across path hid in tangle of flower bed then with flash horrible possibility became certainty to mind house be empty deserted abdul household have fled ship be now at nauplia to carry away fugitive ship be going to destroy consigning on to death among flame from there be escape abdul be surely there with abdul household mitsos stood there long minute with wide unseeing eye for moment horror of position drowned consciousness a blow stuns brain then a reason came back to realized that must not that be physically unable to carry out order fire ship must not start must start for there be yanni with who knew about cursed for having taken yanni so be must start something must go wrong must forget to take kindling for setting light to must only drift by other not harm for be question of choice must not do thing thus thought poor mitsos a sailed home again seemed to that nothing in world mattered except suleima by bitter irony of fate man in world whom most loved respected have told to destroy with on board ship in suleima be on one hand stood nicholas father petrobey yanni whole clan of dear warm hearted cousin who have treated a brother yet divine on other suleima suleima be more to than suleima be part of dearer than hand eye besides besides yanni be having dinner when entered house there be that in mitsos ' face made spring up mitsos said little mitsos what be matter mitsos looked at moment in silence that craving of human spirit for sympathy in trouble whether sympathy be given by man beast overpowered though in own mind have settled that must not destroy ship trouble of struggle be sore upon yanni whispered there will be fire ship abdul have gone have fled with household with suleima among where have fled onto ship be to destroy can not do yanni sank down again in chair oh mitsos said poor mitsos god forgive mitsos glanced at frowning 'poor mitsos ' cried why do say 'poor mitsos ' do think be going to do be not going to do shouted mitsos be not who choose there be choice can not clan oath to obey there be bigger thing than clan oath to hell with oath to hell with clan cried mitsos yanni sat silent mitsos suddenly flared up again how dare sit there cried let silence blame whom rescued from house of mehemet who for must have be rotting in ground worse than that whom saved when cross legged turk have down on ground mitsos said yanni looking at without fear anger stung intolerably for moment two mitsos sat still then blessed relief of tear came what have said to yanni sobbed o god forgive for know not what said yet yet how can do oh of course be right be not hard what be said to something devilish know give up yanni there be none there will soon be none who love a do be great black eye grew soft with tear put arm round mitsos ' neck a head lay on table oh mitsos poor little mitsos said again what be to be done if only nicholas father knew yet must not can not tell perhaps be not on ship know perhaps perhaps oh perhaps be cried mitsos two sat there in silence for time stricken almost out of consciousness by appalling thing at last mitsos raised head there be nothing more to be said muttered have idea what will do to do thing not to do be impossible yet by to morrow will be done left undone yanni just tell forgive for what said just now make indulgence for be hard weary day for yanni smiled forgiveness be word from to dear mitsos said there be nothing must do say to for need ask that mitsos looked up at with dumb dry eye quivering mouth forget too yanni tell will make change between for in truth know what said there there said yanni soothingly thing be not never have be hour went on slowly silently mitsos said nothing lay in veranda like suffering animal have crept away to die alone of mortal wound yanni be wise enough to leave quite to for struggle be one have to be wrestled out alone without help sympathy from others gradually very slowly mist of irresolution passed away from mitsos brain felt that must decide one way other meantime sun have sunk to setting yanni prepared food took with wine out to mitsos eat drink said have not eaten since morning be not hungry said mitsos listlessly for answer yanni took up glass of wine held to drink quickly mitsos be faint for something said then will take fill again mitsos obeyed like sick child yanni took glass brought back full time waited moment then said must make up mind mitsos if settle to hing tell must think for mitsos nodded will come in in hour tell said that will be time enough please leave alone again yanni be better so yanni went back into house warm hearted nature intense love for mitsos made suffer to complement of capacity of suffering must willingly have changed place with mitsos have be possible for felt must not suffer more so other must suffer le oh poor mitsos whose strength habit of laughter availed nothing be le than hour later when mitsos came in face be drawn white felt deadly tired did not look at yanni merely stood in doorway eye cast down come yanni said be time must start where be can of turpentine wood in boat put there mitsos looked up at sharply so meant to do if did not meant to try men walk firmly to scaffold when be to die for good cause martyr have seen wife child tortured burned before eye wavered not be courage of absolute conviction nerved poor lad now with whole heart believed in right of exterminating war against turk have put unreservedly at service of leader there be order laid on have made of part of machine must jarring axle speak to driver say must go farther bid stop whole gear thus be that with firm step with tenderness only despair conviction clutching at cold heart walked down with yanni to beach having looked over apparatus seen that nothing be wanting pushed off helping to set sail took place at helm enterprise be embarked upon be dangerous caique in sat be piled with inflammable material cargo of brushwood carried four large can of turpentine with must presently soak sail be to run up to turkish ship tie boat up to entangle in rigging set fire to jump into small boat towed behind row off flame must spread like lightning over boat giving hardly second to escape might easily be seen shot at while be lighting before must row off element of danger perhaps be help to poor mitsos night at least be favorable to adventure being thickly clouded with fine fresh breeze thus enabling to come up quickly also under cover of darkness otherwise moon be nearly full must have doubled peril wind be from east of north so that ship must probably run straight before for mile so before turning south out of gulf time to attack must be just when turned for must then be far enough from shore to render destruction inevitable moment of slack speed a put about must enable to run into more easily at present must approach within about quarter of mile lie there waiting for to put out there be still plenty of time when mitsos let boat run before wind instead of going straight to nauplia yanni have need to ask why for knew where be going kept eye away for must not bear to see mitsos ' agony for little while hardness conviction have left hour of agony be on again a neared white wall glimmered faintly under cloudy night thought heart must break within passed quickly under ever freshening breeze mitsos looked at a man look on dead form of dearest house have inhabited in life to suleima be dead memory only insufferably sweet ineffably bitter when wall faded again into blackness felt a if have buried whom have loved murdered then putting about ran past island saw light of nauplia grow nearer larger in foreground be tall black hull of turkish ship outlined with light deck be brilliantly lit must hear sound of talking laughing coming from sailor be evidently preparing to put to sea for now then little figure of men like small insect must move up line of rigging adjusting rope block with busy antenna loud voice seemed to be shouting order then bell rang on board rope end splashed into water be pulled on deck have drifted little out to sea mitsos tacked back again to within three hundred yard of ship finding willow water cast anchor two long hour went by spoke only freshening wind whistled in rigging cloud promised stormy night on board turkish ship made ready to go to sea row of open port hole showed necklace of light light waking column of reflection from water of bay then lantern be hoisted up onto foremast run out in bow presently after came grating sound of anchor being pulled home small sail be set sufficient in wind to take slowly out of harbor now light in town be hidden behind bow sprang up from behind stern moved along quay stately slow clear of buoy at end put up sail mitsos watched intently then without word pulled up anchor ran up sail silently went in pursuit light boat went too fast with sail full spread when have approached again to within two three hundred yard took in couple of reef equalized speed if anything allowed other to gain on little so followed in wake of great condemned ship out past harbor light round end of peninsula beyond town into black foam flecked gulf outside light grew small far away land faded to dark shadow brooded on horizon two craft one with immense cargo of human creature other with couple of beardless greek lad with how strange burden of anguish destruction be shut off from sound sight except threat of rising wave then mitsos rose pointing to can of turpentine empty one on brushwood in bow said to yanni give climbed up mast resting tin on yard took out cork let content dribble down over sail when can be empty came quickly down again flushed whole deck with tinful while yanni poured fourth onto remainder of fuel then in hard dry voice let out sail said climb into boat behind give lantern first yanni handed dark lantern first have lit before starting pulling boat in under stern of caique jumped on board under full spread sail drew rapidly near doomed ship when be within hundred yard heard rudder splash stir like great fish under water speed slackened a turned south mitsos who have never felt cooler more collected in life went straight on so a to strike sideways below huge overhanging stern calculated to perfection speed be going distance just a yanni became aware of great black thing with panel of light in overhead heard crash broken glass fell over mast of caique have gone right through one of window in stern boat gave great lurch mitsos sprang off into small boat astern still with lantern in hand quick quick said that can not do yanni jumped up crouching beneath stern of caique thrust lantern open into heap of brushwood impregnated with turpentine caught flared up in moment while from turkish ship came sudden confused sound running to fro flame leaped along caique from stern to bow ran like flash of lightning up sail be driven by wind with roar right into broken panel next moment mitsos having cast loose smaller boat pushed off backward into darkness boy seizing oar rowed for life blaze between ship have made impossible for on board to see after five minute so yanni blown streaming with perspiration saw mitsos drop oar sink down to bottom of boat lie there a if dead illustration boy seizing oar rowed for life round three quarter of horizon be dense darkness inhabited only by rushing wind in front column of fire rose up crowned with cloud of smoke flame leaped up over stern of ship steersman fled for life farther forward left to ship swung round into wind dragging destroyer behind flame from driven straight before licked greedily round timber of victim in few moment tar in seam began to melt run breaking into flame like burning sealing wax plank of upper deck be parted fraction of inch a oozed out then timber began to fizzle crack giving moment new crevice foothold for fire window where mast of caique have penetrated showed red burning lip like horrible square mouth volume of smoke began to pour forward between deck driving who be throwing unavailing water onto flame to upper deck to make hopeless attempt from there woman child ran forward with shrill scream must be seen standing like flock of frightened sheep huddled together then boat be let down before touched water tongue of flame sprang out from one of big square port hole below driving upward so fiercely that who be holding rope let go fell splashing into sea soon with crash aft part of deck charred no longer able to support own weight fell in huge shower of ember half burned blazing piece of timber again flame leaped higher moved forward along ship iron davit supporting boat corresponding to have fallen into sea still stood firm boat hung unburned for ten minute till fire reaching up caught set blazing hanging there apart separate from greater conflagration like huge burning signal of distress soon however side of ship held davit fell in boat dropped blazing into water fire have now reached to main mast in moment caught sail then after few second in smoke redoubled great sheet of canvas caught flared up in pillar of flame great burned piece fell off strewed deck other lighter fragment be borne away like bird in wind fled seaward flapping blazing then with crash second portion of deck fell in mingled with noise shrill chorus of despair from woman rose higher higher jumped overboard found death in what might have be safety others ran up down deck grew ever hotter more blistered now scribbled over by line of burning pitch seized up water can bucket tried even then to stop flame more than one man ran to where flame be fiercest preferring to die at once then without warning came end frightful explosion tore air ship parted in middle for flame have reached powder magazine in smoke steam human cry went down minute afterwards there be silence for wind blackness explosion roused mitsos looked up what be that said to yanni be over replied yanni exploded went down over thank god sank down again yanni bent to oar for be hard work against wind in hour so saw light on quay not more than quarter of mile off be still crowded with people who have be watching fire kept out in darkness until have passed then came in closer to shore so a to be shielded little from wind by land rowed steadily on till came to landing place opposite mitsos house then touched other on shoulder get up dear mitsos said be here mitsos raised followed yanni across road to house went in locking door behind mitsos still silent lay down on window seat staring out dry eyed into darkness in few moment knock came went to door to see who be be lelas said voice yanni unwillingly undid door fat urbane cafe keeper came in smiling eh two have lost fine sight said turkish ship blazing down to water edge then bang went there will not be soul to tell tale mitsos in window seat shuddered half sat up wish there have be more on board continued lelas why 'd have given week wage if old abdul poultry yard of woman have be there next moment be aware of two great hand half throttling abdul who abdul said mitsos face close to lelas hissing out word speak damned pig of pit abdul abdul here let go abdul achmet of course went to tripoli yesterday may burn in hell for throttling young devil mitsos heard nothing after abdul achmet dropped hold on lelas stood looking across at yanni minute while new life ran in spate through vein then flung arm round neck of astonished lelas kissed on cheek oh fat man love for what have said cried yanni yanni will make fat man drunk with wine for have made drunk with joy oh oh flung out of room with great shout lelas felt neck tenderly be mitsos quite mad only little mad asked severely quite mad think said yanni oh little mitsos wait minute found outside dry eyed anguish be turned to joy brimmed eye thrust arm through stood there moment in silence have need of speech indeed be there word in must frame joy of heart chapter iv training of troop into greek camp on taygetus there came flocking day by day fresh band of recruit from country side in mouth of be fresh tale of rise of greek taking of kalamata have be spark to tinder in hundred village patriot have risen attacking slaughtering of hated race who lived among burning dwelling capturing woman child in other case though rarely turk have be prepared tale be of slaughter pillage among greek for most part oppressor have slumbered on in soft indolent life till red hand of vengeance have gripped inglorious though deed be be inevitable for slave who break bond be not apt to deal judicially vengeance that rough justice be in case very just then when slaughter be done band must march to join one of two centre at kalavryta on taygetus for most part latter for petrobey be still commander in chief to army belonged prestige of siege capture of kalamata soon number became unmanageable nicholas at length resolved to strike second blow messenia in only stronghold of sultan have be kalamata no longer gave opportunity for anything guerilla warfare in arcadia there be several fortified place must have to be reduced at rate rendered powerless to send help to tripoli before latter place be attacked chief among be karitaena standing on precipitous hill above gorge of alpheus fortified town almost exclusively turkish be against place petrobey suggested second attack must be made be indeed high time that unorganized rabble who be pouring in must have something to do also learn element of war so proposal to nicholas be that must organize kind of regiment out of taking with a leaven of better drilled men who have be at kalamata besiege take place if possible if not give men notion of what forced march meant idea of military discipline meantime petrobey must move quarter into hill between upper arcadian plain tripoli so that in case of disaster nicholas must get quickly back into connection with rest of army at same time from there southern troop must watch that fortress must however quarter small body of men in pas between arcadia messenia have depot in present camp so that if turk attempted to land troop at kalamata must find pass from messenia blocked nicholas fell in with scheme two day afterwards set out with perhaps least efficient army have ever taken field have deliberately chosen troop from most ill prepared untrimmed of recruit for somehow other raw material have to be put into shape before be possible that must render creditable useful account of in serious operation be hardy out of door folk accustomed to sleep on hill eat roughest food with health cheerfulness be just who must most speedily prove drag demoralization if left idle in camp so on third morning set out at open scattered double where mountain side be steep among budding bush tilted rock taking short cut down to plain where might be possible to give semblance of formation baggage commissariat mule have preceded by few hour be to wait for when got down to marching ground two day march rather tramp brought to megalopolis sparkle in centre of green arcadian plain found town in hand of insurgent greek body of whom consisting of about two hundred men enrolled under nicholas here too heard same tale of slaughter pillage of turk already selfish evil be to do such harm to greek cause generally namely personal greed for plunder have crept in insurgent be wrangling over distribution of booty nicholas with fine indignation shamed into obedience though amid murmur of suppressed grumbling be hot with reproach be for few piastre said that be up in arm be liberty of nation to be weighed against cask of wine turkish slave taking whole matter into own hand reserved booty captured for expense of war half divided a fairly a might be among claimant from megalopolis karitaena be only four hour march be anxious to force pace so a to reach early next morning before rumor of approach must have gone abroad megalopolis men be a untrained a own knew country better organized out of corp of skirmisher who must go in advance intercept fugitive who might carry news of march into karitaena only chance of taking be if must find unprepared like kalamata creep up to at night either make night assault draw beleaguering line round before must be attacked like kalamata town be pregnable only from one side on road ran steeply up to gate parallel with citadel wall thus exposing attacking party to broadside fire if besieged be prepared be in fact more than prepared be wishfully expectant nicholas fell into very neatly baited trap skirmishing party have started little before sunset while others be to set out soon after so a to reach town by midnight before if possible make night attack if not take up place so that when morning dawned citadel might find beleaguered skirmisher exceeding nicholas instruction have gone too far be seen from karitaena night turk made preparation for long headed manoeuvre on morrow however nicholas arrived about midnight finding everything quiet hearing nothing from skirmishing party must lead to think that karitaena be prepared reconnoitred ground decided not to attack by night for gate be strong well fortified without artillery of kind must not quickly be forced returned to men gave order for disposition of troop who be most trustworthy consisting of greater part of argive corp be posted along road to guard bridge over alpheus led to megalopolis tripoli le trained soldier posted on north south where there be little likelihood of attack remained with rawer troop where presence be more likely to be needed than with argive on whom thought must rely morning came chilly clear nicholas on foot early went forward little to see if there be yet sign of movement in citadel advancing to where must see gate observed that be open that couple of turk driving mule be coming leisurely down path be unexpected opportunity surely must storm place out of hand have done with going back to men ordered immediate advance argive troop be to form vanguard then skirmisher from megalopolis in rear mixed untried men led in quarter of hour be ready argive corp leading way advanced at double up steep path then when be streaming up under wall turk showed that too have word to say to summary arrangement storm of musketry fire opened on besieger from length of wall like troop unaccustomed to fire did very worst thing possible stopped to return instead of advancing be hopeless for assailant be completely sheltered behind fortification greek fire did more than innocuously chip off piece of mortar stone from wall after losing several minute many life pressed on again gallantly enough towards gate still stood open brought second part of army with nicholas under fire be now moving rapidly forward still hoped that must be able to get in fire have demoralizing effect on raw recruit who have seen nothing of warfare pillaging of defenceless farm house a be shot down one after too wavered once first three rank stopped must have turned to run nicholas with voice of cheerful encouragement way boy way shouted will soon be past little shower then come turn voice sight of running on a man run to wine shop under pelting of rain word in greek contained somewhat coarse popular joke have right effect doubled on again to close up gap between vanguard few minute have be deadly expensive yet be marvel to see how men untried raw a be fed with hate faced horror of well directed grunt gasp of death involuntary cry of overwhelming physical pain writhing body under foot hardly le horrible sudden complete striking out of life nicholas looking back on thinned rank terror struck face determined advance thought gleefully be brave men be what need by time argive have very nearly reached gate then defender played second card quite suddenly from inside dashed out band of cavalry five hundred in number who rode full speed down on argive stopped attempting to make best of hopeless job front rank opened fire few turk fell charge came on two met with crash inevitable happened rank of foot broke men poured down off road onto steep slope below like water spilled resistance be not possible cavalry came on hewing way through congested mass of men in mean time firing from wall went on steadily nicholas seeing what have happened knew that to face spelled annihilation with fine wisdom though word be bitter in mouth did best must save yourselves cried run turned fled down road again turkish cavalry in rear hewing hacking discharging pistol rout be complete man ran a fast a must go while cavalry like swarm of stinging wasp flew hither thither opening out a reached plain chasing men a fled single in batch of five six luckily for wooded hill came down close to plain here struck for desperately across narrow strip of level land for there cavalry must not easily follow only man to man nicholas running down slope from road tripped in bush a turned out luckily for for sabre at moment swung over place where head must have be turk not waiting to attack singly when there be many little knot of men among whom must pick choose rode on leaving nicholas who have sprained ankle slightly a fell plunged into brushwood where be thickest to find refuge concealment rifle have thrown away for impeded flight found distance behind others who be going in right direction towards valtetzi where petrobey have told camp must be though rout have be complete utter nicholas be far from disguising fact from heart be filled with secret exultation at way troop have behaved for two three moment try courage of man when be being fired at can not return fire to be shot at when man may shoot in return aim be matched with aim be known to be strangely exhilarating to be shot at not to shoot be cold stuff for courage have be through baptism of fire under most trying circumstance with exception of one moment of wavering have stood ground till be told to stand no longer crept painfully up hill side alone pursuit have passed cavalry must see be returning across plain to town knowing be useless to follow farther that fatal road up to gate be strewn with corps almost greek with only handful of turk horse other horse however be careering riderless about plain nicholas limping from sprain thought how much more convenient must be to go riding to valtetzi than to drag along swollen foot quarter of mile away must see two three of men trying to capture one of only succeeded in frightening bolted up towards hill where nicholas be couple of minute later saw burst through first belt of tree halt on piece of open ground below there stopped in minute so began cropping at short growing grass bridle must see be over head trailing on ground now nicholas be odysseus of resource having lived in open air day not witlessly knew manner of many beast must imitate certain of call to other so even be deceived furthermore foot be one burning ache not wishing to walk more than must help preferred that horse must come to rather than that must go to horse be about hundred yard from long way below be grazing quietly so nicholas to make little alert also to assist in bringing nearer took up pebble with extreme precision lobbed over horse so that fell on far side of animal startled by noise stopped grazing started off at trot in direction away from where pebble have seemed to come directly towards nicholas after few yard however stopped again nicholas whinnied gently at that looked up again sniffed air before have continued grazing whinnied once more then lay flat down on back in moment horse answered nicholas called to third time heard from below that have left open be pushing towards through tree once again called answer came nearer in few moment horse appeared ambling quickly up steep incline for moment did not see nicholas for lay flat on ground half covered by bush when did seeing lay quite still came close up to sniffed round then quietly reaching out hand caught bridle a trailed on ground be satisfactory for besides getting mount have acquired pistol be stuck into case on holster getting up pushed horse forward through tree hour ride brought into bridle path running loftily along mountain side halted here to take bearing straight in front of not hour ride distant stood huddled roof of village took to be serrica at present must only see few of outlying house at thought that be serrica heart thrilled within for be village from wife have come wonderful return be for already work of avenging death have begun soon please god must turk be slain for hair of head ah cursed race who have brought dishonor to to wound must never be healed too little helen who ran towards cry father father yes by god father heard voice still cry must not be lifted up in vain in hour more stopped to reconnoitre turning off path among heather heart pulled thither yet for very reason must be cautious not risk ultimate completeness of vengeance from slope above watched for ten minute more seeing movement sign of life in village concluded that here too greek have risen after driving out turk have gone either to petrobey to kalavryta a looked saw that dozen house at one spot be roofless showing by charred beam pointing up to sky that have be burned at end stood church dedicated to mother of god oh bitterness of that be there have be married from door have walked away with dearest fairest of woman happiest man in greece nicholas hesitated no longer be still hour before noon did not care to travel during day must go down once more to place must see again let memory scourge into even keener anguish keener lust for vengeance putting horse to amble down crumbling hill side in ten minute more stood in straggling village street there be house house just in front of went there first door be standing open inside found a mitsos have found at sign of sudden departure brother in law then to whom house belonged must have gone to petrobey kalavryta probably latter thought be wine to husband brother double vengeance must be work of three men have not eaten that day soon found bread meat wine after stabling horse eating went out again to church step seemed tearing open of wound yet with step heart be fed with fierce joy ah helen must not call in vain church door be open entered have not altered at in twenty year since have seen last over altar hung rude early painting showing mother of god nestling in arm wondrous child in front remote king did obeisance behind stood ox as in stall casting down there in agony bitter sweet prayed with fervor faith to mother of divine child hope desire of year be concentrated into moment offered up humbly yet at best to lord handmaid of lord then in excitement of ecstasy a gazed on rude picture with streaming eye seemed to that sign of acceptance visible immediate be given light a steadfast milder than sun grew glowed round two figure rough craft of artist be glorified on face so human yet divine there came soft sudden graciousness of life be touched with pitiful sympathy for eye smiled acceptance of offering bowed down by so wonderful pity hid face in hand faith struck fear from heart in moment felt that have not prayed alone that wife have knelt by that be prayer mingled with have brought for signal favor of thrice holy maid on work night a soon a sun went down way grew dark went on journey with soul refreshed strengthened felt that vow have made over dead body of wife have be attested approved by christ mother of christ from hour to end of life never for day did that gracious vision like bread from heaven fail to sustain strengthen through clear spring night host of heaven rose wheeled above be ministering spirit wind passed cool bracing over hill side incense carried prayer upward to whom vengeance belonged have chosen a humble willing agent sword be sword of lord crossed first range of hill by midnight then struck road led by khan where mitsos yanni have stopped on way from tripoli be now within two hour of daybreak seeing light in window drew rein to inquire whether anastasis have seen aught of other fugitive looking in cautiously through window saw that floor be covered with greek who lay sleeping while anastasis good fellow be serving others with hot coffee bread illustration casting down there in agony bitter sweet prayed nicholas tied up horse went in a entered several of men in group round fire turned looked to see who be instinctively clutching at knife then one got hastily up head be among roof beam uncle nicholas cried be who else must be little mitsos what do here petrobey sent down morning to see if anything must be seen heard of when did not come heard from others what have happened be afraid almost afraid be not so easily got rid of said nicholas anastasis will not forget that be good to fugitive yes will have coffee most of men sleeping on floor have awoke at noise be sitting up nicholas took chair began sipping coffee little mitsos said aloud know what others may have told have happened will tell saw saw body of men who knew nothing of war stand steady under heavy fire because be told to stand saw go on under when there be room to move not one did see do aught else until have to set example told to run mitsos grew rather red in face cavalry charged on from behind fortification came hail of bullet never desire said striking table great thump must be possible to command braver men mitsos held out hand to man nearest christos shake hand knock down said eat word a one eats fig in autumn one gulp have be saying little mitsos asked nicholas said be coward to run away oh be very sorry be bad word be eating well let there be mistake mitsos said nicholas down go christos huge broad shouldered country greek looked up at mitsos grinning there be malice said called liar so did there be nearly hard blow oh must have made fine fight of for be little people there will be fighting now unless be wishful for will deny one anything now uncle nicholas have come why be lame uncle how did get here rode fine turkish horse remarked nicholas may never ride finer mitsos frank unreserved apology have quite restored amiability of present who when nicholas have entered be growling indignant for mitsos have made quite peculiarly offensive though must not clearly see how bravery be compatible with running away nicholas must be taken on trust nicholas have fallen in with last batch of fugitive since noon have be streaming up hill only few apparently be wounded have be sent on on mule to camp who have be wounded severely be feared must have fallen into hand of turk for there have be possibility of escape except by flight altogether nicholas reckoned have lost three hundred men for own promptness in seeing utter hopelessness of trying to stop cavalry charge must have lost five time that number having satisfied on point turned to mitsos again how about ship said when did get back two day after left taygetus said mitsos then with great grin ship be not tell about too afterwards have something to tell mitsos story be of course news to present be received with shout of approval though left out that part of raised exploit to heroism nicholas smiled at when have finished be well done said think little mitsos that too have friend who will perhaps aid a have aided told story of strange vision by know concluded that work be work god have blessed come what may not for hour will shrink from flinch till be finished till time come look east be already lightening get up lad for must push on to camp in quarter of hour be off men marching in good order a long a kept road falling out when have to climb rough hill side hour walking brought to top of hill on detached spur standing alone commanding valley must see line of fortification petrobey be erecting seeing coming while still far off rode out to meet nicholas spurred horse forward praise virgin that have come nicholas said for by know that there be disgrace be right have there be disgrace must not be here there be nothing bravery among men disgrace if so think be be on head told what have happened be brave men said petrobey yet think be braver for giving order must have be foolish loon if have not said nicholas laughing chapter v hornet nest at valtetzi since arrival at valtetzi three day before petrobey have hardly rested night day ground have occupied be fortifying with feverish haste be top of large spur of hill going steeply down into valley commanding good view of advantage be obvious for cavalry at present be particularly incompetent to meet must not possibly attack on perch also must be difficult for turk to get up of big gun of there be several in tripoli to make assault knew that in town there be at least ten six pounder certainly fifteen more nine pounder though since have occupied place found that turk have made effort to bring artillery to bear on petrobey suspected a turned out rightly that be not serviceable furthermore occupying valtetzi cut off tripoli from kalamata whither before long in probability turk must send relief expedition by sea however by occupation of valtetzi there must be two pass to capture before must send help to tripoli a said will be strong men if take tripoli lay about eight mile to northeast at present whole body of greek be occupied in fortifying post have taken village largely turkish have stood on spot demolition of house went on from daybreak to to make material for building up defensive wall soldier meantime a barrack be converted into fortification substituted for hut made of pole woven in with osier brushwood similar to used on taygetus wall must be confessed presented curiously unworkmanlike aspect here there course of regular square stone must be interrupted by couple of byzantine column from mosque capital of venetian pillar in strange human faced lion looked out from nest of conventional acanthus leaf farther on in same row must come packet of roof tile plastered together with mud plane tree standing in line of wall be pressed into service supplied place of big stone for eight upright course above that have be sawn off next section of trunk being straight made wooden coping for five yard of wall here chimney pot filled with earth stone took place among solider material here hearthstone placed on end with two inch of iron support for stewing pot staring foolishly out into vacancy then came section where builder have drawn from richer quarry fine slab of porphyry two rosso antico pillar formed exclusive coterie in midst of rough block of limestone though heterogeneous uncouth wall be stout high a petrobey said business be not to build pretty harem to please woman inside hardy sufficiency be note soldier hut though small must stand good deal of rough weather be built squarely in row camp wise floor be shingled with gravel from quarry close by two house only have be kept in one of be stored arm in other ammunition petrobey nicholas a before occupying hut exactly like tenanted by common soldier mule herd of sheep goat be driven out morning under armed escort to pasture on hill near penned to south of camp for night food be plentiful men seemed well content for booty already taken be very considerable in ten day more before end of april wall be complete petrobey following out plan have formed from first sent out daily nightly skirmishing expedition who made unlooked for raid on village scattered on plain about inhabitant of feeling secure in neighborhood to fortress have not yet sought refuge within wall men woman child alike be slain valuable seized flock herd driven up to camp village burned in such operation inglorious bloody be to be feared necessary part of programme of extermination greek believed not without cause to be only chance of freedom loss be almost to be numbered on finger once twice house defended by few men inside resisted attack fired upon in case assailant did not scruple to set light to place in ten day more only heap of smoking ruin remained of little white village have be dotted among vineyard like flock of feeding sheep petrobey also established small camp on hill to east of tripoli to guard road between plain of argo nauplia have already intercepted have small skirmish with troop coming to place from nauplia loss on greek side be about one hundred on of turk nearly double for when came to hand to hand fighting slow short legged turk be match for fresh vigor of mountain folk on occasion have lain in ambush on side of road opened fire simultaneously at regiment a passed turk have with contingent of cavalry on rocky wooded ground be perfectly useless infantry leaving road have driven greek from ground though in first attack have lost severely readiness to retreat when necessary not waste powder life profitlessly be in accordance with policy nicholas have indicated have be first to put in practice at karitaena be exactly harassing guerilla warfare in cavalry must not be brought into play in attack be unexpected flight be immediate upon sign of regular engagement made turk feel be fighting with shadow though number at beginning of war exceeded of greek yet engagement of kind lessened in far greater proportion than enemy who seemed on other hand to be mustering fresh troop day have petrobey at period consented to give battle in plain be probable that army must have be wiped out if have fought to close say much for wisdom that persisted in policy be tedious distasteful to personally greek be acquiring day fresh experience knowledge while strength of turk lay in admirable cavalry gun be lying useless in north however affair have not sped so prosperously germanos who be practically commander in chief of army at kalavryta le wise than colleague at valtetzi have risked attack on citadel at patras suffered severe defeat a at karitaena cavalry charge ought to have made follow nicholas example stuck with misplaced bravery to attempt until second body of cavalry took in rear cut off retreat with desperate courage men cut way through latter remnant only came through loss be enormous compared to sustained by turk nothing be gained by for citadel of patras still remained in hand of enemy news of disaster be brought to valtetzi about th of may with information that turkish soldier consisting of eight hundred cavalry fifteen hundred infantry have set out eastward along gulf of corinth under command of able turkish officer achmet bey five day afterwards be reported that have reached argo next day while skirmishing party engaged greek on hill opposite rest of force passed quietly down road reached tripoli same evening be splendid achievement boldly successfully carried out petrobey from hour held in readiness to repel attack might be made achmet bey found tripoli in poorer state than greek knew for incessant ravage on plain destruction of crop capture of flock herd a well a great influx of population have even now begun to make felt within wall for town plain in stood be cut off from assistance plain lay barren desolate saw at once that be necessary to establish connection with messenia for plain of argo be occupied by band of insurgent greek have scarcely won way through though port nauplia be still in hand of turk also be isolated from connection with main land by insurgent of plain newly created greek fleet from island of hydra spetzas kept in state of semi blockade by sea provision be got in with difficulty consumed in town achmet bey not knowing that petrobey have established post on pass over taygetus from kalamata into arcadia thought that successful attack on valtetzi must enable to open regular communication with messenia so with sea be early on morning of th of may that attack be made at dawn sentry on wall of valtetzi saw troop of cavalry issue from southern gate of tripoli followed by long column of infantry in quarter of hour camp be humming like swarming bee petrobey have established system of signal with post on other side of valley made sign to for seemed possible that achmet hoping to draw into plain must try to seize pas held communicated with argo be clear blue morning after cold night troop defiling from gate looked at distance like line of bright mailed insect first came infantry marching in eight separate column containing five hundred men next long line of baggage mule followed by horse pulling two gun last cavalry on black syrian horse very gayly caparisoned nicholas have excellent telescope have be given by captain of english ship in return for service petrobey watched until gate closed again behind petrobey shut up glass with happy little sigh will do very nicely said to nicholas will want to entice post on other side into plain think will of just stay at home want to meet gay cavalry just now yet two bright gun will have breakfast dear cousin bugle sounded for ration petrobey told men to eat well for said there will be dinner to day be thinking eye sparkled a pointed to enemy there will perhaps be little supper men grinned soon light blue smoke went up from hundred fire where be making coffee two three sentry only remained on wall who be told to report to petrobey when column left road on be marching turned off westward towards valtetzi eastward towards post on opposite hill nicholas have hardly sat down to breakfast however when orderly ran in saying that post on other side of valley be signalling petrobey finished egg beaten up with sugar milk before replying be not of signalling corp friend said let message be read brought to more coffee nicholas strike a particularly good morning message from signalling body came back in minute two be merely asking for order stop where be dictated petrobey watch to see if turkish reinforcement be coming from argo if so signal here at once if troop have come out of tripoli turn attack run away drawing after if possible there will be fighting for pray for comrade now dear cousin said to nicholas when have finished breakfast will talk if please hour afterwards orderly came in to say that troop have left road be making straight towards valtetzi petrobey got up one to post on wall said let one fire till word be given yanni take order to captain of company wall be pierced in length with narrow slit for firing in hour of be occupied by four men two of whom must fire at same time while two behind be employed in reloading musket outside wall be nine foot high built on ground sloped rapidly away in place at roof angle for two hundred foot while inside rose to within five foot of top of wall there man standing up must see over petrobey took up place over gate where must watch troop observed that infantry have separated into two party one of have left road be marching away from towards post on other side of valley while other larger half be advancing towards cavalry followed latter halted when hill began to rise more steeply out of plain smaller portion of infantry be evidently going to try to draw greek from far post down into plain while cavalry who stayed at bottom of pas below valtetzi must hinder help being sent from there petrobey noticed with pleasant smile others knew exactly what to do meantime force must assault valtetzi must be weakened by more than quarter of men most of however consisted of albanian mercenary who be largely in turkish pay who a well knew earned pay for be men of hill open air who must use sword be master of limb hundred men in greek camp be to say twenty five of group of four be under order of captain who in turn be under direction of petrobey in about two thousand men lined wall of remainder fifty be employed in distributing ammunition be in readiness to bring fresh supply to defender hundred more be ready to take place of who might be killed at post rest eight hundred men be standing under arm on small parade ground in centre of camp under command of nicholas must not however according to scheme petrobey have devised be required just yet told to pile arm fall out not to leave ground so that must not be recalled in moment if wanted mitsos be in attendance on nicholas yanni stood by petrobey ready to take order to part of camp hour elapsed before albanian infantry appeared above ridge five hundred yard off still in greek camp there be perfect silence then opening out advanced at double intending evidently to try to storm place have clearly not known how completely have be fortified while be still about four hundred yard off halted at word of command sheltered among big bowlder strewed hill side still in greek camp there be sound movement only yanni ran across to nicholas with order be ready called men up stood in line with arm then word be shouted by commander of advancing troop petrobey saw albanian massing behind small spur of hill about quarter of mile away where be hidden from sight there be long pause individual man in camp knew that enemy be close that in few minute shot must be singing in mean time must not see one two mile away on plain stood glittering mailed insect turkish cavalry six mile off mere black speck be troop have gone across to east suspense be almost unbearable nerve be stretched to highest tension man exhibited nervous discomfort in own peculiar way christos who be stationed at one of loop hole straight towards enemy merely turned cold damp wiped sweat off forehead with flabby hand expectorating rapidly yanni on other hand at post by petrobey have mouth a dry a sirocco got very red in face swore gently atrociously to young recruit from megalopolis suddenly threw back head laughed sergeant of company vented own tension by cuffing over ear yet boy laughed on mitsos standing by nicholas whistled song of vine digger between teeth father andrea who have begged to be allowed to serve in way be loader for two men next petrobey chanted over over again gently below breath first verse of te deum last sung at kalamata nicholas stood still hawk eye blazing most be quite silent shifting uneasily at post standing now on one leg now on other petrobey perhaps alone for have to think for be quite calm mind fully occupied spur behind albanian be massed be almost opposite gate over stood chance be that must try to storm perhaps try to storm gate together other of be diagonally opposite to at last round shoulder of hill poured troop in two division still four hundred yard distant when rear have come into open first be about two hundred seventy yard off petrobey glancing hastily at number disposition spoke to yanni without turning head will make double attack here on other gate said run like hell there direct fire know order yanni rushed across camp just a got up to other gate heard volley of musketry from petrobey side albanian have separated into two column one of skirting round camp out of musket range soon appeared opposite second gate at distance of about two hundred fifty yard waited till saw white of eye then fire cried be moving in open file at first closed a got nearer solid column of men advanced at rapid double up hundred yard incline first volley took when foremost be about sixty yard off be rather wild men for most part shot over head two more volley be delivered with greater precision before got up to gate still pressed on party of men have halted on hill behind about hundred twenty yard off be returning fire without effect for defender be protected by wall bullet struck that whistled over top meantime greek in centre of wall between two gate be still unemployed before ten second be passed petrobey saw that must be wanted sent sergeant flying across to marshal first row kneeling others standing opposite gate on stood saw be on point of yielding to assault nicholas meantime have drawn up men by gate opposite be prepared in case be forced to receive in same manner before five minute have elapsed since first appearance of albanian round hill petrobey gate burst in with crash assailant be met by torrent of bullet from in reserve inside fairly drove off foot next moment gate be clear again then nicholas knew time have come divided men into two part charging out at wrecked gate led at double double half to right half to left round camp close under wall so that greek fire went over head fell on flank of albanian who be attacking opposite gate at moment yanni seeing what be happening stopped fire from inside wall at order from petrobey caused gate to be opened company of who have be manning wall hurled onto assailant triple attack be irresistible in couple of minute more phalanx of albanian be in full rout hill side be covered with group of men in individual combat party have left on hill being no longer able to fire into melee rushed down to join in scrimmage petrobey leaving only small number of men inside sufficient to defend gate called out rest headed in person charge on first attacking party up down stony hill side chased be chased greek now then party of albanian must try to form in sort of order to make combined assault on broken down gate a often be scattered again by knot of men who rushed wildly upon from side in point of number albanian have have advantage at first attack that short range fire from wall have be of decimating nature now greek have superiority mitsos who have gone out with nicholas found almost swept off foot by rush of own countryman from gate for few moment be carried along helpless striking being able to strike with curious red happiness in heart singing song of vine digger though knew not be singing then suddenly at elbow appeared glaring fierce face a crimson a sunset found jammed shoulder to shoulder with yanni who be swearing a hard a must lay tongue to not that be angry because madness of fighting be on happened to take way shout big pig called to mitsos why in name of devil in pit get out of way fat old yanni shouted mitsos come on little cousin 'dig deep among vine eh there be fine grape for gathering go to hell screamed yanni hullo mitsos be better have squeezed out into backwater of congested stream of men in full front stood great hairy albanian with sword just raised to strike mitsos flying at like wild cat threw in man face hand grasped short dagger like sword a must throw stone uplifted sword swung over back harmlessly while blade of own dagger made great red rent in man face fell back mother wo know now sang out mitsos burying knife in throat 'dig deep ' be deep enough yanni 'the summer here ' there be little work for musket for man have time room to load yanni went on blasphemous way swinging by barrel dealing blow right left with butt in few minute mitsos found out of crowd alone for dead greek lying there on little hillock fifty yard from gate while fight flickered up down on side of eh there be little breath left in carcass panted yanni why mitsos head covered with blood there be slice out of forehead illustration mitsos flying at like wild cat mitsos black curl in fact be dripping from cut on head what with blood dust sweat be in fine mess have not known be touched yanni bound up for with strip of shirt two ran down again into fight there tide be strongly setting in favor of greek albanian be beginning to form again on spur of rock straggler from below kept joining petrobey thinking that be preparatory to attack on gate a additional defence drew off hundred men from mainats who have stuck together be only company who preserved even semblance of order when saw that there be such intention on enemy part for body suddenly wheeled disappeared over brow of hill in direction of plain followed by who be fighting in other part of field for time have have enough of nest of hornet retreated in good order pursued by skirmishing party from greek who followed with derision bullet petrobey order have be that must not advance beyond broken ground expose to attack by cavalry in hour more have come back to camp skirmish have lasted about three hour petrobey knew that fighting be not over yet cavalry have be moved from plain onto one of lower foothill to routed albanian retreated while detachment have started a if to attack greek post on hill to east have evidently be recalled for have passed road along troop have first come be now marching straight across narrow strip of plain separated from range on valtetzi stood hour afterwards have joined cavalry below eye must see that assault be being planned long train of baggage mule be left on plain between greek be whole body of albanian turkish troop so have seemed not incautiously to achmet bey be protection enough soon be seen that troop be in motion again whole body of infantry cavalry together moved up slope towards camp be marching up one side of long ravine be cut in mountain from top to bottom have posted scout along two ridge to guard against attack might be contemplated from flank mile farther up however cavalry halted for ground be getting too steep bowlder sown to permit farther advance in case of sudden retreat must prevent pursuit being carried farther petrobey saw what be coming hesitated mouth watered after baggage train below feared to weaken defence of camp by sending men for purpose nicholas however be clear gun ammunition baggage be fine thing in way not worth measurable risk hand be needed at valtetzi besides movement from greek camp even if sent men round by circuitous route down next ravine must be observed by scout opportunity however might come later for three hour more desultory skirmishing attack be made by albanian on camp four time advanced column right up to one other gate a many time be driven back twice by sortie from inside twice by heavy firing from wall at last a sun began to decline towards west be called back retreated hurriedly towards cavalry then nicholas saw opportunity scout have be withdrawn from ridge for no longer expected attack from flank with hundred mainats set off down parallel ravine hotfoot to plain while rest of men under petrobey order followed enemy at distance keeping attention fixed on in expectation of attack achmet bey at last thought that greek have fallen into trap have baited so many time hoped to draw down into plain where must turn crush with cavalry be already approaching last hill bordered on level ground when petrobey who kept eye on plain saw nicholas band wheel round baggage animal shooting down driver force up ravine down have come on moment gave order to fire greek poured volley into rear of infantry turk be fairly caught if achmet sent cavalry on to rescue baggage greek whose number be now far superior to infantry must in probability annihilate if on other hand kept cavalry to support infantry baggage must be lost chose lesser evil a ground be now becoming smoother more level directed cavalry to charge on greek petrobey fairly laughed aloud run away run away cried let not two men remain together cavalry charged there be simply nothing to charge up hill side in direction fled greek choosing stoniest steepest place dispersing a ran a ball of quicksilver break be spread to part of compass again retreat of turk began once more greek gathered engaged attention in growing dusk attack must be made for horse be already beginning to stumble pick way carefully to avoid falling while greek still hung on rear flank like swarm of stinging insect when hill began to sink into plain petrobey too sounded retreat men though tired hungry went singing up hill side at first sang song of vine digger others fountain mavromati others swallow song by degree song of klepht gained volume by time entered camp again men be singing rang true to deed have wrought thus sang mother to turk will not be slave will not endure let take gun let be klepht dwelling with beast on hill rock snow will be coverlet stone will be bed weep not mother mother mine pray that many turk bite dust through chapter vi entry of germanos petrobey be not slow to follow up advantage by in mountain nest ottoman force now in tripoli be evidently not to be feared in offensive must dislodge greek from position have taken up upon high hilly ground on other hand greek be not capable of meeting cavalry must at present keep to hill not attempt to blockade town closely for in so doing must have to leave height for plain in fortress stood expose to horse with ever increasing number be e flocking to greek standard camp at valtetzi be rapidly getting insufficient in accommodation at same time additional position on hill must be link in iron chain be being forged round town now when be unlikely that turk must risk further engagement at once be moment for advancing step exactly to west of tripoli within rifle shot of wall stood three steep spur of hill known a trikorpha same stir of primeval force threw up crag on valtetzi stood must have cast up bubbling basaltic through volcanic vent hole long after great range

pretentious meddling giving air of deposed monarch for whom be privilege to fight encouraging seditious talk among men by hinting openly that military leader be in league with turk making convention

with permission will put before speak hope a be fitting must speak to yet in mere justice to position cousin hold must tell that there be other interest to be considered for day past there have be division among here not so widely a at other place division there be that too at time when anything of kind be most disastrous there be in camp priest primate who have be saying to men not with nobleness of aim that have indicated to war tell be war of religion be champion ordained minister of religion be to soldier obedience be due what did get for pain shrug of shoulder insolence perhaps question fighting be ' answer 'for whom be fighting for captain leader let tell be who will reap fruit of toil be who will get booty for have spent blood left home now before god father be satanic slander if talk continues who can tell that may become in part true for a army increase have to appoint fresh captain often happens that band of men come in with appointed leader whom have to accept be not such men a cousin must naturally appoint what fear be fear be sorry to say be justified by what be taking place at monemvasia captain talk to other saying 'the primate be trying to get whole spoil of war for two can play at game if war be for enrichment of leader let be for enrichment of leader who have done work of talk too have reached men with result believe what primate say already distrust captain distrust primate say that be not who be doing work why must look for wage most part of who have heard seditious talk distrust be man for be fault of primate be place for for of at least who have taken part in war be work of soldier be doing not work of priest danger be real one a say be danger from who sit at meat with more deadly more intimate than experience from enemy there be none of before primate came among have said nicholas spoke with rising anger thought of mean petty squabble poisoned hope have ruled life for so long be to be wrecked in port on very eve of fulfilment strong a greek position now be inevitable though fall of tripoli appeared yet knew that army demoralized be army at be honey to turn to bitterness be that fair day that seemed now dawning to come in cloud trouble germanos have listened with growing resentment burst out in answer be wrong nicholas believe be wrong be primate who have to put up with insult army of yours be band of wanton child long chid beaten breaking out from school know reverence respect where respect be due ah pardon again said nicholas first duty of soldier be obedience to who be put over a captain commander to have never yet failed in respect in obedience soldier be men take said germanos first duty of man be to obey who be over in lord father father cried nicholas pained unwilling to give pain be time now when be in middle of operation of war to talk of of course be right that christian man belief hand be full have siege before be injudicious of primate to stir up such talk now oh be hand at speaking see do not what mean be lord work surely mean by be accomplished be sword in unity men bound together by one aim that aim glory of god said germanos nicholas made hopeless gesture of dissent shook head petrobey who have hitherto taken part in discussion broke in surely can do better than wrangle together like boy said be light matter have in hand let talk practically what nicholas say be true father there be mischievous talk going on there be none till primate came what do propose to do will help to stop will speak to men will tell that though be primate yet believe in integrity of military commander though soldier duty a men exacts obedience to ruler of church yet duty a soldier exacts obedience to commander trust in question be cleverly chosen to refuse to do a petrobey asked must without explanation be wholly unreasonable to comply must be tantamount to telling soldier to disregard primate germanos hesitated moment wish to put outside province said germanos be here only a head of church not a military leader to interfere with ordering of army be not business then how much le said nicholas eagerly be business of inferior to do so will then tell to follow own most wise example germanos be silent brain be busy yet have reply ready see said little while ago asked to help now ask to help for danger be le to party than to ours speak to primate if will speak to captain will perhaps listen to at rate asked not help against own subordinate said germanos in sudden flash of anger if want help against own men can only say with stopped short for insult be on lip petrobey sat down again with little sigh nicholas answered germanos according to own manner then if be so good a to think that own affair be out of hand said with angry sarcasm will be time to think of helping when have put in order let quote own word be not jealous for be very jealous for honor of army have pledge of favor of god on undertaking ' germanos held up hand pacifically will gain nothing by quarrelling said be in wrong for be first to speak in anger what be pledge of speak nicholas told of vision at serrica when have finished be gently that answered surely mother of god look with favor on nicholas said archbishop for sake if not for own let see if can not put end to unhappy division of tell lay whole blame on order be sure that be not hasty there be at least seditious talk before primate came said nicholas then have proposal to make said petrobey be men be divided side with primate with two party be bitterly opposed if supreme council be appointed consisting of primate commander might not division be healed nicholas shook head wish to make difficulty said case be siege of tripoli be work of army have primate to do with might a well demand seat in synod of church germanos eye brightened realized impossibility of pushing first demand just now at rate must be step gained for rest trusted in own ability to soon get in hand chief share of work of supreme council petrobey have suggested with most diplomatic change of front proceeded to conciliate nicholas dear nicholas said wish with heart have place in synod of church a priest must have soon earned one selected vocation in need give testimony to merit consider dear nicholas be national movement church be great national institution have always have voice often supreme voice in direction of national affair must not think want to interfere in military matter will not find charalambes for instance for matter wishing to lead sortie direct fire in england a know there be two great legislative house one composed of lord of land without initiative with power of check other elected body voice of people general be elected body on initiative depends primate correspond to titular power where can find so splendid august government a see come to meet way be not time now to talk of supremacy of church meet half way allow in national concern must not be without voice there be two power in new greece if be in accord danger have spoken of melt like summer mist nicholas looked across at petrobey must have follow asked well consent germanos be careful not to betray too much elation at success of scheme soon spoke of other thing prince demetrius ypsilanti whom hetairia club of patriot in north greece have chosen to take place of treacherous inefficient brother be shortly to come to peloponnesus hitherto proceeding of club have be very secret fund intrusted to few agent such a nicholas germanos rapid success of war still more brilliant promise for in north greece a well have spread like fire have rendered further concealment unnecessary came forward now a author of liberty of greece credit be through admirable agent due be exercising undoubted right in giving command to whomever must germanos also assured petrobey nicholas that be in highest favor with club prince demetrius be most amicably warmly inclined to might also tell that prince have intention of interfering in conduct of war be content to leave in more experienced hand be coming a head of hetairia have organized financed outbreak of war be sure so thought germanos to approve of step have decided on to appoint national senate doubt must take place at head of assembly chapter vii rule of senate from conversation among three sprang into being peloponnesian senate than more futile apparatus have ever be devised to guide affair of nation from first harmony be impossible between two party only result achieved worth mentioning be that diverted time energy of military leader from work to muscle must have be strained fall of tripoli so far from reconciling division among soldier merely encouraged partisanship for be known that senate must not agree on point worth deliberation petrobey be more than once tempted to resign seat to do be only to throw wavering balance of power firmly into hand of primate while between nicholas germanos there ripened a bitter a dead sea apple enmity only to be reconciled at death bed for germanos so nicholas considered did not scruple to say have deceived colleague have professed highest most altruistic aim what guided conduct be most selfish personal policy be to be feared be partly true though not entirely for germanos have be sincere when opened to two scheme for glory of church finding supremacy like fruit of tantalus still dangling beyond seemingly only just beyond reach stung intolerably at failure personal motive crept in before long usurped place of other nicholas have hoped great thing from arrival of prince too be doomed to be disappointed be given enthusiastic welcome by army majority of whom be sickened with atmosphere of intrigue petrobey instantly took place a subordinate prince gave to understand that be wish that conduct of siege must continue in same hand germanos too welcomed cordially with due recognition of position for hoped to win over to side of church for time seemed that solution of difficulty be imminent in hand of stronger man doubt such universally recognized authority must have found mean of reconciliation prince demetrius be terribly unfitted for responsibility principle be honorable by nature be weak undecided inclined first to one party then to with diplomatic yielding will give inch to gain yard with pitiful futility of one who have knowledge of men habit of command certainty of to soldier weakness manifested openly unhappily not erroneously in personal appearance be under middle height manner always stiff awkward be sometimes insolent sometimes timid unfortunate demeanor for be one other only excessively self conscious shy face be thin pinched hair although be only thirty two be already gray scanty giving look of premature old age being short sighted blinked peered a mitsos said like noonday owl voice be querulous high pitched yet be of upright mind indifferent to danger free from besetting sin of race avarice outward defect corresponded too well with inadequacy of nature strong man with not so honorable heart a have might easily have filled post better uprightness of character at crisis where uprightness be quality wanted must not make felt to army council be bubbling came from man half drowned when what be wanted be firm voice loud drowning cry moreover be morbidly sensitive about own dignity position there be something comically tragical to see that puny frame with bent shoulder presiding over company of strong men hear that little screechy voice prating of wish command on one side of sat germanos courtier like full of deference plying with title a nurse give suck to baby while prince drinking like child must be well pleased pipe what say be very true be wish that church must be fully recognized yes quite so dear archbishop think friend gallant commander of army of a commander in chief a viceroy by wish of hetairia yes exactly have something to say on subject then petrobey must lay before prince urgent need of doing one thing before others tripoli must be taken surely claim of two party must be settled afterwards be work most important to for three week now since beginning of june have waited at trikorpha provision of array be already beginning to be exhausted herd be being thinned lower pasture be drying up in summer heat must not step be taken here at once prince demetrius must answer something in manner what say be very true dear petrobey quite agree with that there be time to be lost must not form committee deliberate what be to be done then submit result to to receive sanction spoke remember about formation of cavalry corp very wise plan thought meant to have talk with about really day have slipped by so yes must indeed be up doing orderly have just informed gentleman that dinner be ready will be pleased to see dear archbishop commander at table dinner will be served immediately deliberation gentleman in think may say have made solid progress will be adjourned till to morrow at usual hour nicholas saw that there be help here set to thwart germanos with power considered that presence of primate in camp rendered army powerless for be eaten up with intrigue slander incessant accusation provoking counter accusation at meeting of senate opposed germanos on point whether suggestion be honorable expedient allying with one who must join in upholding army against church ranged side by side with crooked unscrupulous men like poniropoulos anagnostes mere brigand adventurer who without motive own greed have got together band of peasant be in command of mere disorderly rabble men who in soberer moment knew be a detestable a in furious anger against germanos thought primate to be day meeting of senate grew more more disorderly gradually prince demetrius saw that be no more than cypher in eye of men of personal ambition nicholas have none honestly with whole heart cared for nothing success of revolution extermination of turk used great power influence for defeat of intriguing primate being convinced that till question between two party be settled nothing must be done at rate be free from sting of conscience conduct might be unwise acted from impeccable motif there be enough truth in allegation against germanos to give sting be wellnigh unforgivable be already more than half way through june still army remained inactive petrobey have so far succeeded in rousing prince a to permit to make arrangement for regular supply being sent to camp there be still talk of assault on tripoli indeed preparation for ensuring success senate have met a usual that morning meeting have degenerated into fierce brawl between anagnostes nicholas on one side germanos charalambes on other be in vain that prince tried to restore order listened to no more than to buzzing fly when at length germanos bitten to quick by intolerable taunt of nicholas rose from table saying must take further part in deliberation of senate there must be end said to how long ago be nicholas since swore allegiance to allegiance in thing in jurisdiction replied nicholas to glory of god not to glory of germanos heat of anger did not excuse word moment afterwards better feeling within must have have unsaid anagnostes sitting at elbow applauded vehemently silence there said germanos in white anger will hear voice no more here let tell be not rid of will see what people say to such treatment a have be subjected to go to people shouted nicholas see how mainats receive mainats said mainats whom hold degree only above turk dear archbishop dear archbishop piped prince there be true loyal men in greece besides hound continued germanos not even hearing prince speak archbishop said prince again with certain dignity command order to be silent germanos turned round on still mad with rage order command said with infinite scorn broke into sudden unnatural laugh prince demetrius flushed on senate fell dead hush for once man showed dignity of birth breeding standing up faced angry prelate nervous weak manner have left rose to occasion will please to take seat archbishop said have few word to say germanos looked round saw on side eager attentive face bent not on on prince anger still burned like fire within paused not to consider prefer to leave room said take further part in proceeding choose to disregard request said prince with voice rose sudden screaming fierce will therefore order sit down cried germanos anger went out a suddenly a lightning at night be followed by darkness realized what have done prince favor have forfeited hopelessly though prince be nothing have forgotten in man insignificance power represented henceforth must have to fight without expectancy of help from there feeling scheme already threatening to totter fall about head in sheer blank bewilderment sat down prince stood silent moment then spoke feel said that good hoped to do all effort wished to make for great cause be not to be fulfilled with exception of commander of army senate generally have chosen to disregard presence here from petrobey however have always have courtesy respect party of church in particular have chosen to adopt insolent demeanor towards like of accept from man have seen gentleman example head have given regret decision have long thought be possible have be forced upon gentleman leave camp to day meeting be adjourned then turning to petrobey bowing to rest come with said will leave assembly together taking arm left room hour later quitted camp with small guard leaving rest of retinue to follow a quickly a must get ready news of departure reason for spread like wildfire through trikorpha men who still regarded partly because of marked favor showed to petrobey partly from prestige of revolutionary hetairia represented a champion be wildly indignant with primate riot nearly ensued have not petrobey other commander notably nicholas have guarded in place of safety be not improbable that must have be murdered germanos however who whatever fault be be perfectly fearless refused protection when one of mainats passing near spit at archbishop dealt man blow knocked off foot passed on without hurry discomposure though be in middle of clan mainats who be without particle of reverence for have deep respect for personal pluck appreciated act fully made attempt to stop though minute before be very doubtful whether must have reached quarter alive day feeling in camp against primate rose higher higher for from soldier point of view prince be protector not only against own commander who a primate have told rousing suspicion if not belief in mind be employed in making private arrangement with turk promising life in exchange for property one be true have breathed suspicion about petrobey nicholas for stood beyond shadow of scandal for time ugly thought primate have suggested be cast aside in fierce indignation excited by immediate cause of withdrawal of prince for primate alone be to be thanked knot of angry men assembled outside building where primate musket be stored demanding that must be given up to be dealt with a deserved indeed such fate be not unmerited must have saved world of trouble to petrobey for be responsible for doubt division be traitor in camp in time of war traitor be worse than regiment of foe next day there be abatement of popular feeling in afternoon whole body of commander captain went to petrobey after exacting promise from men of quietude in absence asking that prince might be petitioned to return for absence must end in one thing death of primate with authority of commander in default of by mutiny petrobey readily consented to go in person for thing be at absolute impasse without prince co operation presence be really afraid that worst might happen in name of entire army with earnest appeal of primate waited upon at leondari revolted town not far from megalopolis prince at first hesitated seemed to hesitate privately be very much gratified at what seemed so universal mark of confidence for on thinking action over have appeared to that must cut sorry figure if returned to hetairia saying that army disregarded authority met command with insolence while if came back withdrawal assumed aspect of most successful piece of diplomacy accordingly at end of week returned amid welcoming acclamation of army be pleased to accept having insisted on same apology of germanos be bitter herb to proud man to nicholas a sweet a honey in mouth throughout july waning with moon continued reign of incompetent honest man prince demetrius indecision amounted to disease of mind seemed morally incapable of acting through pretentious viceregal claim of letting others act for creature afflicted with acute paralysis of will inside tripoli there be still famine of food water though achmet bey saw that escape be impossible for weakness of troop inside must have rendered attempt to cut through occupation on hill quite hopeless yet be in mind to surrender when attempt be made to induce to do so there be provision in camp must last three month more for harvest have be got in before occupation of valtetzi ravage of greek have destroyed only village winter crop mehemet salik remarked one morning one seemed safer in tripoli than anywhere else hot month throbbed by while to greek day close saw day lost chapter viii song from tripoli early in august news came to camp that turk in monemvasia have made proposal for capitulation for will be remembered that small fleet of vessel from spetzas be blockading by sea in addition to regiment from south greece by land tidings gave prince demetrius most ill conceived idea term of capitulation be discussed at meeting of senate caused very considerable difference of opinion nicholas petrobey advising that turk must be given passage over to smyrna asia minor port on condition that surrendered arm refunded expense of siege for soldier have be serving without pay further gave indemnity of ten thousand turkish pound must be divided among fleet army national treasury germanos party opposed monemvasia be notably one of wealthiest town in peloponnesus proposed that besieged must only be given life on surrender of property prince demetrius went to other extreme hetairia must charge with arrears of soldier pay since be for very purpose fund have be raised to soldier be due pay nothing more if easy term be granted to monemvasia turk in tripoli must be more disposed to capitulate discussion degenerated into wrangling in middle of prince demetrius suddenly commanded silence since affair with germanos have secured formality of obedience be listened to in silence will go to monemvasia in person said to receive to accept capitulation of town a commander in chief of army viceroy appointed by supreme council of hetairia troop there so hear be out of hand mainat corp under commander petrobey will accompany will continue to discus term of capitulation observe little more decorum senate have experienced deficiency in power of command too long word be like word coming from mouth of mask when one knew how insignificant figure stood behind autocratic tone be ludicrous in particular case peculiarly out of place petrobey who when be possible supported prince now found obliged to oppose with courtesy found hard to assume spoke in answer highness will remember said that siege have be going on for three month have be entirely work of people hetairia have not helped in way be surely then right to demand own term surrender must be made to captain of blockading force to whomever appoint to other prince flushed angrily do understand then be not commander in chief of whole army highness be commander in chief over army have be organized supplied by hetairists agent force blockade monemvasia be raised by private enterprise before appointment by hetairia during stay in morea have not either taken command there assisted that force commander of land force there be member of senate doubt will obey resolve sooner than of viceroy viceroy also be member of senate said petrobey with adroitness prince be silent moment senate will therefore vote a to whether monemvasia be to be occupied in name of senate in name said shortly for once there be unanimity between two party be decided that monemvasia be to be occupied in name of senate discussion about term of capitulation be then renewed a be felt that commander of blockading force have more voice in matter than one else germanos with amiable desire of perhaps thwarting nicholas whose proposal have be more moderate than own suggested that point must be settled between commander prince upon arrival there of latter for be absurd that commander of force be besieging tripoli must have voice in matter nicholas knowing that petrobey must be there too that have more influence with prince than one acquiesced with smile saying that germanos sage reflection applied equally to primate who be not in command of anything so for time centre of war like slow moving stream shifted to monemvasia during whole of august army lay idle on hill round tripoli with departure of prince tale of scandalous slander be again taken up by primate result of be to appear later germanos though must have known what be going on held aloof did not mix up in affair of camp though to shame be said appeared to make effort to check outrageous intrigue to nicholas however month be full of work at once put in hand arrangement for regular supply of camp be occupied with drilling men under wise yet severe rule unorganized troop began slowly to take shape example shamed many of other idle irresponsible captain into following lead though having little knowledge of military matter must be concluded that men be not able to advance to high degree of efficiency meantime among men utter inability of prince to check abuse to enforce discipline have become apparent from time of departure for monemvasia power may be said to have ceased altogether when news of what have taken place at town came to hand from being nothing became ridiculous nightly raid ceased for cultivated land round tripoli be already devastated in town in camp be particular vigilance observed turk knew be hopeless to attack trikorpha till return of petrobey greek have thought of attempting to storm town mitsos brooding inwardly one night on rough wall where yanni used often to sit have idea arose from inaction for several week after adventure of fire ship anxiety about suleima have be stilled for escape seemed to so heaven sent that with childlike faith have manner of doubt that saint watched over though at time heart went mourning for absence yet trusted unreasoning conviction at time appointed must see again strong probability that be in beleaguered town did not at first weigh on at day when provision ran short must capitulate there must be repetition of scene at kalamata must storm there must be fighting inside woman must be in house even if house be attacked must remember what have told cry out to in greek saying be of blood must be well when excitement of skirmish at valtetzi now nearly two month ago move to trikorpha with delightful night raiding be over be succeeded by inaction sickened by odious intrigue of primate began to weary sore for then to be filled with panic fear a unfounded a first security safety in siege there be such thing chance bullet angry greek repetition of infernal butchery of woman child on board ship bound for egypt what be more horribly possible burning house falling wall then mass of pulped body on particular night fear grew like monstrous vision of hag ridden nightmare hundred terrible scene loomed enormous before in suleima with white imploring face be struck out of life now by bullet now by sword below in part of town nearest where five six big house be built on wall there gleamed row of light from narrow barred window from suleima face looked out from room burning within while shook iron bar with impotent hand a flame flickered rose behind thing became intolerable rose walked about found rest thirty yard away soldier hut began must hear sound of singing from big shanty built cafe little farther on sentry have just be on round mitsos exchanged word two with a passed must be back again in hour wall inside be only six foot high outside perhaps ten twelve with plenty of handhold for agile lad next moment without thinking where why went have clambered up dropped down on other side did not know where be going ah heart told somewhere in fiery eyed town into entrance be impossible be for whom be made with eye of night history of soul written on curve of lip inasmuch a be there rekindled fever of love drew thither willing unwilling steel to magnet moth to star have taken off shoe in order to get better grip in crevice of wall went down barefooted over basalt rock ashine with dew moon have strayed westward beyond zenith casting shadow little in front of round head a walked moved opaline halo then crossed mountain stream stood in for moment for coldness of moon eternal youth of night have entered into water making vigorous bracing little wind drawing down course be full of scent of water green thing streamed out to renovate hot air of plain then on again through little belt of vineyard still close to camp not destroyed where stream talked le noisily in soft earth with whiff of summer from ripening bunch scuttle of disturbed hare come down to feed on leaf then crossed stream again lay in elbow southward pushing through clump of oleander rose above head came out into plain earth be warm under foot after cold rock ran plunging across till getting within stone throw of wall crept more slowly finally lay down in shadow of felled olive tree looked to see if there be aught stirring illustration have clambered up dropped down on other side battlemented line of wall opposite to stood up clear cut between moon light of town twenty foot above ran on southward into vague shadow untenanted fifty yard to left be interrupted rather crowned by dozen big house built flush with wall pierced by several row of rather narrow window lower of be barred upper from height needing such defence a crept up alongside of heard subdued murmur of woman voice from within first house home perhaps of turkish captain harem sound of woman voice made mirth to listened for while smiling to from next house came more such music once woman walked to window stood looking out for minute perhaps two unveiled playing with tassel of blind cord till from within one called by purring turkish name turned into house again crept slowly on to end of line of house where battlemented wall began again feeling closer to suleima in sound of woman voice came back lay down again in shadow of tall toothed rock be something to be alone away from jarring camp to be nearer to portentous nightmare beset no longer anxiety again be charmed to sleep one by one light went out in window opposite house became blackness shadow of rock moved little forward in setting moon shifted to be in shade again half hour went by mountain ridge hid moon presently afterwards man appeared on top of wall to right mitsos perhaps must not have noticed that waved white linen thing up down once twice then waited again after time uttered impatient exclamation mitsos watched puzzled to know what must mean when suddenly possible solution dawned upon crept up still in shadow to below where turk be standing whistled softly then voice from above said be late here be paper signed white thing fluttered down done turk turned without waiting for reply went southward down wall paper whatever be be in mitsos possession putting in pocket for be too dark to read crept back to old place to wait few minute more there before going back to camp light showed only in one house now before long too be quenched black mass of flat roof rose against sky silent asleep then suddenly softly from out that blackness like bird flying in desert came sound of voice singing at note mitsos thought heart must have burst for sang dig deep among vine give sweet spring shower home else fairest sun shine stopped a suddenly dying like sigh looking up saw framed in one of dark window upper part of girl figure dressed in white without pause boy voice answered lends lustre to wine sends sparkle to foam prattle of stream above alone whispered in stillness then voice softly asked mitsos be here oh dearest one be little tinkle of laughter rippled from above ending in sudden quick drawn breath at last see again said softly see at mitsos little mitsos be well with mitsos crept silently out of shadow stretched out arm to be well in great thing that be not together will be soon dearest oh please god will be soon suleima leaned forward from window must not wait here must be at passage window though house be dark one never know so go beloved beloved beloved will not be waiting long will mitsos there will soon be soon maybe will come to with gift gift said mitsos then understood ah dearest of whispered yes even so said suleima oh mitsos pray that may soon be able to take away soon horrible town will fall before long must be said when end come run to meet enemy a deliverer cry ' be of blood ' oh heart forget not that suleima turned quickly hearing sound within whispering good night be gone again leaving mitsos alone heaven have opened walking on air went back to camp waiting below wall till sentry have gone by climbed in again where have got out for most part men be gone to bed passed few on way back to little hut shared with yanni two mainats of whom have gone with petrobey undressing quickly lay down on bed to feast alone on great happiness with irrepressible hopefulness of youth fear have vanished before sight of one have never be set to tell over like rosary of hallowed bead moment of night not till then did recollect mysterious paper have received then getting hastily up struck light on tinder box lit small oil fed wick illumination be dim flickering handwriting be large clear by holding close to light must easily read be very short written in greek abdul achmet promise to pay to constantinos poniropoulos sum of two hundred turkish pound on condition that harem be on termination of siege of tripoli insured security from outrage massacre for transport expense of travelling to place of safety for person ten pound in addition will be paid signed abdul achmet ex governor of city of argo mitsos read through once without taking in meaning far le whole bearing of then putting back in pocket blew out light lay with wide open eye staring at darkness while full meaning of word slowly dawned on first came hot indignation greek captain at head of five hundred men be privately trafficking with besieged for private gain close on heel of anger came fierce overwhelming temptation abdul achmet be owner of suleima to mitsos paper meant not only safe conduct to abdul to have be in power must have doubled bribe to further side of possibility to secure thrown own soul into bargain suleima safe more fear for chance blow upsetting too sanguine security because loved with true honest heart thought of be absent must have paid demand of angel men devil to secure from hurt death even though ground teeth at thought security meant only to go on living in harem of abdul nightmare of day before expedition of fire ship lived through again feeling at first that there be question of choice before somehow other must let note go to poniropoulos for be more insidious temptation a must be managed so that one at worst man for whom be intended must know share in yet here again be choice between two impossibility slowly a before aching bruised in spirit struggled back to choose honorable thus new difficulty stood in way be clear duty to let nicholas know of clandestine traffic in so doing mitsos must have to tell of own absence by night from camp without leave nicholas must ask reason probably be very angry with though a have not be detected confessed offence must find mitigation how came to be waiting under wall of tripoli mitsos thought over for little time before arrived at best most obvious solution namely to tell nicholas everything taking of tripoli must not be far off knew that when came near must for greater safety let others know prize town held for week two sooner later did not make much difference so not wishing to delay risk hot resolution put on clothes again to go to quarter have just got outside hut when heard voice of sentry challenging one without camp for grace of god thought there go mitsos who go called sentry again speak fire mitsos did not hear reply sentry stood still while man clambered over wall spoke few word to standing in shadow of doorway not thirty yard off mitsos must see who of be recognized poniropoulos burly christos fifty pound to say nothing of heard poniropoulos say there be short silence mitsos longed to hear offer refused greed of country greek be too strong fifty pound answered christos when do pay on day tripoli fall again there be pause mitsos suddenly made up mind to interfere strode out of shadow to where two be standing stood asunder few pace a came up took christos by arm for love of god say 'no christos said ask first what business be outside poniropoulos came step nearer young cub said below breath what business be of yours christos looked from one to other have promised fifty pound said o fool said mitsos there will be fight between will cost best part of hundred in blood bruise if listen to besides want to get into trouble poniropoulos looked thunder at boy inwardly be disquieted go to kennel cub said report to morrow morning for insubordination mitsos gave short laugh very good said that will be to morrow be yet to night look christos there will be trouble if listen to that be turned back to hut in order to give poniropoulos time to be off leave coast clear for wished to get to nicholas without making disturbance in camp shutting door waited for five minute till heard poniropoulos walk off one way christos continue round then going out again went straight to nicholas quarter knocked at door nicholas be asleep awakened at once at sound called out to know who be there be mitsos said boy want to see at once uncle nicholas wait minute then from within came sound of striking of flint ca light said nicholas come in though mitsos entered feeling glad there be light for made story easier to tell there be powder box where can sit little mitsos said nicholas sit on end of bed now what brings here mitsos felt in pocket found paper be holding out to said on be written that poniropoulos for sum of two hundred pound will insure safety to abdul achmet house when tripoli fall there be moment silence black devil said nicholas then suddenly how came by mitsos be what be going to tell mitsos found rather hard to begin after moment nicholas spoke again kindly gravely be listening mitsos said hush there be one coming keep quite quiet immediately after knock came to door nicholas let be repeated before answered who be asked christos choremis said voice sentry for last two hour well hour ago sir captain poniropoulos climbed in over camp wall thought best to tell at once did explain where have be no sir open door christos said nicholas there be one question more did offer money not to say anything about christos shifted from one foot to other sir said at length did quite right to tell said nicholas can go now mitsos said nicholas when footstep died away can begin tell how got then mitsos with many pause told have taken place between suleima from time have first heard voice out of darkness down to night when again have come to lying outside wall of tripoli nicholas heard in absolute silence oh uncle if be possible cried mitsos let be safe when end of time come for there be one like have be hard for nicholas heard in wonder amazement have one more question to ask when blew up turkish ship mitsos said did not occur to that might be on board thought certainly be there said mitsos be not till be over heard be not nicholas reached out in darkness took mitsos ' smooth hand in god forgive said can forgive little mitsos pain relief of telling story to man whom trusted loved have be too much for boy choked in trying to find voice there there said nicholas soothingly what be matter with young wolf have have good news to night have not have not seen one love there be cause for little mitsos will do by oath of clan swear to that nothing will stay not fever wound booty glory only honor alone from doing what in lie to save from peril will do little one mitsos pressed hand must not speak must promise went on nicholas that never again will go out of camp by night without leave lead with other men to ugly thing to morrow there will be one man le in army treacherous villain to morrow leaf camp with disgrace hissing for have made true false slander of primate brought shame on now go to bed service have done in discovering atones for fault poor little cub have be hard time for next day poniropoulos be publicly expelled from camp afterwards mitsos sought out christos in private told that be better fellow than have supposed that lie have told nicholas to screen captain found favor in eye christos be reasonably surprised that mitsos knew of falsehood relieved to find be not disposed to quarrel with two went off put away quart two of resined wine for mitsos paid news that monemvasia have surrendered detail of surrender be bitter sweet tragic absurd prince demetrius appeared defying senate in fit of impotent rage against perfectly proper opposition to wish have insisted on signing treaty of capitulation with own name a viceroy of country effendi lord of country what not turk opening gate in order to go down to ship take promised departure found met by crowd of angry mainats who considered that treaty a signed by prince not by senate be null void riot took place several turk be killed on point of embarking better part of greek officer seeing that capitulation have be signed that be to blame turk be not soon stopped let embarkation proceed not before five men have be killed several house sacked monemvasia have surrendered so much be good rest be bad fleet army distrusted other soldier distrusted commander who thanks to primate be represented to a having made private treaty with wealthier turk there be fine quarrel a to who must set up greek standard on fallen town in one thing only be there unanimity be in feeling towards prince have shown weak indecisive before have be forgiven have shown dilatory incapable commander under bore blame now showed though with characteristic futility evading tampering with recorded vote of senate in have acquiesced at last meeting in tripoli futility of act be comic motive be warped crooked in word in moment rag of authority have brought from hetairia be torn from for practical purpose connection with revolution may be said to have be over without doubt capitulation be hopelessly mismanaged turk got off without paying penny towards expense of siege if same term be given to fortified place in morea national treasury fund of hetairia must be certainly drained dry before country be evacuated though morally nothing can excuse scene of horror be about to take place yet palliation may be found in two thing that without plunder gained from turk war be impossible that nation be nation of slave long ground down by cruelty of kind now in first hour of freedom despised long dominant race be underfoot stamped down mainat corp be still at monemvasia where petrobey be raising fresh recruit for siege of tripoli prince occupying leisure time of have four hour day in trying to festoon wall of town with red tape when news came of fall of navarin port on west coast ypsilanti have sent there civilian from suite to represent shadow of nothingness senate one of worst type of men who under guise of patriotism have got together large band of freebooter to plunder seize that must lay hand on before capitulation granted besieged life safe transport to egypt tunis have be concluded many of turk have under stress of hunger escaped from town thrown on mercy of greek with whom have lived on friendly term town refused to capitulate till starvation compelled already for four day nothing must be bought for couple of sparrow half starved cat represented few hour life whereas bushel of gold represented bushel of gold one man day before surrender be found with secret supply of food on have subsisted for day remains of be seized from by two starving savage devoured before eye after pelted with money have about telling be well paid perhaps strange premonition of fate induced gaunt garrison to hold out perhaps tale have reached of what have be fate of who have thrown on mercy of besieging army be not till august th just fortnight after monemvasia be taken that capitulation be signed for day eternal blot of infamy be black against greek hardly have garrison evacuated giving up arm when representative of peloponnesian senate thrust into fire treaty of capitulation so that evidence against might be destroyed gave signal for massacre to begin pretext be easily found blow given to greek by turk for insisting on searching person of one of wife for treasure concealed about be enough in hour mussulman be left alive woman be stripped of clothing rushing into sea to hide shame be shot from shore baby be snatched out of mother arm flung in face others remembering fate of patriarch hanged men woman from lintel of own door others be said be tortured before one of persecutor more humane than fellow despatched here in mockery of turkish atrocity man be offered choice between christianity death when chose former be baptized with steel crucified dozen more be burned alive in house where have run for refuge in hour infamous work be finished then arose quarrelling over booty knife rifle be brought in to settle dispute while in mean time two spetziot ship quietly went off with greater part of spoil thus ended day disgrace of will only be forgotten when glory of men like nicholas have faded too dark horrible in part a be deed be to follow cruelty so cold blooded preconcerted stain other page of war cruelty there be many black shameful deed deed wrought in hot blood in drunkenness of revenge happily massacre of navarin be unapproached unparalleled chapter ix private nicholas vidalis before september be week old mainat corp with petrobey prince be back at tripoli course event have taken at monemvasia have inclined latter again to side of primate for interpreted attitude action of army with regard to capitulation of place a insult levelled at germanos be not long in perceiving being acute enough to see that prince authority be just now naught paper sceptre reasoned that friendship be equally valueless unless must manage to rescue for few rag of authority of have by own folly denuded in case support of primate be prop to prince a power of primate varied in inverse ratio to of military commander germanos set to work again to discredit with troop there be that strength of revolution be beginning to lie not in prince who must not command others in senate be unable to command in people soldier who now for more than four month have waited for fall of city still obedient to many utterly incompetent captain still steadfast in watching on hill germanos subtle brain spinning thread out of like spider be busy to catch army while in end army like great blundering bee burst unheeding through palace of silk left angrily hungry in ruin tale of slander went on captain be detected in infamous traffic with besieged be certain also that provision be being sold to men within wall for one night turk be captured outside to save life confessed that besieged be supplied at starvation rate with bread fresh meat upon second detection petrobey gave notice that if case occurred offender must be shot night sentry be doubled whether treason be more wide spread than feared sentry be bribed whether traitor be cunning enough to elude never came to light more evidence be found that traffic still went on one day at meeting of senate germanos rose denounced whole body of officer siege still drag on said where be preparation to bring to conclusion in name of patriotism ask where to whose advantage be that men be kept here from home work when grape be already growing ripe for gathering there be none to gather only bird be men who prefer to stop here in kennel roasted under mid day sun doing tedious hour of drill be to advantage of primate that remain here while church stand empty tithe be remitted be most noble prince demetrius who detains army on inhospitable mountain reason be not far to seek who be who be found trafficking with abdul achmet for safety of turk harem if not one of captain who be of class who last week only be detected in same treasonable business who be now who be selling a very well know provision to besieged at rate make man soon rich to whose advantage be that linger here while within town turk life at ease know lack being sure attack will be made only waiting till infamous men be satisfied siege of tripoli be called there have never be such thing be market place of tripoli busy profitable market men who bring country produce for sale be none other than captain of army in particular there be one among who might have brought siege to end six week before have wished while most noble prince whose eye feel duty to open on point be be with captain have excuse that authority be over that without consent can hing very sedulous doubt be effort to obtain consent yet there be speciousness about excuse will leave during whole month of august prince demetrius be not with nicholas vidalis be supreme here ask therefore before why if be honest man did not attempt to take town several time during speech angry murmur went up from military section of senate nicholas more than once rose to foot quieted with uplifted hand listened attentively with smile on face when germanos alluded to honesty laughed aloud for ever since mitsos have told story of own part in war unsuspected by only divulged when necessity drove of silent boyish heroism uncalculating elimination of self nicholas have be privy to secret shame at own deed rather own word to withstand primate in so far a injured cause be well be seemly to brawl to throw ineffectual word about to waste a called good anger on unprofitable thing what fruit have angry gibe sneer borne be primate wagging unamiable tongue le zealously be not even speaking bitter truth when said that nefarious traffic be going on between captain of army besieged if evil be to be checked must be checked way not by sprinkling scandal monger with insult for long time have contemplated taking certain step now that opportunity offered so fitly took with a light heart a tired man bear homeward at same time openness of accusation prompted equal openness germanos must be answered once for with own frankness then for highest trump card to take honor laden trick so nicholas still smiling courteously asked permission from prince in dead silence made reply speaking very quietly have open dealing at length from archbishop said though have dealt very openly with from first yet never before have favored thus have told that preparation be being made for bringing siege to conclusion with permission of present declare to be deliberate lie ah must ask to sit down said to germanos a latter rose angrily to foot have have fair hearing claim will receive same lie continued because can tell be untrue deliberate lie because there be need for to tell be here throughout month of august month to again alluded later know that during month be tired busy man for be drilling successive company of men day if knew anything of military matter must be well aware that be pleasure to see improve considerably so that now greater part of be efficient soldier have told that be not to advantage of soldier to remain here be in sense true though not wholly for if be to advantage of men greece becomes free country be duty to help in securing freedom be to advantage that remain here for here can acquire knowledge will enable to fight successfully went on to tell that be not to advantage of primate to remain here then why in name of god do do so for be not to advantage of soldier that cause division dissension among let go home gather in tithe heart desire one not even will try to stop yet go must suppose be for one advantage that stop can be that of have idea of getting possession of even considerable part of booty will take can be that one of yes other than archbishop came here in name of master asked certain men other than petrobey for spoil must be taken giving half to national treasury to men soldier who have fought bled for rest spoil be to be devoted to glory of god who priest primate bishop be to be trustee on chance of getting not spoil still enough to make worth while to wait will find reason of stopping here nicholas looked across at germanos who sat white shaking with anger for moment passion flamed up sit there hate cried for will not harm if motif be honest why must not tell if not there be more cause for to be known germanos suddenly started up be infamous slander exclaimed petrobey without moving from seat turned to prince speaking loud enough to be heard by what cousin have said be perfectly true remarked be present please to sit down archbishop said prince nicholas vidalis be speaking to man have told continued nicholas that infamous traffic be going on between turk captain of army know unhappily that there be truth in two month ago when assertion be a yet false be saying same thing others busied in spreading report that be so be that part of honorable man to spread infamous lie about to slander defame to troop be not motive a clear a noonday by sowing discord dissension mistrust in rank hoped to see grand scheme realized to have army flocking to pouring in gold treasure for glory of god into hand of trustee great success have attended effort when prince demetrius left camp know that primate found very popular men finally attack have be made on personally have be told that at time during month of august might have stormed town if have wished that be black falsehood though perhaps not deliberate since archbishop know nothing of military affair for in first place hand be full be necessary to bring mere disorderly rabble to military efficiency to best of power did in second place though be in command of troop have agreed with superior in command not to make attempt while army be weakened by withdrawal of mainat division who be at monemvasia appeal to to know whether be be not true be true said petrobey a to having profited by delay continued nicholas have only word against word of if archbishop have evidence to bring on point must be glad to hear wait for reply there be dead silence germanos sat voiceless with eye on floor if be thinking over evidence in mind said nicholas fitting together a witness accuser must let say so will wait still there be silence germanos still proud full of hate sat there without speech so be even a told said nicholas be malicious lying word have spoken against be man easily provoked to shame speak one to whom forgiveness be hard matter so think be thing for ask pardon not of man of god here in assembly have be accused of blackest offence accusation be blacker still for be fruit of malice falsehood be matter for word of regret from one of pardon from other for there be in heart pardon in be very sure regret yet can rid of need of heart be sick of intrigue dissension accusation slander answering accusation will have more of a stand in presence of god have only one thought be freedom of country serve by spending time throwing word at men whose salt must not eat be not so very long since said voice must be heard more here yet since then have not be silent to day word be mine before go one word for love of god if who sit here suspect of treachery treason of thing of have be accused a hope to be forgiven at last day let stand out say so once again there be dead silence nicholas face brightened for silence be sweet to so be said at length go hence untouched by slander then unbuckling sword laid on table in front of prince seat in senate sir resign said commission a officer resign also by birth be mainat with highness permission wish to be enrolled among private soldier of corp then turning to petrobey old friend said once more be together in clan with step a light a boy heart springing upward like lark rid at last of burden of personal ambition left room went straight to where corp be quartered illustration unbuckling sword laid on table nicholas found mitsos sitting on wall of camp near mainat quarter lecturing small audience on use abuse of fire ship for attempt have be made on vessel of cruising turkish squadron with result of first half roasting navigator then completely drowning men seeing officer approach got up saluted nicholas still with singing heart told to be seated lighting pipe drew in smoke in long contented breath be first tobacco have enjoyed since came here said for tobacco be tasted by heart never again lad need jump up when come for be no longer officer just private like yourselves mitsos stared aghast uncle nicholas what do mean gasped wrinkling eyebrow be germanos doing not so little mitsos for germanos must do only have resigned place in senate have resigned commission be left of be plain nicholas man a happy a king instead of bundle of malice bag of bad word squirted out like new must eh be happy be god own morning puffed out great cloud of smoke laughed out great mouthful of laughter what have happened cried mitsos still feeling that world be upsidedown have happened little one said nicholas that foul tempered man have made up mind to be foul tempered more a thing be impossibility when have to sit cocked up on chair opposite proud primate why have be sensible enough to refuse to sit there longer a be tired of tripping up on fine tin sword have given back to fine tin prince may man never do anything regret le ah here come superior officer there will be talking to do little of will lay tongue to sprang up saluted petrobey petrobey came up quickly followed by two three of other officer among whom be prince smiling at nicholas through annoyance a man stood at attention comely erect drop nonsense dear cousin said come to tent for talk look have come to fetch nicholas looked at radiantly have have set of good minute since left said say say cousin little talking will do prince came forward with fine courteous air have come said to beg to reconsider step fancy will find more insult awaiting in senate highness said can look back on life say have done one wise thing in that morning if a say there be insult awaiting in senate confirms belief in wisdom be absurd nicholas remonstrated petrobey primate even germanos regret what have done nicholas laughed be sweet word to said know be child to be coaxed with sugar think of want help have more weight with men than of will not fail said nicholas if do duty in rank a well a hope think will be more useful there than anywhere else career now on point of being crowned said petrobey eagerly prince have promised nicholas waved hand impatiently have just got rid of career said feel like tired horse when stout rider dismount loosens girth attempt to saddle again ah dear cousin went on suddenly with affection more gravity even know not at if speak like believe care only for one thing in world be object for have labored together so long that cause serve best here for month have be puffing up to think that fine angry word be of avail will try no longer be sick of anger belly move whether will not when sit there have to listen know to what leave in peace be better so glanced across at mitsos moment who be standing by wish to speak to alone cousin said to petrobey will wait meantime thank for friendliness to decline entirely to listen to thing be finished petrobey saw that for present at least be manner of use trying to persuade left for time nicholas remarking that be time for ration that officer be horribly unpunctual took mitsos by arm led off to canteen telling on way what have happened mitsos be furiously indignant with germanos vowed that camp must ring with hissing of name nicholas stopped neither forgive forget said be mere waste of time temper to curse harm be done leave vermin alone oh have bitten sorely deny that if be going scavenging a pray god may let begin in own house there be purging washing to be done among men fear little mitsos from day if there be traffic dishonorable barter among corp of clan have out shoot for make business that there will be none now will go get ration ordered supply of fresh beef for men yesterday be good act to finish up with see already reap fruit of nicholas remained perfectly firm petrobey eventually desisted from attempt to persuade to take up commission again for might a well have tried to lever sun out of orbit still continued to ask advice about affair of army latter must not very well withhold among men especially among mainats underwent sort of upsidedown apotheosis germanos have made villanous accusation here be fine answer a for proud man found position be longer tenable so far from being able to profit by nicholas action discovered though too late that have overreached in making so preposterous statement about enemy army buzzed away through fine woven web leaving dangling in wind saw that chance of power be over accepting inevitable took departure for kalavryta where hoped authority remained intact ala for triumphal reception by united army ala too for chance of patriarchate name have prospectively throned in heart of myriad be flotsam on tide of righteous anger against thrown up on beach tossed to fro once twice then left follower primate bishop le wise than still stayed on hoping against hope that popular favor must set way evil have done lived after nothing now must undo distrust suspicion have caused for first malignant slander have found fulfilment army distrusted officer while officer be not certain of men nicholas have cleared leaping with shout of triumph free from web spun round others have not manliness to do same to challenge evidence for knew there be evidence nicholas found opportunity to tell petrobey about mitsos ' love affair few day afterwards news came to camp that landing of turk from western squadron be expected on gulf of corinth near vostitza prince with acuteness found in rumor sufficient reason to make presence there desirable petrobey wishing to have speedy reliable messenger who must communicate with camp in event taking place sent mitsos off with before end of third week in prince took departure in haste hoping to regain in fresh field loss of prestige have suffered here at monemvasia news if confirmed be serious for meant that turkish squadron have evaded greek fleet threatened morea from north while if once landing be effected turk must without doubt march straight to relief of tripoli just when need be sorest prince left camp with much state dignity with nothing else mitsos to whom have given place on staff a aide de camp extraordinary to viceroy of greece with rank of lieutenant in hellenic army pranced gayly along on fine stepping horse for first time fully sympathized with nicholas resignation travelled by short march like woman a mitsos described afterwards one night aide de camp extraordinary having occasion to bring message to master woke out of sleep saw commander in chief in night cap left deep bilious impression on barbarian mind wholly out of proportion to so innocuous discovery for time at least in tripoli there be more intriguing between besieger besieged for petrobey redoubled vigilance night sent down corp of trustworthy men to lie in wait round town meantime knew strong band of cavalry large force of albanian mercenary be within town in citadel be enough artillery to be formidable so while there be chance of capitulation provided rumor of expected landing of troop on gulf of corinth continued unconfirmed be unwilling to make assault on town began to be known that fall of tripoli be inevitable from over country peasant flocked together on hill waiting for end share in booty be in vain that petrobey tried to drive back a soon a have cleared one range of hill swarmed upon like sparrow in vine springing a seemed from ground a vulture grow in air before battle came armed with gun requesting to be enrolled in various corp others with sickle reaping hook just with knife stick evening on hill round shone out fire of unorganized rabble gathering thicker thicker a day went on then on th of september refugee from town be captured brought to camp being promised life if gave intelligence of what be going on inside told that famine have begun that many of horse of cavalry corp have be killed for meat that unless help came end be matter of hour once again petrobey consulted nicholas who advised assault at once other argued that a long a news came of reinforcement from north case of town be hopeless a be for greek to demand term might a well wait for proposal to come nicholas disagreed there have be treachery before in camp there might be treachery now let at rate minimize disgrace to nation petrobey in part yielded consented to do a nicholas advised if proposal be made in three day in mean time since there be longer fear of cavalry must move down closer onto plain directly below wall then if fire be opened on from citadel must storm out of hand if not have suspected for long time that gun be not serviceable must wait for three day unless mitsos came back saying that reinforcement be on way from north chapter x fall of tripoli order to break up camp be received with shout of acclamation day long on th procession of mule passed like ant on home run up down steep narrow path from plain

uncertainty prayed that might find undisfigured that face might be quiet calm like nicholas for felt that must be thing of consolation to know have died quickly one thought only sustained through terrible hour that remembrance of word nicholas have spoken have bargained to sacrifice that held dear for be already won in very flush presence of victory must not give way to desolation despair beset day beneath burning malignant sun moved among heap of slain turning over body after body only to find more beneath kite preying hawk chid shrilly over head heeded not worked on little before

come to few by rank work be among highest place in greece how did die a common soldier serving in rank by own choice to that appears though cause for be bitterness regret of can not speak wonderful appropriate thing nicholas victory of people darkness have completely fallen while spoke through sombre smoke of torch star peered out of infinite depth of blue in front of germanos rose mould of freshly raised earth for have filled up grave before began speaking wooden cross from mosque have be fetched out planted on top of round in dense rank stood mainats flickering glare of torch striking strong light shadow on brown face by degree torch planted on long stake round grave began to burn low now then one must shoot up with sudden flare die out again in few minute more have burned down

mitsos returned with petrobey feeling somehow strangely strengthened have be trying to feel day have be said for be brave within of there be much rose caught at triumphantly clung to with conviction courage in heart mainats be to leave next morning mitsos dreaded hour spent in inaction decided to go at once again travel through night to stop here be only to talk of nicholas to grow feverish again with hopeless impossible hope that suleima be still somewhere in town with good horse must reach nauplia next day soon after dawn longed with longing of child in distant land for familiar place here spoke to of suleima spoke in word of blood cruelty stabbed stung into sense of maddened rage regret there perhaps with thrill of home about anguish must change to something terrible not so discordant to image heart held of even now when so few hour have passed seemed to have lived with sorrow for lifetime realized that be for lifetime must abide with place where have lost all loved have brooding horror over must not think of a wished to think by cool bay dark headland that beach with whispering reed surely must find aspect of sorrow different to instinct with bitterness of something have once be infinitely sweet instead of with bitterness of horror hatred above dreaded moment of waking next morning though many morrow stretched away before with cup of remembrance coming with light at end of sleep must be something over to get rid of one to have four twenty hour with sorrow perhaps might help to prepare for pang of first moment of waking to consciousness again dead weight of grief must have to be taken up anew then father be there oh how mitsos longed for quiet protective presence here be true be dear clan clan though best of companion gave not fellowship wanted now wanted to be alone yet to have one who loved present with silent sympathy needed word even companionship of yanni who followed with eye of dumb creature know master be suffering yet can not console be irksome none understood better than poor yanni though tried to keep away must not followed mitsos unable to say word to yet unable to leave mitsos rose from where have be sitting in petrobey room walked across to think will go home at once said will be better must be there not to night dear lad said petrobey not alone be coming to set on way to morrow poor mitsos nearly broke down again at somehow kindness reached seat of tear while sorrow passed by will go alone now cried can not say what think be so good to want to be alone say good bye to for must not be able to tell good bye before long doubt not will meet again for promised always to be ready will always be ready petrobey kissed boy little mitsos said be not men of many word know know god keep be watching mitsos with hungry eye turned from petrobey went to come out with yanni said mitsos while get horse come a far a gate if will mitsos ' horse be stabled below in silence two went out together then a turned to walk down deserted street to gate mitsos passed one arm through bridle put other round yanni neck yanni said think unkind be way with that somehow other must get used to awful thing be best alone have have merry time together have not please god will be together many time yet though see not how perhaps merry time will come again want to be alone with to night then alone with father for with be different of others in world why need tell be must choose to be with understand do not yes dear mitsos said yanni rather chokedly if ever want come will come to for oh mitsos be so sorry for know what to do say owe to yet can hing with fairly burst out cry walked on in silence to argive gate then mitsos stopped so let do a nicholas must have do said smiling at other think only of wonderful birthday of people a germanos said now be going so good bye yanni dear yanni oh mitsos let come cried yanni did not mean that good bye god speed turned quickly walked back into town without word look chapter xiv house on road to nauplia horse mitsos rode have be stabled day coming out fresh into cool night air kept busy for time snuffing uneasily at waft of foul air blew from town shying right left at shape lay on road side once dead body be stretched straight across path brute wheeled round nearly unseating mitsos tried to bolt back to tripoli again by by a got used to night steadiness of lad hand gave confidence went more soberly settled down into gentle trot up road leading from plain over mountain a left town behind air grew fresher soon came pure cool from north night be clear for few wisp of cloud drifted southward in wavering line of delicate pearly gray so thin that starlight suffused turned into luminous haze path lay low between bold rock climbed up on side to right among oleander stream talked idly a in sleep above star burned bright close set in blue velvet of sky to east blue be tinged with dove color showing that moon be nigh to rising from shepherd hut on hill came sharp bark of dog sounding faint yet curiously distinct in alert air a in north sound come sharp cut ringing on frosty night a went higher dry smell of summer scorched vegetation be changed for something fresher coming from upland pasture while horse now requiring attention went with straining shoulder drooped head up from slope to slope mitsos knew that have be right to come alone since night have spent with suleima between sea sky loneliness quietude of night setting of secret hour have spent with have always woke in undefined incommunicable thrill calling up of dear ghost of past to be alone at night be nearest to being with often in last week have stolen out of hut when camp be still night at midmost to conjure up same feeling sight of object associated with one loved brings with infinitely dear a have be to there lingered round remembrance of something dim something in common with starlight great vague stretch of silent sea pearliness of sky before imminent moonrise be that complexion of sorrow wished to recapture tripoli be like dreaming of through horrible distortion of nightmare serener bitterness of quieter vision round thought of nicholas there hovered splendid halo glory of life triumph of death made heart bow down in kind of thankful wonder drowning regret for if a germanos have said have gone like bridegroom to bride must who loved mourn strangely mixed have come boon for nicholas for suleima have died at present be too stunned to be able to picture price paid with clearness of focus for limited mind within be soon drowned by shock like coming in spate together realize till first turbid flood have passed illustration beuleima cried mitsos moon have risen before reached top of pas following strange overwhelming desire pushed on quickly for longed to look on bay again by night hour quick riding brought to head of ravine ran straight down to sea at bottom lying like clipping from silver nail be farther edge of bay ashine with risen moon when mitsos saw heart be athirst for home gradually a went down lower hill marched like shadow to right left between moonsetting sunrise stood on edge of shelving cove again where have brought fish to land one night once again be still for whisper in dry tongued reed lisp of sand quenched ripple never again must one beside sit there filled through through with love never again must man have loved pas by like shadow of hawk on one of swift secret errand yet a have hoped there still lingered round place sweetness of sorrow horror have come not here bloodshed crash of war none knew message spot held for garnered store on heart have fed then leaving still rounded by infinite night passed on by white house at head of bay whose sea wall have be to gate of love flung open just after sunrise struck road on other side of water three hundred yard off be whistling poplar by fountain father house garden gate grave memory of boyhood risen sun spun mist out of night dew web of sweet smell from damp earth struck galaxy of star from burnished surface of bay from heart of bush bowered bird drew forth inimitable song so be come to gate where tied up horse while must go inside yearning to see father a walked up path raising eye saw already out working in vineyard beyond must have passed by gone to there when of sudden stopped heart stopped too for house door be open from inside seemed at first only own thought made audible came voice singing sang dig deep among vine give sweet spring shower home then came little feeble cry a from young thing singing stopped mother voice so seemed cooed soothing to baby with mitsos passed not on to vineyard went in suleima busied with child littlest mitsos so told heard not step till be in doorway then looked up thinking be father though earlier than wont with choking cry hand outstretched voice from bursting heart suleima cried end
