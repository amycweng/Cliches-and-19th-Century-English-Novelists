have right to say thing because nobody ever accused of changing hat with anybody draw in know dear call benowflake ' sort of thing be told such lot of people offer hat yet never take one lady alston shifted position slightly a if something have suddenly made uncomfortable be use talking about wickedness nowadays said because people simply stare a if did not know what meant made blanche stare in different kind of manner other day when asked if really have idea how vulgar be surely did not mind being called vulgar did when explained carefully what meant by vulgarity of course certain sort of vulgarity be chic now be very vulgar not to be vulgar not to talk at top of one voice eat too much laugh very loud at thing ought not to be said when told what sort of picture make when sits simpering ogling dick across room so to speak spreading on floor for to walk over did not think be so pleasant be exactly what doe mr brereton drew on glove there be something very successful in attitude marie said go about hurling home truth at people hold up looking glass to make see point out what brute be scold for never bear ill will always want to see really must not go into country can not get on without ah if only be conceited enough to think must go be truly amiable what mean be have got somehow quality of centrality party be sure know why be brilliant if be there sensibly flatter if be not

pressure be irresistible by way jim spencer have just come back know suppose anyhow will meet at dinner evening marie looked up with sudden vivacity jim spencer why of course do be brought up together almost then well then married lost sight of somehow one doe observed mr brereton marriage often produce sort of moral cataract be foolish mildred there be nothing cheaper easier falser than sort of innuendo besides went abroad have be away two year must think do go abroad said mr brereton oh if want to know there be earthly reason why must not tell proposed to always liked very much always said so remarked mr brereton then have business to dear jim will be delighted to see again be one of few really reasonable people know have got sort of plan of own have always known what meant to do though have not always done for instance wanted impossible thing have money have none so proposed that must marry support ourselves by writing have appeared before now in christmas number then perhaps acted wisely roll in wealth now south african millionaire without anything south african about local colour in fact be also remarkably handsome wealth manner good look fairy prince combination lady alston laughed dear will like to see jim with society at foot said make certain will go there lady alston raised eyebrow dear how can ask be rich be sufficient alone must not kick then be to be understood give halfpenny golden halfpenny be very interesting that story about mean lady alston did not at once reply give one bad taste in mouth sometimes mildred said at length very possibly always tell one one have done so know be why be friend mr brereton looked doubtful in spite of must say because of ah here be jack jack alston be one of people whom be quite unnecessary to point out because be distinctly visible not only to outward also to inward eye be so large be to say that must not fail to notice that have come into room at same time have about quality of making felt in subtle silent manner a rule spoke little silence a mildred brereton once remarked with more than usual insight took up time must not be described a rich silence for be essentially dry somehow compelled attention probably if have be short squat must have passed unnoticed coming a did from be charged with certain force partaking of own quality also be doubly unnecessary for wife to call attention to entrance for on one did produce such effect a on thus on occasion having remarked on said more jack lounged slowly into balcony shook hand with mr brereton sat down on basket chair sideways to wife so that looked straight at profile decent afternoon for once mildred said summer at last look summery too what there be left of said marie have be taking hide off skinning jack considered moment well look right skinned said at length bad habit of marie though what have be skinning about be be telling be wicked stupid vicious vulgar be hobby of hers one must have hobby going out afternoon marie mildred took hint instantly must be off said really jack have most brutal manner send to right about with least possible ceremony so wish to tell be going in case have hundred thing to do jack rose when have not will see down wait minute marie if be not in hurry want to have word with oh trouble said mildred can find way jack said nothing merely followed into house when have passed drawing room have be cutting up rough about anything in particular asked oh merely rigid attitude fire work thunder storm what will be rather tired of for several reason have better stop believe most idiot find amusing mildred took parasol out of stand with air of purchaser selecting one most struck fancy a matter of fact happened to be own must take care if be said in low voice man like can not form least idea of what woman like marie really be be carriage here just see please stood on bottom step of stair putting on rather thick masculine driving glove while jack crossed hall rang bell then came back to bottom of stair again do mean that suspect anything asked of course not what do mean be that be beginning to see what be like when see be delighted be nice big playground doe not strike marie a playground also must remember that be how will say sensation latest fashion have got to be careful be capable of exploding day if did must be noticeable will hardly be worth while picking up fragment of that remain jack if doe because if doe will be since something have touched personally well be extraordinarily slow of course person who be most likely to touch personally be have got to mind p q in fact be not way to manage mr brereton face clouded little a walked across hall to door be being held open for well au revoir said will have more to say to to night dine with know jack alston did not appear to be in particular hurry to go upstairs again after mr brereton have gone waited on door step to see get in groom who barely reached up to horse head holding while took up rein then running stiffly to scramble in behind a went off down park lane in most approved fashion elbow square whip nearly perpendicular horse stepping a if there be succession of hurdle to negotiate to be taken in stride remark about importance of taking care have annoyed jack little still more own annoyance at being annoyed have own idea about management of affair among about halfway down came wife hint that might even conceivably make matter unpleasant for be same sort of indignity a suggestion that must not quite manage own dog horse after minute turned for what time be ladyship carriage ordered asked of footman half past three lord tell to come round at quarter to four instead said went slowly upstairs again found wife on balcony where have left with maid beside with two hat in hand yes that one will do said send other back will take afternoon be wrong put in box leave in hall be going out immediately maid retired with condemned hat while marie pinned other on turned to husband wanted to speak to said not lifting eye jack looked at in silence moment lit cigar finish pinning on hat first said marie found obeying with sense of wanting just in order to see what happened not to do a told however pinned hat on well said again jim spencer have come back said knew mildred told just now wanted to say few word to about find people have not forgotten that be very much attached to once looked up at with eye of indifferent wonder a if have asked inane unanswerable sort of riddle people be quite at liberty to remember forget what like a far a be concerned said be that have to say to if so will go out think carriage ought to be round not yet told not to come round till quarter to four have more to say please consult time said before take upon to alter arrangement jack did not reply at once then in voice expressive neither of compunction annoyance be use making fuss said wish merely to warn that people have not forgotten wish also to ask to behave reasonably people very likely will connect name again know what be rose flushing so wanted quiet quarter of hour in to insult said pointed to chair sit down marie said supposing choose not to will not suppose anything so absurd there why not have done at once a be saying will inevitably happen so must advise to accept will entail certain alteration in general style have often heard criticising rather mercilessly world live in mildred tell be doing so afternoon mind doing that have racy sort of way of talking doubt criticism be perfectly true with return of jim spencer must advise to drop sort of thing else not see very much of paused flicked end of cigar ash over balcony not that mind doing one other in continued to do will show want of wisdom ah mind what do only what people say exactly have quite grasped meaning again rose from chair in have sat at bidding be then imagine said five minute be enough yes for what have to say thought might like to talk over have not least desire to jack reached out hand for early edition of evening paper unfolded perhaps must tell what mean to do have intention of doing anything certainly have intention of discussing question with jack did not show slightest impatience there be use in being so nettled about observed if woman behaves in certain way get talked about be have indicated to that if do certain thing will get talked about want that from point of view wonder why mildred be talked about so be told never knew that considered that reason for not seeing good deal for one moment looked quickly up then turned back fluttering leaf of paper quite true if be anybody else wife must not mind how much be talked about be mine happens be mine marie did not reply somehow matter have grown to larger dimension than have intended added only meant to give quite friendly in way insignificant word of warning somehow have put into capital letter there go out for drive really marie have not slightest conception must make such affair of think have be unreasonable do made great effort with very well will forget about see rub other up wrong way jack be great pity yes be not worth bothering about paper appeared to have nothing much in be only few moment after wife have left that jack put down finished cigar without other employment than own thought short scene with marie have disturbed in same way a fall in barometer may disturb picnic giver may come to nothing there be hint of fair weather breaking at same time be perfectly well accustomed to be utterly at variance with never contemplated divergence of opinion between must result in having to give way be only selfish people who can not believe that be selfish jack never passed moral judgment on anybody else to be critical of behaviour did not annoy personally held to be absurd attitude to adopt be only behaviour that might prove inconvenient to one self must reasonably be criticised rather not so much criticised a corrected knew quite well that small well dressed fragment of world at concerned be perfectly aware that marriage with marie have not be romantic success though personally considered quite up to average to nature like unbroken constancy devotion to one wife be not only achievement never aimed at achievement not even contemplated have married a many men do simply because many men do marry heir be certainly natural complement to estate title heir have be born in manner of speaking marie have made estate title appear ridiculous lopsided have not fulfilled part of bargain be not meant to be understood that stated thing to with foregoing baldness none le if have analyzed spring of action determined course of life led must have admitted that represented ground motif with sufficient accuracy jack be not in habit of analyzing anything inquiry into reason for conduct seemed to profitless pursuit since again to put matter baldly did not care at whether person acted wickedly not in fact a wife have said there be many people who simply stared if talked of wickedness husband be among did not even stare be commonly said that modern life be too full too complex generalization requires limiting certainly to man in particular woman not belonging to world sudden plunge into frothy mill race must be complex to verge of distraction there be many way of simplifying complexity one of most convenient efficient be to strike out without further consideration moral obligation positive negative when once one longer think necessary to reflect whether one ought ought not to do to avoid thing saving of time tissue be quite enormous for be not so much doing thing a thinking about consumes minute nerve once having made unalterable rule to do thing if be pleasant refrain from if be not one can get into single day number of delightful experience must appear to who know recipe quite incredible again a among wild beast so in world weak go to wall there be place for use for one have to look out for fight for own possession of other people not to recognise spell failure such at rate be lord alston experience be generally understood to have have good deal of a sat now with stale paper on knee have vague sense of being balked knew own section of world fairly well having broken rose coloured spectacle long time ago not having desired to get new one realized that people certainly remembered jim spencer attachment to wife that piecing together with habitual amiability opinion of ill success of own marriage with frankly low opinion of world possibility of renewed intimacy of wife man must say thing must annoy personally have hoped that marie must see if not at rate learn by heart so to speak from few well chosen remark of have done one other have taken well chosen remark so considered remarkably ill only amende have be to say that must forget about to jack mind be poor wifely conduct chapter ii andrew brereton mildred husband be man about whom little be known hardly more conjectured since be most emphatically of type of man who arouses in none remotest feeling of curiosity there seemed to be doubt that be of humble origin origin whether humble haughty have completely built over with tall edifice of subsequent achievement have resulted in amassing of fortune large enough to satisfy requirement even of wife be generally supposed that brain of kind be necessary in order to make very large quantity of money must be postulated for having made fortune brain so study of particular millionaire must lead one to suppose thenceforth become superfluity certainly appeared that mr brereton on retirement from business locked up perhaps a concluding bargain disposed of doubt at suitable valuation to house dealt largely wisely in sound mining concern in south africa physically be thin meagre in build habitually wore harassed troubled look especially in own house where sat at head of table for attention be usually paid might a well have be sitting on area step inasmuch a really have immense fortune wife have spending of privilege of being present when entertained friend in house be accorded without question further advantage of sitting on area step instead of at table be never seriously weighed by one to night there be only very small party member of with exception of jim spencer have probably met five six time week since came up to london during winter have be together more often than not in other house there be therefore sorting resorting of group required conversation must either be general in single moment split up like broken quicksilver roll away into appropriate corner for moment be general rather everybody be listening to arthur naseby stout young man fresh faced prematurely bald who standing on hearth rug harangued room in loud strident barytone most awful party ever be at be saying mr boneman be there wife of eminent artist wearing sort of bird nest on head with three union jack easter egg stuck into be dressed in sort of brussels carpet trimmed with what looked like horsehair be sure be not horsehair really probably rare precious material looked like wore what understood to be famous yeere diamond be about a large a pen wiper be plastered round neck pinned on to shoulder others be scattered about back imagine stood in middle of room maid threw at stuck in horsehair mr brereton shrieked with laughter be too heavenly cried go on arthur who else be there people whom one always see coming out of door of cecil at brighton who ask one to supper at carlton in order to inquire apparently who be sitting at other table be sort of passion with certain kind of person to know who be supping at other table at carlton usually limitation that never doe appears to of far greater importance than who be supping at own well be there princess demirep linoleum lincrustas host of assume be most brilliant whom did go with asked lady davy who always wore air of intent study when arthur naseby be talking because be trying to remember said in order to repeat a original went with blanche devereux be dining with insisted on coming be going again on th so be dear blanche what did make of said have never felt so humbled in life see be particular party of intimes th be omnibus brilliance of gathering overwhelmed just a did really knew nobody there sat in corner alone in london till mr maxwell left commanding situation at head of stair where received guest came talked to know thought be being kind so be not in way meant be too wonderful said mildred be dressed in red satin must have said bound not dressed very tightly neatly bound with silk marker gilt edge thanked blanche for coming just stopped saying felt much honoured also have hoped to see husband a well now have heard many tactful thing in life think never anything quite so tactful a that strange fatality pursues poor mr maxwell say unerringly loudly only thing be absolutely impossible to say blanche be not prude think be agreed therefore not easily shocked poor mr maxwell might have said almost anything however improper without offending again blanche be woman of world can usually make sort of reply to most awful put foot in be completely outclassed by one simple sentence mr maxwell be first nobody else anywhere lady davy be so far carried away by brilliance a to laugh thus completely forgot have learned by heart from arthur previous conversation then poor mr maxwell turned to went on remarked that looked far from well when one say that to be always ill for next three day in fact hardly thought must get here to night of course spoiled rest of pleasure hardly knew what happened except dick turned up later in evening pursued impetuous path fancy poor mr maxwell imagined that be blanche husband wonder at marie nerve be little on edge to night what mr naseby said roaring volubility with said jarred on at particular moment certainly be possessed with longing of almost passionate kind to cover up like canary with piece of green baize a there be baize to hand got up from where be sitting in canary immediate vicinity sought safe distance in window seat jim spencer who have be sitting at other side of room got up also crossing hearth rug where mr naseby stood followed into retreat latter seeing secession from audience cast one pained pitying glance at then covered retreat by continuation of monologue so like find little trying jim said marie when be seated together will have to get used to be there much of sort of man asked jim remember anything quite like when be in london last be recent invention invented in fact mildred think invented only detected truth be think that on whole people have grown rather stupider in last year two perhaps be only lazier arthur naseby save trouble of having to talk in fact make impossible be always like that a far a know always how odd that doe find fatiguing perhaps be even odder that other people find fatiguing tell something about know nothing about more than what can see hear said marie indeed believe there be more be very rich decline to marry then man be husk husk with tongue said jim probably about at least never heard that one have reason to believe there be anything more than husk jim wonder how many of have real people inside expect there be lot of husk nothing more do think so rather believe that most of have got something real though perhaps nothing very wholesome very pleasant that being so one try to conceal though sometimes pop out like lizard from crevice think must give anything to get inside anybody else just for minute to see what be really like must be rash to do be quite certain that if must get inside anybody a say must never speak to again good gracious must imagine writing down have be in mind during normal half hour depends who be to read mean must let friend read jim laughed well if be a bad a think must clearly be dangerously stupid thing to show to enemy ah must sooner lose friend than give handle to enemy said marie entirely disagree with must choose to make keep one friend even at risk of arming whole regiment of enemy against enemy matter so little certainly friend matter more said jim perhaps acquaintance le than worst of having be away from london so long be that one find so many of latter so few of of others be general impression at present asked stream of talk from mr naseby be apparently beginning to run dry pressure be diminishing jim spoke lower hardly know what to think at present said london seems to to have changed extraordinarily during last few year a far a can make out doe not matter now how dull stupid man be how vulgar vicious woman be a long a be rich enough marie raised eyebrow why of course said calmly what else did imagine be not apparently also can go to man house woman house eat food drink wine then hurry on to next tell that be most awful party ever be at still apparently can go there again on th mildred brereton have joined lit cigarette from fire breathing japanese dragon blew out great cloud of laughter smoke together with mouth very wide dear jim be too delicious shrieked really will get to come talk to instead of mr naseby for amuse much more arthur be dropped jim be funnier of course be going on th because pagani guardina be going to sing sing too divinely for word also considering what know about considering that know know be exceedingly amusing to see look at other with frigid politeness why only other day mr maxwell introduced to other saying must make two great artist acquainted too screaming be too delightful old fashioned idea about obligation entailed by hospitality be savage notion dear jim like cannibalism vanishes before march of civilization believe there be excessively native tribe in java japan somewhere still practises if eat salt stick to through thick thin arthur naseby have joined how too dreadful exclaimed fancy having lot of assorted savage thick thin sticking to one sound a if one be kind of superior fly paper arthur must begin talking again will never get bridge said mr brereton wo play really have got time said told have to go on at half past ten please what time be jim close on eleven then must really be moving mildred jack will play be coming on with where be going lady alston asked arthur to see blanche devereux arthur naseby face fell never knew be giving party said marie laughed rising be be frightened be still possible that have not dropped like mildred be only going to see about soldier bazaar in fact be because be giving party be going jim spencer got up too will give lift asked be going to eaton place also certainly good night mildred yes know carriage be here told hour ago jack be stopping to play suppose please tell have taken carriage two went out mr brereton naseby stood still looking at when have disappeared looked at other dear marie said that lady effusively how delighted evidently be to see jim spencer again oh dear yes be very great friend in old day very great friend indeed come arthur be waiting for always have such delightful people at house said arthur always have something interesting to say about that stiff young man be very rich be not beyond dream said mr brereton wonder whom will find to make money fly for one can never tell look to a if might spend on corot charity something of imperishable kind doe strike a odd whereas perishable nature of money be always dinned into one yet one can apparently purchase imperishable treasure by being charitable with ca imagine one making money fly one might make march away very solemnly in good order not fly be little stiff be not perhaps little reserved when reserve break down be so very unreserved like seeing reserved person having real holiday how many day must say be to holiday asked arthur in low voice a reached card table where jack be waiting ca tell must wonder ca tell marie jim spencer meantime be driving down from grosvenor square towards park night be warm host of star burned very large luminous in sky be beyond usual london measure of clearness after heat of room in particular after certain feverishness of atmosphere not physical so much a moral sense of extreme hurry pressure night air cool steadiness of star be refreshing not only physically morally perhaps from year of early companionship intimacy perhaps from certain more deeply seated sympathy of mind be very conscious of thought of other swift silent motion through glare of street seemed to isolate from world be with something of in mind that lady alston spoke to other yes put down window jim said own too if be not afraid of catching cold be outdoor people think used to be said do mean have changed do find have find have be quite willing to believe that may be change in make think so marie unwound light shawl have thrown over head undid fastening of gold thread cloak so a to let air play on uncovered neck in woman felt might have indicated suspicion of coquetry did justice to feel that such imputation be possible if feel that be probably right said for seem to to have changed at agree in fact about there remains then how have changed looked at in dusk of carriage for moment without replying seemed so much in harmony with people said felt that felt to be one of obviously be afraid felt be not be how think have changed in old day must have appeared to a alien to a do gave one glance ah old day said with impatience be absurd ridiculous to want to remain a one be indeed not to change show that one have nature incapable of development implies sort of moral torpor atrophy of one nature not to get older a one get older one of biggest perhaps best effect of age be to give one tolerance to make one realize that take sort to make world laughed why sudden vehemence asked oh for variety of reason one be because judge correctly because judge incorrectly be perfectly right to say have changed perfectly wrong to imply even tacitly that one be worse for changing do grossest injustice when suppose that be in harmony with people be not more than ever be be absurd to coil one up like hedgehog run spine into everything come across a matter of fact often do be mistake drove on way in silence at last spoke again many of people with whom appear to to be in harmony consider wicked said many of be sure be vulgar in largest sense of wonderful term england be plutocracy let tell jim worship wealth will certainly worship how will like will really be very interesting to see how behave be awful position for if refuse to smile on worshipper will write down miser if do smile on will make a vulgar a laughed frighten said be there place in london for quiet millionaire leaned forward with sudden eagerness ah jim make one make one said be root of matter try if can spend money without encouraging vice vulgarity be worth effort leaned back again laughing lightly drew cloak round again dear have be vehement said be afraid will treat to more outburst only afternoon husband told how absurd be well reserve for said rather like be inspiring person marie know always found inspiring many thanks inspiration will make one do anything one motive have to come from within not without if be worth anything be not so sure of that stopped at lady devereux house in eaton place until bell be answered sat silent then a footman opened carriage door be delighted have come back jim said really be delighted come see often come to lunch to morrow for instance yes be right thirty one know lunch at one thirty chapter iii jim spencer woke next morning with thrill of quickened anticipation serf to remind even before full consciousness have returned that something new exciting have come into life needed little thought to remember what be a lay watching with idle wide awake eye man putting clothes out told over over again in mind like bead of rosary event of evening before always finishing with pendant so to speak fact that in few hour be going to see again frankly honestly reminded that romance be over to begin with also to end with be man wife be sufficient for a doubt be sufficient for three year ago have left england because desired in fibre of being to marry since be impossible because entirely refused to waste life in purposeless dangling after what must not get in spirit be more instinct with manliness than sacrifice of year youth to mere watching of unattainable shadow on blind have gone out to transvaal farmed there with same fervour a have thrown into love making subsequently by discovery of reef on land have become if not one of richest men who have found colossal fortune a sheep farmer at rate one of second rank millionaire if not multi millionaire at point certain sobriety of nature have reasserted have not mistaken that full meal of gold for hors d'oeuvre sought to duplicate reduplicate have not lost sight of fact that have enough recognising with thankfulness plenitude give not with false appetite of habitual glutton have so to speak said grace retired from dinner table so now at age of thirty be temporarily at rate without employment even a have be temporarily also without employment when marie decided to marry not jack alston true have plenty of artistic taste in music picture must easily have passed remainder of life however long just a without ever being bored must have shot autumn hunted winter dozed dined spring summer according to traditional method of english gentleman whose obituary notice eventually teems with encomium on useful simple life mean that have be j p to pas one life merely in hearing music looking at buying picture seemed to a unworthy of person who called man a did recognised round of shooting hunting appear to unworthy of rational being at a to what temporary abandonment of employment must terminate in a lay in bed morning have present idea anyhow be to see marie again deliberately quenched further reflection morning have not be foresworn fulfilled with liberal generosity promise of last few day when mildred brereton reached row on black mare have be behaving a might crab on hot plate must have tried most masterly seat hand broad brown expanse of lady mile be plentifully dotted with rider little green seat too by side be in high

hallucination be in constant habit of remembering that be excellent mother that next to own affair be highly probable that among others took most thought for of daughter consequently on afternoon following maxwell entertainment determined to devote to maud prospect with end in view drove down with in space annihilating motor car to house just above windsor in order to talk with by way when arrived there see that thing be in order for week end party that be giving on saturday summer weather have begun with such splendour week ago have by unparalleled effort kept up seven day of sunshine have brought out wealth of fresh green leaf on tree in london still varnished undimmed by dust in country of exquisite verdure overhead sun be set in sky of divine purity swift motion through air felt to be quite a exhilarating to sens a must have be afternoon party to have not duty called must otherwise have gone have never wished to have daughter abandonment of party reminded how often be sacrificing to maud indeed seemed to herself most excellent mother notwithstanding that be generally justly supposed to be able to spar with most robust emergency mr brereton did not particularly fancy task have set strictly speaking have be set in fact early morning there have arrived for note from hostess of last night saying what sort of communication dear anthony have made before went to bed under circumstance be only right that maud mother must be asked whether sanctioned step proposed to take in presenting a suitor for daughter hand phrasing of note a might be expected from so successful lady a mr maxwell be a unimpeachable a content filled mr brereton with joy for two odious son of husband by first marriage must inherit bulk of husband fortune maud must have almost nothing now mr brereton have desire to see impecunious peeress indeed impecunious anything have come to very wise conclusion that money certainly be money that where chance of marrying huge fortune be presented must be distinctly failure of maternal duty not to put advantage very distinctly decidedly before daughter be never very much at ease with maud whom if have be woman child must have described a uncomfortable kind of girl being own spoke of always a very original with great opinion of own did not particularly like girl more than liked young men new wine needed maturing before be fit for palate be just gave full allowance to necessity for being young before can become mellow though wished that maud must be quick about really when girl be nearly nineteen nearly six foot high with superb figure face at men undisguisedly stare with reason be time for possessor of such advantage to begin thinking about making nest here be one ready excellently well feathered only hoped strongly somehow remotely that maud might see in light considered daughter to combine symptom of hopeless simplicity with of most world weary cynicism be impossible that must be genuine puzzled mother to say be sun be quite hot mr brereton at once put up parasol for large glass screen sheltered from wind delicious sun be said a extinguished what delightful drive will have maud when one go into country like can never understand why ever live in town so sensible of dear nellie be not have bought cottage in country with orchard dairy dream of butter tell probably wake find that be earwig that doe tell think must care about if must tell one about said maud doe strike a real country lover doe oh dare say not in sense be dear said mother always wonder where get from fancy father existing in country said moment that must understand why ever live in town be kind of thing frequently occurred when mr brereton chattered to daughter maud seemed to think that in light conversation people meant what said error so astounding that seemed almost hopeless to point out dear maud how literal be said seem to realize one have mood may last year more may only last minute one lasted le than minute maud laughed how unsettling said for how can one know whether one really like anything may only last minute mr brereton plunged at opening header so to speak into frothy water ah be where wisdom come in said have not only to choose to do what like to choose that reason dictate that know be really advantageous for life must be very simple matter if one only followed one inclination be lesson one can not learn too early there be short pause in mr brereton passed in rapid summary to herself occasion must remember on have not followed inclination seemed to that there be immense number be always doing kind thing pause must have be long one have not maud broken suppose mean that want to marry anthony maxwell remarked in perfectly even voice be occasion on mother be absolutely unable to decide whether maud disconcerting directness sprang from internal childlike simplicity brutally frank insight into diplomacy of others put best construction possible on dear maud exclaimed effusively be too dear of to meet like to tell truth be little shy about opening subject to a did not know what thought be much easier for to talk about now much said maud to think that must have guessed said other always be so quick did not need much quickness after prolonged conversation with last night so have good talk to said mr brereton be so glad maud raised eyebrow surely meant to said whenever looked up meaning to go always thought saw pinning down again did not mr brereton be not quite sure that thing be going comfortably know what mean by pinning down said be of course perfectly true that wanted to get better acquainted with be sure maud be very lucky girl lucky girl put up parasol face be absolutely immobile except for least curl at corner of mouth might have expressed almost anything fatigue indifference anything then have made formal proposal asked mother wrote to asking if sanctioned doing so said yes suppose naturally must not forbid considering a do that be admirable match for young man be amiable quite without vice must think after be most important a so many marriage be wrecked that way be shrewd clever quite father son be immensely wealthy be very good quality said maud dear of course be in bare justice to myself must say that when recommend thing do so not on vague ground on well defined cogent reasoning perhaps must prefer husband who be sot fool pauper must easily find one of without great trouble maud laughed be one of people whom temper in others leaf perfectly undisturbed then laid hand on mother dearest mother said really did not mean to be tiresome be be saying that be well conducted clever wealthy must have thought be good deal to say for one said mother not yet quite calm there be heap of perfectly well conducted people in world who be fool heap of very wealthy people who be vicious plenty a said who have wit moral money sort do want do look forward to spinsterhood in cottage with canary almost father fortune will go to otho reginald will be quite poor love anthony maxwell said maud with deplorable relapse into directness oh dear have be reading sentimental novel seem to think that girl meet man eternally pre destined for with clear cut feature coiffure like hair dresser sort of romantic stuff be extinct never existed in fact be rapidly disappearing in fiction if be true world must have come to end long ago for must have caught such frightful cold by reading dante shakespeare on violet covered bank that must have died without child mr brereton settled on cushion of carriage feeling much more comfortable if only maud must continue to argue question felt sure of ground be not silly know dear went on in fact think be too much other way like analyzing picking thing to bit saying seems to faulty here seems to exaggerated there ' assure be mistake when say love be using expression of meaning of have idea know what love be girl can may feel attracted to handsome face a can be attracted by landscape piece of jewellery one with slightest sense of refinement must marry man because be handsome be grossly indelicate idea one be sure never entertained be not proposing to marry man because of good look said maud dear be certain be not be only saying in abstract that to do thing must be inconceivable folly if husband be adonis must forget be even passably good looking in fortnight dear yes one get used to nothing so quickly in same way with same speed get used to absence of good look anthony maxwell allow have small claim to be only wondering whether when said that did not love did not have half conscious idea in mind that if be very handsome might have dearest maud how wonderfully well be looking wonder anthony fell in love with again corner of maud mouth twitched hope be not cause said for have just told what absurd reason be for wanting to marry anybody for moment mr brereton have violent desire to box eligible ear restrained proceeded to propound philosophy of matrimony with most admirable lucidity ah be where men be different from said be part of province of woman a dear mr austin say to be beautiful be quite outside province of men look at father now maud have perhaps le pretentions to good look than one ever saw what happy what blessed word did not stick marriage ours have be looking back even now have never yet seen man whom must sooner have chosen long long ago year ago at least thought that if only dear anthony must be attracted by what happy thing must be be silly to expect high romance high romance doe not exist for ninety nine hundredth of world luckily be sure be sure be not romantic maud have listened with closest attention to what mother be saying made reply in silence bowled swiftly along bath road seemed to open like torn linen in front of mr brereton also well knew silence in season be a necessary equipment to dialectician a most eloquent speech having said that really intended have design of ruining effect of word by vain repetition once indeed called attention to loveliness of clustered pyramid of bloom covered horse chestnut tree in garden round house of small village half buried in blossom tone of maud lovely showed quite unmistakably that general

sunday afternoon style be to say nervous palpitating little man to whom at moment croquet seemed of more importance than eternal salvation be busy with tea party of four ball separating adversary making hoop with intolerable precision while long willowy girl partner trailed after in triumphal progress gave faint languid sound of sycophantic applause there see be separated miss martin said zealot at length now will mobilize with then can make hoop next time ought to go out yes be quite too beautiful said miss martin know will miss oh be not turn be where be gone at moment guardsman of most pronounced type middle aged woman of most un middle aged type being weary with faultless exhibition have retired to seat at far end of garden be talking very low laughing very loud be recalled with difficulty still lingering on way unpromising situation be carefully explained to by palpitating man in voice in endeavour not to appear jubilant be rather too marked being lady turn chipped ball sideways at about right angle to required direction without even affecting to look where have gone dropped mallet in middle of lawn instantly retired with guardsman again elsewhere other group be forming dispersing in new wooden shelter lady ardingly have taken up permanent position at bridge table while others cut in out kept seat with tree like composure played rubber after rubber with success appeared monotonous to adversary anthony maxwell occasionally took hand at table in interval chased maud brereton from terrace to terrace with hunter pertinacity conscious of approving eye of mother of maud father of must no doubt have viewed employment with equal approbation have not be deeply engaged in secluded corner in trying to rook other at piquet however finding to indescribable dismay that have caught tartar like many very rich men played for very low stake exhibited inordinate greed for half crown even smaller coin jack alston wife have be among guest who came down from saturday till monday have gone over for day rather to mildred disgust to neighbouring golf link must not be back till dinner marie however have be so mildred considered at very best afternoon conferring a in mysterious manner have always power to do air of distinction success to party wherever be there be crowd wherever be there be more constant laughter more animated conversation have gift rare inimitable of making people play up dull folk aroused when talked to brilliant people coruscated for there went from unconscious pervading emanation air of freshness vitality acted like breath of wind in close atmosphere reviving bracing at present be talking to lady devereux arthur naseby who wore straw hat be strangely unsuitable to appeared stouter than ever in comparative privacy of lower lawn ah yes be saying be just fault with now think can be amused merely by having people to amuse be not so being amused depends almost entirely on one day nothing amuses one on others one be amused by other sort of nothing be always other sort of nothing with said arthur naseby what like really best of be pantomime find in pantomime exactly what take there take there invincible gaiety be why find there be what mean said marie be case with everything love pantomime like everything take place without slightest reason be so like life like clown belabour other with bladder throw mud at butter belonging to other people audience part of like mr naseby be enormously amused be horribly unjust marie said lady devereux in sleepy drawling voice never belabour be privileged person go flying over hedge ditch while if for instance a much a look over hedge be supposed to be there for good purpose be consciousness of innocence give such license one can acquire almost anything by practice think will set about marie laughed must dear be innocent for hour day to begin with increase by degree ah be not innocence consciousness of want said blanche be different matter lead to absolutely nothing said arthur naseby in discontented voice except perhaps promotion in church have given up real thought of thought real way to get on in church now be to preach heretical doctrine remarked lady devereux parson at rye always cast doubt on thing like jonah whale try to explain by supposing be not whale extinct animal with enormous gullet seems to just a remarkable tell be certain to be made bishop grandfather be bishop mine be draper said arthur naseby be thankful day that be such successful one really nothing matter nowadays except money be so convenient for people who have here be most convenient person for instance just coming jim spencer entered tent with air of looking for somebody also have air of having found somebody when saw marie sat down in low chair by have be playing croquet said will never play again what happened nothing happened remained in sublime inactivity except when other people used for own base end never felt so useful in life again be use said arthur like consciousness of innocence lady devereux mean to cultivate being simply opportunity for other people seems to very type of wasted life be continually being opportunity for other people opportunity give be to make unkind remark about constantly take advantage of do say asked marie say be idle therefore probably vicious now nothing be ever le proved than that be perfect fallacy entirely due to pessimistic person who said that satan find mischief still for idle hand to do be idle be of course quite true for thirty year have be very busy doing nothing whatever day live find more nothing to do if understand then allow world doe libel said lady devereux certainly doe be that to so strongly object people go about saying sort of thing about be perfectly true greater truth greater libel marie got up from chair be true that world have keen grasp of obvious said why disappoint mr naseby do something be ready to do almost anything in world said for suitable inducement nobody ever induces well will go for stroll said marie expect inducement companionship unless one be inclined jim spencer got up instantly please let come said two left tent arthur naseby lady devereux continued to sit there there be moment pause then in shrill yes case certainly present point of interest said a consulting doctor although nobody have shown slightest desire to consult see why must give diagnosis briefly be exceeding warm weather will undoubtedly cause snowflake to melt if doe not be true snowflake must be for anything snowflake must have melted long ago in fact be proved lady devereux considered marie be great friend of mine said have one criticism to make upon extraordinarily healthy way of looking at thing can not be genuine must not be human if be gave lecture other day about vulgarity of lying down to be trampled on now one be human must know that be just about only thing in world worth doing personally consider instance of wonderful self abandonment self sacrificing character of love must even call love said arthur must use perfectly antiquated shocking word now be be not antique be absurd to treat a if be old testament history marie be great dear have be too sweet about bazaar have promised to hold stall day never can quite make out what people see in said arthur of course adore simply because one have to be unheard of not to be there anything there after except except what one see yes of course there be said blanche there be in that rest of be without to put baldly be good woman get force from being good if be clever a well yes may laugh be so true now rest of be not good dear mildred andrew be said arthur be why one never know whether be in room not said lady devereux be may be good there be nothing else there mere goodness be pretty colourless by marie be everything else good a well be about five time a clever a of have tact else must have made row long ago be woman of world be also good suppose be probably why be never quite comfortable with said arthur in mild ruminating voice very likely be also why be quite wrong in diagnosis just now oh there be lady ardingly looking for people to make up table have probably cleaned everybody else out come arthur let go be cleaned out too laughed loudly went marie jim spencer meantime have strolled away from crowd on lawn towards meadow river even though have be only fortnight so back in england have begun clearly to recognise that experiment of going away self banishment to south africa in order to win back freedom from spell have cast on have be failure have thought that by filling mind with other interest by drugging soul with pursuit of gold a can drug aching body into unconsciousness must still pain so indeed have done for time opiate appeared be not permanent in effect drowsiness have passed off again at sight of love have awoke seemed too to now that loved with more devout passion than ever before old longing be there with added that heightened matured perception must now appreciate how fine be how different from jostling race swirled round who clutched like greedy child with hand at two thing alone thought worthy of effort pleasure at cost violation money be worth sacrifice except of pleasure like whole of rest of london knew intrigue jack have be carrying on for year be now so stale that have almost ceased to form subject for gossip thought be bitterly poisonous to mind must be possible wondered that marie knew condoned that have accepted that for there be remedy divorce played gooseberry to husband knew what be relation to woman whose hospitality be even now enjoying that jack have drifted into apathetic estrangement so often be result of childless marriage did not doubt be reason for be so well known to everybody else again again during last fortnight unworthy debasing suspicion have assailed to do justice have a often cast from trust whole hearted belief in rejecting strangling a often a presented vowed that must give home other alternative only other possible though left stainless unsullied be hardly le painful be intolerable thought to that alone must be ignorant of of better mind told be ignorant three quarter of world doubt if ever gave thought now to piece of scandal have long outlived first youth commended for admirable common sense in recognising folly of making fruitless public exhibition of private affair other quarter doubt wondered idly how long blissful ignorance must continue saw material for drama moment enlightenment came in wonder must not help joining what must do if ever found out worldly wisdom must assuredly indicate direction completely opposite to in moral sense must point that there must be struggle regarded a inevitable even knowing a well a did must form conjecture a to way must go marie accepting what have happened not quarrelling with irremediable made picture unpaintable marie living life of woman who have separated from husband be almost equally outside possibility have vague sense of approaching storm brewing mischief remote might be marching inevitably nearer even a in spell of sultry oppressive day know that be only through thunder convulsion of element that can get back to cool dewy morning again regard sunshine a friend not a thing to be shunned shrunk from may have be that vividness with be conscious in fibre of threatening disaster be communicated by subtle brain wave to in case first word a walked down shady path below full fledged elm bore very distinctly on filled mind how hot be said there will surely be storm echo made by audible voice to inaudible thought startled what sort of storm asked quickly still busy on own ground laughed so have be thinking of storm too said often used to think in harness do remember jim what sort of storm well too have other storm than thunder in mind used to dislike real thunder storm remember always loved expect other sort of storm affect one similarly hate compromise know if one be absolutely at cross purpose with other people be much better to have out fair square to upset furniture smash china if necessary rather than concede little here have little conceded there that always result in state of thing better than before added distaste on side to open subject again did not at once answer bore directly on stifled questioning answered be anything particular in mind asked at length mean yes ca lie to purpose jim be good trying yes what be partly in mind be disagreement have with jack ten day ago patched up quite beautifully agreed that nothing be worth bothering about acquiesced though must personally have preferred to have out at least be sure of if one differs fundamentally from one be use arguing a say bothering fundamentally jack be very different paused moment glanced suddenly at be why get on so excellently added with just suspicion of hurry in word jim longed to applaud quickness have be excellently done most elementary courtesy forbade to call attention to aside be conventionally observed at other place besides theatre be glad of that said in perfectly even voice be turning of table conventionality be a obvious a hers silently noticed also passed on yes little patch up with jack be in mind said then a told have privately settled to have storm storm mean will be bigger storm than on subject jack be quite agreed mean national storm general upheaval goodness high tower steeple will be smashed here go meantime dancing in middle of thunder cloud with lightning so to speak playing about have emerged from wooded walk on to edge of meadow bordering river a marie spoke pointed across field to lawn visible beyond filled with gay figure bordered with bright colour of flower bed set in sombre green of yew hedge jim followed finger yes assuredly be dancing said sunday afternoon in country be innocuous sort of high dress dance be certainly if dance day get on with work in point of fact jim dance be not very high dress no fact be be going to dog a quick a ever can money money money be perfectly sound legitimate cry if mean adopt be that increase wealth if get tip from city man speculate be merely snatching at what want did go to maxwell other night did because do be what have come to doe not spell efficiency worship golden calf instead of feeding try to cut little piece off deborah be prophetess before lord said jim proceed deborah wish be said marie oh must hear truth if be jack must tell come pretty near to being prophet then be prophet wife tell what say about ah be prophet in one thing needful mean fire burning prophet be like phoenix be born from ash of conflagration in jack case message be there be delivered know if will mean anything to personally feel be delivered out of cold lip need touch of red hot coal like isaiah did hear read speech last week about army estimate first secretary have given statement in apologetic kind of way apparently wishing to conciliate opposition for estimate being so high usual bickering over round of ammunition followed then jack got up instead of apologizing for being so high fell foul of own chief for being so low wanted to know why autumn manoeuvre have be curtailed wanted to know why experiment at lydd have be abandoned in middle wanted to know why projected battery at gibraltar have not be constructed be because of expense why in fact have not spent twice a much a have must hardly be popular speech from member of government popular prophet be opportunist thank god jack care absolutely not one jot what either own side opposition think of press next morning be worth reading got most violent abuse from side wo that sort of thing damage in after next election must not think party must like be sure government will not ah disagree with there said marie jack think be getting great hold on people mass if like dislike treat like dirt mass a know be profound snob rather enjoy that like lord to behave in way imagine lord do behave even like wicked lord on other hand be beginning to see jack mean business think army be wholly inadequate judging from length of boer war must crumple under great stress see considers that walk over be anticipated have degenerated into stroll so instead of joining in hymn of praise to british empire government spend time in singing rather out of tune with other stand apart say bluntly that must set to put in far greater state of efficiency otherwise go empire now be impalatable think people in general be beginning to see that may be medicinal must say be lucky be hereditary legislator said jim how about government post afterwards well think government may see that too know perfectly well that jack doe care one straw about party question have said a much what doe care about be empire think care for more than anything else in world what know about be army if cry for efficiency certainly be getting louder in country continues will have far better chance of remaining in power if jack be put at war office have come to far end of meadow marie paused moment looking at broad patient stream hundred of pleasure boat be scattered over surface electric launch river steamer crowded with roaring sunday excursionist did best to make vile one of most beautiful river in world indeed seemed bedlam let loose packed tight even stuffy little cabin be full of feather hatted girl amorous young men who changed hat with other without finding brilliancy of wit grow least stale even in endless repetition took alternate mouthful of solid refreshment out of paper bag of beer out of same bottle with shout of laughter at slightly indelicate suggestion poor river be flecked with fragment of bun bag floating bottle where trout must have be feeding echo of music hall with absolutely independent wheezings of concertina owning suzerainty by way of accompaniment came to marie companion with curious sharp distinctness with sound travel over water for moment stood there in silence then marie turned quickly in direction of lawn behind back to river again after said half to herself jim laughed be somehow strangely pleasant to to find a marie have said thinking in harness yes le loudly so answered replying to have not said so seems to good folk on river seem loud to oh dear jim what awkward inconvenient thing be to be different from people one move among did not feel that owed mercy on point have refused deliberately other life have once offered ah find that do said love for surging up with bitterness in throat yet chose have begun walking back towards lawn again at word marie suddenly stopped from one side came sound of laughter talk from other now more remote fragment of d'isy d'isy well knew what be in mind thanked silently for not putting into word know did said doubt very fact that be different to most of milieu be what make so entertaining at moment jim saw where stood knew that taunt that lot be of own choosing have be dictated by be bitter within be of nature of revenge however ineffectual revenge be very smoky lamp wherewith to guide one step in world have justice to quench without more ado knew also that void might have filled ached horribly by irony of fate have now in abundance that of lack year ago have made impossible then that must fill have be girl boy in felt now that have subsequently flowered into great bloom of love have be in bud bud be now proved be authentic for there be mistaking flower marie also be troubled must not guess something of what be in mind taunt seemed to unworthy of did not regret light finality of answer a walked back by meadow side already growing tall with hay redolent with hundred unprized flower of english meadow mind changed have loved with honourable love on side have liked have be impossible so told rather hurriedly if have be free came to now dismissed such unprofitable conjecture meanwhile have be harsh though perhaps deservedly to old friend so just a held gate into garden open for be so glad have come back jim said chapter vii tea rather modern substitute for tea consistes of most thing except tea from caviare sandwich to strawberry ice whisky soda to iced coffee have just be brought out when two returned to lawn mildred brereton guest have fallen upon with most refreshingly healthy appetite be fluttering about table like school of gull fishing one according to sensible modern plan foraged privately privateerly for there be row of patient woman agonizing for thing to eat drink until man languidly brought something did not want instead of desired on other hand be there row of men parading slowly up female line like sightseer at exhibition with teacup slipping gliding over saucer bun being jerked from plate by neighbouring elbow instead one flocked to table seized what wanted retired into corner to eat anthony maxwell in particular who have wonderful gift for mimicry be loading up with great care solidity something in air might have reminded observer of steamer coaling for

be sure know see be young very young think that hers be nature expands very early young man rather heavy commonplace face flushed for moment be lit up a be by flame from within oh be not going to be impatient said a for perseverance why there be nothing must not do number of year must not wait to get mr brereton looked at critically for half moment why be in love said to herself then aloud dear mr anthony be convinced of said bear that in mind when speak to maud also bear in mind that there be marriage father so much desire ah there be duchess of bolton just come must go speak to interview with lady ardingly have be briefer felt more to point will probably refuse said that lady in case have better wait month ask again have everything on side everybody except perhaps girl eventually will do what be good for here be fourth let play bridge immediately particular game of bridge have rather taken out of anthony for have be lady ardingly partner have have misfortune to revoke in playing sans tout hand remark to be direct might just a well pick pocket of twenty pound said to a do that do not see so by gross carelessness have lost rubber mistake one intelligent glance at hand must have avoided come there be other pursuit be there not in wish to be engaged will perhaps follow with better attention then seeing young man discomfiture admirable good nature returned croquet for instance added hear be great player ah there be lord alston doubt will make fourth maud be true have spent hour since lunch in flying before admirer reason must be confessed be not one must be disposed to think natural on part of young girl there be not in fact one atom of shyness shirking about have not least objection to hear impassioned speech blunt declaration mode anthony must choose to adopt did thought of in way fill with horror have listened very attentively to mother advice when drove down to windsor earlier in week have also listened with same consideration to lady ardingly far more convincing sensible remark when have lunched with on friday only reason for refusing opportunity afternoon be that really have not slightest idea whether must say yes did not a have told mother love did not dislike be merely quite indifferent to a indeed men be men in fact a far a thought about at seemed to to be unattractive people must not conceive what girl must want with one permanently in house be for ever putting tobacco brandy into mouth letting inane remark out stared at in uncomfortable incomprehensible manner on other hand knew perfectly well that be natural thing for girl to marry one always did be probably right supposed that also must ultimately marry be utter absence of emotion correct thing be aware that trembling rapture be in world of printed thing supposed to be orthodox signal flown by party engaged must be creature of averted eye deep blush did not feel least inclined to there be nothing in anthony must make wish to avert eye a far a knew did ever say thing

having very good night indeed marie maud brereton have long ago gone to bed other four still played on in silence for most part occasionally dummy rose refreshed inner self with something from side table from time to time note of cigarette must sound crisply a be on soft air of night at last strange change began to pas over sky from moon have now long set hardly visible there at first making

happening be day be not very likely said lady ardingly how much be jack never mind tell to morrow will pay to morrow jack rattled pencil case between teeth thirty pound exactly lady ardingly said rose walked across lawn towards house jack sauntering little behind hand in pocket smiling to mildred dropped behind with other two walking on few pace ahead most odious hour in twenty four said lady ardingly looking ghastly in dawn very trying said andrew have spent night very well said other a parted at foot of stair charming sunday mr brereton mildred be great benefactor hurried upstairs conscious that be looking awful in hour of low vitality come with dawn not wishing to appear thus before anybody however insignificant chapter viii be about fortnight after sunday at richmond that list of birthday honour came out be surprise to nobody mr brereton name appeared a recipient of peerage for respectability cash be thing that in confer such nobility on fortunate possessor that be only right proper to stamp with coronet like writing paper respectability doubt have be will again be dispensed with cash can not be replaced except by exceptional achievement of kind of andrew be hopelessly incapable a must clearly be absurd to bar man from birth from possibility of attaining to rank of hereditary legislator custom slowly broadening down have brought about since achievement in great deed be within reach of few plenty of good gold bestowed on plenty of good party institution pave way so to speak to what have be called by politician who wrangle hotly in place upper snow marie alston who have known of impending honour day before be talking over with jim spencer say like principle be saying thing being a be think most suitable thing oh dear jim know sufficiently well to know think system wrong from top to bottom after be in piece with rest plutocracy not king house of parliament rule naturally plutocracy say will have be within reach ' why not peerage be certainly within reach of course list be rather pronounced mr maxwell see have be made baronet after who else be there can think of eminent men whom one must wish to see peer ca there be few people richer than maxwell believe be use screaming jim shrugged shoulder at rate must be made peer said be rich enough how nice for vice versa perhaps jack must be made commoner doubt that reform will follow next at least perhaps jack must because really have making of eminent man house of peer anyhow must be made commoner doubt must be if be not for innate snobbishness of average englishman average englishman know quite well that there be nothing remarkable admirable about quantity of peer except peerage yet because be peer love reverence reserve compartment incidentally take toll off a well jim spencer raised eyebrow of course be right said say thing take seriously used to be serious marie ah do injustice said quickly be just a serious a ever be realize that be use being serious in public people have time to spare from amusement nowadays for anything serious in private be serious be serious in private to day for instance well be serious now tell what be serious about oh nothing beg pardon be not in public indeed be something something big a seems to be not sure that will tell about be silent moment unwilling to ask question on subject where hesitated weighing in mind whether not must tell at last spoke be about maud brereton said came to yesterday calm a summer sea to ask advice a to whether must marry anthony maxwell just a might ask advice a to whether must have picture framed in gold white did not ask question a to whether loved because believe that there be many girl who have idea what that mean think maud be one of jim got up began to walk up down room heard marie with ear speaking of maud inward ear translated so seemed to said of maud into thing be saying about now be sufficiently modern went on not to wish girl who feel passion to abstain from marrying believe that quite happy marriage often take place without either man woman may not feel yet by marrying be happier than must have be if have remained single ultimate sum of happiness be large factor jim do not think so again seemed to be talking of herself now must not decide whether be speaking with complete sincerity opinion at rate appeared to monstrous finish exposition first said after whether agree with not be small matter maud brereton asked advice not mine something in tone startled for moment instinctively that afternoon walk have taken down by river fortnight ago came into mind went on without pause seem cold blooded to said dare say be be highly probable in fact then there be further thing to be considered many girl feel sure have passion awakened by marriage now that constitutes great danger admit in passionless marriage who can tell well that need not be discussed remains certain be afraid that there be many woman to whom becoming a one flesh with husband have not meant anything before married le afterwards remarked jim le afterwards physical nature be awakened here be le modern than at present be inclined to give credit for credit for asked jim yes because be not modern at oh jim be great puzzle supposing girl have to feel that there be absolutely only one man in world for supposing man have to feel that here here alone be destiny before married do think must have increase of marriage return be afraid not people being what be do think that celibacy must have good effect on moral be use advocating counsel of perfection when be dealing with human race obvious imperfection at least that suppose may eventually come for practical purpose highest motive doe not always secure such good result a lower one so advised to marry said jim slowly advised not to excellent reason have given why must marry be present in mind even told at back of mind mind soul call what will there be great 'but ' dare say be unreasonable be certainly not clear to what be whatever be said ' wanted not to impose what called experience of world on girl after what doe one experience amount to recollection of one mistake spoke last word more to herself than a leaned back in low chair violet coloured eye looking out beyond focused not by limit of vision that of thought quick uneven breath disturbed slow rise fall of bosom rose have fastened in dress shed fragrant petal on lap because be man looked at with kindled eye because be man who loved blood also be kindled more than ever before knew how idle have be flight from caelum non animum suddenly leaped in mind from dingy rank of truism to austere array of thing be true drew chair little closer to hers laid hand on arm mistake marie said took appreciable fraction of time to recall realize what be meant by burning look took time at when once have realized that to answer yes one mistake said occasion on one have failed to grasp true import of what one be doing in particular mistake one have seen other people making consequence always think that one experience mean much more what one have observed in other people than what one have done one self of course observation pass through crucible of one personality whether one observes thing in one self other people that certainly transforms crystallizes what will if one have grain of imagination other people experience be a vivid to one self a one own a potentially profitable think so rose a spoke trembling slightly brushed fallen petal from dress be just enough not to blame for what have said be indeed just enough to commend for reticence since word have necessarily for significance need to stop saying more be imperative must see what inward excitement moved in soul thanked for love bore that word of must pas between be impossible merely must not be being so desired with fervency of desire that have not known for year not to lose friend word of such kind a knew be rising to lip must have meant loss indeed at moment world seemed to hold for nothing so desired a friendship word might rob of to reply be sobering bracing showed how close have be walking to edge of precipice a marie have just told be old fashioned believed that good bad noble wicked be not yet word of obsolete meaning word like arquebus have significance in vocabulary of day temptation have come gripped by throat temptation to suggest to that must say that marriage with jack be among experience mistake knew also be honest enough to confess that desire to hear say be due to fact that confession must necessarily open certain vista must be first step at rate down path that certain part of have during past fortnight longed to tread with fervour passion shook whole nature a wind shake toss curtain knew in what sort jack have kept marriage vow have begun to ask whether such conduct did not give emancipation so to speak to wife have begun to tell that be use setting up exceptional code of morality one lived in world world did douche of cold water be bracing recalled to sanity to better normal self replied in voice still shaken with own overwhelming though momentary tumult so advised not to marry asked do think will take advice yes because showed clearly what own bias really be one often doe not know what one really think till one express strong opinion on one side other then one hears with strong repugnance strong sympathy reveals to one what one true opinion be jim smiled regurgitation of bitterness swelling up in breast have ever formulated to yourself what own strongest passion be asked never be most difficult thing in world to say what one like best until one be forty thereabouts one youth take extends to about forty be passed experimentally in determining what one like best one doe not know till be crystallized by then also be probably unattainable jim laughed again bitterly oh need not be afraid said rebuff now beginning to sting tell that chief passion be analysis care so much what people do a why do if hooligan knocked down began stamping on can imagine saying betop just moment to tell why be doing doe giving pain to give pleasure to do personally feel grudge against ' then when have told must say 'thank very much go on stamping again marie have detached unpetalled rose from dress have taken from vase in hand did not pin in after listening open mouthed sat down again with in finger be egotistical doubt said must account for burning desire to know why think that suppose do think that jim be irritated with for cause question be unpremeditated a soon a have spoken must have bitten out tongue for having said almost certainly thought in moment pause that ensued must tell why be irritated with that knew already of thing in world be one did not wish to tell answer came almost immediately think there be anything must do must irritate said do think what have said think be bloodless marie think be like what imagine maud brereton to be bloodless people be disconcerting one doe not know how to make hear how to make feel thing that majority of race feel suddenly there rose in mind long far off dusty memory have be skating one day on thinly frozen pond suddenly felt ice bend sway under have said to herself ice be thinner here on occasion have put foot down gone straight for bank on occasion did exactly same be probably right said thing many woman do find absorption in doing think stupid what be worse vulgar what be worst wicked be bourgeoise be bonne femme be what really mean jim be quite true be quite quite true doubt if one be not in habit of spending one energy on on matter of emotion one disposes of in other way if one doe not give one up to feeling one probably have more time for thinking because one must do something if one have nerve brain at hooligan business describe be beyond be afraid got up abruptly must go said there be hundred thing must not do must go not do at moment for first time during interview have touched moved struggle suddenly became pathetic to thing to pity praise like weir spouted at joint in strong door of determination not to speak flood be restrained rose also excuse have charm of absolute sincerity said when people say have hundred thing to do seems to very bad reason yours be better when will see again know said for moment left awkwardly placed manliness once more came to aid for there must be one conclusion if said more added be away next sunday come back on wednesday that night dine with ardinglys also till wednesday then jim go not do thing spoke of not doing thing take longer than doing take time in fact good bye chapter ix be never denied even by stupidest of enemy that mildred brereton be woman of world mode of procedure when learned from maud of first rejection of anthony hand be perfectly correct from standpoint of wisdom made fuss scene of kind only said dear maud be very very sorry know dear how trust maud pondered remark in silent uncomfortable way for moment do mean trust eventually to accept asked mr brereton wondered in own mind where maud must have got tactlessness from aloud said trust in way dear way show good sense that did not definitely refuse wish to force at hurry decision be be said on subject at time mildred after careful thought be convinced have done right impeccable attitude be completed by looking rather sad whenever daughter be observing sighing constantly calling dear child in well modulated tone of chastened uncomplaining affection policy if be possible to use so cold calculating word for process so tender have desired effect maud felt touched with sense of vague contrition eventually not feeling sure of herself have decided to confide difficulty to marie alston for whom cherished shy secret adoration interview however have not be productive of result harmonized with mother tender process indeed have mildred known that gentle dropping of water on stone tender process must have led daughter to ask advice of marie must have adopted quite different method maud told about interview same afternoon be not called dear child word to effect on occasion now there be sort of anger though be often seen in combination with irritation ill temper be something very different from be not quick burning emotion be in hurry to strike to hurt be quite deliberate very patient at end when favourable opportunity present strike hard be quality of anger entered into mildred mind when maud told of interview have be simply irritated with marie angry with anger of le dangerous quicker sort must probably have rushed round to park lane used language of cook to marie burst into tear probably made up day two later have not slightest impulse to do of thing be irritated with maud called fool sent away then sat down thought about marie there occurred to of course at once very obvious method of injuring marie one be to say who mattered at except marie knew that jack have be great friend for very long time what must be effect on marie if let know quietly drop by drop a one let absinthe cloud embitter water what have be going on so long what have be blind to so long mildred knew to be woman of pride fastidiousness quite beyond not only own reach own comprehension have never either resented envied if people chose to behave in what called holy land manner be nothing to be not jealous of unattainable oriental longitude be very well to sit on pedestal if did have idea what game went on in jostling world below marie habitual attitude be to put nose in air draw skirt away from crowd must really be very humiliating for to get to learn by degree what have be going on year to upset pedestal in fact let struggle to foot a best must to let who always professed to find scandal gossip of sort so uninteresting know for first time bit of must scarcely consider dull mildred got up from sofa where be lying in sitting room lighting cigarette took turn up down at first sight seemed excellent plan diabolical suited mood simple a good plan be on second thought there be objection in present anger did not value marie friendship straw while a for own reputation be well aware that for practical purpose have none people knew did not talk about jack longer simply because fact be so stale that thought to herself with grim cynicism be what one call living thing down danger lay elsewhere supposing marie cut up very rough indeed supposing in horror disgust at jack did not hesitate to punish a well bring matter if must into crude convincing light of divorce court must be unpleasant for mildred herself for felt that cross examination be not likely to be amusing must also spell ruin for jack career thing now in present state of affection cared about perhaps more than jack of course matter might be conveyed to marie in so gradual vague manner that such proceeding on part must be without chance of success a far a getting divorce be concerned to posse mind with suspicion gradually became moral certainty be point mildred knew well that in mind of great middle class to be mentioned in connection with divorce court be mischief not to lose win case there in case if decided on must have to think very carefully over must be managed so that marie must not possibly go to court besides ridiculous a marie must appear even if adopted least aggressive attitude of self defence yet mildred felt must not underrate strength of position in society perhaps plan might be found a simple without objection wanted in fact to think of something must hurt marie a much a possible yet give chance of retaliation where be marie vulnerable where be most vulnerable for moment irritation exasperation got upper hand flung off sofa with clenched trembling hand how dare how dare persuade maud not to marry said to herself frankly appeared to most outrageous thing to have done marie must have known what own desire for daughter be in fact have before now told of yet have done mildred felt qualm of almost physical sickness from violence of rage sat down again to recover soon passed leaving again quiet patient implacable searching about for weapon suddenly got up stood quite still moment most extraordinary must not have thought of before said aloud then washed face bathed eye with rose water examining little anxiously a dried on silk face napkin be a red a if have be cry red must suppose from anger just a mongoose eye get red when see cobra certainly have be angry enough to account for colour on whole did not like emotion except pleasant one be exhausting lay down again on sofa for hour to recover told maid to bring tablespoonful of brandy with egg beaten up into then dressed went out to small private concert where saltsi be going to sing two little french song exceedingly hard to understand simply screaming when did so for be certain that must understand quite enough have just come down stair when note be brought proved to be from marie maud have just consulted ran about question of marriage although knew view must not advise in opposition to look a if set against a far a go regret extremely must not do differently wanted to must not tell in case doe not mildred read tore up not even troubling to question sincerity then being told carriage be waiting went out be to call on way to concert for person usually known a silly billy who in reality be ignoble earl be called silly billy partly because name be william partly because be exceedingly sharp countess be kept in country be supposed to go to church great deal world be not particularly interested in be husband once have have money no longer have silly billy be now getting on for forty looked anything between twenty five thirty probably be naturally depraved for career of vice seemed to suit thrived on a other people thrive on ordinary rule of health have charming manner slim attractive appearance moral of kind passion just now be bridge played regularly from sunset to sunrise remaining hour of twenty four be occupied in consuming large quantity of food owing large sum of money talking be supposed not to stand in need of sleep declared be sheer waste of time be often to be seen in other people victoria to day be in lady brereton yes will just stop for saltsi two song said a drove from flat in berkeley mansion then will set down where like how have world be treating silly billy considered moment world always treat a treat said lately have not have much to say to in fact have done nothing so have heard nothing tell news anybody fresh about only jim spencer be rather disappointment a rich a croesus know be always advantage for friend remarked silly billy candidly must like to meet doe play bridge bet anything laughed be always refreshing said because be so very frank doe pay well must do one of two thing said must be absolutely enigmatical quite transparent be quite transparent want other people money will draw small cheque thanks small cheque must be no good by way have heard something about jim spencer be friend of marie alston lady brereton must not help smiling inward anger licked lip ah have heard that too said who care one may do precisely what please so far a be concerned said silly billy so long a doe personally annoy so be true be dear marie observed mildred see be engaged year year ago marie told so silly billy considered moment what have quarrelled with about asked after short pause mildred turned round now how on earth did guess that asked pretty simple said 'dear marie ' in well in tone so snowflake be melting think be sure tried to melt often enough never have very slightest success mildred laughed how funny said never knew that what did marie do looked bored merely bored not shocked bored jim spencer doe bore think suppose be telling everybody about have told soul seems there be need well thank god be prude said silly billy a stopped at house dear marie said mildred again perhaps ought never to have discussed with be such gossip silly billy shrugged shoulder surely be what want said mildred did not contradict did feel that have be wasting time so saltsi sang little french song very distinguished company shrieked with laughter of did not understand what meant shrieked most in order that must appear that did rest shrieked because did understand royalty be there in quiet little broughamish kind of way everything in fact went just exactly a must when mildred stole quietly away to avoid string quartette talk to lady maxwell to congratulate on husband honour advocate virtue of patience perseverance for anthony felt braced invigorated for duty lay before have already wound clock up pleased to think that ticking must soon be audible over london for did not care slightest how loudly people talked about knew on other hand that marie must care very much indeed audibleness of ticking be destined to be heard more quickly than even have hoped expected be two afternoon after silly billy be gently threading way down piccadilly day be heavenly flood of yellow sunshine invaded street plum like bloom hung over distance being so divine out of door be proposing to spend hour till dinner at select little club called black deuce have be lately founded with sole simple aim of bridge playing just a be about to cross street way be stopped for moment by policeman letting out pent up carriage stood waiting for turn in bond street just a lock be opened to let water out among shining stream of black lacquer silver harness there passed victoria with marie alston in by side sat jim spencer silly billy smiled gently to rest of way to club there be three men only friend respecter of in card room for be yet early making fourth sat down at once silly billy having a usual won deal seat established with back to window at angle of wall close to window be door by reason of heat be left open then holy silence fell partner went out in first deal billy cut card to left in great good humour met snowflake just now said driving along with melter paper rustled in window seat though deal be not yet finished silence more awful than silence of game again fell billy gave glance round not to see who be for instinctively felt quite sure merely in confirmation of knowledge hullo jack said that did see come in supposed have said jack damned good answer observed billy what trump did say martyn be to be set down to credit of billy nerve that not only did not revoke during hand played with usual brilliance have often claimed that game have advantage of enabling one to forget everything else in world for time being in instance be certainly justified what be coming afterwards have not slightest idea for present did not concern in turn partner dealt passed billy after little consideration gave trump first card be led billy hand exposed on table at moment billy being unoccupied jack rose can speak to minute without interrupting game asked silly billy rose looking exceedingly small young rather next room must think said two passed out martyn spoke well be damned said nobody contradicted door of next room shut behind others jack silly billy found simultaneously taking out cigarette case in box on table there be only one match jack lit handed first to other then spoke saw whom be with remarked glad have got to ask then said silly billy because must have told jack threw match into fireplace ah did mean wife then said silly billy figuratively speaking threw up hand very neatly done said have there now what do mean to do ask question two first now be that lie of own invention did get passed on from liar be using offensive language to observed silly billy be if prefer to come back to other room will use there silly billy smiled situation be becoming clearer to a regard question said what call that lie be not of own invention must also advise for own sake not to press to tell who told warn that if be offensive again will at present tell by way of amende for speech be indiscreet on part ought to have looked round to see that be not in room be how stand jack knew perfectly well that billy be fool weighed speech for moment in silence understand said think be too crooked for to follow perhaps will be best simplest if go back to other room can then box ear in presence of witness at billy laughed outright will then bring action for assault said for suppose be not vieux jeu enough to imagine will challenge to fight what will happen reason for quarrel will come out in open court will like will like to pose a defender of wife honour be billy grew more animated be so dense a not to know that surest way of dragging in dust be to defend successfully grant in court live in age dear jack in violence have altogether ceased law be meant to take place defeat own object however successful defence of action of wife honour may be surely know that if thing be made public at one instantly say that there must have be something in paused moment jack saying nothing be thinking that be cur coward continued billy have also used offensive language to take then do consider good defender of wife honour be easy for to box ear a suggest think have done fine manly action be conduct to of piece with do think that one will say that be most arrant piece of humbug if have be beyond reproach in married life say might not even have consented to shoot at let shoot at now good god jack started up black angry stood towering over other do think can speak to like that said very quietly for moment silly billy expected to find on floor not eyelash quivered lounged against chimney piece flickered cigarette ash into grate if touch will be sorry for said if say offensive word to will be sorry for be not in slightest degree afraid of if have be faithful to wife must say behaviour be admirable a be be merely childish be rotten folk have pull over because be not hypocrite about well want to call name have better get back have not hand must be over will be waiting for jack sat down wait minute said certainly if have anything agreeable to say remarked billy for have done be rather weak trump wonder what partner have oh damn game said jack probably will when get back conceded silly billy what do want to say only be rotten people have got to think over silly billy moved towards door oh yes be right enough said not coming back suppose be sauntered back into card room where hand be only just over well what luck asked whisky soda waiter yes lord large small enormous two trick did say partner thanks game twenty four to nothing how be ace only have one chapter x jack heard door of card room shut behind silly billy went slowly down stair out into hot crowded thoroughfare be still almost powerless to believe in own impotency have be so trenchantly put before by gentleman dozen time wished back in card room in other room where interview have taken place in order to have opportunity again of knocking down throwing card in face yet so told that seemed reasonable to before must seem reasonable to again there be flaw so far a must see in deduction have be put before be utterly at loss a to what must do story knew well must be over london by to morrow for when thing be talked about at club a quite assuredly must be there be more stopping than there be stopping flight of time by holding back hand of clock must assume protean monstrous form form assumed imagination must not picture one in own part must be construed a creditable what account must silly billy give of interview true one probably because from point of view must not be bettered oh be violent at first put before exact consequence of further violence saw at once must be quite sufficient must almost hear silly billy saying paramount in mind be anger against marie for to class of mind to jack belonged wife can not conceivably do anything more awful than get herself talked about must have be perfectly indulgent so very kindly told to anything might do that mildred have be probably now be talked about in connection with did not concern for be not husband to jack way of thinking flawless reputation be monopoly of one person namely wife walked slowly westward through blur of unrecognised face mind turning aimlessly through what have happened like squirrel in cage without getting anywhere ought to have said nothing at told having said something must at least have have temporary satisfaction of insulting silly billy yet must not have done still saw force of reasoning in fact nothing must have done blame of whole terribly irritating affair be to be laid on marie have behaved in foolish manner have got talked about remembered now that week ago have warned of made more annoying at corner of devonshire house step more than half automatically turned northward season summer be at midmost from side of street to that tide of carriage flowed full full too be pavement human life jostled in race from wall to wall of gray house just outside curbstone like scum flotsam in cross movement of tide moved row of sandwichman bearing various burden of advertisement from strictly private massage establishment to ballet more public better berkeley street square following be back water of flooded river way went with own volition not with dictation of tide through into grosvenor square still without purpose other than born of habit rang bell of house frequented on so many day at so many different hour be admitted mildred be not in room when entered walked up down with step of caged violence be room one must have said be lived in by woman of individuality usual signed photograph bearing royal distinguished name be there instead of being prominently displayed be obscurely penned thick a sheep on louis seize table in very dark corner while on writing table be set in window be only two of jack wife highly daring successful

opened entered at glance took in mood guessed too with absolute certainty of cause thing must make jack look like knew must be numbered on finger of none one must have happened thus there be one only left for moment be afraid of what have done outwardly showed sign what be asked jack did not at once answer paused in front of writing table where two photograph stood then took up that of marie threw into fireplace beat to piece with poker four pound for frame remarked mildred dresden parrot be at least hundred be only right must know be violent by mean if give satisfaction want new thing must not be better to explain first smash afterwards have never seen jack like have never even dreamed be capable of found though alarming rather attractive be always said of woman that like brutality thought to herself perhaps be true jack rose from fireplace little flushed be talking about marie at club said snowflake have melted apparently jim spencer be melter do mean heard said asked mildred yes by silly billy hospital be at asked jack sat down give whisky soda said be a dry a dust may ring thanks mean must have stamped on did not talked about quite quietly with pointed out that a defendant in action for assault must not be amused at cross examination adduced reason mildred looked at for moment with sort of quiet wonder do mean adduced a reason asked not by name how very forbearing of let that pas too yes reflected did right said at length be at first so much surprised at having behaved like must hardly believe did right be however quite unnecessary to smash marie photograph be that dramatic climax to show inalienable fidelity to laughed there drink whisky said how extraordinary men be whenever have have powerful exhausting emotion little alcohol always put square again one ought to measure everything by that wife talked about large whisky soda friend talked about small whisky soda one self talked about well be stimulus in say lithia varalette something lowering by way of

seemed to eye to look curiously without stamen yet a already stated although in le than traditional nine day world in general have ceased to concern with so misbegotten scandal lady brereton almost began to believe own invention in fact appeared probable to effect on marie from have hoped so much be entirely unfruitful lady ardingly about time like old war horse now turned out to grass have begun to prick up ear at trumpet resounded through land on approach of general election like many other people have great belief in jack power of awakening government from self congratulatory torpor

yes be going to speak plainly said be think certain that will be offered war office now have very clever wife who will be admirably useful to have great friend who be stupider than mule with soi disant brilliance be au fond really vulgar woman be vulgar people who make stupid mistake have already made one might have damaged seriously think will of presently be saying that will probably give war office can not with usefulness retain post for day if there be scandal connected with scandal be to say of wrong sort jack leaned forward in chair know why resent lady ardingly said why leave room do neither because be selfish at rate ambitious man said one who be worth salt be now will put name to advice paused moment to take coffee waited till man have left room mildred be very vulgar woman said vulgarity show in nature of mistake silly billy came here other day asked about scene with did not score there if have not be clever little fellow in small sort of bird like manner must have involved in row of monstrous proportion managed in microscopical way very successfully be so also told that be mildred who have suggested that absurd canard to there be stupidity of woman there be grain of sense in nobody who know must believe such thing about marie for ten day together supposing gutter rag of paper have got hold of wife of man who be in running for cabinet prosecuting intrigue with liberal candidate of division of surrey how charming if have wanted to ruin must have tried to think of something a damaging a if have thought of must have be quite content did not see that poor

be position be sedulously circulated that wife have intrigue with jim spencer who circulates cook luckily did something to stop people talking what be told happened to know mildred have quarrelled with wife have invented story out of revenge be case be not certainly happens to be true see how knew guessed be so said lady ardingly be only reasonable supposition there be not hold water besides if have not be true what doe matter now be first way in mildred might have ruined second concern also think need discus said jack who kept temper only by knowledge that must lose great deal more if lost have better be decent fellow jack also will amuse to see in cabinet will not unless be careful now have have affair with mildred for many year at least so suppose that suppose be important thing mind morally speaking because be in way responsible for moral be own business happens to stimulate everybody know about except one person wife now why not tell for what reason asked jack far too much surprised to resent anything simply for fear must find out blow ship out of water said lady ardingly have fallen into grave mistake have treated wife a negligible quantity whereas hardly anybody be negligible quantity certainly not be by way at present be considering career now if marie find out either while be still not yet in cabinet even after before have made clearly felt to be indispensable go for if middle class get hold of scandal about minister not yet proven that man be beyond hope can not weather storm middle class who be after people distrust public measure because disapprove of private life idiotic on part observed jack doubt cause of success be to estimate correctly to take advantage of idiocy of others none of be clever in way napoleon be clever can do be to be slightly le idiotic than rest of mankind now must go have hundred thing to do thousand people to see if can be of further help to let know jack got up then paused indecisive mean will tell marie asked if wish to

asked lady ardingly person asked to wait in drawing room lady ardingly laughed never minded being found out so be said meet her on stair oh be not fool said jack almost with gaiety may be true take own wisdom a working hypothesis said that immovable woman after have left lady ardingly proceeded to take maximum exercise for day consisted in walking four time up down long gallery of portrait ran by reception room be nearly hundred yard in length a stopped once to swallow small digestive pill be presented to with wine glass of water by maid be nearly ten minute before returned to room sent message that person who be waiting must be shown up interval sufficed to pull auburn wig straight settle with back to light mildred be more accustomed to be waited for than to wait lady ardingly message that wished to see at period of inaction in drawing room have improved naturally irritable temper determination in fact when tardy summons came be to be very effusive full of engagement delighted to see how well be looking such pleasure must go attitude lady ardingly often rubbed up wrong way more often gave advice when be cool knew to be right conjectured if more that subject be going to be discussed be jack be more than half decided not to discus in mind in fact labelled lady ardingly a impotent old meddler thus entered ah dear said lady ardingly have be kept waiting be afraid be idiotic footman who thought be engaged did not tell be here how be mildred mildred sat down dress rustled incredulously driven said simply driven how foolish one be to make hundred engagement day not enjoy because one be always thinking about next yes very foolish said lady ardingly especially when one doe not enjoy now tell news dear mildred go out see nobody be always everywhere never saw woman who sat in mainspring so much tell about everybody insensibly mildred felt mollified knew perfectly well that though lady ardingly did not rush about to see everybody be only because everybody rushed about to see still there be to faint aroma of compliment about speech disentangled misshapen yorkshire terrier from muff who for instance said now jack be friend of yours know of of ours said lady ardingly with intonation far more confirmatory than correcting yes such dear be well people have be talking about a possibly going to war office dear jack can scarcely imagine there yes be interesting said lady ardingly so mean to take up politics quite seriously be glad have urged to do that have used influence with in direction mildred continued to melt yes jack really have great talent said know about gun smokeless powder sort of thing believe there be craze just now for people managing department of know something quite new be ah mean ardingly said other how cruel of liquefaction progressed dear lady ardingly said mildred how can say such thing of course did not mean anything of sort seriously think that jack must do well at war office oh be not fool be necessary that must have wife doe one count marie alston a wife do think mildred frowned quite naturally lady ardingly though accustomed to find manoeuvre successful be almost surprised at success of reminds said wonder whether have heard there be going about horrid horrid scandal about marie started a far a know in bridge club 'deuce of spade be not well there one afternoon about ten day ago silly billy remarked that snowflake have melted referring to matter everybody knew what meant jack a happened be in room at time be not awful have gone over london lady ardingly sat up in chair with deliberation that characterized movement took cigarette from tray lighted quite slowly without replying be time felt to begin taking rib out of poor umbrella yes heard something of said somebody told something gathered that did not quite originate there heard in fact dear mildred that driving to concert other day put notion into silly billy head know who can have told that replied silly billy did oh grant that be guarantee at for truth never see reason to believe what silly billy say must now reckon with story a stand a reached in fact namely that told story very indiscreetly repeated in jack hearing who know world so well know that people will not care if be true will only repeat a reached a reached believe story to be true exclaimed mildred completely off guard ah so did tell story then a heard be substantially correct poor silly billy how annoyed must be if knew that have be detected telling truth must be deeply humiliating to however let mind be particularly insignificant now dear mildred why did put into head not that matter why anyhow be not nice of did not intend to be said mildred now be talking sensibly quarrelled with wanted to annoy suppose be possible that see that in annoying be injuring jack with hand in what way perhaps know that jim spencer be standing for east surrey constituency a liberal where be freshfield alstons place have never be there understand be in east surrey conservative magnate wife have intrigue with liberal candidate said only just now to lady ardingly paused moment to myself how damaging for jack how completely fatal for jack there be short silence lady ardingly continued with driest deliberation of course have not heard that jim spencer be standing for division there be nothing so dangerous a complete absence of knowledge be who started that scandal be lucky for be such silly one if have be little cleverer might have damaged irretrievably there be lot of story began mildred thousand not of damaging kind if have said be having intrigue say with emperor of russia must have hurt nobody not even emperor never mind dear thing be done must consider how can make best of scandal be always dangerous thing to touch if one denies afterwards if even inventor who belief to be true how ridiculous too of dear mildred denies there will always be people who think that denial merely confirms in case be peculiarly complicated great thing be that whole invention be so silly from start must have thought dear mildred that have better imagination have not be not fault can not help what will do do think old woman be not so impotent a mildred have hoped have be accustomed to consider fairly wide awake appeared that waking moment be somnolence personified to lady ardingly know said feebly then will tell said lady ardingly start scandal be so good at about jim spencer nothing circumstantial only let be in air let people say thing there be nothing easier then will appear also that have broken with jack tell will not injure married man be open to damaging scandal in two way one through one through wife in jack case dear door be flung wide lady brereton enters through trumpeting like like elephant lady ardingly nodded head at mildred with air of nurse scolding refractory child now look so disconsolate dear went on observing mildred face falling a barometer fall before cyclone just bestir must really in future consult somebody before embark on effort have dug bottomless well so may say at foot of ladder by friend jack be preparing to mount there be room just room to get on to still there be only one way of

whose step maud have noticed be marked by sort of drowsy cumbersomeness like people who be walking about dark room soon crisp step paused began to retrace left gravel for grass in moment anthony maxwell came round lilac bush maud did not feel in least surprised unconscious self have probably guessed who be rose from sitting position on hammock gave word gesture of greeting came down on motor car said be particularly hot may sit here little while get cool by mean said maud then after pause do think be right of to come said think anything about said have to maud hardened retreated into mean suppose that mother insisted on said with cold resentment in voice mother doe not know have come said must have told thought must probably have forbidden indeed must not said maud must certainly have encouraged must have be just a bad said anthony suddenly maud felt stimulated during fortnight gardener dog have said anything so interesting sat down again must like to explain that said without confessing to herself explanation be unnecessary that wished to hear explain be sure said quite be then said have be put in false position have be urged to marry other have refused have not be fair on of in spite of pressure have be put upon have refused in spite of pressure put upon want nothing else in world that must marry mind quite sympathize with for if there be anything in world must make one wish never to see person again be to have person persistently hurled at one have be hurled at be one of reason why came here to tell that sympathize with be afraid people have made uncommon nuisance to anthony paused raised eye moment saw that maud be looking at steadily with grave consideration in face felt rightly that never before have given such favourable attention be not such coxcomb a to suppose that must have given different answer if have not quite naturally be 'put off ' by way in have be treated continued do ask to remember have scarcely have fair chance please try to think that have not be fault have be mother said maud yes have be fault suppose thought that continued perseverance must have effect may may not have have opposite effect to what intended certainly not that have have opposite effect said maud be sure be now can try banish from mind will try anthony again looked at heart hammered against rib even though scarcely felt master of did not lose wisdom press point further hope to win said by making importunate perhaps now think of be not wise of to come be not sorry came do give up hope very likely that be presumptuous of for be sure that will not change sat on ground playing with ear of one of dog a said last word finger made sudden violent movement dog whimpered there there said fell to stroking again quietly said that be one of reason why came said maud what be other there be only one other wanted to see be drawn by cord said poor mr anthony said very quietly there be shade of irony in voice thank for that said maud lifted foot off ground swung gently to fro in hammock be naturally very reserved in matter of emotion still extraordinarily ignorant must have puzzled to say exactly what felt now be tearing violent emotion storm rather strong serene press of flowing tide hitherto human race whether considered individually collectively have not much occupied something now within quickened stirred moved be certainly at moment not indifferent to plain young man who be so modest so self assured there be more about to be learned than have known book just opening promised to interest her of passion felt touch poor mr anthony have contained authentic pity be quite right said various advantage have be constantly told by mother thing seemed to such excellent cause why must marry seemed to to be very bad cause indeed be represented to a most urgent did not find so paused anthony said nothing feeling that further word be on lip like said at length come have tea moment have said be afraid that must do something stupid look fervent even seize hand need not have be afraid anthony rose at once oh do let have tea said be longing for be relief be great be stupid of said wo have whisky soda must be awfully thirsty must prefer tea thanks said hate drink at odd time how lovely garden look yes be still rather backward chestnut flower must be out by now be still hardly budding how can remember that oh if one take interest in thing be difficult to forget about said maud be perfectly true remarked anthony soon after tea left again took white riband of bath road back into london must not help telling that have prospered beyond expectation if have be a have told maud not hopeless before be may be supposed on sunny side of hope now intended to stop once for risk of mismanagement on part of others having reached home went straight to mother room have be down to windsor said have tea with maud brereton alone have got spark of proper pride anthony said mother with heat to go dangling mooning after girl who be refused flat wonder what set up to be think set up to be said anthony be rather rare like want to manage own affair in own way particularly wish lady brereton not to say word more of kind to maud must like to tell so if have opportunity why be sure be be a eager a anybody said lady maxwell will not succeed with because mother wish said anthony will play hand alone please in london in meantime fact that maud have refused have become generally known london with admirable substitute for altruism be so characteristic of consists in vividly concerning one self with thing in least concern one have be very voluble on subject there be scarcely divergence in view expressed everybody be agreed that be terrible thing for poor mildred to find have for daughter so obstinate wrong headed girl why maxwell roll dear simply roll of course maud be wonderfully good looking doubt lot of other men will be after why not have accepted anthony provisionally be always so easy to let be understood if anything else turned up that young girl like have known own mind on top of there leaked out fact that marie alston have strongly dissuaded from world with agility restlessness of monkey leaped to new topic really marie be getting little too strong be very well to scatter amusing general criticism on people in general take unworldly pose when came to putting finger in wheel of society watch so to speak stopping from turning be too much how on earth be struggling mother to hope to get daughter happily yes happily married if idealistic snowflake be ready to descend upon at street corner forbid banns over society grinned showed teeth for little while then be off again on fresh tack how must mildred behave to marie here there be wheel within wheel upshot be that society be not at sure that there have not be break on one side other between jack given that certain thing have come to marie ear must account for everything what ingenious revenge too on marie part really be person of brain required cool thinking to hit upon riposte like after sensation came hard on heel of sensation mildred began to be mentioned in same breath a jim spencer far more remarkable jack began to be mentioned in same breath a wife have dined out together twice last week have be together to party after party how curious interesting complete resorting of card without fuss honour a usual in marie hand in one partie have recaptured husband shunted off admirer on to mildred scored heavily against time with nose in air a unapproachable distinguished a ever meanwhile lady ardingly sat like spider in middle of web thread have extended farther than even have originally planned did not object in least to when people came told news be le severe than usual ah dear must say how fly about gather honey sort of curious other thing sit here never know anything except what be good enough to come tell so jack be amourache again of wife so charming be not let play bridge immediately mildred however did not think that thing be quite so satisfactory at first idea of jack marie darby joaning together sent into fit of laughter after week so joke began to lose point to state more accurately point became rather too sharp for liking jack have settled that be to see le of other not give ground for people to say behind back what be perfectly absolutely true have not bargained for return to intimacy between husband wife once have approached jack on subject be very realistic have said have great respect for detail to what be referring asked oh be stupid be taking part very seriously see nothing of be right be necessary to bore quite so much with marie bore have said bore then try not to do said jack with curdling equanimity what be driving at do want to mourn for to watch shadow on blind must be rather unconvincing to other people must not must say be tired of jack considered want to say anything about at answered again sense of imperfect grip haunted woman sense of having be talking to cook man be sum of mildred discomfort have amiably proposed not long ago to break with marie now that opportunity be ripe felt simply unable to do so there be deficiency of force in moral immoral matter not be unable to stand up to other also be dimly aware that people in general be watching looking at rather a have done when now year ago hair have turned golden in single night now

sunset of auburn hair perched negligently on top mouth seemed to crack little by way of recognition passed in flash of winking lacquer marie driving with jack penultimate meeting be most surprising did really think mildred indeed marie be sort of woman to stand menage trois especially when one of three be wife then like earthquake wave laden with dead slime of stirred depth sense of own impotence came over only fortnight ago have airily told jack that be glad that concealment be at end that must now break with marie what if something else be at end what if revolt at menage trois be altogether ill founded out of three people there be two mathematically possible arrangement deux in case one must have to be left out have put up veil at moment something line like crossed field of
