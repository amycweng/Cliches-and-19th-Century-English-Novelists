built dam impedes course of flowing water till find way round through stream of wheel horse pedestrian scuttled in out like bolted rabbit whole tide of movement be at height little island in mid street be crowded with folk who be cut off must seem by rising flood water from communication with shore with remote chance of escape then omnipotent policeman stepped out into surging traffic held up compelling resistless hand at gesture tide more obedient to than to canute ceased to flow cross movement began permitted daisy cousin to cross stream whether be that stoppage in passage made corresponding halt in thought whether a be more likely have said that meant to say on subject of lord lindfield began just a started to move again on something widely different aunt jeannie come to morrow said be quite delightful for do believe have missed single day since went away year ago if do that may depend upon that be very nice indeed a rule like people very much when be there get along excellently without when be not quite quite true said gladys with touch of acidity be much most sensible plan continued daisy perceiving completely ignoring tone doe good to miss people a say seldom

marry if be fifty be forty three just now said gladys yes being with have made grow older very quickly said daisy gladys laughed with daisy be very true that c'est le ton qui fait la musique same word in tone must have wounded now merely amused have taken long time to get used so to speak to brilliant vivid friend who turned engaging smile on world in general shone with supreme impartiality on wicked good to know a knew now with greater thoroughness than knew ethically if gladys have be put to question on oath must have have to give most unsatisfactory account of friend to sum up question in one must have come to that believed daisy to be quite heartless humanly there be in daisy much to take place of profound organ have joy of life interest in life to supreme degree though resolutely turned back on anything disagreeable ugly peremptory dismissal of such thing be more than made up for by unbounded welcome of pleased have only to please be very ready to be pleased poured sunlight on gladys who be naturally rather shy rather slow to make friend rather reticent soon grasped essential fact about daisy having grasped held tightly to felt must not readily go to daisy if be in trouble there be one to whom must hurry with such certainty of welcome if be happy though doubt sympathy to be complete must feel for sorrow a keenly a feel for joy yet nature feel keenly for joy turn back on sorrow be perhaps quite a fine one a though may be excellent comforter be rather of nature of wet blanket when happy soul appeal to for sympathy on joy whether own that of daisy never turned back delighted in happiness of others chapter ii daisy father mother have died when be quite young not yet half way through momentous teen for seven year after have lived with mother sister inimitable aunt jeannie whom wished to see day though have passed seven year with have barely seen aunt husband be death year ago have sent to nottinghams for aunt jeannie in crisis of nerve have be ordered abroad for year be now on point of return having returned be to stay with lady nottingham for indefinite period may be taken up by finding of suitable house daisy knew there have be trouble at back of uncle francis aunt jeannie husband have be called invalid gathered that ill health be something not to be openly alluded to morphia be connected with habit be connected with since be somehow disagreeable have long ago so successfully banished from thought that curiosity about be thing without existence certainly made aunt jeannie very unhappy aunt jeannie who be such dear so young still not more than thirty for be youngest of family of whom daisy mother be eldest have be always sedulous to hide disquietude from niece be entirely characteristic of daisy to be grateful for having hid from not even in thought to conjecture what be about during year of separation from aunt jeannie in a have said daisy with fault limitation be george washington for truth have missed day have always looked forward to return though liked being with lady nottingham very much knew that must ultimately go back to unrivalled other aunt again with intensest satisfaction of late prospect of going back living with aunt at have receded into at least middle distance there be doubt in own mind though liked absence of doubt to be endorsed by cousin that lord lindfield have be extremely attentive to for last month so have committed dreadful social crime such a throwing over engagement already made nearly due when found that must be at house to be subsequently invited somehow be charm of part though upset dinner table right left nobody really minded match making london includes larger part of marriageable city even when be personally affronted inconvenienced smiled sympathetically when heard what movement on night ought to have dined with have be did even worse than that have once indeed omitted to send excuse of subsequent engagement everybody have waited quarter of hour for to put in belated appearance when did not hostess have remarked that must be picking daisy procession have gone dinner ward with widowed girl turned out to be true did conjecture of hostess have dined quietly that night at lady nottingham have played old maid afterwards a bridge be universally voted to be far too intellectual daisy took huge pleasure in such fact a stealthily conveyed to by one if not more of innumerable girl friend for though there be doubt that many dutiful mother must have liked daughter to marry lord lindfield yet when declared by sign a unmistakable a felt communicated ill humour be picking daisy very well sooner plucked particular one better daisy be so pleasant wonder after that wished for too quite soon must join rank of match maker be immensely kind to everybody else yet if only katie elsie nellie be use thinking about daisy once settled must certainly do best for to whom fortune must pay subsequent visit lady nottingham purred approval over girl on punctual return before of guest have arrived be rather stout very comfortable behind stoutness comfort there beat heart of gold extremely acute brain be not always allowed for be alert watchful heart of gold be considered a not incompatible with comfort stoutness nobody who have not come to grip with be ally in affair called for diplomacy tact knew how excessively efficient brain be have too supreme gift of only sending into action a much of a be required to do work never made elaborate plan when something simple must do a well combined to make not only character be lovable friend whose wisdom might be depended on daisy be eminently right in valuing aunt counsel advice sought indeed evening in quiet half hour intervened between departure of tea party guest time when be necessary to dress for dinner lady nottingham be resting in room when daisy went to ostensibly quite truly to get list of who be coming to dinner night in order to arrange table though must have gone there in case for reason far more essential one lay behind wanted indeed to get aunt opinion on point have talked to gladys about afternoon sound a to opinion about lord lindfield sorting of people to see who must take whom in to dinner with abstracted frownings over map of table seemed to daisy admirable accompaniment for disjointed question one must give adventitious advantage since at moment must be absorbed in task be so kindly occupying with be silent over if reply be in way inconvenient sort of diplomacy though not exactly habitual with daisy seemed to sufficiently acute blinding sat on floor with peerage list of guest sheet of paper pencil began at once while lady nottingham rested on sofa against daisy leant back oh what nice people said daisy ca take in willie carton jimmie lord lindfield mr braithwaite lord pately dear willie suppose ought to take in do mind whether sit at end of table in middle of middle aunt alice middle of middle always work out more easily all right dear willie diplomat who be known to be diplomat be at once under heavy handicap daisy be instantly detected lady nottingham since there be direct question to reply to preserved silence then after sufficient pause asked have settled about willie dear ye e will be better if take gladys in then be settled for said lady nottingham turning over page in book did not suit daisy have meant to make aunt alice ask leading question instead of only gave most prosaic answer sighed poor willie said aunt alice laughed quietly comfortably dearest daisy said a want to tell about willie why do so suppose want to ask instead very well make difference imagine have proposed again to that have refused want to be quite sure think be wise about see said 'dear willie first 'poor willie ' afterwards what other inference must reasonable woman like draw if have wanted to talk about must have said one other have better begin daisy laughed think be witch said oh one moment table be coming right yes at end lord lindfield on left said lady nottingham without looking up be end of daisy diplomacy must have be burnt at stake two hundred year ago darling aunt alice said must have helped to pile faggot what good thing be born earlier said then for moment thought intently what wanted to say next required consideration daisy dear said wanted to talk to also if have not be so very diplomatic must have begun oh wish have waited said daisy yes make difference what want be advice to a to whether must accept lord lindfield quite agree with that be going to propose to otherwise have be flirting with disgracefully have never known flirt with girl before lady nottingham put book quite completely down wanted to convey certain thing quite clearly without grossness now daisy be very young said in way be extremely grown up mean think know own mind very well wish very much that aunt jeannie have come back sooner because be about nine time a wise a must have advised instead of a be since think may have to settle very important question day have got to give best advice can think will propose to a said day indeed feel quite certain of else must be abominable in to talk to about at therefore do make up mind before doe say when doe that be not sure that must take time to consider there be reason why girl must not say 'yes ' at once unless question come a entire surprise doe not do except in second rate novel like one lady nottingham dropped condemned volume on floor in real life said girl see long before man proposes whether be likely to do so must know quite well what be going to say think intend to say 'yes must however be quite sure that a far a can tell be making wise choice now be not going to shock very likely be going to make think be shocked be not really fact be be not in love with attracts with attraction be very often in same relation to love a bud be to flower have sort of attraction for often contains folded immature petal of full flower wanted to ask series of question must lead up to answer then wanted to ask one further question be whether be enough to say 'yes on answer to be 'yes ' diplomacy in daisy be quite completely dead so easy to mature woman seemed sort of conjuring trick to be thought reading of most advanced kind reading of thought that have not consciously formulated soothsayer proceeded have seen advantage of such marriage clearly enough be ambitious dear want to have big position to have big house plenty of money to take thought of material morrow be advantage be only stupid people who call stupidity unworldly who think otherwise great point be not to keep 'to morrow ' comfortable to keep everlasting 'to day must be sure of year bring heaven know what will bring must feel now when consider whether will accept not that can bring difference to must be unable to conceive of at seventy a different from now with regard to what be music hall song have be together now for forty year express exactly what girl must feel forty year before now for thing more difficult to say lord lindfield have have knocked about good deal sooner later will know be infinitely better that must know sooner for seems to almost criminal that girl must be left to find sort of thing out for when be too late mind say that will knock about again fact that be quite certainly intending to propose to show that doe not mean to be not bringing boy first love to girl lady nottingham leant forward stroked daisy head dear how brutal must sound said be least brutal of woman assure of have told there be to tell a far a know must have blamed if have told le here be hendon be time for to dress daisy got up kissed aunt with quick trembling caress think be perfect darling said chapter iii dover boat midday service be on point of starting from quay at calais luggage be

guess at underlying tragedy for daisy year have be in seedtime of life mr halton rightly wrongly quite firmly believed that young year of who be to become men woman be best spent if during can be brought to learn joy of life while possible tragedy be kept a far from a may be for in general habit of joy be best weapon with to fight sorrow when sorrow come to expect best of everything everybody

ministration owes return of health removal of fever while lasted came between whole world making thing strange unreal then just for moment little shudder passed over a thought of sharp edged shining street of paris through have passed with downcast averted eye that morning going straight from station to station hating moment of passage be hard to forgive paris for association held for of certain fortnight be hard to believe even now that bitter miserable hour contained more than pain by be necessary that dear erring soul must be taught lesson at heart did not doubt that though must not

nothing to say made very substantial job of yet time be talking with reservation having clearly made up mind not to mention lord lindfield name felt sure if did aunt jeannie must see that mentioned somehow differently from way in mentioned others first moment of meeting for sincerity of joy to see struck a not suitable for confidence reason why wanted hour with said be that be dining out to

canary well will be old maid with canary will instantly sell because make such row do think might talk about something else be scarcely necessary for daisy to add last sentence for without pause proceeded to do so at back of mind mr halton felt that there be something behind since daisy clearly did not desire to speak of must be committing crime almost unpardonable between friend of attempting to force confidence if showed slightest eagerness to hear more even let manner betray that thought there be more to be heard besides have own secret from daisy must be meanness to deny to others liberty claimed lady nottingham came in soon after before long two girl have to go dress for dinner daisy in highest spirit rushed in again to say good night to aunt before starting ravishing

like child of israel here be jove have taken off hat stood bare headed a handed out of cab exposing that fascinating greyness above temple daisy have spoken of face clean shaven so bubblingly good humoured that criticism of feature be futile appeared below reader of character might easily guess that if once that bubbling good humour be expunged something rather serious awkward might be left good humour seemed ineradicable one must picture face without in other respect be very broad of sufficient height to carry off breadth without giving appearance of being short broken front tooth often exposed by laughter completed general irregularity of face fascinating greyness be accompanied by tendency to high forehead due probably to incipient baldness rather than to abnormal intellectual development know what jove have got to do with said daisy if be responsible think be delightful of be glad be here thought be going into wilderness too oh think have met cousin have met gladys about hundred time so daisy be quite right shook hand gravely that ceremony over turned to daisy again without pause dance too be there said sha know soul never do do dance with sometimes out of pity sake

appreciative sigh think be nicest story said be true oh jeannie be match maker be so pleasant to be forestalled asked down to bray simply in order to promote now find have be promoted already punt will be useful same jeannie joined friend in window seat yes just same said chapter vii there be silence for little while hour have passed since began to talk be still short of midnight hansom motor still swept about square like throng of sonorous firefly just opposite big house flared with lit window sound of band came loudly across open space little mellowed by distance with rhythm of music intact oh must get into ball dress go dance now for lightness of heart said jeannie wo will do something much nicer be will hear from news of year now be 'you next tell have done be thought of then will want to know about gladys about daisy talked to daisy rather talked to for hour afternoon think got absolutely 'home ' in talk have impression that be showing dining room drawing room so to speak

private have got to be now dear alice about first alice sighed again not appreciatively time there be very little to say be rather lazier than be daisy gladys daisy chiefly make arrangement send out to dance alone because always find chaperon of kind know jeannie like hot room supper weave plenty of plan still mostly come off go to superintend execution of think have very private life if have must at once be admitted think great deal about people like best try occasionally to straighten out affair for want girl to marry suitable men men to marry suitable girl think indeed that only change in have be that take rather wider view than used to of word suitable see be optimist ca help believe that most people be kind nice oh say that be not great fun being critical seeing absurdity fault fancy that if one want to increase sum of comfort happiness in world be better to spend one time in trying to see charm virtue dear what dreadful commonplace be saying however be very truthful history for last year want to make people jolly comfortable happy if possible without standing about in extremely hot room with band playing into one ear at distance of three inch jeannie laughed think be at bad history said be just sort of history hope will be written of by by oh alice want more trouble crisis even if be good for one sometimes wonder if there be envious power be always on look out nemesis with dreadful wooden eye that wait till be happy then put out great bony hand knock over squeeze till scream 'oh nemesis ' feel inclined to say 'do look other way for little bit yes just want nemesis to leave friend alone for little ah nemesis be looking other way with great fixedness seems to said lady nottingham may be dabbing away at other people must be just jeannie have be dabbing at of lately oh hush say so loud said jeannie may hear turn round alice laughed such thing said nemesis will certainly send headache feeling of being tired to morrow morning if sit up talking to longer half rose jeannie pulled back into window seat again oh go yet said be not least tired be so dull going to bed hoard pleasant hour make last a long a possible surely can lengthen out one for little more besides have not told one word about daisy yet a said though have hour talk with feel a if have taken into room private history gave be that willie carton still wanted to marry still did not want to marry lady nottingham considered for moment in silence wondering whether a daisy have not spoken to aunt about lord lindfield be under tacit bond of secrecy scrupulous though be must not see cause for secrecy jeannie interrupted silence be there somebody else said again lady nottingham thought over ca see why must tell said since half london know be waiting quite sympathetically agreeably for to ask consulted about only afternoon think when doe say if because feel sure will think that when doe will accept advised to think agreed name ah perhaps daisy want to tell name interrupted jeannie again perhaps want to keep a surprise for tell name alice tell about though not enough to enable to guess tell about daisy feeling towards somehow think girl must need advice must know for think not always sometimes of course girl be definitely even desperately in love with man before marries jeannie how often be other way like think will be kind to want to be married have reason for marrying except of being in love such marriage so often turn out so well even turn out ideally own did in circumstance think girl be right to ask advice jeannie smiled think yours be admirably sensible view dear said confess freely that there be heap to be said for be afraid be not sensible over thing like love think sense ought to be banished so do lower class think remarked lady nottingham rather acutely consequence be that gravest problem have ever faced nation have arisen oh take be not one of unemployed said jeannie be top end of oh go on dear tell about said jeannie well be rich suppose might say very rich have title have old honoured name oh want something more important than said jeannie old honoured name be very well be continuing to make honoured to be honoured be far more to point than having century full of honoured ancestor be satisfactory can easily forgive ancestor for being unsatisfactory be sure be good fellow said lady nottingham jeannie got up began walking up down room do know be such ambiguous phrase said man be good fellow who eats lot laugh lot flirt lot be that sort of good fellow oh hate milksop need tell that there be plenty of good fellow whom must be sorry to see daisy married to there have started up in jeannie mind that memory of paris have made hurry through away from town there have started up in mind also that have be so hard to get over in autumn that of have spoken to alice nottingham only to tell that hoped must never speak of two be connected be more than connected for be same now fear fantastic perhaps definite grew in mind once again thing be to be made vivid to pas into currency be that sort of good fellow asked there be trouble in voice anxiety lady nottingham be startled be a if ghost have come into room visible to jeannie answer must not be put off postponed something trouble dear said ca guess what yes be that sort of good fellow suppose think generalize too much when class together judge harshly can not man have to use cant phrase have sown wild oat have done with mind know nothing definite about wild oat before now have be matter of gossip that have be very very susceptible woman find charming be disgusting doubt fully believe have done with such thing be not to have chance in winning girl like daisy becoming model husband father judge harshly jeannie paused in walk opposite friend stood looking out into warm soft night yes perhaps judge harshly said because know what awful harm man of sort can do be thinking of what man of sort did do be worse than others daresay be most emphatically good fellow woman concerned in be one knew loved so ca forgive kind have known lot of men of kind have found agreeable well bred rest of without doubt many of settle down become model husband model father be sorry be sorry if only daisy have cared for willie carton doe not love man say attracts interest find great pleasure in company want to marry be not what must call worldly woman jeannie think be wise be excellent match in spite of what say about so called 'good fellow be good fellow jeannie face have grown suddenly rather white tired felt a if nemesis be slowly turning round in direction again sat down by dressing table drummed finger on yes doubt judge harshly repeated doubt also there be particular fear in brain quite fantastic probably quite without foundation have 'good fellow ' in mind whose whose fellow proceeding touched very acutely want therefore to know name of man ca help if daisy want to be surprise for must be disappointed see what fear be that two be same so tell name alice there be something so desperately serious in tone that lady nottingham did not think of reassuring out of fear answered at once lord lindfield said drumming of jeannie finger on table ceased sat quite still looking out in front of lord lindfield asked tom lindfield yes jeannie got up then thank heaven doe love said be quite impossible that must marry since began to tell about

tired said jeannie be just sending aunt alice away must go away too be dear of just to look in to say good night when two have gone jeannie sat down again in window head resting on hand thinking vividly intently thank heaven doe not love said at length chapter viii geography of breakfast at lady nottingham be vague shifting sometimes happened in dining room sometimes rather oftener little of happened there took place instead of on continent in scattered island of bedroom gladys however be generally faithful to continent often a happened next morning breakfasted there alone while tray be carried swiftly upstairs to bedroom of others alone of inmate of house have slept well that night always slept well even if have toothache daisy have not slept at well must be nearer mark indeed to say that have not even lain awake at well have tossed tumbled in manner unprecedented there be wonder that be unprecedented since caused have not occurred before to have left dance quite early dragging gladys away because have got something to think about absorbed have never be really absorbed before though be chronic condition with to be intensely violently interested in superficial manner went deeper from spring of nature now there came forth something bitter sweet tinged thought consciousness in herself a lay awake night hearing gradual diminuendo of noise of traffic outside till when thought there must be hush crescendo of work of coming day began felt doubt a to what be absorbed kept sleep so far aloof from eyelid have started from a small beginning a fire devastates city reducing to desolation blackened ash careless passenger have thrown away stump of cigarette match not entirely extinguished near inflammable material be from other cause than before long wall of tallest building totter sway fall night be turned to hell of burning flame not yet to have come wholesale burning there be not yet involved in nature something have caught fire at few word of lord lindfield heat fever have begun well knew what be that ailed hitherto love be thing be stranger to though be stranger to intense impulsive affection like felt for aunt jeannie how mysterious unaccountable be seemed to that phenomenon known a love at first sight of have read be thing far le to be wondered at there girl meet one have not seen before whom find hold for potent spell must be easily understood new force with come in contact instantly exercise power on daisy have come across man hundred time now suddenly without apparent cause who thought knew so well must appraise weigh settle in own mind a have done after talk to lady afternoon before whether must speak word for rest of life must make fate destiny fashion manner of night day found that in moment change of vital import have come in turn on so that looked on with eye of other vision thought of in way a yet undreamt of be disquieting unsettling be a if house in dwelt own mind body have thought so well founded securely built be suddenly shaken a by earthquake shock realized with touch of panic fear that outside yet knit into very soul be force unmanifested a yet might prove to be of dominant potency then suddenly mood changed power be frightening no longer be wholly benignant life giving be not earthquake shock have frightened be first beam of new rising sun have struck on to darkness of world in have lived till now be smitten by first beam from springing east who have never known before what morning be how fair be light pours on to world morning beam be for have not struck fortuitously shedding light on others without choice have come to shine into window choosing above others be that first beam sought came to gild glorify house body mind place where soul dwelt how blind have be there be difference in difference have be in alone have sat with sealed eye at window at most with eye must see shadow not sun now saw sun only there be shadow for shadow have be own blindness dawn be in sky outside here in quiet white curtained room dawn have come not quiet with gleam of sun alternating with cloud tempest making beholder wonder what day must bring forth aunt jeannie too have lain long awake when sleep came came deeply dreamlessly demanding repair of two night in train agitation of talk have given order that be not to be called till rang when woke sun be already high square outside lively with passenger traffic be with sense of coming trial trouble if not quite of disaster that woke be disaster have to avert have to think scheme have known of daisy sleepless night cause of must have felt that anchor prevented situation drifting into disaster have be torn up for anchor be belief a lady nottingham have told that daisy be not in love with tom lindfield by one of fate little irony at very moment when be comforting last night with thought be true no longer sleep have quite restored giving vigour to body power of cool reflection to brain when victor came according to promise to see during morning there be hint of trouble in welcome of did guess that disquieting news have reached conclusion though not actually true be justly drawn for peace sense of security felt in presence be of kind that nothing else except danger disaster to must disturb be very tender very real part of nature be troubled trouble did not reach down into depth did mean to speak of trouble to at promise have be made by to keep a secret a must be hitherto secret have be completely kept have passed lip of none of few who knew to day must be obliged to speak of to alice for plan to avert disaster be already half formed dared not embark on alone without counsel from for utterly unlooked for stroke of fate supreme in irony that daisy must be meditating marriage with one man in world whom be utterly impossible that must marry have fallen at cost event must be averted chapter ix two girl a have be already arranged set off during morning for river side house at bray where must be joined next day by lady nottingham rest of party aunt jeannie returning home shortly before lunch found that daisy gladys have already gone that hour for consultation with friend be come for situation admitted of delay in sky till yesterday have be of dazzling clearness incomparable serenity there have suddenly formed thunder cloud so to speak hard imminent menacing be necessary immediately necessary such be image under situation presented to mind to put up lightning conductor over daisy room be nature of thunder cloud that have now to make known to lady nottingham that done between have to devise lightning conductor approve erect one have already designed in mind during sleepless hour of night before be of strange design hardly knew if have skill to forge for forging have to be done by lunched together immediately afterwards went to lady nottingham sitting room where must be undisturbed for have given order neither most urgent of telephone most intimate of caller be to be admitted drank coffee in silence then jeannie got up have got to tell alice said about only yesterday said hoped must never be obliged to speak of to anybody suppose envious fate heard certainly word be scarcely out of mouth before necessity arose have got to tell about be that last autumn be harder for to get over think than have be through only yesterday believed to be dead believed to be at most memory from time have already taken bitterness be completely signally wrong be dead no longer be terribly alive for have have resurrection must convert sadducee be connected with reason why daisy can never marry tom lindfield be more than connected with be reason jeannie have begun to speak standing by fireplace facing full light of window here moved wheeling chair with back to light sat down in wanted to be voice more mere chronicle of few hard dry irrevocable fact thing have happened must not be altered softened there be comment interpretation to be made have just to utter alice nottingham have just to hear may have to give time dear said for will be a much a can do be afraid just to get through with telling of yes be already frightening know do on purpose because want to prepare for story must shock disturb very much wondered last night whether must manage without telling whether must spare hearing find ca ca act alone in on own responsibility perhaps may be able to think of plan will make mine unnecessary must give great deal for to happen plan must be made carried out something have to be done covered face with hand for moment then took away spoke slowly carefully so that there might be need for further explanation of what said of course remember diana daisy sister said though must remember more a name than a person for think never knew at well married very early know married that nice frenchman monsieur dupre after lived abroad till time of death fact of will certainly remember though be now year since happened where be yes then diana died in five year ago so at least be told at time be in of daisy believed that diana died jeannie gave long sigh story of why daisy can not marry tom lindfield have begun dear alice said for diana did not die then lived for four year after died last autumn only in arm thank god thank god dear that died thank god be with there be one else not husband even alice nottingham turned on face be puzzled be beginning to get frightened what doe mean said be very disquieting very strange what doe lead to daisy tom lindfield be telling a shortly a can said jeannie interrupt dear be last autumn died not five year ago a have supposed five year ago be be found out if understand be found to have be living with man not husband learned that forgave for adored with tender unwavering devotion be very rare be to like child who have be naughty must be forgiven then in few week only after fell again even then did not divorce make bear shame publicity of what have done simply let go jeannie be still speaking slowly quietly a if reading out report have to be mastered by friend on word let go voice trembled little then again recaptured completeness of self control whether be wise not said whether might not have be better if have let diana bear punishment human law have ordained for poor thing who behave a behaved need not inquire need tell detail of how be managed learned from diana so few week before died last year be sufficient for to say that left home near amiens together ostensibly for long foreign travel after week sent home news of sudden death sent news also to in england be told daisy be told diana poor poor diana went lived in paris again bravely suppressed emotion made jeannie voice to quiver be what mean when said that m dupre let go said often think be barbarous kindness must not live with more fact that loved so much made that impossible have to divorce let vanish into glittering crowd of who who be made like that chose latter accounted for disappearance by news sent to amiens sent to in england that have died so five year ago diana went to paris for time lived not with man who have taken from husband with during married life have lived in beautiful country house of near amiens seldom going to paris one apparently ever found out who really be then again jeannie paused paused long time before spoke put hand over eye a if to shut out dreadful vision then left that man said lived with know know daisy also be a if lady nottingham have caught sight of made jeannie cover eye for winced drew back said ca bear that please jeannie at sound of beseeching voice jeannie recovered self control be wanted alice wanted for comfort oh dear must not be afraid said have to face fact not be afraid of do best see how can arrest alter train of consequence be tom lindfield again paused again continued speaking quietly knew nothing of till little over year ago said for even a m dupre have wished to spare diana shame publicity so suppose wished to spare knowledge of what diana have done be thus that daisy knew anything of think perhaps ought to have told told anyhow did not be of use to think what must have done if have rather more than year ago diana wrote to wrote pitiful heart breaking letter thought at first must be grim practical joke though must not imagine who have played so cruel trick why trick have be played at be diana handwriting enclosed photograph of herself have now be impossible to mistake that nothing must mar beauty then be signed dated in own hand wrote to say that have be ill that be getting rapidly worse be of consumption perhaps remember that mother died wanted to know if must come to wanted to tell everything thank god wanted so be there that went when left england last year stayed with till died in little gilded flat during month told everything be long story alice be set to one shameful tune be not shocked that must have made being with quite useless to begin with also did not feel inclined to be shocked be so like child child have gone wrong if will still child whether be ashamed not hardly know for after have told of never once spoke of again certainly wished a passionately a be capable in poor dying state of wishing anything that must not bring shame sorrow on others of others that wished to spare most of wished to spare daisy promise to dying person be very solemn thing promised must do lay in power so that daisy must not know till yesterday thought that promise must never come up have daisy must not conceivably marry also must not know why there be crux one word more in justice to added be convinced doe not to day know who be with whom lived in paris knew for instance liked be sure must not have lived with knowing who be oh alice misery sorrow of know be with diana at end loved think going so utterly wrong like made love more pity of hopeless helpless sorrow of did not want to die jeannie voice choked for moment wanted life wanted love poor child be like beautiful wild thing without law did think never loved husband who adored did think died frightened frightened at what might be in front of a if infinite tenderness be not in front of a if jesus christ man of many sorrow be not there oh alice how can judge ah dear judge said anyhow judgment of ours have effect be done with a far a be concerned jeannie face suddenly brightened into semblance of smile be veiled be flesh

nice want above thing to keep poor diana dreadful secret to let one if possible above daisy know that be sister who lived year in paris in manner jeannie got up clearly easiest way of arriving at what want be to make daisy think that have only be flirting with said that be not serious will hurt poor child know if be in love with think be not must hurt far far more therefore must waste time day moment may fall in love with be extremely attractive do mean will tell daisy that have only be flirting with asked alice must do good must not believe besides day also may propose to must be more convincing than must see that convinces that be not in earnest must make if can under daisy very nose flirt with somebody else must make neglect know if can be done must try at least can think of other plan will not involve telling daisy that want to keep from how who asked alice be coming to bray lord lindfield mean yes be coming to morrow evening with others jeannie paused in front of mirror looked long at spoke to image there yes passable yet just passable yet said to herself lady nottingham got up came across room to jeannie what do mean asked what be mean jeannie turned round quickly

be beautiful a have told never a far a know flirted with girl well that prof like woman best ah ca do jeannie broke in lady nottingham think of what will appear to daisy think of own self respect think of victor what will make of be too dangerous have thought of thing said jeannie have weighed balanced seem to lighter than promise made to diana may have to tell victor about know will do utmost not to may not be necessary for alice think trust a utterly a trust think that if saw running after other woman must feel there must be explanation hope must not ask for think be faithless to believe

will still keep diana secret may fail one can not be sure of plan going right show other plan at from bottom of heart will thank lady nottingham shook head can think of other plan said ca approve of one be playing with serious thing jeannie be playing with love other people soul diana did not mean to do anything like in order to keep promise to poor child one doe not easily see consequence of one

have done never dy may be forgiven heaven grant may be forgiven exists still in life of others be not a if be alive said other a if must suffer for jeannie shook head ah dear said to mind be reason more for keeping promise living people can defend to extent can appeal to make see perhaps such promise involves more than be reasonable to demand dead alice dead be so defenceless lady nottingham be silent knowing that be useless to argue over question of feeling for amount of reasoning however admirable can affect question about heart have taken side after moment jeannie went on be not dead alone said there be daisy also to consider have made promise at think must do anything a distasteful odious to a be going to do for sake of keeping dreadful knowledge from alice think if have have sister like must ever get rid of poison of be awful thing to let young soul be poisoned when grow older get suppose better digestion poison affect le be worst of growing old again paused now dear a

having arrived at dismal conclusion by unspoken train of thought wish be cow wish be boy ca be cow boy said gladys gravely really wish be dead daisy suddenly have fit of giggle before long infected cousin also lay back in chair in peal of helpless laughter now then one other must recover little only to be set off again by temporarily hopeless case be not till have laughed tired that fit subsided daisy mopped streaming eye l let pick laburnum said at length how silly be must save such lot of trouble to be cow if laugh more will be sick come into garden then said gladys oh dear did mean that laugh again daisy doe hurt so dreadfully chapter xi might prove to be conduct of others seemed clear next morning that weather meant to do in power to help daisy to have happy time hot cloudless day succeeded girl intended originally to lunch at one since gave longer afternoon at one since nobody have appeared seemed wiser to put off lunch till past since be hour at lunched in london eventually sat down alone to meal even more belated at present nothing must touch mar daisy happiness be much better that must come said with air of decision daresay aunt alice must like though must have be supposed to be fault very likely motor have broken down told usually did laughed quite naturally there be sting in absence in fact told usually sent on ahead said started walking after about hour

can eat oh gladys mean to be cross when say thing on purpose to annoy must be such bad manner in not to appear to be annoyed do think motor have broken down fancy tramping down bath road on day like hate walking unless be going to kill something be charged by rhinoceros once if try to shoot miss charge how awfully tiresome of killed afterwards though be quite close never heard anything so exciting gladys laughed oh daisy said told that before said be so hard to know what to say if did know rhinoceros from hippopotamus now find too exciting well what then said daisy with dignity think one ought to take interest in sort of subject be frightfully suburban only to be interested in what happens in own parish somebody said that world be parish know what parish grosvenor square be in said gladys parenthetically somehow daisy in new mood be far le formidable than glittering crystal have be daisy up till now seemed to have rubbed shoulder with world instead of streaking sky above happiness must say even in moment of birth have humbled softened gladys found have not slightest fear of being snapped up several time during lunch daisy have snapped have snapped innocuously have finished now rose expect in about hour said daisy rather magisterially let finish flower love flower in bedroom do let put dish of in everybody bedroom look so welcoming book too everybody like book two in room be so easy to do little thing like people appreciate enormously there be whole of afternoon before nobody will arrive till five o'clock train thought said expected began gladys darling pray criticize last remark three remark becomes obsolete a soon a remark be made daisy last conjecture be correct be not till after five when tea have be laid on broad creeper covered verandah to east of house that one appeared then however appeared in large number for most of lady nottingham guest have chosen train recommended to travel by one in fact arrived by with exception of jeannie halton lord lindfield knew jeannie must miss lady nottingham said a be equally certain must not thing have to be put to proof daisy darling how be insisted on being taken to symphony concert at least did so much insist a lord lindfield insisted on taking be to meet at paddington in case jeannie went so far a to provide for contingency in case missed be to drive down in motor victor braithwaite who have come with party joined in know that motor said can do journey second time try journey first time took other day from baker street to south audley street stuck in middle of oxford street jim crowfoot helped largely to strawberry turned to daisy be slim rather small young man with voice two size too large for be supposed to be rather good person to have in house because never stopped talking have be possible to cover over with piece of green baize like canary when one have have enough must have be even more desirable suppose be what mean by second thought being best said be usually case at least find that if ever think right be always when give matter consideration came down here without considering promised to dine with mr streatham evening be excellent plan mr beaumont broke in plan be always to be tremendously appreciative of everybody for two sentence in order to enhance effect of nasty thing said of everybody moment afterwards set nasty thing off better think one be too horrid about dear kind mr streatham said be most hospitable woman know for instance jim go eat cutlet then laugh at asked to dine with next friday said must a remembered be already engaged when looked at book found be with have already promised to dine like being asked twice show one be really wanted oh be really wanted said jim always want people who want be tragedy if will ask to dinner once mr beaumont will transfer two of mr streatham invitation to there be again be not kind must upset table not at husband must dine downstairs daughter must dine upstairs be advantage of having family can always make thing balance have family said be exactly why bank book wo balance when overdraw always threaten to transfer account banker will stand anything wo mr braithwaite let go stroll dear jim always talk so loud that ca hear think if hear think know what will say next do tell be on purpose do think that mr halton lord lindfield missed train may be quite wrong did think that alice said a if have rather expected surely said expected how interesting what heavenly garden only have just met mr halton one say be too fascinating be perfectly charming said be that same thing oh not at may be perfectly charming without being least fascinating man ever want to marry perfectly charming woman only think delightful when one of friend doe so daisy have heard most of a two left verandah strolled off down garden effect that have on be to make label mr beaumont a horrid be quite aware that three quarter of ordinary light conversation went on between people who be not friend only acquaintance be not meant to be taken literally that one of perception took otherwise tribute to aunt jeannie charm have be paid on side woman have heard of a too fascinating victor have found charming daisy from own point of view must find epithet too laudatory endorsed fascinating charming be just conscious that must have preferred that victor must have called fascinating mr beaumont charming rather than that must have be other way about be not because mr beaumont called fascinating that daisy labelled that unconscious lady a horrid be because have made suggestion that lord lindfield aunt have missed train on purpose in order so followed that must drive down together in motor whose second thought be so admirable daisy scorned insinuation altogether felt that degraded by allowing to think of have be clearly implied group round tea table have dispersed easily found next aunt alice everything be in order dear aunt alice said gladys have worked so hard think must have come down yesterday if have known there be symphony concert afternoon what did have brahms think said lady nottingham vaguely there be brahms be there neither jeannie lord lindfield quite knew went to see when did settle to go see asked daisy last night think oh yes at opera last night yes mr crowfoot of course may have cup sugar came to box lord lindfield mean be so delighted to meet aunt jeannie again yes put in one lump mr crowfoot be that right lady nottingham certainly succeeded admirably in lightness of touch gave to little speech knew a well a if daisy have told in so many word sort of feeling have dictated daisy rather catechism question about manner of jeannie lindfield settling to go to concert what there be at concert lightness of touch be not easy knew quite well did not fail to remember that few day ago only have advised daisy to have answer ready when not if lord lindfield proposed to have certainly not done so daisy have evidently not expected to go to concert with aunt miss train drive down with have reason to suppose that anything must be called jealousy be a yet existent in daisy mind only perhaps wanted to know exactly what have happened jim crowfoot have only paused like bird on wing pouncing on morsel of thing to eat having got second cup of tea flew off again instantly to mr majendie whom be regaling with shrill soliloquy thus for moment daisy aunt alice be alone at tea table daisy dropped into chair at lady nottingham side be so glad like aunt jeannie said in best quickest style that like suppose do like other since go to concert together miss train together never miss train with people like do aunt alice be rather afraid do know aunt jeannie must like be so glad be wrong knew other before did lady nottingham paused moment never devoted a have be said more of brain than be necessary to deal with subject in hand appeared to that good deal of brain be required here daisy poor undiplomatic daisy have tried so hard in rapid quick witted little speech to say thing knew ought to feel a matter of fact did not feel superficially be doubt delightful that aunt jeannie must like tom lindfield be delightful also that must like speech be quite correct quite sincere a far a went if one took further be quite insincere said that surface felt in order to conceal what really felt light reply again be not easy to lady nottingham have considered jeannie plan in bearing then now must think of better plan already daisy be watching said be so nice that two must be friend meant a far a went further must have to learn to mean le le must have to dislike then to hate idea of being friend if jeannie plan be to succeed must also have to hate one anyhow if not of two whom liked so much curtain have gone up on tragic little farce be in order to avoid tragedy however that farce have be planned be in order to save daisy that be being sacrificed now lady nottingham took up daisy last question oh yes have known other for year said helping plan forward met quite like old friend be completely out of last night be just three in box be behadowy third daisy stamped figuratively speaking on be in mind compelled loyalty to triumph wonder at everybody simply loving aunt jeannie said do love lord lindfield motor do hope will be in time for dinner otherwise table be absolutely upset will have to settle over again be rather inconsiderate of aunt alice think ought to have caught train whether be brahms not loyalty be effort lady felt that applauded effort poor daisy said speaking in two word unspoken thought be too bad of to give more trouble oh mind just arranging table again said daisy quickly chapter xii rearrangement of table proved to be necessary since at half past eight lord lindfield motor have not yet be heard of in spite of absentee be hilarious party sat down have be on river have strolled about garden be disposed to enjoy immensely jim crowfoot have not ceased talking at showed at present not slightest sign of doing so took daisy in to dinner be probably sitting by roadside said singing brahms to other while chauffeur lie underneath car hammering with foot just sticking out trying to screw throttle into waste pipe of carburetter why doe nobody invent motor car without carburetter be always that be at root of trouble shade of evening will thicken will sing louder louder a night draw on to check rising sensation of cold hunger fear while chauffeur swiftly firmly reduces car to scrap iron think be so interesting when somebody doe arrive absence give rise to so many pleasing conjecture be going to do to morrow miss daisy oh nothing hope said why do want to do anything if be expected to do anything wished to know worst at once what like best of be to sit in chair not read chair ought to be placed at railway station succession of people must be provided to run by with heavy bag in hand just missing train next best thing to doing nothing be to observe everybody else trying to do something like catching train not succeeding uncle once missed eight train in one day then tried to commit suicide next day caught nine train motor reconciled to living be still doing be sure be uncle asked daisy not quite be much better style to say thing happened to uncle than to confess that made up if make thing up people expect to write novel something whereas nothing can be expected from if say happened to uncle have got uncle be such good thing ca be anxiety to nobody be anxiety to dining room looked towards front of house daisy turned suddenly ah surely be crunch of motor on gravel said expect be that be motor be at once put beyond region of doubt by succession of loud hoot in couple of minute jeannie appeared in doorway dear alice said apologize most abjectly at least motor apologizes lord lindfield made apologize just now at top of voice did hear scold missed train by about twenty minute a be always best to do thing thoroughly will dress may come into dinner just a be jeannie looked radiantly round while chair place be being laid for shaking hand with nearest smiling at others kissing hand across table to daisy swift movement have be extremely swift for last ten mile after car have got to work again change from cool night air into warm bright room have brought blood to cheek gave wonderful sparkle youthfulness to face sat down at top of one of side of table with lord lindfield between alice be so hungry said for last half hour have talked of nothing food must look at pink after glow of sunset because reminded of strawberry fool lord lindfield nearly burst into tear because there be cloud shaped like fish have tea see because be missing train at tea time dinner went on usual way after daisy succeeded in giving le distracted attention to jim crowfoot for up arrival knew that have really be thinking about only still felt little hurt that instead of coming down here early to day lord lindfield have be prevented from doing that only by subsequent engagement to take aunt jeannie to concert very likely have thought over half promise to arrive early seen be indeed case that be not quite usual thing to do doubt be doubt must explain to afterwards daisy settled in own mind that must at once admit reasonableness of though must let appear that be little disappointed be delighted that aunt jeannie liked have said that before to lady nottingham be truer now than when have said for have be conscious then of something in own mind did not agree with speech have be glad that aunt jeannie liked must have be quite equally glad if did not be not quite nice feeling there be something in common between jealousy have required certain effort have gladly made to put away from that have done from where sat must just see at head of table side by side with lady nottingham let look at more than looked with casual glance at of others be very often that heard allowed to listen for great boisterous laugh contained so much enjoyment rare glance in direction however told that be aunt jeannie to whom be talking for after word two to lady nottingham just after came in have have further conversation together be clear then that liked aunt jeannie be good thing also door from dining room be at end of room at be sitting daisy on way out have to pas close to have not finished talk with aunt even then for stood by chair waiting till others have passed out a daisy came up saw why miss daisy said have seen heard dinner time be practising for future incarnation a mouse dumb animal well be jolly be mr halton forgiven for having motor break down on condition of getting one doe daisy darling said aunt jeannie putting arm round girl waist how be must take side after having stuck for hour on perfectly flat road be unreasonable that couple forgiveness with new car will have ultimatum afterwards lord lindfield daisy may make harder condition than if doe will certainly adopt now do look bored pretty soon come out of dining room quickly be barbarous separation of sex after dinner stop behind after breakfast to drink tea others have passed out daisy mr halton brought up rather detached rearguard rest have gone straight out of house into verandah where have have tea for night be exquisitely soft warm followed there ah concert daisy said jeannie wish must have be there such ludicrous drive a have be so pleasant meeting tom lindfield again be great friend year two ago think be great friend still dear drive went for first hour well inside four mile hour limit eventually stuck on perfectly flat road then chauffeur chauffed for hour two after came along shade above fifty mile hour limit limitation be limit throughout such nonsense a talked oh do tell said daisy nonsense be only thing care to hear about must ca remember anything only know laughed quite enormously causelessly ah here be alice what divine place how have grown up like daisy be telling about ridiculous drive with lord lindfield jeannie sat down in big basket chair became suddenly silent felt queerly tired felt also rather sick at heart looking at daisy must not bear thought of trouble disquietude must bring to girl whom so loved have saddled with load already galled though have barely taken up even a spoke of ludicrous drive there came to mind aspect of namely purpose for have driven down with be not ludicrous at here in starlit garden with friend on side of seemed incredible thing that have got to sow suspicion discord trouble sorrow seemed so remote so utterly alien security serenity have here proper home be place of pleasantness friend rest felt much inclined to yield to influence to put off execution of scheme saying to herself that be wiser to think over again see if there be not a surely there must be other possibility of detaching daisy from man whom seemed certain must otherwise marry whom be quite impossible must marry even now daisy be standing near trusting so implicitly loving so well that love trust so intensely dear to have to risk disturbing indeed be scarcely risk ran be certainty courted however quietly well did part be impossible that daisy must not see that be encouraging tom lindfield be using woman power of attraction to draw towards true daisy have not a yet told that expected to marry officially a far a daisy be concerned be ignorant of supposing daisy confided in there be nothing more likely within next four twenty hour daisy must quite certainly see that aunt be very intimate with lord lindfield very intimacy must encourage daisy to tell on other hand lord lindfield while still thinking that be only very pleasant sympathetic woman might tell hope with regard to daisy be very possible stage in process of detachment yet knew that personally must make better plan than have already begun to carry out have thought over thought over one consideration remained paramount namely that daisy must never know why marriage be so unthinkably impossible if proposed to seemed certain that must accept in case must have to be told clearly then proposal must be averted must find other plan to avert than one be pursuing already partly to relief partly to added sense of meanness of own role believed that detachment must not be so difficult to manage have responded very quickly readily to advance have come to concert with be delighted to miss train having told also that have thought of going down early to bray have said no more than have quite legitimately laughed at idea of spending day alone with two girl have professed a pleased to have upset so preposterous arrangement yet too though be glad to have stopped added to heart sickness must not have made arrangement unless daisy have allowed if daisy permitted to come down to spend day with gladys surely implied that daisy wanted very much to see lady nottingham have told that daisy be not in love with be still anchor of consolation be effort of consecutive thought required to be reasoned out be in front of spread out like landscape to be grasped in moment there be victor too daisy moved step nearer chair be three day since got back aunt jeannie said have have real word with yet may come talk to evening when go up to bed have such heap to say be too dangerous at cost jeannie wanted to avoid intimate conversation with daisy have work to do did not think must go through with if daisy told in own dear voice what already knew have to be flirt have to exhibit man to daisy in light to make disgusted with be hard row to hoe did not want made more difficult luckily even a daisy spoke interruption came sound of men voice sounded from open door darling how long to talk to said rather to have talk to to night daisy be so tired when can escape go to bedroom will just tumble into bed look so well dear so happy must tell anything nicer than ah here be men let multiply chapter xiii lord lindfield have carried out jeannie instruction to letter after woman have left dining room have relapsed into state of supreme boredom have not be difficult task boredom be quite genuine for did not in least wish to talk to victor braithwaite to listen to jim crowfoot pas wine to two three other men wanted to tell daisy how impossible have be to get down earlier in day wanted also to tell mr halton what jolly drive have have together have be jolly there be question about have be so delightful too about breakdown of wretched motor car other woman might have be annoyed audibly wondered when be going to start again have not be least annoyed have said oh hope will take long time to mend be heavenly sitting by roadside like tramp have sat like tramp for hour two did not look particularly like tramp for have huge fur cloak on at first designed originally to defeat cold wind occasioned by speed at hoped to travel up till then have be about three mile hour have taken off sat on rug taken from disgraceful car treated whole affair like huge joke there never be such good comrade if have be boy out on motor for first time must not have adopted franker air of amused enjoyment at accident of road have made periodic visit to car hammering chauffeur then great hunger about have already spoken have begun have confessed to awful inanition have suggested thing to eat till fact that other people be already sitting down to dine having have tea became absolutely unbearable then suddenly have stopped nonsense said be so glad that have happened being left in bath road like make one know man better doe always wanted to know better oh compliment be ambiguous have told yet whether improve on acquaintance then just a stopped at door motor hooted apology turned to what pity have said hate nice thing coming to end particular nice thing have certainly come to end be firmly determined that there be quantity of nice thing not yet begun be genuinely attached to daisy fully intended to ask to be wife contemplated in case be so fortunate a to obtain yes from many serene happy year indeed be coxcomb did not fancy that girl saw be willing to marry if wished to marry at same time did not feel that be in least likely that daisy must refuse a came out after dinner that night after so successfully looking bored in dining room have not altered mind in least intention be still fully there be reason why must not talk to mr halton be quite capable even of talking to about daisy be then that action of tragic little farce really began daisy have heard sound of voice before turned corner of house by design moved away from aunt side to far end of verandah from where path led down to edge of river verandah be well lit there must be question that when came round corner must see there be question moreover in own mind that must join jeannie be sitting at end of verandah near to corner round came victor braithwaite stopped on one side of chair lord lindfield stopped on other latter have looked up daisy felt sure have seen then after few minute chat daisy saw aunt get out of chair heard laugh challenge lord lindfield daisy heard say apart from chivalrous instinct if accept challenge will be because know will be beaten will have game of pool first then when everybody else be tired will play serious hundred probably think that because be woman ca play game very well say to 'let put to proof mr braithwaite come play pool first wo dear alice may go play pool be nobody else coming let begin at once daisy heard once again saw lord lindfield look up towards end of verandah where be standing then call laughing reply after mr halton who be already just vanishing indoors for couple of step followed then turned round came up verandah towards daisy mr halton have arranged regular night of miss daisy said have challenged to game of billiards in such way ca refuse be going to have game of pool first wo come take hand will play mr halton braithwaite side at pool asked daisy why must probably think be stupid to go indoors on night so be must much sooner stroll about go on river see ca help myself let go in punt to morrow please keep punt for put label on 'you ' daisy smiled must not have allowed that needed cheering up at be fact that cheered up yes do let spend day on river to morrow said must go play pool now think will come in be so heavenly out here lord lindfield wavered girl looked enchantingly pretty upon word so be said look just like summer evening miss daisy wonder if must get one to take place at pool before play single with mr halton stop out here with pleasant though deed must have be to daisy wish desire be more essential must without struggle forgo pleasure of being with now that have said that be that preferred indeed must do anything of kind said aunt jeannie want to play asked must go in at once fact that mr halton have carried off two men to billiard room left rest of party out of square daisy quite willing to be odd unit strolled very contentedly out along path led to river moon have not long risen shone very large low in east burning dimly red through heat haze vapour from thames air be very windless river lay like sheet of grey steel at foot save where little spreading feather of black ripple showed course of water rat bat wheeled dipped like company of nocturnal swallow pursuing minute prey uttering little staccato cry so high in scale that none acute ear must hear from garden a occasional whisper of wind lifted down dropping leaf of aspen ash air came laden with scent of damp earth for since sunset gardener have be busy spilt fragrance of sleeping flower occasionally little draught must draw from river to daisy be of even more admirable quality for smelt of cool running water nought besides on far bank mist lay in wisp streamer above low lying meadow dark bulk of cattle horse loomed through like rock in vaporous sea fathom from ground air be dry clear be in willow sea that rock be submerged on side of river where daisy walked banking up of path to form protection to garden against spring winter flood raised above damp breathing of fruitful earth moved in clearness austerity of starshine moonlight not body only mind soul walked in light be very romantic wonderful seemed somehow to be attuned to pale mysterious flame of moon flooded heaven dim intense happiness first experienced two night before have blazed up within into conflagration nature of there be mistaking while dim almost intenser doubt misery of two night before saw now to be shadow cast by first kindling of other light now a blazed higher more triumphantly shadow vanished though consciousness of be so vivid alert self consciousness be almost altogether banished no longer made plan for herself in future a have always done till now seeing a mistress of great house filling position a indeed be fitted to do so well seeing always kind always pleasant always ready to smile on adorer did even see a mother of child lost sight of altogether just now saw only in different light in have appeared so suddenly so disconcertingly at ball two night ago have wished have preferred to come out here with rather than go indoors play billiards daisy in sudden mood of exquisite humbleness go with love blushed with pleasure that must be so told that be incredible thing yet so be must sooner have come out here for have said talked to goose of girl than be with anybody else even aunt jeannie daisy wished have told aunt jeannie on afternoon of arrival what be state of thing between lord lindfield for be really rather too much of good thing aunt darling must innocently monopolize whole afternoon drive down with alone taking hour hour over a soon a dinner be over at meal sat next take away to play billiards have let that opportunity slip though have hoped to tell jeannie about to night must not be able since aunt have cried off bedroom talk on plea of tiredness then quite suddenly thought occurred to daisy of most disagreeable kind aunt jeannie have be too tired to talk to have meant to slip away tumble into bed a soon a possible yet within five minute of having made that declaration have engaged to play pool to follow up by having single with lord lindfield odd programme for woman who be so fatigued that be going to slip away go to bed a soon a possible then almost without pause daisy pulled together again banging door of mind so to speak on unpleasant thought refusing to give entrance to hold parley with there be fifty explanation if explanation be required for loyal friend be not daisy refused to think more of matter time small prying denizen of subconscious mind be wondering what explanation must possibly be unpleasant little moment though have dealt with a loyally speedily a must have rather spoilt moonlight saunter at rate daisy be afraid of other similar intrusion went back to house there found whole party engaged for bridge table have be made up one in far end of billiard room one out on verandah while remaining three be still at pool without more than half conscious intention daisy strolled on round house meaning to look in at billiard room have meant to go into room in natural ordinary way entering by long french window gave on to path must be sure on warm evening to be open did not do instead paused opposite window at little distance from so that be probably invisible to eye looking from bright light inside into dusk in stood wanted in fact to see what be going on without being seen saw aunt jeannie lord lindfield be standing together by marking board talking about point might might not have be connected with billiards pool apparently be over for victor braithwaite have put down cue have strolled over to bridge table at moment jeannie raised hand laid just for second on sleeve of lindfield shirt for be coatless action be infinitesimal momentary looked rather intimate then poor daisy have once more to take herself in hand polite name might be found for present occupation must call strolling in garden looking at moon if chose there be very straightforward not very polite name must be found for be spying discontinued entered billiard room whistling like proper person usual thing happened everybody became so stupidly obstinately unselfish that looked a if there must be no more billiards at lord lindfield without pause said by jove how lucky miss daisy have come in nick of time just finished pool now mr halton will play single will mark for appeared also that if there be thing mr halton really enjoyed doing be marking for other people insisted that daisy lord lindfield must have game daisy of course be equally altruistic firmly refused to interfere with previous arrangement eventually rubber just coming to end cut into bridge table in far corner of room rubber be fairly rapid before end of footman have appeared with bed time tray of soda whisky lemon followed by man with bedroom candle mr beaumont only other woman in room besides daisy mr halton who have be yawning in strangled manner during course of last two hand instantly took candle departed daisy with more deliberation drank soda water looked on at game for few minute daisy dear said jeannie be too dreadful wicked fast of to go on playing care if be must finish game be going to win oh lord lindfield what fluke do mean to say be going to count by jove yes charge three for miss daisy aunt giving awful hiding there have left again jeannie a matter of fact be what may be called very decent country house player quite capable of making twenty five break more than once in course of game selected moment to do now from seventy six ran out other men have strolled out on to terrace daisy after congratulation lit couple of candle one for one for aunt say mr halton might have one more game said lord lindfield be only half past ten must sleep if have to finish up with whacking jeannie eye be sparkle with enjoyment triumph have game with daisy said let rest on laurel daisy shook head not to night said really must rather not do play again aunt jeannie be going to bed be really fifty then lord lindfield said jeannie daisy went straight up to room still making effort to banish thought aunt jeannie have said be tired slowly house grew quiet step of men going to room tapped along polished board of corridor outside with now then rustle of dress then be still sat half undressed with book on lap that be not reading while couple more quarter chimed from clock above stable at last came sound of step again outside tap of rather heavy tread with rustle of dress then came be laugh merry unmistakable good night mr halton said have have perfectly ripping time never enjoyed day more apparently have gone down passage way for voice sounded more distant also said good night then came sound of two door shutting chapter xiv be about half past three in afternoon of next day house garden alike wore rather uncomfortable air of heat fatigue somnolence blind be down in window faced south west with object doubt of keeping cool most desirable condition of thing one on present occasion imperfectly realized be thing much better to east of house where ran deep verandah in have sat from daisy have strayed evening before for heat came no longer from honest scorching ray of sun through thick blanket of grey cloud morning have be gradually forming over obscuring sky southward there be rather ugly glare in day tawny coppery coloured light spread from low on horizon where cloud of thicker more palpable texture be piled together cloud with hard edge angry light in be certain there be going to be storm somewhere must be no bad thing for air be horribly sultry quite distinctly needed clearing daisy be always susceptible to atmospheric condition have gone upstairs after lunch to room on plea fairly true one of thunder headache aunt jeannie have be eager with sympathy smelling salt offer to read daisy have quietly rejected saying that be merely question of thunderstorm when storm broke must be better till then smelling salt must not help be quite darling of aunt jeannie have forced to say at end with cordiality be somewhat hard to put into voice really must sooner be alone be bad headache only just thunder one there be window seat in room well lined with cushion looking over river be here that daisy be rather uneasily reclining have first tried lying on bed room be too airless except close by window to be tolerable partly that partly hour ago sound of voice outside have made come over here be to see what be happening to whom have heard talking a well a to get what air there be that kept here now breath holding immobility lay over river garden quiver moved in aspen shook leaf clad tower of elm chestnut be a if instead of being clad in soft sensitive foliage be cast in iron note of bird came from bush ripple broke metallic hardness of river reflection of loose strife tall grass along edge clump of chestnut on little promontory at corner of garden be a clear cut unwavering a if have be enamelled on steel there be atmosphere in day mist haze in spite of heat shrouded melted distance tree house roof of maidenhead mile away seemed a if stretched out finger must be laid on be of noah ark size be only minuteness that showed remoteness there be punt underneath chestnut at corner of garden partly concealed by low sweep of bough hour ago daisy have heard aunt jeannie voice below window saying yes with pleasure will be wise not to go far a be sure there will be storm be at that daisy have left bed come across to window seat to see with whom aunt jeannie be not going far before have got there voice have told who be have not gone far have gone about fifty yard from boathouse must see line of punt among leaf there be great pile of crimson cushion woman figure dressed in grey in front of sat man figure in flannel with shirt sleeve rolled up to elbow even a daisy looked aunt jeannie passed couple of cushion too sat down on floor of punt close to facing daisy have said headache be not bad that be only thunder headache neither of assertion be quite true headache be bad be not in main thunder headache at be headache born of trouble perplexity struggle did not in least understand what be happening have got up early that morning have gone out before breakfast very likely be out of sort row on river in coolness of day be exactly right thing to correct morbid suspicious impression be founded so told not on fact on own bilious interpretation of fact indeed in fresh dewy morning found when went out that imagination have be fairly busy most of night fitting together like chinese puzzle rather disturbing event of day before have be riotous sensational lord lindfield for instance be true have not come down here early yesterday a have suggested have gone with aunt jeannie to concert clearly coming down alone to spend day with two especially one girl in country must have be highly unconventional be very wise not to so be disposed of have missed train motored down instead arriving half way through dinner what of unless be prepared to aver that there have be no breakdown what be there to build on here so be disposed of have played two game of billiards together last night second fifty so appeared have be doubled why not before game daisy have be asked if must not play have refused then have said a parted on landing that have never enjoyed day more what of did not daisy have most heavenly evening have ever spent about seven time week like sensible girl be took trouble to bit in early morning row a one may take mechanism of clock to bit found there be something faulty in individual piece of working clearly therefore whole thing when pieced together again must not reasonably be considered reliable clock since there be something wrong with single piece of here be trouble of seemed to when reconstructed made into one to keep excellent time to be thoroughly dependable yet since piece be wrong must not accept whole tossing overboard so to speak settled down for spell of demon dispersing exercise be still only little after seven have two clear hour to get rid of blue for already have become substantial enough to take depressing colour before breakfast have returned must be confessed in far more equable spirit physical exercise have disposed to broader more out of door attitude while determined effort not to be suspicious maliciously constructive have done more of people in world aunt jeannie be least mean ignoble minded daisy told that have be measuring action by standard so crooked that must not lie straight along there must be no more such attempt more looking from dark into window to see unseen what people be doing inside flushed exhilarated by row daisy cheek burnt shade brighter moment at thought that be indeed who have done that be still hour to breakfast time when got back to boat house already heat of day be begun smell of damp coolness of night dried up strolled along outside of thick hedge faced river then turning corner saw in front of not twenty yard distant two figure standing alone together woman two hand clasped of man holding against breast be speaking softly eagerly smiling into face quick a lizard daisy popped back behind hedge before seemed to have seen went swiftly to house be more inexplicable yet for two figure have seen be of aunt jeannie victor braithwaite there be questioning intimacy of attitude yet here again have seen something have not be meant to see must be lamentable creature if let mind dwell on try to construct meaning significance be not for if man figure have be lord lindfield must have be le surprised have earned inactive morning by expedition before breakfast announced set determination to go further than elm tree beyond rose garden when arrived there to hing from other side of table lord lindfield rose at jove miss daisy said have be wondering since got up what be matter with now know be need of sitting under tree doing nothing will join party if will let be talking allowed yes nobody need answer usually sha jim crowfoot got up be not sure if will come not said think not feel rather inclined for conversation to day better not come then old chap said lindfield there be not much conversation usually when be with never get word in anybody else be impossible to take offence at even so pure friendly be chaff may be said to jim credit that did not even attempt to do so what be to do then asked ca converse alone mr halton will talk to mr halton going to write letter morning said lindfield told so just for second daisy allowed to think so already knew that be momentary mood of drawing inference from infinitesimal data in other people conduct be altogether detestable must not allow to do yes be going to be virtuous woman said aunt jeannie alice dear will get nice dog chain fasten down to writing table till swear to have written to everybody who ever writes to if wish if chain down sacrifice fineness of virtue make virtue of necessity said jeannie make necessity of virtue sha be able to get up be same thing be clearly going to make morning of remarked lindfield jeannie sighed afternoon a well said if recollection of size of certain packet neatly labelled 'unanswered ' be at correct must make packet of unanswered letter said lindfield burn then can start afresh chapter xv next hour two have fairly fulfilled breakfast plan daisy after tiger accident to parasol at zoo have fallen back for country use anyhow on immense scarlet contadina umbrella have planted under elm tree a soon a breakfast be over almost immediately after lord lindfield have followed with not quite so rigid interpretation of idleness a daisy for have brought absolutely nothing with to occupy hand mind whereas have daily paper not word sigh sneeze miss daisy said in whisper will be discovered not brought anything with be right just forget parasol said daisy really be insignificant affair know be like hide too much of daisy laughed suppose that mean have to put down said well think must be kind of said have be hiding too much lately to mind daisy must not let pas well like said threw over yesterday said be going to spend down here arrived with aunt jeannie in middle of dinner played five thousand up with afterwards yes when do hope to catch glimpse of hide under scarlet umbrella said that be better thanks awfully daisy furled big umbrella threw down on grass for moment mind be absolutely at peace again went back with tremulous sense of happiness to mood of ball so few evening ago a faced thought again that be different man from one have known again saw that difference be in have great discussion mr halton went on when be sitting like wayside flower near ealing yesterday a to whether people be nicer in country in town wonder of will agree with oh with aunt jeannie expect said daisy not without challenge in voice h be be nasty one for well let put to proof anyhow agreed that people be nicer in town others in country there parted company ah tell said daisy let think plucked long grass stem drew through teeth people one really like love be nicer in country said at length people who just amuse be nicer in town hurrah said be first rate be what said mr halton must have of that say that be so much nicer in town that refused to accept classification else must mean that none of liked stuck to fact that none of must like so much down here daisy considered how funny of aunt jeannie said wonder then whole collection of thing poor daisy have tried to put away from mind flashed into again giving feeling of sickness insecurity what did mean wonder what meant added truthfully enough know here come by jove miss daisy how splendid look aunt jeannie certainly be looking very best morning be walking hatless in blaze of sun somehow sunlight seemed not so much to shine on a to shine from flower garden river sky sun be so much le splendid than love heat said sap moral nature leaf happy animal with sense of responsibility daisy dear need answer wo invade for long sat down at table with unanswered letter looked through determined not to answer one be going to have holiday from being good have be good too long think joy of virtue pall there ought to be wind there be sun sky water nice thing except wind ca what be phrase ca raise wind lord lindfield tom lindfield clicked finger thumb together jove mr halton said always think of right thing make do so jumped up will order motor at once said miss daisy let go out for run old puffing billy always go well up to speed day after be broken down daisy effort with morning on river suddenly came to limit of energy once again saw everything in light have tried so hard to extinguish now there be more added there be further feature in scene aunt jeannie be too clever for with how natural air have come out said that only wind be necessary to make morning perfect how naturally how unconsciously have responded to subtly conveyed suggestion very subtlety of made believe that have thought of plan outwardly daisy still be mistress of herself be from inside not outside that control be beginning to give way put up red umbrella again thanks awfully lord lindfield said ca think of grilling road dust without putting up neat little parasol again be too ingenious for word aunt jeannie come out here demand wind instantly think of only plan of giving for book of verse rather newspaper underneath bough will last till lunch time have anything happened daisy spoke in lightest possible tone required woman to hear that beneath light word troubled spirit spoke jeannie be sick at heart at success of scheme have heard at breakfast how two meant to spend morning be aware that others knew of situation existed between must surely avoid elm tree by rose garden like plague stricken spot so have come out here on hateful mission interrupting breaking up dangerous companionship have be prepared to go further than to ask if necessary point blank for use of car hint at pleasure of company part of have be spared probably have inkling of design in coming out demanding wind indeed thought have thought of daisy knew tragic farce have to preserve tone required of public performance daisy dear wo come asked three be best company of think daisy turned over leaf of paper rather too smartly for public performance indeed think wo aunt jeannie said have such long row before breakfast feel frightfully disinclined to move waited to hear lord lindfield urge to come be already half way towards house daisy just raised eye saw already distant felt that have often heard of before passed over a unintelligible now understood for heart swelled aunt jeannie followed after general remark two to daisy must scarcely reply after more trial be in store for willie carton brought patient presence out under elm tree have promised so well performed so badly lay on grass pretended to read book be very stupid of to come so daisy thought rather selfish have given so firm answer if reopened question again be determined to speak even more plainly did nothing of kind daisy quieting down little from tumult of private thought began to feel little compassionate knew now in kind of way what be going on inside realized nature of brought out here to pretend to read book wanted to be near there be something of pathetic faithfulness of dog about dog be beaten repulsed never falter can falter in devotion to master have begun to know what that unreasoning devotion meant know compact of elm tree be not to talk expect answer said willie quietly let disturb daisy looked up at swiftly if said that do disturb said then must go away said oh willie said right tell when do then poor daisy began to have headache got worse before long rose what beastly day said be rather said be all right here be all right anywhere said daisy will go indoors have got headache wish must take said oh be foolish thanks awfully know mean one ca take other people burden know be saddled separately can do be to pretend be saddled at make grimace pretend to enjoy do pretend pretend oh have be pretending long time said daisy headache gave stab be quite unsettling men always think about remarked answer be elm tree rule will answer be remark that men always think about meant to apply to only want to know daisy have little sense of justice left said think be motorist came back very late for lunch just a evening before have come back late for dinner such be daisy morning felt have perfect right to headache with headache lay in window seat of bedroom watched punt with crimson spot of cushion unwaveringly reflected in surface of thames above sky grew darker with approach of storm light grew more coppery with rising of curious cloud out of south still dreadful clearness of air continued in spite of growing darkness maidenhead be still close distinct closer more distinct be punt where aunt jeannie handed lindfield two crimson cushion then in darkness below chestnut tree match be struck lit cigarette dropped still flaming vesta into thames then shifted position little sat nearer to other figure dressed in grey whose arm be leaning over side of punt whose hand just dabbled in water then daisy suddenly hid face in cushion of window seat began to sob chapter xvi jeannie a daisy have heard have advised that in view of approaching storm must not go far be now about hour since tom lindfield have after stipulation gone down to river have taken punt pushed out from hot reeking boathouse smelt strongly of tar be growing soft viscous on roof beneath heat of day slid down backwater towards river weed here wanted cutting wrapped affectionately round punt pole dragged green slender finger along bottom of punt a if seeking to delay passage then for moment have found little coolness a passed below chestnut tree extended long bough three quarter of way across backwater jeannie have said lord lindfield will certainly get very hot if punt up stream will probably get very wet before get back let stop here have be by mean unwilling have tied up sit down said out of two thousand cushion can spare few there on bottom of boat did suggest stopping said must be sarcastic afterwards over immense expedition took promise not think must ever be sarcastic to do know must only laugh point of sarcasm be to give pain want to give pain hurrah ah be not sure that little pain must not be rather good for think have almost too delightful time when did last not enjoy yet know perhaps deserve be sure give friend delightful time though do have one poor daisy be afraid be having good time afternoon have headache offered sympathy companionship felt like being alone poor daisy jeannie voice suddenly died meant to say something about daisy for felt a if must not go on talking be sorry said thought be looking very brilliant must have come out with for run in motor jove be hot even here think be excellent plan not to go further besides want to talk most awfully week ago jeannie have loathed thought of man even a for same reason loathed thought of paris when passed through at moment did not loathe thought of at did loathe who so loved sunshine joy of life must not like one who took so keen boyish pleasure in pleasantness boylike also turned so uncompromising back on be unpleasant even puzzling have use for unpleasantness head for puzzle from intellectual point of view might have be called stupid intellectual though jeannie be never took view of life estimate of people from standpoint affection simplicity good fellowship be thing seemed to matter to much more from human point of view then doe not concern with one neighbour intellectual quality more than concern with moral have quickly grown to like simple pleasant man who have so good appetite for joy of life liking for made task far more difficult far more repulsive to than have anticipated have thought that a far a be concerned must find perfectly easy to be ruthless steeling to by memory of diana that memory have not in least faded there have come into foreground of life liking sympathy for man who hoped be to be victim made what be doing doubly odious to yet think puzzle a might must devise plan if succeeded must spare daisy knowledge that have promised diana to spare a far a thing have gone be fairly content with what have accomplished be horrible to plan be working quite well have scarcely seen daisy since have come down here while have seldom be out of own company be clear to mr halton that daisy be certainly beginning to be puzzled poor child be beginning to feel hurt slighted there have be a yet more than beginning made lord lindfield must have to be far more taken up with than be now daisy poor dear must have to be far more deeply wounded hurt before thing be accomplished already mr halton felt sick at heart about yet till better plan must be thought of have not to set teeth to smile best flirt flirt flirt there be one bright spot in whole affair that few word have have with victor early that morning before breakfast have asked not pointedly in general way arising out of talk what must think if in way completely puzzled acted in manner be incomprehensible have laughed why darling what easy question said must know that there be something behind did understand must wait for to tell about if never told about asked jeannie then dear must know have good reason for must never ask think know must never cease to trust forget that be well be wine to chapter xvii liked lindfield that made task so much harder be shameful to treat man like yet yet there be still memory of dreadful gilded house in paris dying voice of diana so once more not for last time settled down to task be so odious odious because liked will quarrel then be afraid said because want to talk too want to talk to to leant over moment since punt pole have to be grounded at stern of boat for have tied chain in bow to unearthed root of tree leant little sideways away from be done be then gave few cushion out of two thousand have got anything very special to say asked because have so will begin yet know if be special except between friend everything seems to be special again jeannie must not get on for moment proceeded without notable pause difference between friend acquaintance be so enormous said yet so many people confuse two one may meet person hundred time be only acquaintance one may meet person once be friend in minute perhaps be not same with men think man recognizes who be going to be be capable of being friend at first glance whereas woman doe feel to end of finger tip jeannie gave quick glance at saw that be listening with considerable attention gave little sigh clasped hand behind head what uneconomical world be said what lot of affection emotion nature allows to run to waste man see in woman one quality one character that be for ever seeking see that be in way complement of perhaps woman merely dislike may happen other way round what waste of noble stuff mean affection be poured away like stream losing in desert doe seem pity jove yes never thought of that said there must be lot of going on so much perhaps that day desert will get quite damp then wo cease to be desert looked at rather longer letting eye rest on be much more hopeful solution said perhaps doe go to waste will say that nature never throw thing away put odds end of affection in stock pot to make soup will make soup for other people ah there be lightning far off storm be beginning waited in silence till long drowsy peal of thunder answered oh be mile away yet said jeannie arranged cushion more comfortably yet rather like nature uneconomical habit said if settle be spendthrift there be something rather royal large handed about be just same in physical affair saw in snippety paper other day that amount of electricity discharged in good thunderstorm must be sufficient to light house in london for five hour run train on tube for about same time must think be rather spendthrift too lord lindfield laughed oh yes pour out gallon of affection in direction always have again jeannie smiled at ah like said softly wo think go to waste must be too sad go on tell about pouring out in direction must like to hear about jeannie hated a spoke be using woman charm to draw on thing must not follow though knew well be using lightness of touch so that must not see how much be in earnest have used too that sacred name of friendship to encourage to draw nearer for man must listen to what have be saying without reading into directly personal meaning clearly friendship spoke of concerned for woman talk to man about friendship purely in abstract unless be grandmother be not nobody must be le like grandmother a sat there in full beauty of thirty year ripened womanhood be beautiful knew have charm be alone on hot thundery day with in punt also meant to use power be hers plan be to detach from girl manner of detachment be attachment to daisy must be shown how light be attachment indeed handicap of year did not seem so heavy now be perfectly well aware that men looked at a went by turned head after have passed hot sweltering day knew suited ripe rather southern beauty of face though in others might only be productive of headache fatigue indeed be little wonder that plan have made so promising beginning moved again little nearer clasping knee in hand have talked about friend said be encouraging to talk about be jolly word mean such jolly thing be beginning to hope have found one in last day two there be mistaking be there use in pretending not to know what meant indeed be worse than useless for be for have be working there be touch hint of passion in voice be speaking of friend a boy might speak liked held out hand with charming frankness of gesture be very good hearing said congratulate lord lindfield be only congratulate congratulate most heartily unclasped knee took hand in thanks most awfully said friend thank other said

friend mean to marry then asked hope to marry once again lightning flickered in sky thunder gave far more immediate response big coppery cloud have be low on horizon have spread upwards over heaven with astonishing speed even a thunder crackled few big drop of rain splashed on river outside shelter under chestnut storm be quickly coming closer big tree a jeannie remembered be not very desirable neighbourhood under circumstance have better get home said there be going to be storm jumped up at once loosed chain with few swift stroke took back into boathouse there be time just then for further conversation jeannie at rate did not wish for be a have feared that have done hitherto be nothing calamity wished to avert have not yet be averted one thing only have gained at present footing of friend already be sure valued that on must have to build be precarious task must not see way yet only knew that such friendship a have already formed with be not enough be not detached from daisy yet

yard across from boathouse have got wet with first rain of storm wanted not that so much a to sit by think matter be not so easy a have hoped for knew now that have let believe that by mere formation of friendship with must lead away from daisy now for first time saw how futile such hope have be must in pleasure of new friendship be somewhat markedly inattentive to daisy for day two must not permanently detach must seem to offer something more than mere friendship that be seriously in love with daisy did not wholly believe meant to marry meant anyhow to ask to marry alice who knew better than what daisy felt be sure that daisy must accept something more than mere flirtation be required matter saw now have to go deeper than must make essential to then when knew that be essential must have to turn back on be not pretty role there came gentle tap at door daisy entered ah have come in aunt jeannie said did get caught in storm not to speak of did not go far lord lindfield offered to take up to maidenhead a matter of fact went to corner of backwater oh promised not to laugh at for immensity of expedition because be who proposed stopping under chestnut how charming be daisy how be headache rather brilliant still will get better aunt jeannie how quickly make friend with people there be something tearing to jeannie tender heart about daisy looked so white tired so helpless who be usually perfect well spring of high spirit enjoyment jeannie longed to take dear head in hand kiss trouble away be just that must not do trouble must not be kissed away have to be burnt away by hand too that seemed unconscious of cruel work with do mean asked lightly can scarcely say have only now be making friend with saw good deal of at one time in fact be rather devoted to eagle eye see sign of return of doe yours room be very dark with blackness of sky outside jeannie must see daisy indistinctly then with wicked flare of lightning leaped into light thunder rattled round eaves in moment flash jeannie saw daisy face again mute white appealing be intolerable to besides anything be better le dangerous than tete tete with daisy at moment might tell about lord lindfield offer expected must make part infinitely worse to play must make impossible at present anyhow so far a daisy knew be ignorant of jumped at appalling racket overhead oh hate thunder hate thunder said let come downstairs daisy where there be people besides be tea time be not let go down came straight to room lord lindfield think went to alice will be anxious if think be still out listen to rain how will beat flower down come dear have hardly have word with since came back aunt jeannie said daisy know dear in house full of people what can one expect must have great talk when get back to london moment seems occupied here dear child hope headache will be better soon will not go lie down will tell alice be not well wo have little dinner quietly in room by let go down then chapter xviii storm be violent for hour two before sunset have moved away again half hour of sunshine washed clean sunshine preceded sunset somehow storm have not done proper work have scolded roared wept have not quite got trouble out of air there be more to come same sense that there be more to come invaded spirit of lady nottingham guest be little distraite daisy headache have left rather white tired gladys lamented wreck of garden there be not much life about then after dinner clouded over again cloud regathered lightning began to wink remotely thunder to grumble even mr halton whom sultry heat have so invigorated according to own account afternoon be inclined to join in rather early move to bed also next day be sunday sunday be not particularly wanted fact of be felt to be little depressing nobody quite knew what be matter with everybody else be fact that in gathering of friend acquaintance there be one person who make la pluie le beau temp in party be emphatically jeannie halton who arranged weather spirit of person be to certain extent infectious spirit of few people run through house like influenza there be doubt that have evening be in rather piano mood have not of course committed unpardonable social crime of showing that be depressed have be little retrospective tended to remember how in general conversation rather than to hope that must not be supposed that have behaved in way outside line of normal social intercourse have for instance just gone out into garden after dinner with lord lindfield have quoted line in darkness thick hot be apt enough harmless enough have vaguely made feel that something be little wrong then have made daisy play billiards together while marked for marked with weary accuracy said oh what beautiful stroke rather too often to make credible that always meant with rest of woman have gone up to bed rather early tom lindfield on other hand though did not feel at inclined to go to bed early felt that there be trouble somewhere must not date in least must put finger on moment when trouble began must asked that question several time jeannie have be so pleasant so good comrade till have gone out in punt then came compact of friendship somehow at once almost seemed to slip away from have wanted to tell much more to tell even how in paris have be desperately in love that what felt now for daisy be not that somehow woman in paris reminded of daisy yet what two woman must be more different than have apartment in rue chalgrin be very much gilded yet very simple that did not occupy much what occupied so much more be that till storm have begun till jeannie have run hurriedly to house have found extreme content in society have be for last thirty hour so such admirable comrade there be brahms concert ridiculous motor drive evening at billiards morning in motor afternoon in punt then quite suddenly have seemed to shut up to enclose from yet little spirit of companionship have escaped again when quoted line in darkness thick hot then after that have walked back to house made play billiards with daisy have gone upstairs at earliest possible opportunity nobody with slightest prospect of winning case must have accused tom lindfield of being sensitive in perception nobody without certainty of losing must have accused of not being fairly sound in conclusion what have happened to mr halton to make so different to for matter to everybody else since four o'clock afternoon did not try to decide since have mean of knowing what did know be that be woman of enchanting mood at one time be good comrade then be friend then for reason be sort of shadow of excellent thing be there be obscured by something else that obscuration rendered more enchanting did not understand be away somewhere beyond longed to follow life woman have be to most delectable of riddle expressed desire to marry settle down be perhaps only statement of fact that longed to solve one example of riddle one form in be presented to felt now that wished have married year ago that have already become quiet domesticated there be time for youth fiery passion ecstatic uncontent there be also most assuredly time when fever must cease have so repeatedly told that be time must cease for of late have come to believe believed still be for reason that have determined to settle down to choose a have done in own mind pretty charming girl much younger than a be right ask to settle down with be not in love with in absorbed tumultuous way meant to do best to make happy looked forward to being immensely happy have seemed very right reasonable satisfactory to night in way mirror of future tranquillity be disturbed be a if little sudden puff of wind like rustled now then through darkness thick hot outside ruffled broke surface making dim full of shattered image seemed to have swum up from below be that once again be beginning to fall in love with daisy in old passionate way at moment be aware that be not thinking about daisy at passed very rapidly through mind be effort of conscious reasoned thought more a if without volition of own picture have be drawn across brain a stood in hall while rustling procession of woman went upstairs with going became aware that rest of evening be likely to be rather boring be still not after half past ten hour impossible to go to bed at impossible anyhow to go to sleep at fancied that own company own thought be not likely to be very comfortable very profitable did not want to think wanted hour to pas a quickly unreflectingly a possible until be morning again doubt then thing must present in more normal light certainly event of day have proved rather exciting unsettling to be perfectly honest jeannie have somehow unsettled how quickly friendship have sprung up what have happened then seemed to have left altogether glided away from strolled back into billiard room where must find company of sort there already hour of yawn fitful conversation have begun first one then man nodded good night left room jim crowfoot however who hated going to bed a much a disliked getting up have brilliant cargo of conversation on board proceeded to unload two knew other well when be left alone conversation rapidly became intimate thunderstorm always be simultaneous with sombreness said sometimes wonder whether be sombreness produce storm storm produce sombreness one have be sombre to day except perhaps tom merry widow be referring to mr halton know of other lady nottingham be merry ca think how manage to produce so much impression with so little material have to talk time to produce impression at then be usually unfortunate one think description of mr halton a merry widow be particularly unfortunate one remarked lindfield guessed whom meant said jim know be characteristic of if not of always see people in in caricature besides thought mr halton be anything merry must know best why because have spent entire day with chiefly tete tete also yesterday tom lindfield be apparently not in very genial frame of mind to night let remark pas in silence then went back to what jim have previously said always talk good lot of rot old chap said want to know if be talking rot when said something about producing impression with little material sound pretty good rot if meant something by wish must tell what be doe have special application yes certainly referred to haveni vidi vici ' with mr halton laid firm hold of yesterday have not let go since imply that have wanted to go jim in spite of large quantity of outrageous nonsense often talked have very fair allowance of brain when chose to talk sense be worth listening to so at rate tom lindfield thought now wish 'd go on said just tell be in mind by mean if promise not to knock down anything be just that have be asking 'be to be aunt niece who have be asking that asked lindfield oh everybody except perhaps braithwaite poor wandering willie mr beaumont lady sybil be hard at when mr halton strolled out after dinner tore mr halton open a tear open registered envelope with same greed understand cat remarked lindfield oh yes like to hear ' braithwaite did listened to just one remark then went away looking black what have got to do with asked tom oh be great friend with m w said jim be one of nice old fashioned people who never talk evil of people behind back where be to talk evil of people except behind back be what want to know ca do in front of face a must not be polite be epigrammatic there be good fellow said tom only confuses well have confused be supposed to be walking out so to speak with miss daisy instead of leave completely alone walk out time with mr halton oh deny that be running after be at least so cat said be confusing know think one know where be lindfield took turn two up down room took up cue slapped red ball into pocket be sure know where be said expect will be in deuce of mess before long about mr halton running after be absolutely rot what brute woman be to other say to use expression that have be walking out with miss daisy have be supposed that be going to ask to marry lindfield sent one of white ball after red be far wrong said well will go to bed jim conversation be too sensational good night mind let know when have made up mind said jim chapter xix be certainty that have got to make up mind whereas till to day have believed that mind be made up lindfield carried upstairs with bedroom candle unlike useful article must be put out at will question refused to be put out burnt with disconcerting gem like clearness be perfectly true confessed to that for last two day have distinctly preferred to cultivate wonderful quick growing friendship have shot up between jeannie rather than bring thing to head with daisy have meant while down here to ask to marry now if looked that intention in face be aware that though be still there even a have begun to tell mr halton afternoon have moved away from immediate foreground stood waiting at further distance cat jim crowfoot told with impatience be altogether at fault when so charmingly said that have to make up mind between aunt niece be not that at only question with making up of mind be concerned be whether be going to ask daisy now to morrow to be wife moment asked that question be already answered that did not know a always be quite honest with proceeded ruthlessly to find out what have occasioned postponement of intention be not hard to answer answer have already be indirectly given be enchantment of new friendship have forced into foreground that friendship however be now agreed upon ratified postponed intention must come forward again last few hour have made feel uncertain about friendship there be use in denying have be quite different since came in from punt how maddening how intoxicating woman be how forced to wonder speculate about to work brain into fever with guessing what be going on in theirs turned over in bed with face to wall shut eye with firm laudable intention of not bothering more about of letting sleep bring counsel did intend to ask daisy to marry be not quite certain when must do so then there outlined behind darkness of closed lid jeannie face with great dark eye mass of hair growing low on forehead witchery of smiling mouth so perhaps cat jim crowfoot though little previous be not so wrong about reality of question on must make up mind jeannie announced intention of going to church next morning at breakfast victor braithwaite who be sitting by professed similar ecclesiastical leaning jeannie have apparently completely recovered from piano mood of evening before commented severely on sunday habit of christian country personally taxed one who have at present come down with having have intention whatever of going to church accusation appeared particularly well founded in middle of lord lindfield entered good morning lord lindfield said alice be catching hot morning from jeannie who have be accusing by name individually of being heathen worse than heathen said jeannie briskly oh good morning lord lindfield did see worse than heathen because heathen know better alice must come be landlady of bray must set example be so hot said alice take out carriage on sunday like to give coachman opportunity of going to church give fifty two year said motor be eating head off remarked lindfield will drive do come with mr halton oh thanks will walk said mr braithwaite be coming with jeannie rose a spoke went out through french window into garden half past ten then mr braithwaite said lindfield helped to dish on side table ca stand being called heathen said will go to church too victor soon strolled out after jeannie hang jeannie said want to go to church with now tom lindfield say be coming considering how much oh well never mind jeannie looked hastily round found have garden to took arm how much have seen of how little have said quite correct be difficult guess will be cunning victor said half past ten quite loud did let meet in manner of conspirator at garden gate at quarter past turned towards house again jeannie detached arm from remember promise dear said be be yours never doubt that day there be possible cause for doubting conspirator plan succeeded to admiration lord lindfield daisy with somewhat faint intentioned gladys have waited in hall till quarter to eleven then be discovered that jeannie have not be seen in house since ten gladys victorious over faint intention have stopped at home while daisy lord lindfield walked rapidly to church arriving there in middle of psalm jeannie have be gaily apologetic afterwards have not heard at breakfast that anybody except mr braithwaite meant to go to church coming home paired off with daisy at lunch again there be when appeared two vacant place one between willie carton one of cat other next lord lindfield walked quietly round table to take first of instead of going to nearest chair for afternoon there be several possibility jeannie appealed to said must like to go up to boulter lock see ascot sunday crowd that appeared be very easy of management a lord lindfield must punt up will be delightful said jeannie daisy dear have simply set eye on do let go up together lord lindfield will punt will be blest pair of siren of extraordinarily diverse age will give apple of discord to one of if give will never speak to again lord lindfield will take up will have two apple said then daisy will of want have be last of arrangement be like mr halton such be opinion of cat to manage thing like there must be doubt that when launch noah ark punt met below boulter must be found that daisy have convenient headache three vessel met there on punt be lord lindfield daisy alone mr halton seemed have stopped at home there be explanation have simply not come preferring not to nobody must understand least of lord lindfield have swum further away daisy have not have very amusing time punting appeared to monopolize attention of punter chapter xx day throughout greater part of next jeannie kept up with chill politeness composure attitude towards lord lindfield at rate found maddening what made more maddening be that to rest of party behaved with eager geniality be so characteristic of only when be there when addressed directly something must come over manner can only be compared to forming of film of ice over pool to acquaintance merely must have be unnoticeable even to friend if have happened only once twice might have passed undetected a be must not fail to see that be there must fail to puzzle wit over what cause of might be during day tried to get word with in private seemed to anticipate intention contrived that must be impossible for request to be made once however just after return afternoon from boulter lock have managed to say to there be nothing matter be there with complete politeness have replied have just touch of cold be nothing thanks thereupon have taken up newspaper remarked to lady nottingham that eton harrow match seemed to have be extraordinarily exciting now man unless be definitely in love with enthralled by woman will if have anything may be called spirit stand sort of thing tamely lindfield honestly examined to see if in aught have offended must find cause of offence in then went through series of conflicting unsettling emotion told that for reason have wished to get on intimate term with then curiosity whatever be being satisfied have merely opened hand into have taken so to speak wiped hand off seemed to very mean heartless proceeding there be have clearly done if woman chose to behave like to man only rejoinder consistent with ordinary dignity self respect be to take notice at dismiss from mind clearly be right thing to do instead of doing right thing first felt angry then sick at heart woman witch be really rather cruel cast spell over one then rode away on broomstick disregarding poor wretch over whom have cast be left to go mooning about until in merciful course of nature spell began to lose potency die out then again must remember dignity of man repeat to determination to dismiss incomprehensibility from mind challenge daisy to silly game poor wretch must accept with avidity game whatever be soon seemed to lose edge gaiety there be something have clearly gone wrong daisy guessed what be guess be fairly correct seemed to that for couple of day aunt jeannie have to put quite bluntly run after lord lindfield have pretty well caught up too for daisy be fair minded enough to see that have not be very agile in getting away from have be quite glad to be caught up be evidently charmed by then clearly about time of own headache something have happened daisy must see aunt jeannie though positively melting with geniality charming warmth to everybody else turned on shoulder be absolutely frozen why have done daisy must not help guessing solution be that jeannie have be tremendously attracted by then suddenly seen that somehow must do perhaps at point sight daisy have caught of aunt victor braithwaite together in garden supplied gap in explanation daisy did not like to think that be for in truth if be there be doubt that darling aunt jeannie have be flirting a aunt jeannie have quite ceased to flirt daisy be more than willing to forgive for misery of two dreadful day be even willing to forget only lord lindfield be clear to did not quite forget be altogether unlike for little while must be uproariously cheerful then gaiety must go out without gutter like candle suddenly taken out into gale of wind then perhaps eye must stray about till for moment fastened on jeannie who be probably a entranced by general joy of life a have be minute before then must look puzzled then angry then puzzled again be passing in jeannie mind concealed with supreme success so that nobody must possibly tell that anything be passing there that have current going along below surface have current be going in direction have willed to set for that flowed in so strong tide hated flowing of hated who have set moving be playing deep game one have required wit to invent tact to play during sunday day followed observed effect of move though hating be well satisfied with result with tail of eye with ear even while be in full swing of preposterous discussion punctuated with laughter with jim crowfoot must observe lord lindfield must see perplexity anger must hear attempt to talk laugh a if there be nothing to trouble must note before long sudden change in tone short monosyllable of answer quenched laugh be much with daisy mr halton did not mind that indeed be a must have have for be clear how little daisy have power to hold be just that be beginning now to perceive wanted to understand very completely to have sink down into nature till became part of yes diplomacy be prospering well already fruit of be swelling on tree might be salutary be certainly bitter chapter xxi jeannie went that night to lady nottingham room to talk to be feeling very tired not with sound wholesome tiredness be precursor of long sleep refreshed awakening with restless fatigue of frayed nerve disquiet mind lead to intolerable tossings turning long vigil through varying grey of dawn first chirrupings of bird have not come for long dear said have to tell somebody about about what be happening be going so well too alice saw trouble in jeannie face a matter of fact have seen trouble in other face have have word with said know what be happening seem to have have nothing to say to lord lindfield day thought perhaps have given up be too hard for dear wonder found must not compass gave little impatient sound nerve be sharply on edge dear alice said be not very clever of thought must see however be quite glad for if be sure daisy doe be getting respite from daisy well daisy loathing of method like probably think have given back to jeannie be prowling up down room rather in manner of restless caged thing in spite of tiredness disquietude seemed to lady nottingham that have never seen look so beautiful looked kind genial sympathetic for sheer beauty though rather formidable there be two word to sit down jeannie said alice quietly be only exciting tell about understand nothing seems jeannie paused moment in walk then fell to pacing room again be not exciting said be exciting stir up by walking be merely attempting not very successfully to walk excitement off oh alice what wild beast be at bottom prey prey prey be one of instinct that nice woman be rarely conscious of doubt whether be ever quite dormant yes come later will explain from beginning beginning of be easy said be perfectly easy for woman to capture attention of man like even when be seriously thinking of getting married to girl there be difficulty in making take to concert in making neglect daisy first two day liked immensely oh alice here be first extra difficulty liked became friend mentioned word friend openly a applied to felt like like man who get wild bird to sit on hand eat out of in order to grab if not to wring neck to put into cage meant to put into cage shut door go away then yesterday afternoon in punt just after have made discovery that be friend confided in told be going to settle down marry judge of rage disappointment saw that effort up till then have be quite useless be still meaning to marry a be right poor dear told news to friend daisy name did not come in something made break off flash of lightning think beginning of storm must have found something to divert conversation otherwise be much better in view of what have to do must not officially know to whom hoped to be married already calming effect of telling trouble to friend be being felt by jeannie sat down on sofa near window clasping hand behind head looking not at alice into dark soft night little rain be falling hissing among bush saw then said that have made stupid mistake have thought that by mere friendliness sympathy making agreeable making admire did doe must get away from daisy see now how impossible be if be who be going to take away must feel more than that will not leave girl intended to marry unless fall in love in own manner with one else alice believe be doing so jeannie paused moment hate said ca help being immensely interested now for part understand part made think that have given up be bold game believe correct one dropped d r o p drop why simply in order that might miss of course risked failure might have shrugged shoulder wondered why have taken so much trouble to flirt with gone straight away resumed operation with daisy did go straight back to daisy do think be getting on very nicely more see of now more think about say have kind thought of be puzzled doe dismiss be angry instead hurt show want will never propose to daisy while feel like there be short silence then lady nottingham said do mean want to make propose to yes monosyllable came very dryly unimportantly a if to perfectly commonplace inquiry then lady nottingham in turn got up jeannie restlessness disquiet seemed to have transferred to be intolerable role said can not play with love like be playing head tail with man life worse be playing with very soul month afterwards will be who will be playing with woman soul said jeannie quietly can not call love with sort of man how many time have be in love have happened to be only making chance woman with whom happens to think in love at time when proposes to settle down marry will propose marriage therefore to lady nottingham air of comfort have quite left plump contented face be puckered into unusual wrinkle said ca imagine act like jeannie be jeannie eye grew suddenly sombre oh dear be said though be glad be be stranger to hope a rule play pitch toss with other men soul there be circumstance have now arisen in see other way at cost to will fulfil promise to diana will do best that daisy will never know care what cost yet be not quite true do care because like can not measure possible suffering against daisy be through that need of doing have come have got to suffer for assure be alone who pay be also jeannie rose yet know if will succeed said may look with scornful wonder on somewhat mature charm may though really expect still intend to settle down marry daisy will accept if doe have seen enough to know will then have to tell hope may not happen took up candle must go to bed said for be dog tired feel so fretted now have told wish did not like must not care if did not good night dear alice next day until evening jeannie continued tactic genial eager sympathetic with others treated lord lindfield whenever be necessary to speak to at with unsmiling civility well bred woman accord to man scarcely know doe not wish to know better day saw growing effect of policy for day grew more perplexed more preoccupied with gave opportunity of speaking with alone for have planned day occupation so that be time in company of others hour by hour trouble increased did trouble spare daisy nothing must be clearer to eye with such absolute naturalness did jeannie manage situation than now at rate be standing quite aloof from lord lindfield few day ago daisy have told that be glad aunt liked must be added that to day be equally glad that jeannie apparently did not yet trouble did not spare daisy for if aunt jeannie be utterly changed to lindfield seemed to be utterly changed too be grave anxious preoccupied meaning of escaped girl even a have escaped lady nottingham party have be gradually gathering in verandah before be time to dress for dinner night jeannie propos of dressing bell have just announced that quarter of hour be enough for nimble woman with competent maid throw thing at catch put on said if like drop floor of

on said imagine stiff shirt cuff hitting in eye when maid threw floor of room must look not so much like carnival time a shamble lindfield indeed alone supported jeannie want ten minute said neither more le jim be time for to go else will keep waiting for dinner see that mr halton will be left alone at ten minute past eight at quarter past jeannie heard perfectly turned quickly to lady nottingham alice be true that have post out after dinner said must go write letter then before dressing particularly want to get to town to morrow rose went in at lindfield deliberately got up too followed

little let try after dinner to put straight will find opportunity thanks said be not only word that thanked jeannie maid must have be first rate hand at throwing if by simple process produced in quarter of hour that exquisite finished piece of apparelling appeared at half past eight true be jeannie who wore jewel dress hair be that rose in black billow above shapely head dress may be said be worthy of wearer still if be to be arrived at by throwing thing maid be generally felt must be competent hurler so happened that everybody be extremely punctual that night jeannie though quite sufficiently so last to appear lady nottingham be even just beginning to allude to necessary quarter of hour when came in lord lindfield saw first be talking to daisy turned from in middle of sentence said by gad might have be by gad be by worth four shade of grey pearl mr beaumont distinctly thought that be not sort of dress to dash into face of quiet country party be like letting off rocket at five o'clock tea only woman must dissect enormity of men just stared know be not more than one minute late said lord lindfield alice have told to lead to doom be to take in alice have told have chapter xxii seemed to lord lindfield that dinner be over night with unusual swiftness that have scarcely sat down when rose again for woman to leave room yet short though seemed have be momentous hour for in hour perplexity anger have made very blood so bitter to during last two day have be charmed away from instead love like splendid fever of spirit burned there until jeannie have be friendly be with again have not known bad a last two day have be how deeply intimately missed friendship even merely frank friendly intercourse have become wine to thirsted longed for even now that be restored to mounted to head with sort of psychic intoxication yet be gift have for whole world of friend what if there be something for behind must be alone not world something to wine be a water at dinner have be side showed to world there be better coming have promised talk night by that knew well did not mean just intercourse of dinner talk table might share in talk like have have before by roadside when motor broke down in punt while thunderstorm mounted in hard edged coppery cloud up sky last thing have spoken of then be friendship have told remembered how hoped to settle down marry hoped that must of own accord speak of friendship again must be thing of good omen for again a before must speak of hope of settling down marrying only must speak of differently now for hour have struck there be choice of deliberation possible more to did not look on picture of quiet domesticity more find pleasing did not look on count up year settle with content have just one grain of resignation in that be time for to make what be called home looked at jeannie from ocean of love billow came bore off foot took seaward beauty of face soft curve of neck grace suppleness of body be no longer a have be case till now whole of woman whom loved now be material part of believed knew that loved something be more essentially jeannie than loved soul spirit late love have come to for life have stifled possibility of growth by being content with what be more material at last have dawned on stood now on threshold of world be a new a be bewildering yet for bewilderment saw at glance how real be how true be light of sun that shone there made shadow till now have thought to be in so radiant be about half past ten when jeannie lord lindfield cut out of bridge table simultaneously have be playing in billiard room strolled out together talking in hall outside pleasant place of book shadow corner jeannie paused held out hand to lord lindfield said have be most utter beast to last two day be sorry be indeed have got perfect right to ask for explanation there be be best explanation of ca get behind will then be generous shake hand let go on where left off took hand be exactly condition must have made said what that must go on where left off do remember what be talking about have sat down in low chair by empty fireplace drew close up to hers at right angle to just above be pair of shaded candle so that sitting little further off be in shadow whereas soft light fell full on to have seen face more clearly might have known that task be already over daisy have become shadow to that be eager burning to put coping stone on to what have accomplished remembered scene in punt remembered that immediately after have spoken of friendship like friend have confided to intention of settling down marrying time therefore must speak in more unmistakable way yes yes remember indeed said be last good hour have have between be not blaming lord lindfield except perhaps just little bit leant forward voice trembled why do blame asked even little bit jeannie laughed think can tell said must get scarlet yet know think must make laugh too be always good thing to laugh so turn away look at when be scarlet since be unbecoming well blame little bit because be little bit tactless charming woman one anyhow who be trying to be charming have just be talking to about friendship sighed smile in yawn a be do know browning be dear said ' be going to settle down marry ' now not word be going to scold have be two girl talking together have just made vow of friendship must have be utterly tactless for one to choose that exact moment for saying be going to be married be sure two boy in similar condition must ever have done thing again jeannie laughed sound so funny now said be such snub suppose thought be getting on too nicely oh how funny have never have thing happen to before so blame just little bit be rather depressed already thunderstorm be coming be going to be sunday so wanted everybody to be particularly nice to gave little odd awkward sort of laugh jerked little more forward in chair may look said believe be scarlet besides have to say be sorry ca say be sorry to carpet jeannie paused for moment before replied something in voice though still must not see face clearly startled sounded changed somehow full of something suppressed something serious must not risk second fiasco have to play high card out hope for triumph need say said so let pas to what suggested what must have made told condition of forgiving friendship what beautiful word in what big one how little most people mean by man say be woman friend because lunch with once month woman say be man friend because have taken drive round hyde park in middle of afternoon jeannie sat more upright in chair leaning forward towards then saw more clearly hunger of face bright shining of eye endorsed what have heard in voice yet be not certain not quite certain oh believe most of understand friendship at said be not characteristic of race to let feel most english people hate love make friend in earnest think one have to go south south east to find hate love friend just a one have to go south to find sun do know persian poet what say of friend ' book of verse underneath bough loaf of bread jug of wine thou beside singing in wilderness wilderness be paradise enow ' ah be more notion of friendship
