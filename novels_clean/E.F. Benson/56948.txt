port of kingdom have reacted on bracebridge fresh avenue of villa have sprung up mushroom like for accommodation business men who liked to get away in evening from crowded street crackle of cobble stone while simultaneously opening of new railway work at bracebridge have implied erection of mile upon mile of workman dwelling from business point of view to who have business in town be very satisfactory circumstance provided that be sufficiently wide awake to keep pace with growing demand not by letting demand get ahead of provision for cause permit to spring up rival establishment keeling be hardly necessary to state have fallen into such drowsy error growth of bracebridge in particular of avenue of villa housed so many excellent customer have always be kept pace with indeed

prosperity stretched round sunny spacious have doubt in own mind a to whether have not be worth while to devote thirty year of busy life in order to attain reward of effort namely establishment of large remunerative business enjoyment of income of fifth part provided with that must want in way of material comfort complete ease in living seemed to perfectly satisfactory return for industry a far a must see there be further expansion possible in bracebridge have attained limit of commercial prosperity there if be to devote energy now still in zenith to further increase of fortune knew that expansion must take form of establishing fresh branch of business in other town did not for moment doubt ability to succeed elsewhere a have succeeded here for have not in course of sober industrious

of family even mother daughter of p o captain even alice for french german music lesson with girlhood have be made so laborious time have not keeling found hard to define thought to certain unobtrusive certainty of after three year only of public school be a much personal possession of john a brown eye white teeth quality have grown even a john stature have grown time came back for holiday be produced apparently by mere association with gentleman little a keeling thought of mr silverdale be aware that mr silverdale have that quality too might be silly affected unmanly when john ten day ago have sat opposite other on sunday evening john sick disgusted silverdale familiar self advertising though appeared to talk about drunkard be easy to see that belonged to different class from rest of keeling admired envied quality whatever be produced difference since association with who have produced saw reason to suppose that be out of reach there be plenty of people in bracebridge who possessed except at meeting on official occasion did not come in contact with a ex fishmonger a proprietor managing director of store moved in society quite distinct from to whom john be learning so quickly to belong must see tellingly contrasted with other if cared to walk along alfred street past church where be so regular attendant on sunday to where there stood side by side two social club

did not suppose that colonel crawshaw canon arbuthnot lord inverbroom discussed omar khayyam morte darthur more than did alderman james town councillor phillips there be soil from culture sprang just a from sprang that indefinable air of breeding already observed in john one day have seen john standing in window there with colonel crawshaw son who be schoolfellow of john keelings heart have swelled with strange mixture of admiration envy to see how much john be at ease sitting on arm of big chair with nameless insouciance of respect refusing cigarette colonel crawshaw have offered lord inverbroom stood by john john be perfectly at ease in surroundings be tiny instance none must have be more typical keeling wanted with want of thirsty man not so much to belong to county club a to feel at ease there if did belong be roused from quarter of hour reverie most unusual to in middle of morning by entrance of one of porter with card on tray lordship be waiting sir said want to know if can see for ten minute keeling took card found to concern man of whom have moment be thinking lord inverbroom be lord lieutenant of county who lived six mile outside bracebridge in house famed for library picture owner have held office in last conservative cabinet be now indefatigable promoter of county interest keeling met with tolerable frequency on various board there be one in world for whom entertained profounder respect ill see said show up next moment lord inverbroom entered be small spare highly finished in face wore extraordinarily shabby clothes of one least of be conscious good morning mr keeling said with great cordiality owe thousand apology for intruding have quite decent excuse excuse necessary lord said keeling please take chair thanks now wont occupy time more than can help have come to consult about county hospital of a know be chairman have meeting in hour from now notice of by mistake never reached till morning thats excuse for descending on like paused

like to be able to tell that such project be will be under consideration what sum do require asked keeling eighteen thousand pound mean twenty said keeling probably mean twenty assented lord inverbroom must pay suppose four five per cent on loan keeling tapped table impatiently with finger be business in opinion rotten business considering last year there be deficit said where must get money to pay interest must be managed think may say must guarantee how about repayment of loan asked keeling how will be guaranteed hospital be working at loss dont mind so much appeal can be made to wipe off small deficit on working expense institution be working at loss cant get further loan from public body without giving security for repayment at least if be on public body must resign place rather than consent to what sort of balance sheet must have to show taxpayer lord thats quite out of question secretly wondered at obtuseness of man who have thought scheme within wildest range of possibility for must not have lent sixpence either of own of public money on enterprise yet knew that lord inverbroom have be foreign secretary of outstanding eminence diplomatic large viewed one who have earned well merited confidence of public without doubt have great quality did not appear to embrace smallest perception on subject of business lord inverbroom nodded to rose quite see point mr keeling said now put to so plainly only wonder did not think of before be afraid will have melancholy meeting a spoke became aware that keeling be not paying smallest attention to appeared unconscious of finger still tapped desk be frowning at ink bottle then dismissed a if settled be occupying mind how much have be spent on new wing already asked approximately eight thousand pound will be thrown away unless raise twenty thousand more not permanently thrown away hope will give return in way of hospital accommodation new wing on guarantee be urgently needed asked keeling can assure of keeling

heavily padded at edge so that clack of typewriter hardly reached be not keelings usage to take step concerning finance business without considering where step must take though consideration must often be condensed into moment insight thought of sudden munificence with regard to hospital occupied mind when settled down to work again a little a did thought of new typist whom have just shut up in stuffy little chamber adjoining own momentary a have be time required for offer determination to make be logical next step in secret ambition have so long be growing in mind indeed interview with

generally must learn identity of benefactor until at opening name of new wing must flash on assembled gathering that opening must be day of pomp magnificence in course of time must talk over with lord inverbroom at present have plenty of occupation to concern with noticing very fluent clacking came faintly from behind padded door filed account have found so satisfactory buried in business again be barely four oclock when miss propert came in with sheaf of typewritten correspondence for inspection signature have thought that must occupy for at least hour longer a read over looked for sign of carelessness must betray haste rather than speed none such revealed have done be exceedingly accurate neat showed trace of hurry passed sheet over to when have read signed for to place in envelope looking across table without raising eye noticed decision swiftness of finger a folded paper with sharp accurate crease liked seeing thing handled like be way to do job whether job be giving of wing

through book department where nodded to propert into bustle of square noticing with satisfaction never failed a walked by various door of block of building how busy be traffic in out of store be still hour to sunset on left municipal office town hall rose pretentious hideous against blue of southern sky while in front to west gray gothic glory of cathedral separated from square by line of canonical house aspired high above house roof leaf laden elm tower in close fact struck that front of town hall with wealth of fussy adornment meaningless row of polished marble pilaster foolish little pinnacle finial be somehow strangely like drawing room in own house with decoration selected by amazingly futile taste of wife there be very similar confusion of detail about two kindred ostentation of unnecessary object there be waste in expense be not represented on other side of ledger by credit balance of efficiency one took pleasure in little pink granite pilaster between light of window in

for if be directly useful be worth paying for where be return on money spent on pink pilaster on lily painted on huge looking glass above wife drawing room chimney piece lily certainly be not useful since prevented mirror exercising proper function of reflecting what stood in front of did yield dividend in pleasure to emmeline did not believe that did felt sure that have just bought no drawing room suite dining room suite with extra a set forth in catalogue knew catalogue well with extra suite came to have much in common with front of town hall so too if came to consider have crocodile with calling card in abominable hall day a miss propert have already discovered in little stuffy den be exceedingly hot airless keeling when have passed through reverberating square under arch leading into cathedral close found pleasant to sit down on one of bench below elm tree soared loftily among tomb of disused graveyard facing west front of cathedral owing to miss properts rapidity in typewriting have left store hour earlier than usual here thanks to be hour of leisure gained for have imperative employment quiet gray graf with head stone standing out from smooth mown grass formed foreground behind sprang flying buttress of nave be intensely different from decoration of town hall have a for ignorance in architecture must see obvious purpose to serve like arm of strong man akimbo gave sense of strength like leg of strong man propped that glorious trunk be decorated be true decoration served useful purpose somehow carved stone work appeared work of love fantasy done for pleasure of performance ecstasy of hammer chisel of who wielded be like flame on edge of smouldering log of wood felt sure that man who have executed have enjoyed work at least man who have planned have planned might say for fun elsewhere on battlemented angle of nave be grotesque gargoyle of devil bat nameless winged thing with lead spout in mouth to carry off rain water from roof commercially might perhaps have be omitted more economical device of piping have served same purpose have about certain joy of execution there be imagination in something justified for nightmare hideousness people who made laughed in heart executed strange dream put up there to glorify god man who perpetrated little pink granite pilaster on town hall man who painted lily on looking glass above mr keelings drawing room chimney piece have nothing to justify lily pilaster be manner of good there be difference between flying buttress gargoyle latter gave pleasure paid dividend to one who looked at so did verse in omar khayyam to who cared to read be justified too in way that drawing room suite be not justified for with extra cost purchaser dimly like moving of unborn child sense of beauty that profitless thing without there be profit in concern of world began to trouble keeling with livelier indication of life than that have yet experienced from in disconnected way be connected with john education lord inverbrooms manner denizen of window of county club a opposed to who more numerously gathered in window of town club next door propert salesman in book department have cousinship to men who made gargoyle beautiful book whereas emmeline be only cousin to pilaster in town hall drawing room suite properts sister according to brother account have same type of relationship a main point about be swiftness in shorthand writing accuracy of transcription on to typewriting machine keeling have never have secretary who finished heavy day work in so short time owed extra half hour leisure have led to appreciation of gargoyle buttress of cathedral for thirty year have passed way almost daily until to day have never seen before in sense that seeing mean digestion of sight behind where sat ran thick set hedge of clipped hornbeam bordering asphalt walk led through graveyard be still in full leaf completely screened from passenger going through close there have be many passenger going along path there have heard score of sentence spoken a passed within yard of behind hornbeam hedge sentence after sentence have entered ear without being really conveyed to brain then suddenly close behind heard voice speaking very distinctly said so horrid to work for cad charles havent done before oh know be awfully kind to voice merged into buzz of autumn noise footstep other conversation have stood apart distinct keeling knew recognised voice for moment must not put name to owner be woman voice very distinct pleasant in tone in order to satisfy sudden unreasonable curiosity got up from seat looking out down path over hornbeam hedge saw few yard down path head of book department sister very efficient secretary typewriter whom have engaged that morning head be turned to other there be doubt about identity well nothing must possibly matter le to so seemed at moment than what typewriter thought about that mattered be what thought about typewriter whom considered very efficient young woman who got through work with extraordinary accuracy speed did not care two straw whether considered cad for what signified opinion of girl whose sole connection with be nimbleness of finger employed at twenty five shilling week a long a did work well might take view chose about employer who for part have view about except concerned with speed accuracy of transcription then even a assured that be a indifferent to opinion a moon found hating fact that thought cad why have thought that asked have be perfectly polite to with icy aloofness of employer have even melted little from for have opened door for to go into typewriting den because hand be full of paper composed work why cad then gave order to mind to dismiss matter with long striding sauntering walk carried so quickly over ground continued way homewards despite determination found that thought went hovering back to unfortunate unintentional piece of eavesdropping wondered whether charles propert agreed with sister a if mattered quite strongly hoped that did not certainly keeling have be kind enough generous enough to then more decidedly still pished whole subject away there be other thing in world to think about for next week miss propert continued to display galaxy of unvarying excellence in duty keeling though told that have dismissed overheard criticism from mind altogether perhaps believed that have done so acted towards in sundry little way a if consciously deprecated opinion sought to change weather for instance continuing very hot ordered electric fan to be placed in small stuffy den where did work saying nothing about to setting going while be absent for hour interval in middle of day on occasion when be sitting at table with hat on took off a entered on third cleared space for to write at when came to receive dictation for morning in part though must have denied dislike of verdict on prompted infinitesimal courtesy in part incentive dictated vaguely distantly be beginning to mean something to personally be acquiring significance apart from duty began to notice not only speed efficiency of finger comely shape of hand began to heed not only distinctness of voice a read over shorthand transcript to quality reminded rather of john voice oftener oftener a dictated correspondence looked up with gray eye set deep below bushy eyebrow at quiet handsome face hardly ever raised eye to somehow perfect fulfilment of complete duty of secretary devoid of other human relationship to began to pique treated a if have existence apart from function a employer have never before have so ideal secretary so intelligent accurate piece of office furniture now having got be inconsistent enough to harbour smothered wish that be shade more human in dealing with wished that must not call sir so invariably whenever spoke to looked out for smallest indication on part of being conscious of in human manner such indication appeared complete absence of vexed though a often a vexed vexation be smallest of annoyance strenuously denied to that feeling existed at in mind have made engagement with brother that must come up one sunday afternoon fortnight after miss propert have entered

be open through must just see hand arranging paper on table rest of be invisible a spoke in voice loud enough to be heard by observed that hand paused in deft speed of tidying remained quite motionless for second two knew a well a if flawless telegraphic communication have be set up between brain that be debating in mind whether must come not thought cad doubt wanted to see book be message came to from keeling nodded towards room where hand have become busy again knew have heard overheard if will since did not choose to give answer did not choose to convey invitation to again faint stirring of human relationship began at moment to enter into living existence for set up little screen of pride must have done have there not be something ever so small to screen will ask said to brother be in there waited hat stick in hand while couple of sentence passed between then charles came out be very much obliged to sir said will be very much pleased to come damned condescending of thought keeling to what right have secretary at twenty five shilling week to send message through brother if message be to be sent be glad be that one keeling received two next afternoon in secret garden have taken trouble to bring in couple of more comfortable chair for first time looked at secretary without sundering spectacle of employer on instant became aware that on side have so to speak taken off blinker of employed be here a guest asked by personally because wished to welcome show book eye instead of being glued to work met with frank cordiality be not accustomed to shake hand with brother on sunday visit here girl advanced to with hand out presupposing welcome whatever hesitancy might have have in accepting invitation have by fact of accepting put indecision completely away for

still lingering in attitude towards sat down in one of big chair that keeling have brought in be purpose for have fetched for moment put on employer spectacle again to observe unusual sight of secretary sitting unbidden while stood then girl complete unconscious certainty that knew how to behave whisked from in front of eye again saw only guest sitting there to whom be due power of entertaining interesting charles tell go in for beautiful book rather than rare one said charles have told mr keeling about official italian book on leonardo be going to mention to to day sir said

darthur may look at be one have never seen ah what page what type for next hour three burrowed into nibbled at keelings volume now losing completely in interest be in common between now for moment conscious of mutual relation a employer employed interval grew rarer in keelings mind be replaced by new consciousness of secretary with mask off on part found difficulty in separating employer from mr keeling with really wonderful collection of beautiful modern book indeed there be little in common between hobby be like thawing sun of february uncongealed ice of office a long a shone on melting seemed not le than complete break up of frost lord inverbroom life near doe not asked thats wonderful library be public allowed to see suppose not must not trust charles within arm length of caxton if have one kind of remarked charles sister designed cut book plate for sir keeling saw out of corner of eye just shake head at brother instantly changed subject reason seemed clear enough in midst of wall of book have such decoration need not have shown such delicacy thought to for have notion of ordering plate from very soon rose must be off charles said if be to have walk thank so much mr keeling for showing treasure be sorry be going made attempt to detain presently be walking back along still sunny road with brother im sorry called cad said he only cad in office perhaps dear did see

autumnal light faded mother dozed quietly in chair having let book fall from lap for third time alice short sightedly peering at almost completed leaf must have suffered eye to drop out of head rather than relinquish work be sewing little fibre shred of heart into pomegranate leaf gave most exquisite satisfaction to do so must have be easy so simple obviously minded person must think for to have turned on electric light have saved eye there be subtler more compelling reason stood in way of doing that first be that light must almost certainly awaken mother who by beginning to talk again a always did when nap have refreshed must put end to alices private reflection flourished best in dusk in silence second reason be that be more than likely that mr silverdale must presently drop in for tea be decidedly more interesting to be found sitting at work with profile outlined against smouldering glow of sunset than to be sitting under le becoming glare of electric lamp for same reason did not put on spectacle must otherwise have worn leaf be finished when mother began to talk with such suddenness that alice wondered for moment whether be talking in sleep gist of remark be slightly too consecutive to admit of supposition though look very odd said beginning to give utterance to reflection in middle of sentence that father hugh must go to cathedral while go to st thomas cathedral be very draughty thats what always say with autumn cold due if not overdue must be flying in face of providence to encourage by sitting in draught a for incense confession voice suddenly ceased again a if tap be turned off by external agency alice wisely made reply of kind feeling sure that in minute two mother must begin to give vent to faint snoring betokened that have gone to sleep again that did not interrupt flow of ecstatic musing whereas mother general attitude to novel institution be so precious to gave tendency to strong shudderings only hour ago mr keeling have said that be sure saw nothing wrong in confession must not mind going if must think of anything worth telling mr silverdale about alice have drawn in breath sharply when mother said that a if with pang of spiritual toothache there came slight sound from drawing room next door must have be inaudible to expectant ear alice bent over work with more intense industry then door opened very softly mr silverdale looked in be dressed in black cassock have long wooden shepherd crook in hand saw alice seated in window saw mr keeling with mouth slightly open eye completely shut in corner of sofa rose to happiest level

pomegranate foliage with far greater distinctness never before have have so vivid interest in life a during last two month indeed greater part of female section of congregation at st thomas have experienced similar quickening of emotion livelier iris burnished up dove of villa in alfred road iris in question of course be effect of personality of cuthbert silverdale if be not a averred being spoiled blame did not lie with parishioner have discovered a doubt meant to do that soldier saint have come among missioner crusader vied with other in adoring decorative obedience making banner

sent in counterblast to alice keeling with other enthusiastic young lady have forwarded within couple of day far more voluminously signed document quoting prayer book of edward vi in support of pastor according to pastor interpretation of at wednesday lecture on history of english church cuthbert silverdale be not unaware of emotion have roused in so many female breast be impossible to acquit of sort of clerical complacency in knowledge so many young lady gazed gazed on with mixture of religious personal devotion though firm believer in celibacy of clergy did not feel debarred from sentimental relation with married unmarried member of flock indeed very fact that nothing must conceivably come of little mawkishness made appear perfectly licit held hand took arm sat at knee called dear girl two three at time finding safety perhaps in number not wishing to encourage false hope be incorrigible if innocent flirt licensed lap dog practising familiarity if indulged in by ordinary layman must assuredly have led to kicking in curious manner quite succeeded in deceiving a to propriety of affectionate demonstration considered sort of brother to young lady who worked for with industry more than excitement of devoted sister to do justice be just a familiar with male member of congregation patted boy on back linked arm in theirs must be idle to contend that got a much satisfaction out of male embrace there be question however about devotion strenuousness of life congregation in spite of secession of such plain men a mr keeling crammed church to door spilt into street kindled religious fervour in parish terror of hell a set forth by predecessor have be unable to fan into blaze in thoroughly cheap in masterly intelligible manner preached gospel in life practised by incessant personal exertion of others a well a be very conscious be more surface than essential self be so deplorable mass of affectation amorousness horror inspired in mind of certain

finger from others when be holding cup glass be ten in mr silverdale dr inglis completing number a be usual at table of generous housekeeper mr keeling there be vast quantity of nitrogenous food provided in many course be not till nine that dining room door be opened on run by mr silverdale to let lady leave room made suitable remark to a passed julia fyson alice with waist arm interlaced stopped to talk to a went out precisely at moment while be in gothic hall together boy covered with button opened front door admitted norah propert door into dining room be still being held wide by silverdale a interlaced young lady answered humorous lament over setting of sun now that lady be leaving through keeling standing at head of table saw norah there have have one moment for thought a front door be opened to light from hall streamed full on to step judged better to come in than having be already seen retreat again without looking up walked across to library door while still mr fyson stared let in heard dining room door opposite close again while fumbled for switch of electric light heard indistinguishable murmur from hall only one caught ear intelligibly when mr keeling said oh mr keelings typewriter be cataloguing book have begun to snow thickly outside stood for minute two before fire shaking from cloak frozen petal fizzed on coal certainly have felt disconcertment at moment of entry passage through hall have found fault with ill luck have caused to meet gorged galaxy from dining room on one only night when brother have not be with encounter did not long trouble like warmth coming over frozen limb fact of being here alone gave thrill of pleasure surprised be in secret garden by without charles to intrude presence without even keeling did not want here now be surrounded with presently plunged like ecstatic diver into work have come to do for soon buzz of men conversation drifted past door prominent among be silverdales expressive high pitched voice without intention found listening for keelings then murmur be cut off by sound of shutting door went on with work on catalogue card faint tinkle of piano be heard a alice performed several little piece faint scream a julia fyson sang keeling be there doubt still did not want in bodily presence be more completely with in room empty for have settled in own mind to get away before party broke up grew absorbed in work came with something of surprise shock to when again heard gabble of mixed voice outside saying what pleasant evening have have realized that must wait till compliment be finished have not yet written note keeling have asked to leave on table regarding brother health did now a waited giving promising account of soon front door closed for last time leaving silence in hall heard well known foot cross in direction of drawing room pause then come back keeling entered good evening miss propert said want if will to leave work now come into drawing room to talk to wife daughter for few minute while ring for cab for be snowing hard oh must rather not do said norah have got great big overshoe there be filling up corner of room shant mind snow mr keeling go back to drawing room say ive gone be clear to of that same situation that of norah having be seen entering house alone after dinner going to private room be in mind of of norah for part have secret blush for fact that considered incident at reply have revealed that did for remembered that brother have alluded to question of coming up here alone keeling saw absurdity in so to speak regularizing situation solution commended to more than hers must prefer that came be introduced to mr keeling said think be better norah got up smiling at internal blush have filtered through to face if think best will said whatever do dont let waste time here come then said showed way to drawing room where wife alice be standing by fire have brought in miss propert said while be getting cab for to take home be snowing heavily be daughter miss propert mr keeling made great effort with to behave a befitted mayoress daughter of p o captain thought outrageous of husband to have brought girl in here without consulting not being clever enough to see obvious wisdom from standpoint that of girl of doing so have fairness to admit in own mind that be not girl fault mr keeling have told to come into drawing room naturally came therefore behaved to a befitted mayoress talking to typewriter be very grand condescending be sure be very useful to mr keeling said in helping to arrange book must be great treat to to have access to so large library if be fond of reading pretentious solemnity of be not lost on norahs sense of humour be rather annoyed at whole affair be absurd not to see lighter side of answer accordingly yes be very lucky said be lucky in london too where have access to library at british museum seemed very proper speech to mr keeling be delivered in clear pleasant tone with appearance of respect must not make out why alice gave one of queer crooked smile why said suppose be bigger than father miss propert norah looked up at laughing at guess must say be said decidedly there be something here that mr keeling did not wholly comprehend when did not comprehend called being kept in dark comprehended however that norah be exceedingly good looking that there be certain air about supposed came from reading book simultaneously remembered fyson asking who be who have come in passed into mr keelings library on being informed that lady have said how very odd at once changed subject instantly began to consider if be very odd for present determined that nothing must mar perfect behaviour of mayoress pray sit down miss propert said fancy brother be one of mr keelings clerk too yes usually come with in evening said norah be in bed with very bad cold indeed oh indeed said mr keeling conversation came to dead halt here again mr keeling with growing resentment took in norah from head to foot second be beaten out sonorously by pink clock on chimney piece at last norah now growing thoroughly uncomfortable in hostile atmosphere rose think mr keeling have much better not bother about cab for said can perfectly well walk home mr keeling became shade statelier without abatement of extremely proper behavior mr keeling will do a think wisest about said seemed however not to be in mr keelings power to do what thought wisest for after minute two of ringing silence appeared with news that there be cab to be got be snowing heavily be out norah held out hand to mr keeling wont keep up longer said will walk home at once impossible said there nearly foot of snow now more reason for getting home before there be two said ill see home then said cant go alone indeed will hing of sort said be quite unnecessary absolutely forbid for moment be mere tussle of will between norahs reason be stronger looked at moment knew have won without more word went back to library put on over boot gathered up book slip have made that evening followed a far a hall waited for dont look at foot said gaily be officially invisible like leg of queen of spain grim mouth smiled stern eye grew kindly knew transformation so well now be very obstinate said why dont let walk home with be right said think plan be wrong werent rude to asked growing grim again ah shouldnt have asked that said be exceedingly polite let out into snow felt that fire went with then returned to drawing room where found unquestionable ice little sour wreath of mist be already afloat in mr keelings mind though not yet condensed into actual thought be chilling down to in narrow receptacle alice took embroidery went upstairs wife sat rather upright by fire looking at evening paper held upside down meant to behave with perfect propriety again wished to begin so a to launch propriety on fair even keel for part have known so many of evening when dinner party went away precisely at half past ten be left to hear long comment by wife on soup beef grouse pudding savoury what dr inglis said what mr fyson thought hoped when first came back after seeing norah fade into snow storm that be to be regaled with such reminiscence hoped rather against hope reminiscence came to aid began to be aware from ice bound condition that must expect something far le jovial trivial have accusing conscience if chose to read evening paper upside down in silence must at least read morning paper right way up then a must not give lead make remark be to say to must take exception have to begin must say be surprised at not seeing miss propert home said after bringing into drawing room forcing to be civil to might have have civility to see to house be aware that be intending to exercise dead weight somewhere be not many week ago that have brought into play regarding mr silverdale romish practice when have refused to leave church for simpler rite of cathedral have yielded there because did not really care whether alice chose to attend milliner church not might if liked did not seriously matter dead weight if be intending to exercise over question of norah mattered very much must have pleased better if have seen home asked cant say whether must have be pleased not said didnt happen im sure dont know why sent typewriter in here to talk to dont know what think must find to say to with alice here too have said too much knew moment have said mist have congealed felt obliged a must have expressed say to mr fyson to speak mind did not really speak mind spoke what perfectly groundless jealousy dictated to dropped paper stood up by fireplace said with alice here too said oblige by telling what mean saw that in reasonable frame of mind must not have meant anything be cross surfeited cold in head have spared so long be seriously threatening wanted out of sheer perverseness to defend indefensible position well im sure alice must have thought very odd bringing typewriter into drawing room said didnt mean said keeling mr keeling got up if only want to contradict said can do by thomas im not going to answer that rude girl came in here rude said rude how be rude knew be being unwise in bandying stupid word with wife continued to make accusation want of breeding to use general term did not allow to pas over in silence that knew deserved how be rude repeated said something about british museum library did not understand said because couldnt understand think be rude be that well if have heard say began know did not be quite certain that miss propert be not rude now about alices being here when brought in what of wish to tell if meant anything if did not wish to say so knew quite well that be adopting bullying tone have inclination to be bullied one other of have to be vanquished over be quite determined that must not hold white flag there be something to be fought for something must not give up must allow be very odd that secretary must appear in middle of dinner party said simply stroll across to room have be talking of room half dinner time with mr fyson saying that none of be allowed there then in came girl cut short what have to do with alice repeated be going to say that only always interrupt said then when guest be gone bring in here just a if be julia fyson into drawing room alice well alice must think very odd too just a mr fyson did of course be not that mr fyson thought odd know will try to catch up ask how mr fyson knew be always way thomas know quite well that mr fyson have gone away before brought in here dont want to catch up said only want to know why alice must not be here when bring miss propert in to wait for cab cant give reason because there be reason let get that clear then want to talk about something else suddenly whole of vague internal movement of mind flashed into vision a intelligible a perfectly simple business proposition have certain justification too be awkward that norah have run into exit of lady that wife have be saying that none of ever entered library knew mind of bracebridge pretty well slightly malicious construction that woman like mr fyson must find compelled to put on knew also mind of wife effect clearly have have on sense of propriety of dignity have be assaulted be queer thing to have happened then there be norahs presence in drawing room have insisted on for at moment seemed most straightforward thing to do be beginning to think have be mistake something about girl beauty never have that struck so forcibly a when saw standing by alice air of breeding of education of simplicity in front of draped easel painted looking glass have stirred long latent potentiality for jealousy in wife be that suggestion suddenly enraged dont be such damned fool emmeline said angrily answering own thought have divined hers quite correctly justice lay behind rude speech struck full only course be to take refuge in own propriety knew how to behave well mr keeling said cant expect to say anything more about if want to do be to swear at perhaps must like to swear at again pray do thats said ive told not to be damned fool meant wisest thing can do be to take advice moistened lip very genteelly with tip of tongue then if have finished with said will pas on to other matter said wanted to talk to about by mean mr silverdale be stuffing alices head with ridiculous notion he doing same to other girl of course shes business of yours mine alice be shell soon be fancying in love with if doesnt already do want opinion on subject asked mayoress of course be consulting then think be quite mistaken be great friend mr silverdale have most wonderful spiritual influence over be quite changed be always doing something now for somebody else read to mamma take sunday school be busy happy active mr keeling considered idea be that shes doing for mr silverdale must have read to mother before dr inglis went to cathedral silverdale be somebody shes doing thing for be due to influence certainly know dislike then be opinion doe not agree with other people parishioner generally adore especially young lady of especially silly one can have influence with poor alice without holding hand whispering to he flirt dont like flirt especially who wrap up nonsense in religion cant do something to stop he always coming here isnt dont like that pawing touching saying be spiritual influence mr keeling felt shocked at positively carnal view of mr silverdales tenderness at same time thought have promising aspect besides spiritual one well hope youll not say do anything to put off said practical side of question claiming im sure high time alice be married never yet have taken to young man a shes taken to mr silverdale poor keelings head whirled moment ago wife have said that two be great friend only on spiritual plane now be saying precisely what have begun by contradicting be satisfied however that have true opinion at last did not appear to to be worth anything there be got up if thought silverdale have slightest intention of marrying alice said shouldnt mind how much pawed dont believe have ive good mind to ask indeed hope will hing so indelicate said humorous twinkle came into eye wish must flirt with emmeline said take away from alice perhaps do of clergy flirt with decent looking woman within reach youre twice a handsome a alice also be dreadfully indelicate be not to be wondered at mr keeling cast glance into looking glass where reflection looked out like naiad amid water lily even while reproved husband for broadness of suggestion never heard of such talk said pray dont let have more of for shame went up to bed in far better temper than must otherwise have done quite abandoned idea of lying awake to punish for previous brutality went back to library when wife left where intangible something of norahs presence lingered there be chair have sat in there be note to about brother on table blotting paper on have blotted entry have made on catalogue card took up top sheet held to light so a to be able to read title of book there be author name in big firm capital book title in smaller writing legible have done lot to night for remembered having put clean blotting paper for sheet be covered with impression here have be sitting at work while talked listened to people in drawing room who meant nothing to laid sheet down with impatient exclamation at thought over incident of norahs meeting party of lady in hall mr fyson have thought have so much more mistaken be mr fyson there be nothing odd about at wife have be disposed to take mr fysons view have given opinion on point pretty sharply nothing have ever passed between norah might not with perfect propriety have taken place in middle of market square with mr fyson lady of bracebridge straining eye ear to detect anything must have given one of single thing to think about complete truth of be not whole truth situation be in process of formation underlay truth just now that situation have expressed in eloquent silence when took up blotting paper read what norah have written on card have not given thought to title of book author though probably eye have observed mind have be wholly occupied with knowledge that be who have written be that wife have expressed in manner word be that for have chosen to swear at have given good knock for hinting at have followed up that knock by stupid sort of joke about superiority of charm to of alice be sure to appreciate have done so have said for shame gone simpering to bed perhaps must take mind off other affair sincerely hoped must distrusted stupidity cleverer woman must have probably accepted more superficial truth that there have never passed between norah single intimate word stupid one might easily let dull unfounded suspicion take root in mind be difficult to deal with stupid people never knew where stupidity might break out next emmeline have certain power of sticking mr fyson have brilliant imagination together might evolve odious by product one must fumble shove way into underlying truth got up with shrug of shoulder there be use in making conjecture about perhaps if gave emmeline pearl pendant for birthday fortunately occurred next week must distract mind be impossible to tell about emmeline stupidity be incalculable item went to front door in order to make sure have put chain on then taking off opened door looked out into night snow be still falling fast print of wheel footstep outside be already obliterated mr silverdale have walked home light heartedly predicting jolly good snowballing match with boy next day keeling found detesting mr silverdale with acute intensity norah have walked home also in moment be back in hall putting on mackintosh must have liked to put on boot a well for that must have have to go up to dressing room next door to wife bedroom then gently closing door behind went out into night must just walk a far a house to make sure be not still tramping way through snow traverse street have traversed be absolutely necessary to satisfy about did not care how unreasonable be rational consideration have application emotional dictate made go there be mile of gas lit thoroughfare between

of discomfort absurdity of what have be doing snow be deep evening shoe be wet through mackintosh heavy with clinging flake rational self made voice heard telling what fool errand be in progress heard emotional self heeded nothing of that must not argue must not answer be well satisfied with what have done telling now that be going homewards again that must find there blotting paper on have pressed wet ink of catalogue slip reminding that at nine next morning must see again must attend to interruption thought sufficed for knew that reason prudence be ringing up a be on telephone bell tinkled

altogether exaggerated view of affair when told that situation might easily develop into dangerous one with emotional self to back up knew better than have assured that self control have situation well in hand need not go on summoning be not going to attend in leafless elm above there sang in wintry snow bound night shy strong bird of romance never in life have heard such rapture of melody despite fifty year hard dry business atmosphere of life there be something amazingly boyish in inward agitation in keeling arriving ten minute before time at office next morning awaited norahs coming midnight excursion dictated by imperative necessity from within have even if be not new stage in emotional history revealed chapter already written not yet read by expected too quite irrationally that corresponding illumination must have come to girl that like must have progressed along similar stage pictured telling how have left house in order to have satisfaction of seeing lit window have

smiled when a often happened now small mutual understanding flitted to fro between must easily imagine tone of reply oh how dreadfully foolish of mr keeling want to be laid up too like charles must not say more than there must be that glimmer of comprehension of acceptance showed have share in adventure that allowed looked on with kind eye of friend there be never swifter disillusionment than when came in stood up a have now learned to do at entrance have heard step along passage bird of romance hidden perhaps behind sofa in case of file gave out great jubilant throatful of song next

letter opened for with usual speed a worked must see by soft creased line between eyebrow even a have seen yesterday morning when be anxious about brother that something troubled to day however did not question might tell if felt disposed guessing that be connected with event of last night instinct told that be for to speak be silent then when have opened letter placed by without word took up

remote of bird of romance have sung to from snowy tree assented to fact that people be fool be that end of library catalogue asked must finish thought perhaps must go there for hour in middle of morning when be down here must still get letter done in time for evening post if went there day for hour must get through a much a did on alternate evening knew to be sound sensible plan did not in least wish to assent to in first place must look a if acknowledged basis of reason in wife attitude evening before in second place must no longer have half hour after dinner in library with norah brother knew that have become pearl of day to since people be such fool said doe matter yes think doe dont want to make unpleasantness for asked make none flushed little yes personally dont care two straw charles doe rather keeling stood up im ashamed of myself said brother be perfectly right go down then a suggest in morning well settle like then said be so sorry liked evening didnt object to said a turned eye met again norah knew have done right that knowledge gave atom of satisfaction land agent be announced norah left two together of late year keeling have be buying building site house in bracebridge simpson agent have be instructed to inform of desirable site be coming into market at moment felt singularly little interested in purchase simpson might recommend good morning simpson said what have come about in next room typing machine have begun clacking that came staccato subdued through baize lined door seemed to more momentous than anything agent must tell about well sir there building site just beyond little place began mr simpson coming up next month for sale if make offer now think might get cheap keeling forced mind away from sound came from next door looked at map that agent have spread out purchase did not appeal to too far out said think villa building be being bit overdone anything else said yes sir if youll pay price there important site owner want to sell freehold of site of county club price asked seems rather high then consider club be getting premise absurdly cheap might fairly ask much higher rental suddenly keeling felt interested in clacking of typewriter came to ear no longer what lease have club got asked have ascertained that there be break in next midsummer on side notice to be given at lady day present owner have determined to put up rent then committee believe thought that quite reasonable want cash have instructed to look out for purchaser keeling have that faculty have stood in such good stead life of being able to make up mind quickly when data be put before did not hesitate now ten minute after when detail of ownership present lease be in possession have authorised agent to purchase for gather that owner wish transaction to be private said wish same certainly think have made wise purchase sir said simpson be told that landlord be ex officio member of club good morning sir will have deed made out with lawyer without delay keeling nodded last speech have given something to think about chapter vi mr keeling have much enjoyed sense of added pomp dignity husband mayoralty gave liked seeing placard in street that concert in aid of charity be given under patronage of lady mayoress must rustle into arm chair reserved for in middle of front row with feeling that have got concert up be responsible not only for assistance gave to charity in question for excellence of performance assumed grander more condescending air at party distinctly began to unbend to inhabitant of alfred road instead of associating with a equal knew position a lady mayoress almost seemed to that be who have raised husband to civic dignity when one morning found among letter invitation from lady inverbroom for herself to dine sleep one day early in december at place few mile outside bracebridge be easily able to see through insincerity of lady inverbrooms adding that must give husband such pleasure to show mr keeling library be amiable insincerity emmeline be secretly sure that lady mayoress be desired guest tried without success to control trembling of voice when telephoned to keeling who have just left for store vulgar store gratifying request be quite pleased to accept must detect trembling in voice men controlled feeling better than woman took parlour maid a maid though husband altogether refused to pas off boy covered with button a valet enjoyed moment supreme triumph when be able to reply to lady inverbroom who hoped when showed room that must ask house maid for anything required that have brought own maid then lady inverbroom to hide natural confusion have poked fire for pointed out position of bathroom communicated with bedroom certainly be most convenient dinner must be at past eight mr keeling felt little strange magnificence of great house rather overawed have to remind several time a dressed that be lady mayoress there be quantity of tall liveried footman standing about when went down remembered to put nose in air to about angle at lady inverbrooms be naturally levelled walked by with unseeing eye a if be piece of familiar furniture have soup on silver plate be quite successful in avoiding what must have called scroopy noise made with spoon a fed off unusual material then when lord inverbroom alluded casually to great reynolds over chimney piece flattered that made very apposite remark when after duly admiring said who be heir to beautiful property for be well aware that host be childless there be guest in house except though must have be nice to let slip name of illustrious people when alluding to visit afterwards in bracebridge felt glad at time that there be one else for be on verge of feeling shy must never have done for lady mayoress few small incident during dinner rather surprised once lady inverbroom in helping to hot sauce let drop of fall on finger of footman who handed to instantly turned round in chair said in voice of real concern just a if man have not be piece of furniture beg pardon hope didnt burn after dinner again when cigarette came round be rather astonished at being offered one holding head very high turned abruptly away doubt be mistake there must have be word at cedar next morning if parlour maid have offered cigarette to lady indeed be rather astonished that lord inverbroom lit without first asking if minded perfume what surprised even more than hostess politeness to footman handing of cigarette to herself be husband obvious unconcern with magnificence of surroundings seemed perfectly at ease though there be nothing in manner suggested sort of haughty polish felt be suitable in exalted place behaved a simply a if be at home in fact simplicity almost made wife blush once when on occasion of large puff of smoke coming down chimney said to lord inverbroom can show new cowl will quite stop lord inverbroom did not seem least uncomfortable at sudden peeping out of mercantile cloven hoof merely replied that cowl must prevent that chimney from smoking must be worth weight in gold be very tactful mr keeling be vexed that husband must not leave subject instead laughed said that cowl in question did not cost much more than weight in iron then luckily talk drifted away on to book though mr keeling knew that by rule of polite behaviour husband must have be engaging hostess in light conversation while talked to host keeling lord inverbroom quite lost in discussing italian book with picture have lately appeared lord inverbroom said must not afford must be joke in consequence of two men talking together be left to lady inverbroom a have taken trouble to read small paragraph in society journal that day must give little tit bit of information about movement of king royal family while with ear continued to listen to husband so a to interrupt in case tended to unsuitable topic again be so dumbfoundered when propos of book plate sounded safe enough heard lord inverbroom say that have charming one lately made for by miss propert that apposite talk be engaged in died on lip have just made one for said husband perhaps didnt know that life in bracebridge with brother be secretary typewriter indeed wonder if must let come over here one day must like to show book with book plate in saturday perhaps if be half holiday must come to lunch do think spend afternoon mr keeling be quite horrified longed for husband to tell that miss propert be quite humble sort of person then luckily occurred to that doubt idea be that must have lunch in housekeeper room relieved mind continued to tell lady inverbroom last news from windsor shortly afterwards with little pressing on part of hostess be induced to precede out of dining room leaving men alone new wing of hospital be subject about lord inverbroom wanted to talk to guest for little while engaged open weather have allowed building to go on apace by end of march wing must be advanced enough to permit of opening ceremony board of hospital director must see to lord inverbroom sketched out idea for day ceremony of opening proposed must be in morning for hoped to secure presence of very distinguished personage lunch must follow if mr keeling approved must at luncheon announce name of munificent giver then paused moment mr keeling said think there be doubt that prime minister must wish to submit name to king a recipient of honour in public recognition of munificence must allow in confidence to tell who benefactor be must in case see matter a do be disposed to accept baronetcy may say that think there be slightest doubt that will agree with perhaps first must like to mention to mr keeling keeling have doubt on subject at felt sure wife must have none be not in least snob to wish to be baronet implied nothing of kind must be very much gratified honoured said very well perhaps must mention to wife let know town county generally owe deepest debt of gratitude now there be subject on keeping have made up mind to speak to lord inverbroom intelligence encouraged to do so by purchasing freehold of county club have acquired right of membership with streak of pride be characteristic of did not want to get elected to club a right have since have made purchase thought over wished to stand for election must secure proposer seconder like other candidate that being so did not intend to tell lord inverbroom that must ex officio become member of club at next quarter day when entered into possession of property have determined to ask if a president must propose in ordinary course next election have already ascertained took place early in april when blushing honour a benefactor to hospital baronet must be fresh upon there must be no more suitable opportunity for request than present wonder if must do great favour said bluntly feel sure must be pleasure to to do favour be in power said other must then be kind enough to propose for election to county club next april said keeling there be pause very slightest quite imperceptible to keeling though john must probably have noticed instantly lord inverbroom made up mind that be quite impossible to refuse thing wished have not be asked have not smallest personal objection to having keeling a member in infinitesimal pause divined be afraid unerringly feeling of club generally ridiculous might be a many class distinction be knew that existed in general shared succeeded however in keeping cordiality in voice in consenting to do what felt unable to refuse will be delighted to said have got seconder ah think be not necessary when president proposes candidate will certainly put down name when go into bracebridge next again there be slight pause rose trying to avoid appearance of breaking off distasteful subject well mr keeling said mean to keep up long time in library to night so will go into drawing room at once till lady go up to bed dear that awful chimney must be very good of if must let have cowl told of late a be when keeling went upstairs found jubilant wakeful wife waiting for with positive cargo of question impression have to unload at once elation took condescending critical form neither wanted paused for answer well im

pheasant a served at table for declare must hardly get teeth into though did come on silver plate nothing nut apple for dessert though can get choice grape so cheap now there what doe matter when dine with friend such pleasant talk a have too with lady inverbroom who im sure be very sensible agreeable sort of woman nothing very gifted dare say great deal of common sense common sense now often wish be commoner time passed so quickly while lord inverbroom be talking together in dining room be quite surprised when came in soup too did not find insipid expect lady inverbroom doe not have sort of cook have always be accustomed to jewel just little diamond brooch made feel be too fine with beautiful pearl pendant gave for birthday dont agree with thomas have talked about fifty thing dear dont know want to agree with about said well will let pas be not odd that lord inverbroom have book plate by miss propert quite coincidence made feel quite hot when talked about supplying with chimney cowl just a if be customer not that really matter thought got on wonderfully well though doubt felt little strange at first what did lord inverbroom talk about when left book suppose keeling sat down by fire if want to know will tell said of course want to know what must ask for unless wanted to know parkinson tell have quite common supper in room nothing out of way just of fish be left over cold beef must ask lady inverbroom to drop in to lunch day when be in bracebridge let see how pheasant must be served be going to tell what talked about if will be quiet for moment yet know have given new

great deal kindly allow to get on be not to tell anybody about till day be opened when will be announced lord inverbroom think will be given baronetcy suggested must tell see what thought about mr keeling sat straight up in bed well never said indeed mamma be right when said people got on in world sir thomas keeling bart lady keeling sound very well doe not do call money well laid out however much be sir thomas lady keeling hope parkinson will pick up quickly not stumble over lady instead of maam will have to practise be easy to see out of depth of futility mr keeling be pleased husband retired to dressing room shut door on rapture be largely remembrance of visit future accession of dignity have foreshadowed that inspired mr keeling a drove home in victoria after morning service at st thomas few sunday later with so comfortable sense of general felicity thought of being addressed on envelope a lady keeling by parkinson a lady caused to take livelier interest in future than usually did for comfortable present be generally enough for with regard to present horizon be singularly unclouded apart from fact that alice be suffering from influenza infliction mother bore very calmly mind be not nimble took time that slowly lolloping horse occupied in traversing road from church to cedar in surveying horizon running over a have just be bidden to do by mr silverdale in sermon numerous cause for thankfulness hardly knew where to begin pearl pendant husband have given on birthday now oscillated with movement of carriage on platinum chain round ample neck formed satisfactory starting point really be very handsome since did not hold with mean spirited notion that present be only token of affection that kind thought that prompted gift be of greater value than cash equivalent found great pleasure in size lustre of pearl indeed rather considered value of gift to be criterion of kindness of thought have prompted by standard husband thought have be very kind indeed have never known kinder since now many year ago have given half hoop of diamond sparkled on finger gift have be of piece with general conduct knew for fact that be going to behave with usual generosity at christmas to mother have promised alice fortnight holiday at brighton in february perhaps must come with be more likely that business must detain found did not care whether came not be duty to be contented happened when everything be so pleasant imaginative flight into future fatigued at rate demanded effort on part of brain very naturally went back to blessing that found easier to call to mind since already existed quite high among little lower perhaps than pleasure of being lady mayoress higher than fact that alice be distinctly better morning be sensible way in husband have behaved about odd evening visit of miss propert when worked at library catalogue faint be remembrance of unpleasant moment when have suddenly appeared among guest at close of dinner be subsequently introduced into drawing room after visit have ceased altogether instead miss propert came in middle of morning when husband be at office be perfectly in accordance with rule of correct behaviour when chanced to meet norah going into library leaving at conclusion of work always have civil condescending word for have doubt that girl be very decent young woman in station of life be a much a must be said about anybody at point sat rather more upright in carriage in order to be able to show how distant stately be recognition of mr fyson who be walking not driving in direction gave little bow without hint of smile for be just how felt to mr fyson more clearly mr fyson grasped that fact better must barely see mr fyson be truth of be not wholly sunlit mist of inverbroom magnificence obscured be true that since inverbroom visit followed up by lady inverbroom lunch at cedar when have shown how pheasant must be served mr keeling have adopted to alfred road generally attitude of slowly ascending balloon hovering bathed in sun over darkling low lying earth below must very usefully tend to prepare alfred road for greater elevation to must suddenly shoot up a by release of ballast when in spring certain announcement of honour must be promulgated be not only that alfred road be growing dim shadowy beneath prompted stateliness to mr fyson misguided lady not true lady have be going about bracebridge assuring friend that mr silverdale have be so very attentive to daughter julia that be daily expecting that mr silverdale must seek interview with mr fyson julia blushing one with now a mr keeling be daily expecting similar set of interview to take place at cedar be clear that unless mr silverdale contemplated bigamist proposal must certainly be very great change from celibate conviction mr fyson must be considered mischievous jealous tatler several day ago alice have appeared suddenly in mother boudoir murdering sleep like macbeth to inform that be never going to speak to julia again wished to hear name mentioned gave reason did mr keeling need one for severance of relation beyond saying certain remark of mr fyson be immediate cause then immediately went to bed with influenza mother attributed to rage shock though last of mr fysons misdeed be not first mr keeling almost forgot duty of thankfulness for blessing when remembered that dreadful occasion shortly after norahs final appearance in evening mr fyson have called under pretext of digestion visit after dinner have hissed out series of impertinent question a to how have ended fool though might be mr keeling be not of peculiarly hopeless sort confides domestic difficulty to ear of gossip have with appearance of astonishment merely said that miss propert have have very pleasant chat while mr keeling be telephoning for cab to take miss propert home on mr fyson have looked exactly like ferret said did bring into drawing room be very clever remembrance of odious suggestion be only thing seemed to cloud serenity of mr keelings horizon indeed scarcely did that corresponded rather to very slight fall in barometer though sign of untoward weather be anywhere visible did not often think of knew that have not like so many more important thing entirely vanished from mind when did think of produced slight declension from weather otherwise set fair immediately afterwards thistle down reflection must flutter away to pearl pendant inverbroom visit baronetage have arrived at front door of cedar a be rather too cold to wait for boy covered with button to remove rug managed to do for herself just a stepped into gothic porch front door opened norah came out be something of surprise have not previously occurred to that catalogue work went on on sunday be business of hers whether husband secretary chose to behave in unsabbatical if not heathenish manner be quite own concern small elephantine reproach be that occasion demanded why miss propert said fancy working on sunday morning when good people be at church norah looked not only surprised startled instantly recovered know be wicked of said so much wanted to get on with work be back early arent be true sermon on duty of thankfulness have be short though joyous there be litany mr keeling have already congratulated on for must have time to rest well before lunch perhaps see alice when have rested when after few more gracious remark found in hall did not immediately go to boudoir to rest perhaps little noise from library only half consciously heard caused to pause then mr fysons unforgotten remark occurring to went to door opened husband whom supposed to be at cathedral be standing in front of fire back from cathedral already thomas said yes dear from church sat in nave if want to know came out before sermon paused moment probably met miss propert at door said have be working at catalogue find how be alice morning have seen pearl pendant gently wagged at mr keelings throat mr fysons comment gently stirred in head must have said be clever too introduction of miss properts name without waiting for wife to mention clever not served immediate purpose for gave news of alice sooner take off to seaside better said change of air will do good must go week if be seemed to mr keeling that be not being clever stupid felt that be designed diversion to distract thought be being pearl pendanted again without pearl be not going to be put off like oh have too many engagement to think of said must not be able to come with there be little chance of whenever go said awful ill inspired notion came into poor mr keelings head determined on light good humoured banter intention be excellent performance deplorable too busy over catalogue eh asked coming away before sermon too naughty a mr silverdale must say oh understand dear effect of light humour be not at what have anticipated turned swiftly round to with face appallingly grim never mind what mr silverdale must say said tell what be that understand now quick what be understand retreated step with fallen face whats matter said dear be matter be only joke instantly saw mistake have have opportunity to treat subject in same playful spirit have be unable to be too serious to grim puritan streak in have not prevented falling in love with norah made impossible for to jest suffer jest about be not flirt did not care to have tawdry cloak thrown on to shoulder have made mistake ought to have accepted that ridiculous decoration with grin a ridiculous now tried to recapture belated inanity ah youre just chaffing said there harm in didnt care for what mr silverdale must say he naughty too if he not going to ask poor alice to marry when shes recovered from influenza have done a asked cut daughter out thats joke too one bad joke deserves emmeline suddenly struck that situation be parallel to more significant than have occurred in drawing room when norah have come into for few minute one snowy evening then a now wife have hinted at underlying truth be aware of then a now have scolded for ridiculous suggestion word implied to day same situation be intensified presented to in colour many tone more vivid even a underlying truth have become of far greater concern to unless be mistaken have become much more real to wife first vague stupid truly founded suspicion have acquired solidity in mind doubted whether must so to speak bomb to bit by throwing to of pearl pendant looked at moment with eye behind there smouldered real though veiled hostility found wishing that must put into word repeat definitely seriously accusation at dismal little jest about work of catalogue keeping here in bracebridge have hinted then must have denied more explicitly with violence might have impressed roughness fierce challenging of stupid chaff have effectively frightened off such repetition gave opportunity of denial defence only a left with intention of seeing alice before lunch noted intensified situation have become more explosive more dangerous now instead of taking boldly out into open encouraging to explode with probably very destructive result have caused wife to lock up in confined space of own mind hiding away from anger ridicule be doubtful whether have detached smouldering fuse of own suspicion be at present of very swiftly inflammable stuff there be vague sense that husband be more interested in norah than must be have answered chaff with something equally light might easily have put out that smouldering fuse have not done that have flared scolded attempt to respond in same spirit be hopelessly belated began to wonder whether mr fyson be not right true mr fyson have said very little little appeared now to be singularly suggestive various sale department at store be thronged day from morning to night during week before christmas with crowd of purchaser correspondence on business matter such a engaged norah fell off a holiday approached next morning when arrived found not more than dozen letter for to open charles however be being worked off foot in book department where be hundred type of suitable christmas gift more expensive being bound in stuffed morocco so that side of resembled flattish cushion norah intended a soon a have finished shorthand transcription to proceed at once with typewriting then ask leave of keeling to go help brother arrived few minute after in hour shorthand dictation be finished be going to typewrite at once said if youll allow then go help charles in book department keeling pushed back chair a often did when be disposed for few minute talk putting gap between business table gave smile long look have seen book said im almost ashamed to get profit out of such muck beastly paper beastly printing squash binding more expensive be more loathsome laughed be pretty bad said there big sale for may go help charles not do work in library morning asked unless wish to paused do rather said want work to go on a usual monday be regular day to go there now yesterday when norah met mr keeling in porch latter have be so very normal condescending that have scarcely given thought to encounter mr keeling have often met coming going to work have always word for even a have have yesterday instantly now when keeling expressed wish that must go there morning connected in mind with meeting will go if like said will be obliged if will have certain reason for wishing rubbishy reason enough neednt bother with looked up at be clear to when eye met that same specie of thought be in mind of at rate be thinking of what have occurred yesterday immediately looked away again silently pondering something watching saw that soft frown like vertical pencil mark appear between eyebrow then cleared again looked at with smile conveyed comprehension of rubbishy reason sudden flush came over face confirmed that to naturally be a awkward even a impossible for to speak of a be for must consent to go refuse to expect see point said will go for first time occurred to that have voice in matter that be only fair to to suggest that must give up visit to house altogether must not be there when went understood now indeed have understood long ago when made entry into dinner party mr keeling have so to speak eye on be due to norah that must be allowed to say whether wanted that eye taken off dont go unless wish said suddenly give up catalogue altogether if like moment suggested that whole nature consciousness of entire innocence of visit there be up in arm against proposal not to go there must imply that there be reason for not going there there be none have passed between mr keeling husband yesterday be business of hers intended to finish work conclusion be comprised in decision with answered why must give up catalogue said have intention of doing so unless tell to business be to finish keeling hesitated wanted to say something to showed however remotely gleam of feeling something must let that spark of unspoken comprehension flash backwards forward again yes just matter of business isnt said met eye with complete frankness there be nothing to show whether have caught suggestion lurked in speech not then will go down to house now get on with business said be half disappointed half pleased wisely gave up idea of conveying to that there be anything more than business for in working among book if understood that handling passing hour in room preparing catalogue be something so utterly different from what must have be if one else be doing for must have found hint of in what have said if did not well be exactly there that disappointment came in pulled chair little nearer to table again where work lay there be one other thing said get four day holiday at christmas brother be going to spend here suppose so then take advice make brother go to seaside with instead youve be rather overworked lately have too change must do good oh dont think will go away said fidgeted with paper moment when money concerned business must discus bargain with nonchalance of man who have passed life in making when money began to trespass on privacy of life there be one in world more shy of mentioning miss propert said dont think impertinent if there question of expense about going away please let advance money will be paying for catalogue youve done good deal of work on already be quite reasonable proposal moment said that norah knew that did not want to be paid at for work on catalogue when undertook to do have just mentioned question of payment saying that must let know charge time since then thought of what be going to charge have not entered head now when thought of pleasant hour in library disliked thought of payment dont want to be paid at said be most of work done in office hour when otherwise must have be in office here have done certain amount in evening enjoyed found much more amusing than playing patience cant allow for moment said what if have to asked smiling will not have catalogue completed will insist on paying for what have done will get estimate of work made price fixed did not smile back at looked at table drummed with finger a have often seen do when be discussing business point on did not intend to yield be serious asked be never more so have really enjoyed doing have done for sake of book like doing thing for book keeling stopped drumming finger looked up with grim face relaxing dont remind of affair over book plate said be putting into odious position isnt generous of be to do then asked took cheque book out of drawer wrote take on account please said if want to be business like give receipt advise to spend of on little holiday looked at cheque cant take a part payment said be fully a much a completed catalogue will cover be very obstinate said will get independent estimate of what be fair price for completed catalogue when have finished adjust payment by will satisfy quite seems to be far from obstinate have given way of course credit with so much sense suddenly norah found did not mind yielding to be rather surprised at for knew there be truth in charles criticism that preferred own way to anybody el be amiable way liked having now when keeling so much took for granted that be going to do a suggested found have objection to wondered why thank very much said will try to persuade charles to take advice too come away for few day now ill go down to house oh receipt will write file have already pulled sheaf of paper towards be turning over please said be crisp morning with touch of frost lingering in shadowed place where warmth of primrose coloured winter sunshine have not reached norah preferred walking to taking bus must have set down at corner where alfred street became alfred road be keenly sensitive to suggestion of brisk sunshine depression of heavy weather kindly vigour of winter morning did not wholly account for exhilaration glee of blood there be more than in drench of december gale must hardly have affected to day a went let examine for first time condition for last six week have caused morning to awake with sense of pleasure eager anticipation of ensuing day hitherto have diverted mind from cause be contented with effect office work work have begun so distastefully pleased interested catalogue work enthralled now turned round corner so to speak of asked why sunshine be spread over did made reservation on subject told that be because thing be done with keeling for with equal frankness now that have brought face to face with question affirmed that be not in love with a far a must know at knew that to be true be equally true that have never met one who so satisfied never for moment have least hint of sentimentality entered into day long intercourse must be sometimes be gruff grim accepted grimness gruffness because be at other time showed comprehending consideration for welcomed comprehension considerateness for exactly same reason knew must not have cared toss of brass farthing if mr silverdale have comprehended railway porter have be considerate of life have be independent industrious have sufficed for have not wanted anything from anybody except employment decent recompense emotional life have vented on beloved creature called book on divine veiled figure called art stood behind prompted a from behind theatre wing deft imaginative work in designing executing wood block for book plate in one there be secret fountain pours out broadcast quietly leak so save from bursting book dream wove into block have given leakage here have fountain thrown up feather of sparkling water have not be without certain expression of herself in more human term have for year borne patiently with querulous mother patience care for have be expression of decent filial behaviour rather than of herself when task be over have gone with comradeship to brother with whom have greater affinity of taste now a walked westward in snap of wintry air joy of wintry sun realised how completely sisterhood kinship of bookish mind accounted for devotion to be best of friend lived together in most amicable equality in comfortable atmosphere of courtesy affection gave took lived worked together equally that sense of fairness of reasonable contract between brother sister be root of harmonious companionship now so instinctively recognised that sort of satisfaction in human intercourse have become to childish elementary be good nothing must be better a far a went morning felt a musician might feel if be asked to content with series of full plain common chord on piano nothing must be better a far a went than uncomplicated common chord a far a went must anything be better than living with so amiable understanding brother only now wanted to give instead of to give take wanted to lose sense of fairness to serve not to be served have satisfaction that made step more briskly gave sunshine mysterious power of exhilaration of knowing that be serving supplying loved knowledge that never have keelings typewriting be done for so flawlessly that never have detail of business such a came within ken be so unerringly recorded might ask for reference to minutest point in month old letter must always reinforce deficient memory of turn up letter for confirmation of knowledge when day of overwhelming work have occurred have suggested getting in second typewriter to assist have always with mixture of pride in own efficiency of jealousy of helping hand proved capable of tackling task might be set probably must not have done for one else must do for be easier so told to do work than to instruct anybody else what to do allowed just that shade of self deception knowing time that there be plenty of routine letter that one else must have done a well a did not want anybody else to do be passing through disused graveyard of cathedral where clipped hedge of hornbeam bounded asphalt path browned leaf still clung to tree suddenly remembered how have passed down path with charles have said how distasteful be to work for cad own word to hang on air even a leaf still clung to hedge tried in vain to remember mood in word be green a hornbeam leaf have then be instead of being brown lifeless lifeless be there be vitality in clung to memory a brown leaf to hedge be scarcely ashamed of only wondered at just a in parenthesis of thought wondered at clothed twig when other tree have shed foliage be not evergreen be just dead came out by short cut across cathedral close where motor bus must have taken saw row of separated house stretch westward in alfred road quarter of mile away be cedar with delightful big library abominable residuum of house very likely must see mr keeling miss keeling be not only in matter of office work of swift shorthand of impeccable typewriting that be of use to guessed that found in companionship mr keeling with pearl pendant propriety must not supply norah knew about pearl pendant mr keeling have told a wagged at throat that husband have given on birthday be not handsome be tremendously handsome there be doubt whatever about pearl pendant mattered to norah exactly a much a did cheque have just be given mattered le indeed did not express anything faced conclusion that vague exhilaration of thought have brought to did not only serve in office served here in cedar mr keeling daughter must make book catalogue for irrespective of inability must not have allowed to attempt must do gave access to library free hand to do a liked there turned in at gate went up drive to gothic porch gave more than that gave need of have expressed that when have said catalogue work be pure matter of business what meant what understood be that be not boy covered with button opened door to hoped that mr keeling must not be richly crossing gothic hall wanted only to get quietly into library go on with letter m letter m implied quantity of cardboard slip wanted to be left alone in library working for did not matter whether paid for work not only wanted to go on working for chapter vii alice keeling have arrived at stage of convalescence after influenza when there be dawn on wreck seems faintly possible that world will again eventually prove to contain more than temperature thermometer beef tea be going to leave bracebridge with mother next day for projected fortnight at brighton have tottered up down gravel path round garden morning for hour to accustom to air locomotion again while be out have heard telephone bell ring inside house sound always suggested to nowadays entrancing possibility be confirmed when parkinson came out to tell mr silverdale must like to speak to at ceased to totter foot positively twinkled on way to little round black ear of machine entrancing possibility be confirmed might mr silverdale drop in for cup cheered afternoon be better must promise not to be naughty get ill again indeed be vastly better on moment said down telephone in voice still slightly hoarse im not naughty dood in baby dialect much affected by mr silverdale alice be not of prevaricating deceptive nature having suddenly remembered that mother be opening bazaar afternoon must not be back for tea gaily hastened to forget again for chance of having tea alone with mr silverdale must not be jeopardised by such infinitesimal propriety hastened also to forget to tell mother that have proposed only remembered to change dress after lunch for something more becoming choose with view to brightening up daring red gown made by contrast look rather whiter than influenza have really left did not mind that be obviously out of question to look in rosy blooming health best alternative be to appear interestingly pale remembered also to order hot bun for tea though idea of eating one in present state be provocative of shuddering qualm having mother safely off premise sat waiting in mr keelings boudoir ready to ring for tea a soon a visitor appeared punctually sound of front door bell according to custom came running across drawing room tapped at boudoir door peeped in head alone appearing may come in said how be took hand playfully pretended to feel pulse now be doctor order said be to sit cosily by fire talk to poor parson who come to see dose be to be taken at exactly past four sat down on hearth rug in front of chair looked round room be pleasantest club know said wheres president alice guessed what meant in moment dont think mother be in yet said wont wait tea for bun there be two lump of sugar isnt how be better said better already poor parson have be lonely without dear kind helper now he got again alice gave little quiver of delight cup handed rocked on saucer poor parson going to be lonely again isnt went on didnt ickle bird tell that helper be going to spread wing fly away to brighton for fortnight mustnt be selfish mustnt poor parson only be glad to think of helper sitting in sun drinking in life health again alice wished that julia fyson must hear say that julia fyson probably must have if have have influenza too that benumbing possibility did not enter alices head have called helper before oftener called that better now helper be going to ask question said formally adopting name want to know if poor parson have be good not be overworking turned to with air of childlike frankness he be pretty good said not bad enough to be scolded if helper will get nasty influenza why parson must do of work alice must not keep up pretty jesting tone longer be much too serious wonderful thing to jest about must really be helper oh mr silverdale said have really be of use to began to be firmly conscious of wish that mr keeling must appear alices pale eye be fixed on with almost alarming expression of earnestness took refuge in pretty jesting again once upon time said there be young lady of such modest disposition that though have sunday school boy class made beautiful beautiful altar cloth oh helper broke off have altar cloth in use for first time last sunday not there to see how smart looked that be of way in made religious matter real to many of congregation used phraseology even slang of ordinary life about speaking of such ripping prayer jolly celebration oh hope fitted well said alice diverted for moment by mention of piece of ecclesiastical finery be perfect fit wish coat fitted a well looked round to see if couldnt catch eye of helper there wasnt helper there at wondered if be ill must think of nothing else must have kept away just said wee bitty prayer for helper then after church heard that have horrid old flue now may make chimney smoke smoke not smell nasty to poor flu flu be joke of well established standing asked permission to light cigarette leave be given insisted that must strike match hold to end of cigarette poor parson have business to indulge said blew inhaled smoke up chimney in gay puff have steered conversation away from tidings gleamed from alices earnest eye have taken past dangerous corner of religion from might bolt back again to earnestness have brought to congenial base of legitimate clerical flirtation allowed to talk baby talk with adoring parishioner squeeze hand dab on presumption that meant more to anybody else than to be pure assumption meant much more to poor alice for one brief moment certain clear sightedness penetrated infatuation certain business like unidealising vision inherited probably from father came to aid giving warning peremptory final for one moment saw adored priest a be more le to whom baby talk squeezing of hand lighting of match be not symbol of anything lay behind only expressive of amorous anmia have be in earnest with hundredth part of intention must have caught at made plain want even if marriage be not within scope of desire reached hand to love brought claimed comradeship of even if must do more in moment of clear vision saw knew that did not even do that sat on hearth rug wagged tail barked for biscuit then cloud of own foolishness derived perhaps from mother side strangely swollen by individual temperament obscured that brief ray of common sense yielded up to entrancement of having mr silverdale sitting on floor at foot lighting cigarette from match sudden idiotic courage possessed proposed to put thing to touch flickering firelight sense of convalescence inspired have called helper have said thousand thing behind meaning might lurk be business like of sensible girl who want to be married to show that shy priest like advance met slightly le shy welcome wave of calculating fatuousness combed over poor parson doesnt indulge a much a ought said wont think wee bitty about own happiness so make others think of for alice looked not at a said remarkable word at pink clock on chimney piece have recklessness of physical weakness in did not care what happened if only one thing happened if must not take that lure be quite prepared to try with half took rose at so to speak rose short continued to use baby language in order to indicate distance separated from earnest eye so pointedly looked at pink clock poor parson know kind friend be thinking for said know too well perhaps be so selfish that leaf happiness in hand of others doesnt bother about suddenly struck unfortunate clergyman that word might conceivedly bear disastrous interpretation to adorer anything be better than to let interpretation become coherent felt that alice have be encouraged to be on point of proposing to without moment delay since moment be precious so long a alice did not take possession of switched off violently on to religious topic just now have seemed dangerous to at awful moment presented appearance of ark of refuge parson have got too much to think about hastily continued to allow to think of own happiness isnt true dear miss alice that only get own happiness when be thinking not about ourselves thought about for hour morning did get so dreadfully bored thought how pleased must be if how delighted must be if then thank god found yawning be so stupid dont believe must be stupid said alice with infernal calmness again terrified stupid be always stupid said want to do something for everybody committed to charge want to give to drunkard drab unbeliever be like foolish cook know how to serve up so a to become palatable must not help drawing long breath of cigarette smoke mixed with relief thought that corner have be quite safely steered round there be back again in parish work what must be disregarded alices gasp of appreciation at modesty proceeded with increased sense of comfort give give said give ask nothing what get doesnt matter doe be feeling so comfortable now that scarcely wished for mr keelings entry alices earnest eye so told thereby revealing ignorance of psychology be dim with perception of fine interrogation be being wonderful a have so often be before perception of must surely fill soul with altruistic glee possessed began in sense of personal security gave to get little incautious did not wait for acceptance of prodigious doctrine that nothing get matter to problematical getter construed own sense of security into acquiescence so let give said just a if be perorating in pulpit let give till have spent energy will take long time wont for act of giving seems to increase capability of dear miss alice have thousand plan be yet unrealised thousand scheme for little parish of ours must have more school for religious education more class more life unselfishly lived want help can get want to transfuse st thomas with certainty that doubting disciple lacked cant do alone who see must lend eye be mere stupid man then fatuous voice suddenly ceased to extreme terror alice with earnest eye leaned forward towards be husky through influenza purport of what said be horribly clear oh mr silverdale said do really mean that cant work alone a mere man do alice drew long breath wheezed in poor throat covered eye with hand for be dazzled with vision be surely turning real to to helper have said that be no use a mere man surely purport of be clear do mean said mr silverdale got up off hearthrug where have be sitting nursing knee with miraculous celerity behind hidden eye heard knew felt knew that in moment must come touch of hand on hers a took bade look at perhaps must say look at darling perhaps delicious joking way must even at sublimest of moment still assert must say peep o did must be delicious must be perfect touch came on hand there be long awful moment of dead silence while behind poor alices hand dazzle died out of vision before be broken perceived that beyond shadow of doubt did not mean be tongue tied in shame of having provoked passion have use for in shame of having revealed passion have not invited have come to wrong house be unbidden guest who must be directed outside front door again got up sense of being wronged for moment drowning shame be fault have made think that wanted have long be termed helper now have made clear by terming mere man at least have thought made clear silence made clearer see dont mean said quietly there be nothing for to confirm justness of perception dear miss alice said be infinitely distressed from mere habit of pawing laid hand on hers infinitely distressed repeated have idea that ever looked upon must not complete that outrageous falsity with alices eye fixed on waited longed to withdraw hand from under itched to pluck away yet counter compelling influence from kept there delighting in touch resentment at encouragement have received have provoked ghastly fiasco faded from shame at having precipitated faded also mind even in cataclysm sunned in presence that lasted only for moment shame toppled off pre eminence again again sense of wanton flirting of have be victim banished shame never in year of placid existence have mother felt poignancy of one of emotion made tumult together in alices heart a if be not enough added discordant shrillness to babel within pulled hand away tell one thing said be there one else be julia fyson oh mr silverdale do tell be not julia fyson mr silverdale suffered at moment profound disappointment have be telling that hand be exercising calming controlling influence over poor lady presently must say something very sensible proper though must not quite tell what must be instead be a if wild cat have suddenly leaped out at certainly be not miss julia fyson exclaimed in great dismay for moment chronic fatuous complacency in possession of habitual adorer quite faded from mind be intended to adore tenderly reverentially fervently not to make proposal of marriage to really did not care if never put arm round julia fysons waist again assure be not miss fyson reiterated wiping moist forehead wonder at suggesting besides surely know view about celibacy of clergy humorousness a must have struck bystander of amazing anticlimax escaped alice knew be anticlimax for be not giving two thought to principle be only involved in practice anger suddenly flamed in giving odd grotesque dignity dare say have heard express said have also heard express intimacy affection towards always encouraged held hand whispered to once after confession said mr silverdale hurriedly did kissed on forehead called little child said alice with indignation waxed a recalled token mr silverdale clasped hand together be infinitely distressed began alice with temper rising to height uncontemplated interrupted said that twice before said dont believe care bit hush said mr silverdale holding up hand a did at benediction wont hush did thing be girl to make of except what made of put natural construction on know hand of benediction did not seem to be acting well mr silverdale took down used instead to cover eye be quite genuinely sorry for alice at back of mind must not help considering what wonderful person must be to inspire passion without ever having meant to there be fascination about be deeply grieved said a will not listen to anything say there be use in saying more good bye miss alice put back head in proud misunderstood attitude instantly at thought of leaving like alices anger began to ooze out of pictured what room must be like when boudoir door have closed behind intolerable emptiness have still enough resentment left not to stop good bye said arent going to shake hand asked dying flame flickered up again weve got nothing to shake hand about said bowed head with marvellous proud meekness left alice sat down again by fire picked up piece of buttered bun with semicircular bite out of have fallen on carpet must have be in middle of mastication when fiasco began yet must not have be for have begun to smoke perhaps took bun after have finished cigarette considered with detached curiosity seemed to occupy mind then boy covered with button came in to remove tea tray noticed have piece of sticking plaster in middle of forehead be interesting too curious then have firm absolute conviction that mr silverdale have not gone away that be waiting in hall unable to tear from yet forbidden by pride to come back have only left room couple of minute surely must find seated in one of gothic chair in hall with hand over face must go to eye must meet somehow other awful misunderstanding estrangement in have parted must melt away must say life be too strong for farewell celibacy of clergy something like must hold hand for long very long time perhaps whisper then blessing on fallings out happens nothing must interrupt friendship perhaps farewell to celibacy of clergy be exaggerated optimism must be so content so happy with much le than provided always that did not say farewell to celibacy with julia fyson must be enraptured to continue on old term now that understood what meant what did not mean perhaps have spoiled so that must never again hold hand whisper to kiss with sort of tender fraternal affection a once in vestry when have made guileless confession to be brother kiss priest kiss coming almost from realm above now have thrown that in teeth have altogether failed to understand friendship comradeship pawings in fading of anger longed for have thought meant so much prized now for own sake surely must find still lingering in hall sorrowful unhappy misunderstood not reproachful for be too sublime for that have said be infinitely grieved several time must be great enough to forgive perhaps must be too deeply hurt to make of appropriate little speech have devised for if so reconciliation for already yearned re establishment of relation on old maudlin line must come from initiative already with curious passion woman have for being beaten ill treated longed to humble to entreat forgiveness did not wait to put on shawl walked quickly across drawing room where have so often heard nimble tripping approach across inner hall out into gothic apartment where must surely find before got there have only one desire left to abase be raised up again be short sighted a came into outer hall heart for moment leaped within for thought saw standing in dusky corner by library door then with sickening reaction saw phantom resolve into coat hat of father hanging up there saw that hall be empty mr silverdale gone still must not give up might be standing just outside unable quite to leave like opening front door looked out on to star sown dusk certainly there be one there went back to mother room deliberately proceeded to torture have be to blame throughout not spark of anger resentment came to comfort past month have brought joy purpose into aimless life have bitten hand fed even worse than have scolded owner for bounty be with sense of incredulity that recalled of awful phrase rude snappish interruption yet in midst of self humiliation knew that felt thrill of excitement at what have happened what be taking shape in brain a to what be going to happen have just that pleasure in agony of self reproach a doe penitent who scourge liked to hurt gloried in castigation be surely doing good tingling from self inflicted penance went to mother writing table for have to complete humiliation by writing to without delay expressing fully unreservedly have made last half hour so replete with luxury of self reproach expression of be not so easy a perception of have be made dozen beginning without satisfying one began oh mr silverdale how must then despaired of how to proceed began have honestly gone over moment of afternoon find there be not single point in be not entirely to blame be too business like lacked emotion when be almost in despair at futile effort brilliant idea came into head must write in baby language must surely touch heart when remembered how many serious thing have discussed together in pretty jesting fashion vewy sorry wrote messy with sorrowness o poor parson helper be vewy miserable may thing be a before will oo forget forgive let everything be nicey nicey again fvom wicked little helper who hate must not improve on for silliness pathetic sincerity unable to contemplate delay post must entail gave to boy covered with button to carry at once by hand to vicarage wait for answer must take hour there be thirty delicious minute of suspense for though did not doubt purport of answer be thrilling to have to wait for thrillingness be slightly shorn of vibration by return of mother who have great deal to say about felicitous manner in have opened bazaar have brought back with small plush monkey climbing string realistic representation of spider web with woolly spider sitting in middle of rim of web be fitted with hook so that must hang up anywhere selected base of pink clock a most suitable site be not clever quaint said must really tell jane that be not real one will be dusting away monkey too be even quainter can bend arm leg into sort of attitude made little speech dear there be lady inverbroom on one side of mr crawshaw on other be quite gathering of county people lady inverbroom asked after think told have influenza first then asked after yes be way of have mantle on dont think can have cost more than four guinea then im sure not fault if have to economise for part if have picture with great house to keep up must get husband to sell one two treat to bit of finery better dinner in evening perhaps be entailed said alice thinking that by now note must have arrived at vicarage very likely dear said mother though poor work entailing picture if havent got anybody to leave to indeed dont see how must be entailed unless have somebody nearer than second cousin to entail for shouldnt think law must allow for so distant relation though im sure dont know bless put on new red dress have done that for just to sit quietly before fire at home alice have sense not to conceal perfectly ordinary innocent event if concealed subsequently detected must make concealment of significant oh mr silverdale came to tea said telephoned alone with said mr keeling archly well im sure what did talk about be stupid of to ask alice felt colour rising till imagined face a red a gown decided to treat question humorously very stupid mamma dear said couldnt dream of telling said to other at moment boy covered with button entered mr silverdales not at home miss said will be given note when come in send answer now mr keeling have very high opinion of power of tact intuition here be situation promised to drive final nail into cheap flimsy coffin of mr fysons hope mr silverdale have come to tea alone with alice here be alice writing note required answer not hour afterwards intuition instantly told that mr silverdale have made proposal of marriage to alice that alice have written to saying that must allow little time to think over why alice must not have said that why alice must not have instantly accepted intuition did not tell be certain that other grouping of surmise must fit fact then intuition having done work though bursting with curiosity summoned tact to aid began to talk about spider web again be determined not to pry into daughter heart wait for daughter to open door of alice only served to confirm mr keelings conjecture responded instantly to tactful treatment began to talk so excitedly about spider web plush monkey journey to brighton next day that mr keeling almost began to be afraid that be feverish again presently volubility died down sat so mr keeling rightly conjectured listening for something once be certain that heard step in next room went to see if father have come in once be almost sure that telephone bell have rung wondered who must be disturbing at chat over fire then without doubt telephone bell did ring on occasion pretended have not heard hurriedly left room on pretext of taking tonic left door open mr keeling must distinctly hear asking tonic apparently who be though well aware that be strychnine then after pause heard thanking tonic ever ever so much came back looking a if have done great deal of good already odd a may appear there be limit to mr keelings tact to state matter in other term none to curiosity for little while resisted incoming tide when alice have informed brightly for third time that train started at next morning felt so strongly that mother be daughter proper confidante that tact retreated rapidly towards vanishing point saw mr fyson afternoon said beginning gently did see asked alice with sort of idiotic eagerness time there be ringing in head like peal of baritone bell through quackings of telephone lovely word dear little helper bless dear little helper imagine so a be opening bazaar said mr keeling with dignity of course yes said alice with enthusiasm how stupid of not to have thought of lovely spider do remember to tell jane not to dust away havent seen mr fyson for long time julia must write note to julia wishing good bye before go to brighton dear julia got up overturned tray of pen in eagerness to write to julia of course gave fresh provender to mother intuition must put two two together a well a most people hardly ever failed to make result five be quite obvious that mr silverdale have proposed to alice that in consequence mr fysons ill founded expectation for julia have fallen a flat a card house wonder alice must afford to forgive friend well im glad to hear speak like dear said because last time mentioned julias name be to tell that didnt want to hear mentioned again mr fyson too dare say be very well meaning woman though doe go about saying that sort of thing be happening without ground except want to alice made large blot on paper in agitation at hearing allusion took sheet of paper be sure julia have excellent heart said enthusiastically recalling mr silverdales definite assurance that be not julia at time have be so full of more personal emotion that have scarcely cared now balm of be divinely soothing quite excellent heart said julia have always be friend except just lately now be all right again dont think that quarrel sometimes lead to even warmer attachment mamma mr keeling tried to recollect something about quarrel have be party to there be case of two little tiff have have lately with husband once when have distinctly sworn at once when have asked so roughly what meant with regard to little joke about norah catalogue one of so suddenly seemed to now have led to pearl pendant seemed to illustrate alices theory of quarrel leading to warmer attachment have not connected two before wondered whether mr fyson must say that be very clever too determined to think over when have leisure at present be too curious about alice to attend to must think over at brighton dont think lead to warmer attachment mamma repeated alice finding got answer mr keeling be very cunning must apply to alices quarrel with julia just see what alice must say next well dear said couldnt well be more warmly attached to julia than be im sure used to be quite inseparable alice gave little hoarse laugh oh that said dear julia hope will be great friend again when come back from brighton will be very glad to be sure clearly quarrel led to warmer attachment have nothing to do with alices late fury about fysons mother throwing tact delicacy about daughter heart to wind tried method of battering way into must not conceive why alice did not tell mr silverdale have proposed to ive be thinking dear said that must be kind to ask mr silverdale down to brighton while be there look a if holiday must do good must take nice room for in hotel of course must use sitting room of course must make quite clear to that be guest just a if be staying with here such walk talk a must have what do think of for plan alice be so stiff with horror at for plan that must barely articulate of course mr silverdale must refuse to come horror be due to mere notion that must be asked oh dont think must do at mamma said must be very odd thing to propose dont see why be such friend will write to suggest might perhaps must be best can say can not manage though for part must be very much surprised if did not accept alice got up from table where have just written affectionate little note to julia came up to mother chair quivering with apprehension really must hing of sort said there be reason against cant tell mr keelings power of intuition must make nothing of starting with firm conviction mr silverdale have proposed to daughter there seemed place where must fit in be very mysterious dear said seem to forget that be mother if tell that must speak to nobody about yet may be sure will not do so without leave be always famous for ability to keep secret why not so long ago father told something be sure will make mr fyson turn quite green with odious jealousy when hears have not breathed word to anybody not word so dont be so mysterious dear remember going to tell mamma moment father spoke to be in garden behind mamma house must show very place if dont believe mr silverdale hasnt spoken to like said poor alice well then there reason more for asking to brighton said mr keeling now quite out of sight of tact know very well what attention to mean ive never seen man so devoted for im sure father never made such fuss over a youve got to meet man half way dear only right to show that be not indifferent to do mean he not indifferent to word be so puzzling want wife can see may trust that want will invite to brighton if only behave sensibly hell ask before be even thinking of coming back dont want to ask said alice splendide mendax mr keeling looked positively roguish oh just wait till doe wont be very long wait said think youll be shy nervous wont when turn come ill be bound like well enough really be about a pleasant to alice a prodding of exposed nerve held on unshaken to main point if ask to brighton said will instantly write to tell be not going thats last word if knew what have happened must agree with wont come cant have asked alice in spite of influenza shattering event of afternoon have something adamantine about paused moment please promise at once not to suggest to added mr keeling rose from chair dressing bell have already sounded have not have moment rest since before lunch well im sure little reward one get for being mother in day said wife for what with father typewriter lording in library telling whats right what isnt in own room there little left for to be mistress of wear to bone in doing duty to get be to be sworn at scolded when lie awake at night making plan for future tell might just a well have gone to sleep for wont permit pray may go dress haw other order for just want promise that wont ask mr silverdale to brighton said alice unmoved by withering sarcasm well whats use of repeating that like parrot observed mr keeling havent promised didnt hear said alice well then may have own way be crowed over by mr fyson since prefer that to being taken care of by alices smart red dress be good enough for purely domestic dinner sat down again by fire when mother have bewailed out of room have got way there be relief be mr silverdales helper again be glow have penetrated very bone when wrote little baby note to felt that if only be granted welcome back a have be conveyed to down telephone must swoon with happiness already that thirsted for be dust in mouth like dead sea apple guessed that little caress whisper have meant so much to because took to be symbol of so much more now knew better be without meaning measure of disillusionment may be taken from fact that independently of have happened be glad that there must be chance of coming to brighton wanted to love failing that did not want little token have made think did might just remain in bracebridge dab away at julia if wished provided only that meant nothing whatever by did not love whit le just now did not want whose presence for last six month have filled with sunshine must go away into dark see what dark felt like poor alice sitting by fire in smart red dress began to make most

little a wanted other turned westward where successive line of down stretched away like wave of landless sea then stopped again for from tussock of grass not fifty yard from there shot up with throbbing throat down beating wing solitary lark somewhere in tussock be mate to whom sang quivering tuneful soared now almost invisible against blue easily seen again when white cloud rolled up behind shadow preceding turned fresh emerald of down grass to dark purplish green at that delicate trembling hint of spring suddenly crystallised in keelings heart into strong definite emotion be young sang to mate a climbed into sky soon passed altogether out of sight be just sightless singing out of wind of march then slowly descending appeared again song grew louder just before dropped into tussock of grass song ceased keeling waited quite still for moment then came back into from bright place into have aspired god there fool like old fool said to a skirted with wide berth past tussock

be rich must spend thousand on hospital be silent moment be that remark made to asked suppose be just little bit be very impertinent do subscribe to know said oh yes saw name among subscriber when be there yesterday said rather hurriedly keeling felt keen secret enjoyment over knew quite well what must have seen namely fact that be yearly subscriber of a set forth on subscription board have temptation to tell who be anonymous donor of new wing must hear that to morrow in meantime must continue to consider donor of year liked that did not want curtailment of one know who giver of new wing be asked fancy lord inverbroom doe replied secretly praising for remarkable ingenuity enjoyed that afternoon spent there said be kind be simple be only simple people who count wonder if lord inverbroom gave wing ah have not occurred to said keeling served purpose clearly suspicion of being tricked by ingenious answer crossed girl mind paused moment shielding eye with hand looking towards bracebridge that shelter from sun concealed face mouth looking at thought that if mouth alone be visible of must have picked out a hers among thousand others full upper lip be slightest degree irregular drooped little on right falling over join with lower lip be a if be infinitesimally swollen there for one second of stinging desire longed to shut down hand over eye kiss corner of mouth must have be that about skylark sang have come near to end of ridge where steep descent on to road began fifty yard in front at present unnoticed by be tussock out of bird have risen even a paused looking at bracebridge at that carolling jubilation began again at once put down shielding hand laid on sleeve a if must not hear there lark whispered did not move while song continued hand still rested unconsciously on sleeve eye looked straight at demanding companionship in young joy of life thrilled no le than bird be that in main that possessed yet for delicate intimate moment have instinctively so instinctively that be unaware of choice chosen a companion wanted to listen to lark with coat on finger tip whole soul be steeped in joyful hour be with shared be not hers alone song grew faint louder again then ceased took hand off arm thanks said made wide circuit round that windy home of melody now of will go first said for must go alone now of naturally walk fastest expect so will sit here for five minute more then follow agreed to strode off down steep descent just before be out of sight turned to wave hand at then be alone on great empty down still hatless still flushed with wind walking just behind tussock where lark lived found note for on hall table with in hand walked into wife room to see if have returned from church be already there resting little after fatigue of worship extremely voluble so be back too thomas said what pity did not get back sooner lord inverbroom have just called left note for wonder did not see in cathedral for went to service there said always took walk on sunday morning after service so sooner than wait wrote note for oh have in hand what curious handwriting be must have thought spider from ink pot must have done better than doubt will be able to make out of course asked to stop to lunch for whether be alone expect company im sure table be good enough for anybody alice will not be here have gone to lunch with mr silverdale oh be that quite proper not alone dear what do take for hope know what be proper what be not sister have come to stay with most ladylike sort of person might almost say distinguished alice made great friend instantly declare must have thought be sister instead of two silverdales be dear to other before have talked for five minute thought omen of what asked why of becoming sister be match maker thank god really way in mr silverdale introduced sister to alice why have never seen anything like be helper margaret said perhaps be martha must not quite catch name be dear helper be couldnt do without what do say to dont say anything at dear said mr silverdale have said too often ah tone there be so much in tone said excruciating lady how very odd must be to hear clergyman give out own banns must think remarkably odd if be alices too said keeling well dare say wont be long before be finely surprised then pray tell what lord inverbroom say be sure be about opening of hospital to morrow have practised royal curtsey can get down up quite easily indeed mamma thought most graceful doe not praise without reason perhaps lord inverbroom want to come down to bottom of step make curtsey there if insists of course will do for naturally know more about court etiquette than do at present will certainly bow to superior knowledge keeling stood there with letter still unopened hour ago have be with norah listening to skylark on down now on pink clock in front of hung quaint spider web jane have be most careful about felt a if be caught there may be about bouquet continued wife very likely have found out that princess have favourite flower in case must be only right to have made of instead of carnation gypso something must say favourite flower royal highness something of sort pray open letter thomas see what be keeling found difficulty in deciphering handwriting there be three page glancing through moved towards door nothing about ceremony to morrow said went to library gave more detailed perusal to what lord inverbroom have to say be disagreeable letter to read felt that writing of have be disagreeable to author informed that since lord inverbroom have put name up for election into county club have become aware that there be considerable number of member who must certainly vote against election lord inverbroom have spoken to various of have not succeeded in mitigating opposition be afraid that candidate must certainly not be elected in circumstance did mr keeling wish to withdraw name not must be entirely guided by wish added very simple sincere expression of regret at course event have taken keeling read through once once again before passed to consideration of answer must make to found that said very disagreeable thing inoffensively seemed to feat knowing that if wrote letter containing disagreeable news tone of letter must be disagreeable also must not quite understand how be done certainly felt kind of offence towards writer content be matter annoyed excessively kindled in blaze of defiance must much have liked to know who be member for whom be not good enough whose opposition lord inverbroom have be unable to mitigate a far a withdrawing candidature went for fear of result of election acquainting lord inverbroom of fact that a purchaser of property have ex officio privilege of being member such craven notion never entered head if sufficient member to secure rejection objected to must record objection be not going to withdraw on chance of doing so have never yet abandoned business proposition for fear of competition seemed to that to withdraw name be somehow parallel to being frightened out of deal judging from purely business standpoint there be mistake expected to find that large quantity of supposed opposition be bluff besides before election came on must be known who have given new wing to hospital pulled committee out of quagmire of rotten finance must be known too that whether county club thought suitable occupant of bow window looked on alfred street sovereign thought good enough to go into dinner before of except lord inverbroom be snob suspected that good many other people be accordingly even before gong sounded for lunch have finished note in answer to lord inverbrooms a follows dear lord inverbroom be obliged for favour just to hand regret be out must be obliged if must kindly fulfil engagement entered into with put up for election a agreed in least fear result of election so trust may be in error about faithfully yours thomas keeling read through before posting be sound business letter saying just what set out to say wondered why lacked that certain aroma of courtesy distinguished letter answered perceived that be so more knew how to remedy than knew how to fly must walk pretty sturdily along ground required stalwart push to upset if undesirable happened lord inverbrooms fear proved to be well founded knew have sound knock ready for whole assembly of who collectively thought be not good enough for ill find answer thats good enough for said to a slipped letter into post box in spite of practice in conduct of social function a lady mayoress natural aptitude for knowing how to behave suitably mr keeling have one moment of extremest terror when royal princess came up step of hospital next day between keeling lord inverbroom to where lady mayoress awaited knee so trembled that though felt that there must not be smallest difficulty in sinking down in curtsey indeed in sinking into earth altogether much doubted power of ever raising again gypsophila in bouquet be about to present shook so violently that appeared to be gray mist among daffodil have be ascertained to be princess favourite flower must have liked to run away there be nowhere to run to indeed gorgeous heaviness of satin gown rendered active locomotion impossible then royal highness shook hand thanked for beautiful flower inhaled perfume of scentless daffodil before giving to lady in waiting to carry mr keeling found able to say favourite flower royal highness broke spell of terror then followed declaration that new wing be open tour be made through empty ward while mr keeling so swelled with pride anticipation that felt that be who have be yet anonymous benefactor sometimes talked to princess sometimes only to lord inverbroom be even so mindful of proper place a to drop condescending word two to bishop whose only locus standi there so considered be that must presently be permitted to say grace lining big hall in corridor be common people of bracebridge mr fyson that class of person naturally mr keeling swept by a have swept by footman on pleasant domestic evening at lady inverbrooms then came lunch in town hall near by at bishop did duty guest theirs there be table raised dais for principal of on floor of hall dozen others for le distinguished close by against wall be sitting of keelings staff who have be bidden to ceremony have already satisfied that norah be there then at close of lunch came lord inverbrooms speech at close of that sentence for mr keeling have be waiting royal highness said lady gentleman will now ask to drink health of munificent benefactor whose name by express desire have till now remained secret ask to drink health of most honoured mayor mr thomas keeling then followed usual acclamation be sweet to donor ear sweeter than to be moment when a guest sat down again rose to reply looked across at table near wall caught norahs eye just perceptibly shook head at a if to reproach with ingeniousness day before face be alight have never met so radiant encounter from mr keeling be almost too superb to speak even to lord inverbroom in interval after lunch when presentation be made before princess drove to station again must not continue not to speak to anybody more because of great exaltation be full of bright thing a went home with husband really passed off very tolerably said do not think so dear be not gratifying just a dear princess shook hand with for second time before drove away holding hand quite long time said hear friend will not call mr keeling very much longer be not that delicately put how common lady inverbroom looked beside after cant be princess be told by lady in waiting who be very civil sort of woman indeed that royal highness be going to stay with poor inverbrooms next month can hardly believe must not think be at likely sort of thing to happen felt really ought to warn mr did not quite catch name what very poor sort of dinner mistress must get if fared better than did must keep ear open next month to find out if really doe happen though dare say will be first to know for after to day lady inverbroom must scarcely fail to ask to dine sleep

honour of baronetcy have be conferred on husband did not mind how often read london paper reproduced gratifying intelligence though wording in most of be absolutely identical repetition never caused

sweetest of gave detail about herself parentage number of child be not habitually great reader only using book a soporific till tumbled from drowsy grasp now became wakeful enthusiastic student whole range of literature since day of primeval epic have never roused in one tithe of emotion that clipping afforded keeling have such craving to see in print that be perfectly well aware of even looked undazzled at card wife have ordered on one set of appeared alone a sir thomas keeling bart to differentiate from mere knight whilst on other bart appeared in conjunction with event filled with good deal of solid satisfaction due largely to bearing on approaching election at county club never from business point of view have there be more successful timing of enterprise be a if on very day of getting out summer fashion summer have come with flood of hot sunshine that made irresistible to lady of bracebridge muslin organdy foulard floated diaphanously in freshly dressed window summer of munificence honour have just burst on town in spite of lord inverbrooms warning felt a walked down to office on morning of day on election took place that member of club must be so to speak customer for presence in future in staid bow window during month of mayoralty have come into contact with have be at civic function host of quantity of member of county club whose suffrage sought to day there be none among who have not shown courtesy even deference that doubt be largely due to position a mayor thomas keeling who be candidate for club be mayor who have given new wing to hospital thereby averting very unpleasant financial mess too whom king have delighted to honour to business mind nothing must have happened more opportunely business mind be mind must not see how must fail after bouquet of benefit honour to be attractive proposition to club a walked down to office that morning swept cobweb of lord inverbrooms apprehension away wondered at for having allowed to infect with moment uneasiness to make consider even at very back of brain what must do if be not elected morning did not consider at be sure that contingency for have provided must not arrive provision be filed away with shut up in dusty volume be suggestion agent have made that might quite reasonably raise rent that club paid for premise be now property that business be just concluded proposed to inform lord inverbroom at once of fact that be now landlord of county club that question of rise in rental might be considered a shelved lord inverbroom must be in bracebridge morning since must be presiding at election at club at twelve oclock have promised to communicate result at once very likely keeling must drop in at club to have bit of lunch there must get chat with lord inverbroom then a slid upwards in droning lift took to floor where office be club election connected with vanished from brain like dispersing mist on summer morning for few step must take along corridor to room where norah be opening letter that moment of entry have become to matter of daily excitement expectation sometimes soft furrow must be ruled between eyebrow must give glance of stranger chilly good morning instantly turn attention to work again sometimes must show such face a have shown that sunday morning on down when have listened to skylark together face of childhood possession of spring sometimes be gave grizzled elderly man tremulous excitement of boy when hand opened door must give look have shot across town hall like launching of silver spear transfixed if did not get then sometime during morning in pause in work perhaps even in middle of dictation must receive from just that one look made know so long a lasted that there be bar impediment between there be speech language essential self spoke revealing affirming to existence then without pause must drop eye to work again busy pencil scooped dabbed over paper heard in secret place of brain while lip pronounced sharp business like sentence word thou beside singing in wilderness in afternoon when came to read over typewritten transcription of dictation always knew at what point in peremptory letter out of sheaf moment of clear glance have come be always on look out for must never induce gave so have begun to seem not in answer to just when must withhold no longer morning correspondence be heavy complicated whole series of widely scattered date have to be turned up in order to trace question of payment of carriage on certain consignment be tiresome job norah recommended to leave for verification to clerk downstairs whose business be probably for very reason sir thomas insisted on doing be fractious be obstinately determined to have matter settled here now like child cross with hunger wanted clear look have not yet given furrow soft smudge have long be marked on norahs forehead a turned up letter after letter failed to deal with point spent what considered wasted half hour over be still rather irritated when found what have be looking for unclipped communication from spring fastened into place passed think thats what be wanting sir thomas said took from noticing rather incisive politeness of tone looked up at furrow be still there very impatiently ruled clear glance be there also radiantly shone on quite undisturbed by superficial agitation concerned not surface of depth did not look at paper handed on unconscious finger have closed be not going to miss one infinitesimal fraction of moment that have at last given frowned still be property of tiresome search be hers a mattered will find on third line from end said messrs hampden be perfectly right about then moment be over except in secret place of brain voice sang in wilderness looked at letter have given word danced swam presently steadied see said well then miss propert must cross out what have dictated to about please read letter through yes cross out from sentence beginning re payment for carriage of good dear be nearly one what lot of time have spent over that booking clerk must have done much more quickly frown cleared clear look did not return be over seemed have satisfied think must have saved time said yes be quite right like being right dont got smile for that sort of smile that anybody might have have from suppose do said certainly hate being wrong be wrong time said gave lot of trouble in consequence that again be use got smile friendly look of sort no longer wanted be that then asked sir thomas there be dozen more letter yet have just taken next when there came tap at door boy entered be not one of messenger boy of store with peaked cap brass button keeling have impression of having seen before then recollected often lounged at door of county club note from lord inverbroom sir said lordship told to give personally wait see if there be answer said keeling tore open envelope be already after one probably there must be answer since must see lord inverbroom at club where proposed to have lunch note be quite short dear sir thomas promised to let know result of election meeting be just over be sorry to say have not be elected please allow to express sincere regret yours truly inverbroom keeling have one moment of sheer surprise have be perfectly sure of being elected then without conscious feeling of rancour disappointment mind passed direct to what have already determined to do if contingency since opening of hospital wing have thought impossible actually occurred wait moment said to messenger there will be answer for to take back to lord inverbroom turned to norah please take down direct on typewriter said with carbon copy to file norah put two sheet on roller dated paper waited keeling thought for minute drumming with finger on table be ready said dictated dear lord inverbroom yours to hand re election at county club to day of note content also to acquaint a president with fact have lately bought freehold of premise see that there be break in lease at midsummer year on tenant landlord side therefore beg to give formal notice intend to renew lease hitherto held by club a will be using premise for other purpose yours faithfully read over please miss propert said will sign file note of lord inverbrooms with carbon copy docket norah brought over typed letter what docket will put on asked non election to county club notice of termination of club lease signed letter to lord inverbroom sent boy back with now will go on with rest of shorthand said norah came back to table took up pencil then laid down again frown be heavily creased in forehead may just say something to before begin said may think great impertinence be not meant impertinently what be said beg to call boy back not send that note said hate to think of doing that isnt act of stopped suddenly easily supplied rest of sentence isnt act of gentleman said theyve just told that im not one must have elected will like to know how right be paused moment be sure did not mean impertinence miss propert added think have committed one be very sorry then said yes will get on with shorthand please keeling seldom wasted thought energy on irremediable mischance if business proposition turned out badly cut loss on dismissed from mind be equally characteristic of to strike strike hard if opportunity offered at firm have let in for loss in case since club have hit at felt be fair that must return blow with precise instantaneous vigour be right proper rejoinder to norah that club who did not consider sufficient of gentleman to enter door must have pleasure of knowing how right be have at least a much sober truth a irony about opportunity to hit back be ready to hand must have be singular indeed in flat contradiction to habit if have not taken when once have done that be satisfied did not want a member did not want a tenant there be end of like fermenting focus in brain minute a yet with potentiality of leaven in be fact that norah have implored not to send answer to lord inverbroom still considered interference impertinence what stuck in mind began faintly to suggest other train of thought be equally undeniable fact that have not meant a impertinence in intention have be friendly speech inspired by good will of friend shrugged shoulder at did not understand business possibly did not understand club so be then did not want to understand be with mixture of curiosity annoyance that saw lord inverbroom walking towards along alfred road when left store afternoon curiosity be due to desire to see how lord inverbroom must behave whether must cross street cut dead annoyance arose from fact that must not determine how to behave at awkward encounter when observed that there be to be cutting crossing street at perfect cordiality outstretched hand faintly pleasantly occurred to that owing to letter there might be forthcoming election at club with request that must submit to further suffrage must certainly have pleased for have sufficient revengefulness in character to decline proposition with thanks such proposition be submitted to be just going to leave note at office sir thomas said lord inverbroom may give instead save further walk be just acknowledgment of letter about termination of lease perhaps will glance at to see that be in order keeling felt in spite of business like habit that be unnecessary true be matter of business must have verified correctness of lord inverbrooms information instead merely put into pocket be all right said be going home asked other wife know be calling on lady keeling will pick up there if have not be so fortunate a to find lady keeling in will wait for in motor may not walk down there together will be delighted said keeling still did not know how to behave be gradually becoming aware that behaviour be necessary behaviour a such did not seem to exist for companion must not help wondering what took place wife be furious with lord inverbroom went on have succumbed to leonardo book instead of having dining room ceiling whitewashed have materialistic mind preferring whitewash to leonardo besides a told never look at ceiling will often look at book have come across anything lately life be not worth living without perhaps have better not tell if have will practise further domestic economy will be very pleased to show anything ive got said keeling will have cup of tea in library unless lady inverbroom be waiting in motor ah must be great treat let do in case sir thomas surely can go in back way so a to escape wife notice if be really waiting outside will do good to wait be very impatient keeling be completely puzzled if have ventured to speak in sense of lady keeling knew must have made sad mess of in mouth same material must have merely expressed in rude light tried rather mistakenly to copy manner be manner at ah must get good scolding if treated lady keeling like that said did not sound right a said have perception of that perceived too that lord inverbroom did not pursue style then presently arriving found that waiting motor contained impatient lady inverbroom stole into library at husband desire so that news of coming must reach until have have quarter of hour there with host then perhaps might be told if sir thomas must have goodness lord inverbroom sauntered about in grazing ambulatory fashion of book lover when quarter of hour be already more than spent put volume be examining back into place again with certain air of decision must like to express to by actual word of mouth sir thomas said regret at what happened to day be more sorry for because notice that in rule landlord of club be ex officio member of if only have told that have become landlord must have informed of spared annoyance there be mistaking sincerity of good feeling of keeling be moved to be equally sincere knew that already said lord inverbroom looked completely puzzled then will pardon for asking why did not take advantage of become member of club without further bother because wished to know be acceptable a member of club to other member said keeling have told that be not there be good deal of dignity in reply sprang from feeling lord inverbroom be perfectly competent to appreciate understand said what have said much increase regret at election going a did paused moment evidently thinking keeling have opportunity to wager be offered must have bet that next word must convey however delicately hope that keeling must reconsider letter of morning announcing termination of club lease be not prepared to do anything of sort hoped indeed that suggestion must not be made that must have thought that suggestion be going to be made showed very precisely how unintelligible to be whole nature of class lord inverbroom represented such suggestion be made more than hour ago idea of fresh election being held be mooted have pleasure of speaking very warmly in favour sir thomas said lord inverbroom at length of course of voting for may tell that be now considering in consequence of election whether will not resign presidency of club be unusual proceeding to reject president candidate think rejection reflects upon keeling be being insensibly affected by companion simplicity behaviour seemed very easy matter to lord inverbroom be mere matter of being simple must be very sorry to have be cause of that said dont think must be logical of urged to withdraw be most must do after have promised to propose lord inverbrooms sense of being puzzled increased here be man who have written letter morning turning club out of premise merely because have be blackballed who yet showed by fact of seeking election in ordinary way instead of claiming ex officio by delicate unbusiness like appreciation of own position instinct letter of morning so flatly contradicted yes urged not to stand said be only reason why hesitate about resigning must like to know that if remain in post be cause of doing so otherwise must resign other side of question presented to keeling must be rare stroke to deprive club not only of premise of president though have just said that hoped lord inverbroom must not resign felt must be extreme personal pleasure if did then further scheme came into head nail in coffin of county club with inherent caddishness rose paramount over such indication of feeling a lord inverbroom understood appreciated perhaps if left county club said must do honour to join town club be president of must think however honour to resign post if must consent to take ill warrant therell be mischance over election lord inverbroom suddenly stiffened be very good to suggest that said must be utterly out of question well sir thomas envy library here see be new catalogue miss propert told be working at may look at yes indeed be admirably done author title of book illustrator a well all entered father be great friend of mine may have told that very tragic story have never mentioned father to be well sort of man whom county club must not have blackballed perhaps be worst thing have said yet though indeed meant grimly humourous observation not perceiving being able to perceive in how odious position put guest lord inverbrooms impenetrable armour of effortless good breeding must turn even aside laughed well after what club have done to day said there be telling whom must blackball certainly must have be at one time very happy to propose keelings preoccupation with club suddenly ceased wanted so much more to know anything concerned norah perhaps must tell something about said ah must not be quite right must said lord inverbroom still unperturbed if miss propert have not cared to speak to of keeling found alternately envying detesting impenetrable armour there be joint in be abominably complete even while hated appreciated coveted understand said telling tale out of school quite so now will take to find wife let be in conspiracy not mention that have be in house hour already must dearly like half hour time lady keeling be bearing infliction of prodigiously long call lady keeling will be only too gratified said husband be very kind of indeed think have better go gratification be certainly not too strong term to employ with regard to lady keelings feeling indeed too strong to apply to lady inverbrooms when call be brought to end sublimity of princess be not to be have day fortnight have elapsed since memorable visit with return of routine of undistinguished bracebridge have caused so prolonged visit from peeress to mount into lady keelings head like hour steady drinking of strong wine well ive never enjoyed hour chat more said a keeling returned after seeing guest off seemed no more than five minute be affability wasnt alice so full of admiration for what did call french word bibelots suggested alice biblos be never seemed to think how time be flying for never once alluded to husband being so late to be sure might have might perhaps have said be afraid be keeping from occupation for must have assured very handsomely that be more than pleased to sit talk to be quite true thomas about princess visit next month may be sure asked about be coming down to spend three day with very quietly lady inverbroom said yes said that twice now come to think of though caught perfectly first time will be very much surprised if dont get note asking to dine sleep with alice a well perhaps for said what pleasure must be to alice to see beautiful house ground day will quite understand after what said about visit being very quiet why there will be party after be very pleasant evening spent there before when there be guest at said how much enjoyed quiet visit with ceremony did ask for more invitation said keeling a wife paused for breath dear thomas quite misunderstand asked for nothing except might take mamma day for drive through park hope know how to behave better than thing too miss propert have be there twice once to tea once to lunch hope will not have head turned for seems that did not take meal in housekeeper room upstairs be none of business be sure lady inverbroom may give lunch on top of church steeple if wish said very distinctly that have always found very well behaved young woman mentioned nothing about bouncing in in middle of dinner party when spent sunday morning in library bygone be bygone thats what always say act on too certainly appeared to have be case lady keelings miscroscopic mind seemed to have diverted minute gaze altogether from norah to keeling be miscroscopic relief more for seemed to to matter very little what wife thought about norah lord inverbroom be great friend of miss properts father at one time said told so only to day oh indeed very likely in sense that man may call butler old friend of family must be quite pleased to speak of parkinson like be for equality be equal in sight of heaven a mr silverdale say dear wish be equal in energy next month hold mission down at easton haven among ruffian at dock in addition to parish work be doing far too much said alice excitedly wont listen be so naughty promise will be good not wear out go on just same a ever except that get worse worse keeling listened to with mixture of pity grim amusement felt sure that poor alice be in love with man be sorry for alice in regard what grimly amused be utter impotence of alice to keep condition to herself be puzzled also for spring alice seemed to have remained a much in love with a ever not to have got worse better silverdale filled with frantic wholly maidenly excitement be like love of antique spinster for lap dog intense deplorable sexless must even joke in discreet manner with poor alice about gratify by so doing well lady who be so much in love with ought to be able to manage said alice bent over work have eventually induced mr silverdale to sanction creation of pair of slipper with pleased lop sided smile father dont know said he quite quite unmanageable never saw one so naughty punish by not giving slipper give instead ill wear when come to dinner alice looked almost shocked at notion of such unhallowed foot being thrust into hardly le than sacred embroidery be a if mother have suggested making skirt out of parrot pomegranate adorned smart altar cloth divined that in spite of father inexplicable want of reverence for master have become master helper sometimes called sir much a norah have called father for antipodal reason there lurked behind rather unseemly joke kindly intention towards might laugh at somehow below felt knew not how that part of understood did not laugh be a if knew what meant to be in love to thirst to be unslaked to be hungry not to be fed gave quick glance out of short sighted eye glance deprecated yet eagerly sought for sympathy knew be somewhere about then lady keeling put in more of wrecking shattering remark so unerringly spoiled hint lurking colour in human intercourse well must be funny notion for sir thomas keeling to wear slipper at dinner said what going back to old day might a well wear high necked merino gown what father say be quite true alice might really take mr silverdale in hand tell thats last hell see of unless take more care of saw coming out of county club to day looking so tired that almost stopped carriage told to go home to bed talking of county club thomas doesnt election come on soon must be sure to take to have lunch in lady room one of day lady inverbroom told be lunching there to day have quite clean good sort of meal nothing very choice expect dare say doesnt care much what eats will never forget what tough pheasant have when dined there if id be told be eating bit of leather must have believed perhaps day when lord lady inverbroom be in bracebridge again might have lunch together there for last six month keeling have be obliged to keep hand on when be with wife for have developed amazing talent for putting on edge susceptibility for being irritated by cause probably contributed for since accession to greatness condescension have vastly increased while on side have certainly grown more sensitive to pretentiousness be with utmost difficulty that restrained from snapping at im afraid that cant be emmeline said election came off to day club have settled can do without well never heard of such thing havent elected do mean mayor of bracebridge to say nothing of being baronet who be purse proud people must like to know dear thomas have idea must not wonder if lord inverbroom be in have be quite cock of walk a may say up till now doesnt want rival what be going to do hope youll serve out well for somehow have done so already bought freehold of club not so long ago have given notice that will not renew lease in summer lady keeling clapped soft fat hand together thats right sort of way to treat said in great glee will pay out never heard of such thing a not electing baronet who do think be what fun will be to see great sofa being bundled into street bought furniture at store did not be cream of to mind must not wonder if want to sell back to second hand must be fine joke for first time now that wife so lavishly applauded action keeling began to be not so satisfied with fact that commended to type of mind be argument against praise disgusted be at least a impertinent a norahs disapprobation alice fixed faint eye on father oh wish hadnt done that said doe lord inverbroom know that mark word said wife lord inverbrooms at bottom of nothing of kind emmeline said sharply lord inverbroom proposed then turned to alice yes know said gave notice to why do wish done declare im getting like mr silverdale lady be concerning with there mother saying ive done right miss propert saying ive done wrong there pleasing have miss propert got to do with asked lady keeling that disapproves of what youve done shell be wanting to run store for next just because shes be to lunch with lord inverbroom never heard of such impertinence a miss propert giving opinion youll have trouble with miss propert ought to give one of good snub dismiss altogether must be far best keeling felt a practitioner of sortes virgilian might do when have opened at strangely apposite text to consult wife about anything be like opening book at random wholly irrational proceeding must not be impressed by sudden applicability of wife did not know situation more than did musty volume wondered if have not answered with strange wisdom wholly foreign to now have given opinion emmeline said must allow somebody else to talk want to know why alice disapproves alice stitched violently at slipper mr silverdale will be so sorry said drop in there sometimes for rubber of bridge for think that be such good thing to show that clergyman can be man of world too keeling rose be altogether too much for well weve wasted enough time talking about said if thats reason im to hear isnt said alice cant express can feel know must agree with miss propert lord inverbroom about did miss propert say well talking of waste of time observed lady keeling indignantly cant think of worse waste than caring to know what miss propert said keeling turned to perhaps cant said youd better have nap that wont be waste of time youre tired with talking im sure be too left room without more word lady keeling settled cushion against what must be called small of back father served out well said thats way to get on to think of not considering good enough for club have shown spirit very properly idea of miss propert telling whats right what isnt on twenty five shilling week cant bear to think of mr silverdale not having rubber of bridge now then said alice be such refreshment to keeling have intended to pas hour among book to wash off scum so to speak of atrocious conversation when got to library have taken down new edition of omar khayyam charles propert have induced to buy found must give very little emotion be aware of exquisite type of strange sensuous wood cut somehow affected like subtle odour of beautiful binding not least of text perfection be more than presented to did not penetrate must not rid of scum odiousness of wife approbation must not be washed off what made cling be fact that have divined correctly have rejoiced at serving club out be just that norah deprecated felt that lord inverbrooms complete silence on point forbearance to hint ever so faintly that perhaps keeling must reconsider action expressed disapprobation a eloquently a norahs phrase have finished for have done be caddish act be what thought about alice when have finished nonsense about mr silverdales rubber of bridge have similar protest in mind did not rate poor alices mind at high figure be fact that be allied to other two opposed to mother added little weight to opinion wanted to be considered gentleman when others declined to receive a such have justified verdict by behaving like cad be cad here be truth of a struck now be why have behaved like one shut meaningless book now intensely disliking step have taken at time have seemed so smart rejoinder probably if at moment lord inverbroom have appeared asking to cancel must have done so be exactly what be certain lord inverbroom must not do there remained norah wondered whether norah must refer to again probably not have made clear that thought offering of opinion be great impertinence now to annoyance remembered that wife have also considered a such again agreed with again fact of concurrence made lose confidence in justice of own view have instantly acquitted norah of deliberate impertinence now reconsidered whether have

to be brought into dining room at end of dinner when lady keeling gave two short pressure to electric bell that stood by on table by boy covered with button wrapped round with endless swathing of paper be to present bale to mr silverdale saying that be immediate asking if there be answer must not be fun to see astonished master take off wrapping find maltese cross within entertaining scheme succeeded admirably alice showed remarkable sense of dramatic by play talked very eagerly to neighbour while mr silverdale stripped off layer after layer of paper a if be quite unaware that anything unusual be happening be not till unmistakable shape of slipper began to reveal in core that master guessed helper cried sly little helper then pushing back chair took off evening shoe putting on slipper went solemnly round table saying to of host fellow guest may introduce to slipper when came to alice said think slipper have met before there be never anything so deliciously playful when have padded back to place keeling saw poor alices eye go wandering looking at one in turn round that festive table except master finally for one half second eye rested on keeling a one of who run must read heart went out to poor alice be prodigiously silly yet that one self revealing glance decorated loved that distinguished dignified after guest have gone lady keeling launched forth into usual comment on success of dinner party well im sure must be puzzled to name pleasanter evening said thought quite brilliant though im sure claim share in success except do think gave very good dinner im sure never tasted better bit of spring salmon than be not lucky caught eye afternoon slipper too alice be quite little comedy be sure have seen many le amusing scene in play to introduce everybody to

that miss propert did not want to give notice said now can guess why took back again oh not word more be discretion even did not hurt be rather amused than otherwise trust for hitting nail on head

there be something ever so little of truth in what said have touched up now did not mind that showed that there be truth in at now have never thought there be anything serious for thomas be not that
