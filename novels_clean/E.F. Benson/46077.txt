under black eyebrow be kindled glowing with excitement in such moment looked strikingly handsome though feature taken singly be not faultless mouth be too short too full lipped for actual beauty now a sat there very eagerness vitality came went a now one aspect of idea now struck gave fineness to feature made worthy of admiration more perfectly moulded face might well have failed to deserve there be fear a well fear so fantastic that be almost ashamed of a thought of grew upon have always felt when painted portrait virtue went out of that put actually part of personality into picture what then must happen if painted own portrait completely knew idea be fantastic unreasonable fear fear again of something be new be there lurking in shaded corner of mind of must speak to margery be cool smiling way of dealing with phantasm always have most evaporating effect on of other fear have wished to speak to once did not wish to hear wished to speak to of no longer looked at watch found be nearly tea time have be there over two hour wondered to whether have seemed more like two year two minute rose to go before leaving room took long look round feeling that be looking at for perhaps last time at rate that must never look same again only register change in thought by impression that other thing make on if taste change say that thing used to think beautiful be ugly be not so be same a always be can not paint picture without changing will change be yellow crumpled programme copy of jekyll hyde lay together unregarded on table when have drunk medicine concern with medicine

house said in case be five sha' get more than two hour on river so come in jack often caught regretting be not portrait painter when looked at mr trevor be told one of beauty of time black hair black eye delicately chiselled nose have caused many young men on slightest acquaintance to wish that have not decided to change maiden name to trevor be also noticeable that a acquaintance became le slight regret became proportionately keener frank have done portrait of first brought prominently into notice a jack thought best by one of daring experiment in hand seemed always to succeed have represented tall stately figure dressed in white standing in front of great chinese screen covered with writhing dragon in blue gold nightmare of hideous form in wonderful color be bold experiment certainly to jack mind have managed with miraculous success to bring out what be almost a characteristic of wife mind a beauty be of body for want of better word called wholesomeness contrast between exquisite deformity behind hit eye so to speak straight in face hit fair be triumphant mr trevor paused on edge of gravel path picked up lonely tennis ball to think that must have be there time said how blind be mr armitage jack rose knocked out pipe fate be unkind said call in to tea just when have lit pipe then go blame for not finding tennis ball told be not worth while looking for did know be in gutter

wisely afternoon however other thing suggested to have be meditating asked jack sympathetically have be meditating afternoon why did come out a said must meditate with have little private meditation of own said frank demanded solitude be bill asked margery know dear told that 'd be sorry for paying hundred guinea for horse frank laughed be not bill at least not bill that make demand of cash give tea margy evening be warm fine cloudless after dinner three sat out on terrace listening to footfall of night stealing on tiptoe in wood round full moon shining through white skein of drifting cloud cast strange diffused light air alert with coming rain seemed full of delicate scent be imperceptible during day once hare ran out from cover across lawn where sat up for few moment with ear cocked forward until heard rustle of margery dress a moved to look in direction of frank finger pointing at then scuttled noiselessly off have be silent for little time at last frank spoke wanted to tell margery of fantastic fear that fear might hear about rather to let find out pour cool common sense on feel just a did on last night at home before went to school for first time said feel a if have never painted portrait before have have long holiday know still be not a if have never be to school before wonder why feel like most of one fear be for very harmless thing observed jack one see bogie run away be probably only turnip candle naturally one be nervous about new thing one doe quite know what may turn out to be a rule if be turnip candle be sheet mask equally inoffensive really unexpected ah usually feel like said frank in fact never have before one be like plant when one have flowered once be fairly certain that next flower will be like last if one put anything of one into of course if one face one one may put out monstrosity be not facing yet somehow be a afraid a if be going to produce something horrible unnatural ca face ca blossom under glass be nice theory for dear said margery especially if be inclined to be lazy frank made little hopeless gesture of impatience lazy industrious industrious lazy what have to do with understand bit when time have come must paint do so inevitably if time have not come be impossible for to paint know that think artist be idle desultory bohemian irregular be part of nature a artist man who grind out so much day be not can not be artist sap flow bud sap recedes for be winter time call tree lazy in winter because doe not put out leaf tree at rate be regular said margery besides evergreen yes everlasting flower said frank impatiently tree be only simile be not dead when produce more than tree be dead in december margery frowned theory of frank be pet aversion must not get to give up then do mean to say that effort be valueless cried frank whole process of production be frantic passionate effort to realize what one see amount of effort will make one see anything must do picture must probably think very pretty day if liked of 'love in cottage ' such inanity jack crossed leg thoughtfully great objection of love in cottage said be that be so hard to find really suitable cottage frank laughed courageous attempt to change subject said be not going to talk nonsense to night think be talking awful nonsense dear said margery candidly will see be serious in minute said frank be saying must paint sort of thing at time must not be part of only picture worth doing be be part of one self real picture tell of course something about what represents tell great deal about man who painted be most important of two can not what be more choose to paint anything into put part of mind look about wood after have gone said jack if see leg arm of mine lying about send to beach hotel new quay frank threw back in chair with laugh dear jack said for clever man be confounded idiot one ever accused of putting nail paring of own into of picture of course be landscape painter make certain difference landscape painter paint what see only of portrait painter real portrait painter paint what know feel when paint virtue go out of more know more virtue go out of suppose said jack know pretty well what will happen when paint frank grew suddenly grave be exactly what want to know be what meant when said felt like little boy going to school for first time will be something new have only painted four portrait in life of definitely took something out of changed from be telling sober truth absorbed something of sitter when paint suppose will go out like candle interrupted jack total disappearance of rising english artist of portrait what will think be will walk about talk will get vitality frank got quickly out of chair stood before thin tall figure looked almost ghostly in strange half light spoke rapidly excitedly be exactly what be afraid of said be afraid confess be afraid of many thing about portrait be one of began to paint once before have never told even margery have to stop afternoon several thing made irresistible must try again be in bad health when tried before one evening when went into studio saw be more than half finished have sudden giddy feeling did not know be portrait be on verge of something new unknown that if went on with must go mad go to heaven when moved towards saw did see take step towards looking glass said margery go on dear illustration be afraid confess ' then be frightened ran away next day came back tore picture into shred now be braver besides brave not must do lost great deal know by not going on with must not oh yes may laugh if like be true may even say that what lost be exactly what one always doe lose when one be afraid of doing something one loses command one be le able to do thing next time one try lost that lost great deal more lost chance of knowing what happens to man if part with be silly frank said margery suddenly how can man part with in two way at least may go mad may die dare say doe matter much if one only have produced something worth producing frightened despite perhaps because fear be most contagious of disease margery felt little frightened too about new portrait rallied when time come for to die die said ca help can avoid being very silly while live at least can be case in point frank resumed seat spoke le quickly excitedly know sound ridiculous absurd said if paint portrait a think be going to will put into will be wonderful thing there will be picture like tell plainly soberly be not feverish may feel pulse if like that if paint a believe can something will happen to will be soul a well a body will see there ah there be hundred danger in way what will happen to pretend to guess moreover be frightened about once again for moment margery be frightened too frank fear earnestness be very catching summoned common sense to aid such thing did not happen be impossible in civilized country towards end of nineteenth century oh dear boy said be so like to tell that will be wonderful thing that there will be picture like will be even more like if after have made admirable beginning say be horror put foot through vowing will never set brush to canvas again suppose be part of artistic temperament frank thought of other fear of must not tell margery have refused to hear of before laid hand on arm margery tell not to do said earnestly if will tell not to do wo dear frank told just now that be inevitable must why must tell not to do think must be best thing in world for well will see jack why must go away to morrow why not stop be witness must go said jack if mr trevor will send post card wire if show grave symptom of going to heaven bedlam will come back at once promise that dear how anxious will feel just word know ber trevor going to bedlam ' 'going to heaven will come at once must go to morrow have be expected at new quay for week besides have painted so many beech tree here that will say be going to paint tree in england just a moore have painted english channel hear be begun on atlantic frank laughed fear certainly have painted great many square mile of sea however supposing lost admiralty chart how useful must be must soon be able to reproduce from picture for certainly be exactly like sea be like bellman chart in 'hunting of shark said margery without least vestige of land what must be effect on frank asked other if painted few hundred mile of sea suppose must be found drowned in studio morning must be able to fix place where be drowned by seeing what be painting last there be difficulty in way must be very careful only to paint willow place said margery where ca be drowned oh frank perhaps be astral body go hopping about from picture to picture astral fiddlestick said frank come let go in paused for moment on threshold of long french window opening into drawing room if one particularly margery said ever mistake portrait for will know that particular fear have be telling about be likely to be realized then if wish will discus advisability of going on with begin to morrow chapter iii armitage have to leave at half past eight next morning for be ten mile drive to truro nearest station breakfasted alone rain have fallen heavily during night have cleared up before morning everything looked deliciously fresh clean ten minute before carriage came round margery appeared walked together up down terrace until be time for to be off margery be looking little tired worried a if have not slept well will have breakfast with frank in studio after have gone said so until carriage come will take turn out of door there be something so extraordinarily sweet about open air frank did seem to to profit by much last night margery frowned know what be matter with said nonsense frank talked last night must have got on nerve know long half waking dream one have sometimes when one be not quite certain whether what one hears see be real not once last night woke like thought at first be part of dream heard frank talking in sleep beargery said 'that be at be surely know do look so terrible ' why must think looked terrible said jack know then went rambling on ' tried to bury must not let tell ' of course mind must have be running on what said yesterday evening a came in for went on repeating ' know know ' morning got up at daybreak have seen since margery stopped to pick couple of rosebud put in front of dress have hat on light wind blew through hair with deliciously bracing effect turned towards sea sniffed in salt freshness with wide nostril like young thorough bred horse if frank must only be out of door for two hour day while be working must mind said stick in studio then digestion get out of order becomes astral mother want to go to lizard to morrow have taken house for summer spend couple of day think will go yet like to leave frank be use trying to get to come be nervous be asked jack thought be so particularly sensible last night frank be awfully fantastic always be fundamentally be sane enough probably will be wonderful picture be usually right about picture will be excessively nervous irritable while be doing refreshingly idle when be done be way usually have be unhealthy way of doing thing said margery wish be more regular wind bloweth where listeth said jack blow very often on be that enough well then wish have barometer said hurricane come down without warning be not nervous at least mean to be be just one of frank ridiculous notion same a said last night when doe do really good portrait have very definite effect on in what way understand do remember picture of mr bracebridge be in academy year after portrait of though be painted first know one said be wicked to paint thing like that might a well have painted mr bracebridge without clothes on a without body on without body on yes somehow even felt be not artistic frank managed to paint soul must have written exhaustive analysis of mr bracebridge character from portrait effect on frank mr bracebridge be charming man know said margery be really unable to tell truth sound very ridiculous for six week frank really became most awful liar jack stopped short thing be absurd in case what doe mean by saying that doe know what will happen when paint seems to that in case of mr bracebridge so far from frank putting lot of into picture unfortunately absorbed lot of mr bracebridge into frank be quite unconscious have become liar said margery what mean be put lot of own personality into picture really whole thing be so absurd that be ashamed to tell about consequently weakened a must express emptied being in state mr bracebridge little weakness impressed on that certainly happened seems to only likely be affected by one with whom be much taken up what frank assumes be loss of own personality be absurd frank be like hypnotic subject in fact said jack at least say that give up subject to will even then like think whole thing be nonsense how will painting of own portrait affect like put whole personality into receives nothing in exchange other personality will so to speak feed really be very silly sound of carriage wheel caused to turn in stroll walk back again to house incidentally asked jack how did cease to be liar margery looked at openly frankly oh by painting be very truthful did absorb other characteristic yes became le fantastic for time see be very unimaginative then have better get to paint portrait of while be doing wo that preserve balance fresh air sunshine be having legitimate effect on margery have sufficiently cancelled troubled night broke out into light laugh oh must be too dreadfully complicated said let see what must happen must put personality into portrait get back of mine so must cease to be become watery reminiscence of be a bad a equation really mr armitage be beginning to think believe in no not bit more than do well must say good bye to frank tell not to become too astral frank be standing in front of easel with charcoal in hand have caught very characteristic pose of figure with extraordinary success margery jack exchanged rapid glance a saw for though have avowed that did not believe word of frank nonsense felt to be certain relief when saw how brilliantly frank have sketched in there be certain sureness about line seemed to give bedlam heaven most satisfactory remoteness noticed that frank have drawn face already erased be only represented by few half obliterated line frank did not look up when entered jack crossed room to be just off said seeing that other did not look up have come to say good bye have enjoyed visit enormously quite enormously frank started winced a if have be struck looking up saw armitage for first time drew hand over eye a if have just be awakened eye be still heavy with sleep ah jack did see what time be where be going even a spoke turned to easel again went on drawing be going away said jack be going to new quay of course be well good bye drop in see at time be very busy be lost in work jack laid hand on shoulder overdo old boy said soon knock up know if take exercise wo be half so good if slave at day artistic sense be good digestion will be very careful said frank half to take hand away please be drawing in piece will tell to send breakfast in here at once frank said margery be going to have breakfast here with frank made reply two left room together armitage be suddenly loath to go carriage be at door be obviously absurd to stop just because because frank have talked great deal of nonsense evening before have made wonderfully clever sketch of for reason have be dissatisfied with drawing of face somehow little point interested wanted to assure that significance be to be attached to besides frank be in better hand than for left behind splendidly sensible woman sort of apotheosis of common sense in whom that rare prosaic virtue became something keen subtle have said that thought idea of frank about personality be ridiculous besides must always telegraph to new quay obliterated face have caught margery attention a well a a walked down corridor to front door said did notice that frank have drawn in face then rubbed out yes wondered if have noticed too why do think did that asked margery know suppose did satisfy margery frowned know frank be usually so rapid about drawing always draw face a soon a have got few of line of body in really know only noticed just before jack drove off impulse prompted to say beach hotel new quay know will be sure to come if telegraph yes many thanks will remember be very good of to promise to come at once think be very likely know that will telegraph good bye margery waited till carriage disappeared between tree then went in to tell to send breakfast to studio at once a walked back there allowed to herself with habitual honesty that will be in collision with inclination have great gift of forcing to do anything will told have better do in dealing with other people also will asserted predominance if be in collision with theirs have be heard to remark that be obstinate while if went in harness with said dear margery be so firm congratulated when a on occasion will be in collision with own inclination exhibited in splendid self control felt trifle lonely inadequate when saw armitage drive off a told sense of loneliness inadequacy be not due to fact that be frightened at being alone with frank ghostly enemy because have determined to fight ghostly enemy to force frank a far a in lay to paint portrait of finish at cost persuaded must be real final defeat of fantastic tendency irregularity fit of complete laziness whenever idea did not beat loud at door of imagination be absurd to sit at home wait for idea to call art have to look for idea in sort of place be with fine show of justification that said to herself that many of wild idea must be routed if must only make go through with portrait see stand in front of finished work say be ever hoped must be be still sane man surely if must help in way to make do that must be slight cause for self congratulation genius be often bitter frank be not that more often be fantastic frank must be fantastic longer what harm can come to through reasoned be quite sure already liked to tell be quite sure that will not lose personality because such thing happen that will be awfully savage silent while be painting fully expect doe not matter what doe matter be that must see when be finished what goose have be breakfast have just be brought in when margery returned to studio frank be still working sat down at once began to make tea 'd much better have breakfast now said go on working afterwards suppose a usual will let everything get cold nasty egg bacon cold grouse be going to begin margery helped to egg bacon poured out tea have scarcely caught flavor of first sip when frank suddenly left canvas sat down by be tired said hand be heavy will be lighter after breakfast said margery cheerfully eat frank will eat soon want to sit by look at margery darling what trial must be to have for husband there be something very wistful pathetic in voice margery felt moved ah frank said find so frank be looking at with eager eye a dog look at master have taken up hand be stroking gently with long nervous finger suddenly jumped up see see said have be drawing something be at can do now margery will come stand very close to so that when look in glass can see too margery rose from half eaten breakfast went across room to where easel be so said frank picked up charcoal began drawing rapidly in ten minute have done what have be trying to do for last two hour there said that be husband now go back to breakfast margery must begin to paint at once margery looked at face have drawn why be said frank look just a looked when met that morning on beach at new quay be what mean said frank chapter iv margery finished breakfast with sense of relief wanted portrait to be done quickly easily without incident difficulty fact that frank have completely got over odd inability to draw face a wished be very encouraging left parting injunction with to eat breakfast before lunch take out for hour stroll frank got palette ready stood brush in hand glanced at own reflection in looking glass back to face on canvas then back again be very odd murmured to saw so clearly just now stood looking from one to other frown gathered on face when margery have be there with have seen something quite different to what saw now have seen a saw face frowned back at from looking glass be face of man laid palette dry brush down took piece of paper began drawing on line for line reproduced face have drawn earlier in morning have erased once be good said must draw what be not what margery think taking piece of breadcrumb from breakfast table rubbed out face have drawn when margery be standing at side looked again at sketch have made felt that must not draw other way eyelid be little drooped whole face little faded still eager noise of gay city be in ear eye half unfocussed looking outward little sideways be half amused half wearied mouth smiled slightly lip be parted smile be not altogether wholesome through face have wistful expression tired eye seemed to long for something different from thing be sweet bitter bad have not strength to cease from looking on frank took up crayon again there be still something about mouth did not satisfy looked at reflection back again several time before saw what be wanting then made two rapid stroke increasing line of shadow in mouth thing be finished expression have tried to catch for so long be there wondered whether margery must see with same eye a did later in morning margery strolled into studio again expecting to find painting be drawing busily when entered did not look up face have seen draw at breakfast time be gone faintly indicated line of face have taken place frank always drew with extreme care usually with great rapidity to eye seemed to have done nothing since have left well how go asked go slowly be working very carefully said stood away from portrait let see have strengthened outline since have be in at breakfast sketched in background why be splendid said be exactly way loll on edge of table frank be awfully good why have rubbed out face frank looked up ah yes rubbed out directly after left made sketch of what be going to be like forgot to put in again will do now there be great deal of careful work about hand too what be doing asked margery examining look a if be smoothing out crumpled piece of paper ah think that said frank absently wondered if must think be crumpling piece of paper up oh said confidently be smoothing out what doe mean what be paper programme something yes programme something emphasized faint line on face again stood aside look oh frank wo do at look a if be convict something horrible a if piece of paper in hand be unpaid bill be trying not to pay frank laughed little bitter laugh drawing have be very successful said margery be still looking at face be horrible said yet see where be wrong be very like somehow looked from picture to husband saw that face be puzzled anxious see what be said have be worrying growling over till face really began to look something like what be drawing oh frank have have breakfast yet sit down have at once come of having breakfast be that do think asked be that face of man who be only guilty of not eating breakfast look to guilty somehow yes that be why be guilty face be guilty too when have eaten breakfast smoked that horrid little black pipe of yours wo look guilty more frank be looking at what have done with air of disinterested spectator seems to that brute there have done something worse than not eat breakfast said nonsense be going to get fresh tea because be cold there be that sweet little cold grouse dying so to speak to be eaten begin on while get tea frank felt exhausted hungry sat down proceeded to cut sweet little grouse of margery have spoken have strange sense of having just awakened from dream else having just fallen asleep begun dreaming must not tell seemed most real hour have just spent before canvas present moment with margery in thought only knew that two be quite distinct different suddenly dropped knife fork with crash turned to picture again yes there be doubt about there be curious look in line of face especially in mouth suggested guilt yet a margery have said be very like margery fear doubt have returned to for moment with renewed force a looked at face frank have drawn have spent hour out of door fresh autumn air have be hellebore to fantastic thought by violent effort have torn vague disquiet out of mind manner to frank have be perfectly natural soon returned with teapot of fresh tea chatted to while breakfasted what part of personality have gone morning asked seems to that be just a sulky a always be when be painting be unfortunate because afternoon play tennis at fortescues if be sulky why there will be pair of mr f oh what dreadful man frank love one bit more than one christian be bound to love be presbyterian at oh ca go to fortescues said frank want to get on with have be working very hard yet have finished

beginning to turn gold russet light mist still hung over edge of estuary five mile away at falmouth harbor tall mast of ship seemed to prick skein of vapor like needle tide be up covered more than half of little iron step below gate have to be repaired long brown fingered sea weed swung to fro in gentle swell of water like hand of blind man groping upward for light color air sound alike seemed subdued mellow with margery by frank phantom seemed to catch something of prevailing tranquillity retired into dim aqueous mist instead of hovering insistently round black winged scarlet robed think will come to fortescues after afternoon said frank a turned homeward why of course will there be 'of course ' about dear said frank feel a if must paint to day how dreadfully lazy be said margery inconsistently 'd never do anything if be for must promise to work very hard sensibly to morrow next day when come back will expect to see more than half finished sensibly said frank impatiently there be such thing good work be done in sort of madness somnambulism know everything worth doing be done by men possessed of demon demon of crossness seems to have haunted morning said margery need make crosser than be consistent with truth supposing ca paint in other way than what saw morning asked frank what be to do then there now be asking advice said margery triumphantly although always insist that know nothing about art why of course must paint a see be forever saying that well wo like said frank if will promise to eat breakfast at nine lunch at two not work more than seven hour day go out not le than three will chance mr armitage be so right when said that good digestion be artistic sense other half be bad dream said frank if have good digestion have bad dream frank walked on in silence if only knew what be matter with said at length must correct think must be right be very odd be not bit odd be only because did eat breakfast now have got to eat lunch frank smoked cigarette in studio afterwards while margery be getting ready soon heard calling got up to go stood for moment in front of portrait before leaving room momentary spasm of uncontrollable fear seized god said go away to morrow will be left alone with chapter v frank got through tennis party without discredit margery presence seemed to have exorcised for time being at rate demon said possessed there be apparent similarity between nature mr fortescue ease of manner certain picturesqueness be natural to margery found forgetting slightly disturbing event of last twenty four hour mr mr greenock who dined with that evening be gifted with oppressive personality frank once said that always felt a if raphael cloud have descended on when talked to gentleman raphael cloud maintained be very likely big with blessing be somewhat solid in texture resembled benedictory feather bed rather than benedictory cloud environment of benediction be possibly good for one in long run considered rather suffocating at time mr greenock on other hand be example of what american perhaps mean by very bright woman be oppressively bright have bright blue eye suggested button covered with shiny american cloth nose like ship prow seemed to cut air when moved asked artist question about art musician about music if have met crossing sweeper must certainly have asked question about crossing be persuaded be best way of improving already superior intellect a hers admittedly be there be great deal to be said for view there always be great deal to be said for view usually said most of always made point of saying that must remember anything happened to tell in order to give tom harry jane really professional opinion in case must happen to ask question on subject in hand may in fact be described a lioness woman who bore away possible scrap to feed whelp method of obtaining scrap however a frank have suggested reminded one of ferret at work have same bright cruel way of peering restlessly about mr mr greenock be loudly insistently punctual when frank came into drawing room that evening found guest already there mr greenock be snapping up piece of information from margery mr greenock attitude gave beholder to understand that blessing of church hovered over instructive intercourse mr greenock instantly annexed frank a being able to give more professional therefore more nutritive scrap of intellectual food than wife have rich barytone voice impressive delivery be sure will think dreadfully ignorant said when dear kate asked when leonardo died be unable to tell within ten year now what be date really must not say for certain said frank forget exact year if ever knew mr greenock heaved sigh of relief thank so much mr trevor said then may tell dear kate that even know for certain so can not have be epoch making year when one know so little want to know so much be always worth while remembering that there be something one need not know now must say be most epoch making year in history of art frank felt helpless with bright cruel eye of ferret fastened on face shifted nervously from one foot to other must be hard to say that one year be epoch making replied must say that italian renaissance generally be greatest epoch may take in to dinner mr greenock turned eye up to ceiling a if in sudden spasm of gratitude thank so much for telling that algernon dear did hear what mr trevor said about italian renaissance agrees with mr greenock unfolded napkin a if be in expectation of finding manna of professional opinion wrapped up in be little disappointed on discovering only piece of ordinary bread what mr trevor if may ask what be subject of next picture naturally wish to know exactly be going on round be only way be not of being able to trace tendency of art historical romantic realistic what have just begun portrait of myself said frank mr greenock laid down spoonful of soup be raising to lip a if mental food be receiving be more suited to supply need than potage la bonne femme thank so much ejaculated algernon dear mr trevor be doing portrait of remind to tell harry that a soon a get home ah what revelation will be artist portrait of portrait of by be only true way for artist to teach to show theirselves what be not only what look like frank crumbled bread with subdued violence have hit nail on head replied be exactly what mean to do mr greenock be delighted be sort of testimonial to superiority of intellect written in hand of professional please tell more said rejecting entree there be nothing to tell said have got to root of matter portrait must be a say man not what look like be often very different to what look like gallery of real portrait must be very startling thing so many portrait be merely colored photograph endeavor be that will be something more than yes said mr greenock eagerly will see if wish said frank will not be finished for couple of day yet wife go away to morrow for night a will be alone will work very hard at frank be speaking in lowest audible tone stopped suddenly be afraid for moment that must actually lose control over a spoke strange dream fancy surged back over mind must hardly prevent from cry aloud looked up caught margery eye seeing that something be wrong referred point mr greenock have be discussing to wife meantime frank pulled together registered solemn vow never till crack of doom must mr greenock set foot in house again margery have have small tussle over necessity of asking vicar to dinner margery have insisted that one always asked vicar to dine frank of weaker will than have acquiesced poor mr greenock have unconsciously launched on very thin ice frank inwardly absolved from responsibility if tried experiment again when two lady left room mr greenock feather bed descent began in earnest be trying be le likely to go in dangerous place than predatory wife must not drink more wine must not smoke when frank proposed that must join lady said so seldom happens in secluded corner of world can converse with men who have lived life in sphere so different to mine that confess must much enjoy little longer talk with yes suppose get few visitor here said frank visitor get here said mr greenock be chiefly tourist who be not inclined for interchange of thought experience sometimes see in little church yard where so many men of note be buried stop indeed must indicate morbid tendency if did have often noticed how many name one know be on graf in church yard said frank be solemn thought said mr greenock that in little church yard lie be mortal of so many brilliant intellect exceptional ability grows grass on graf a wife beautifully expressed other day in little lyric dear did not know that mr greenock wrote poetry said frank be sonneteer of considerable power said vicar frank who have always thought of mr greenock in light of puritan rather than sonneteer gave sudden choke of laughter mr greenock be arranging next sentence did not hear verse be always distinguished by thoughtfully chosen simile continued flow of harmonious language can hardly feel out of world if always have poet by career of poet said mr greenock be always beset with snare difficulty on one hand there be danger of too easily gained popularity on other discouraging effect of absence of audience be sure can guess to danger mr greenock be most exposed said frank rather wildly be pleased to say so said vicar with appreciative wave of hand in point of fact verse of hers have appeared from time to time in local paper have attracted much not unmerited attention be preparing small volume of verse idyl for publication mr greenock rose a if further interchange of thought experience must not be bathos after frank joined lady mr greenock be seized with sensitiveness when heard that frank have learned about forthcoming verse idyl soon recovered sufficiently to make very true though not very original remark on beauty of moonlit sea pressed frank to tell whether one have ever painted moonlit scene frank cast glance of concentrated hatred at unoffending moon proceeded to answer in imperfect world said must surely be too much to expect that can convince one else be sufficient if can convince what on earth doe opinion of foolish crowd matter to artist praise be almost more distasteful than censure have ever seen critic met one once at dinner god forgive for can not admired picture admired admired for wrong reason admired just that be intelligible to added insult to injury by praising in one of penny in slot journal a one say man have right to criticise picture unless know more about art than man who painted carry conviction to one else wait till day when poem seem ugly to when write seems commonplace trivial will not care about convincing other people then will say 'it be enough if can write line seems to only not execrable ' extreme meet contentment come only to who know nothing who nearly know mr greenock stared at in amazement be not at idea of cultured refined artist man who must say pretty thing in beautiful language ask to borrow penalva gazette contained poem on corner in country church yard drew on glove a if to shield from blustering wind frank be sorry to say evil pleasure in shock have given have spoken without malice aforethought malice certainly came in when have finished speaking what right have verse idyl woman to tell what portrait must be to speak to of hardly dared think of drag nightmare out on to table cloth voice rose tone a went on call one thing pretty ugly said believe art know such term thing be true be false cruelty of be that if have a much a grain of falsehood in whole sense of truth thing be worthless therefore in picture be doing have tried to be absolutely truthful a said at dinner have tried to paint what be without extenuation concealment must like to see must probably call hideous caricature because in terribly cruel human life man know what be good in only what be bad be who love only who know if there be good in voice sank again a eye rested on margery hardness softened from face be transformed dear have be talking lot of shop be afraid said have privilege misfortune hardly know to be terribly in earnest have committed unpardonable breach of manner to make unwilling recipient of earnestness ah margery be going to sing to poor mr greenock felt a if have asked for little bread be pelted with quartern loaf felt almost too sore knocked about to eat much le to put piece in pocket for tom harry jane fact that margery be singing made natural for to be silent finished putting on glove so to speak tidied up again in fact before left have recovered enough to be able to thank frank for extremely interesting conversation have have to remind of promise to show picture will send note when be done said margery be going away to morrow for inside of two day expect will be finished in three four day at most chapter vi margery left early next morning since by ingenious tortuous route pursued by cornish line be day journey from penalva to lizard frank drove with to station promised to do a be told not work more than seven hour day not le than four have quite recovered equanimity spoke of portrait without fear despair when got in sight of station again when puff of white steam thin shrill came to a stood on platform through blue white morning mist terror came looked in face clung to margery like frightened child margery will come back to morrow wo said ah need go at margery be disappointed have thought that frank have got over fantastic fear have be so like during drive be absolutely determined to go through with to yield once be to yield twice must not yield frank must be cured of sort of thing only way to cure be to make do what feared to make give absolute final evidence that personality did not vanish away before portrait like ghost at daybreak a matter of fact frank fear be fear have not spoken to of danger of losing swallowed up danger of losing oh frank be fool said here be train have have bag labelled of course will be back to morrow good bye old boy with whistle puff of steam train be off frank drove home again like man possessed margery have gone there remained to only one thing until be with time ran to waste horse freshened by cool clean air flew over hard road frank still urged on a soon a drew up by door frank jumped down leaving rein on back went to studio there in corner stood worst self set to work in earnest to day there be waiting puzzling over idea must not realize evil face smiled a looked at yellow little programme long fingered hand smoothed out crease with lingering loving touch desire fulfilment of desire be there into soul have leanness of entered because a have said man know best of only worst there be little trace in face of man who have loved margery whom margery have loved yet in eye be trace of what have be lost if not regret at least longing to be able to regret better part be not wholly dead though half smothered under weight of evil a painted began to realize that must be so have margery be there felt better part must have be recorded too devil be highwayman who wait for men who be alone be stronger than solitary man though be st anthony margery be away absence be almost a draught transformed jekyll into hyde so for two day worked alone a have never worked before a have often worked since utterly absorbed in painting eating ravenously for few moment only when food be brought to a hour went on conviction came over that be right about strange fear have spoken of to margery about other fear of have spoken to none conscious self seemed to be passing into portrait one by one like drop of bitter water past life flowed higher higher round far off thought must see margery gave sign did not beckon to to come be not alive to danger of rising water soon must be too late first evening after daylight have fallen must no longer paint threw down on sofa work of last few day stood opposite red glow of sunset not yet quite faded from sky still made clearly visible though value of color be lost frank felt like man who after long sleepless night of pain feel that if only must forget everything for moment might doze off into slumber must take hour two out of life pain a be stood before mastering may only have be that nerve abnormally excited after strain of working played false seemed to that in spite of fading light portrait be a clear a ever a be sitting wondering at half encouraging to believe be suddenly aware that figure have painted cast shadow on to background have never put there a have painted shadow fell on left side of face now seemed that shadow be on right side of face exactly a must naturally be cast by light coming from window at moment knew what fear be cold fear that clutch at heart sat there moment unable to move almost expecting to hear speak to then with effort of will so strong that seemed like straining of body walked up to turned round to wall left room night have odd dream result again of excitement of day so strangely natural that hardly knew next morning whether have happened not dreamed went back to studio finding everything exactly a have left portrait turned with face to wall brush palette where have laid down when have become too dark to paint servant have brought in light have laid day paper on table be conscious of utter weariness of mind body longed for margery knew that be away yellow programme of cafe chantant lay on shelf of bookcase where have put in leaf of jekyll hyde took two down together a have done few day before mechanically mind again retraced life have before suggested to suddenly utter loathing of more complete than have ever felt came over tried to tear programme up seemed to be made of thin sheet of hard substance must not tear then tried to crush under foot must not even bend bitter unimaginable agony of not being able to destroy awoke found morning have come day worked once again a evening fell sat on sofa staring blankly at what have done once again shadow shifted on painted face fell where light from window must naturally cast once again cold fear clutched at heart at moment heard step along passage step knew margery entered frank said opening door be there long figure sprang off sofa ran across room to half smothering in caress oh margery be so glad have come said so glad know what have be without margery promise wo go away again till be finished wo go away again will margery shuddered drew back moment hardly knew why why frank what be matter asked have seen ghost what place be full of ghost said wo trouble more now have come back let go out away from here want to see portrait first said ah portrait frank took two quick step to where be standing wheeled round with face to wall not to night said please look at to night ca see by light know ca said only wanted to peep at to see if have got on have got on said frank have got on wonderfully look at to night be terrible after sunset margery raised eyebrow oh be so silly said however mind waiting till to morrow be good come out of place will tell about outside west be still luminous with sunken sun a stepped out on to terrace margery turned to look at frank face seemed terribly tired anxious there be deep shade beneath eye again a few moment before in shadow involuntarily shrank from there be something in face more than what mere weariness anxiety must produce something have seen in face have sketched two day ago something knew have shrunk from before though have not seen in moment pulled together if be going to go in for fantastic fear too allowance of sanity between must not be enough for daily consumption frank however noticed at once ah too said bitterly even desert margery took hold of arm talk sheer silly nonsense said know what mean know what be matter with have be working day not going out yes know have must help never mind that now have got back margery give up really do frank what do mean asked mean mean nothing know what be saying have be working too hard have got dazed stupid turned to look at blaze on water to west ah how beautiful be exclaimed wish be landscape painter be more beautiful margery be safer to be landscape painter so much safer margery stopped faced now frank tell truth have be out since left yesterday morning how long have be working day know did look at watch day suppose day be long terribly long night too night be even longer one ca work then margery be frightened being frightened got angry with oh really be too annoying said with stamp of foot get into bad health by overworking not taking exercise have got family liver know then tell house be full of ghost conjure up sort of absurd fancy about losing personality frightening frank be too bad frank looked up suddenly at too be frightened too god help if be frightened too be not frightened said margery be angry ashamed of be better than silly child margery said in lowest audible tone will never touch picture again if wish tell to destroy will will go for holiday together want holiday have be working too hard must be better if went in very quietly cut up want to go near doe like tell to destroy cried margery be very thing will not do fancy saying want holiday have just have two month holiday be reason why must work like lunatic of course one can go mad if like be only question of whether think be going to margery tell truthfully said frank do think be going mad of course only think be very very silly have known that ever since knew at be great pity strolled up down for few moment in silence magic of margery presence be beginning to work on frank after little space of silence laughed to almost naturally margery be doing good said have be terribly lonely without terribly silly appears perhaps have anyhow like to hear tell so must like to think have be silly know be afraid if have be silly portrait will be silly too said be silly frank be wonderful said suddenly stopping short be not only like be at least if will stop with while work will be will feel safer if be there then wo be there said margery be not child longer must work alone always say ca work if one else be there well suppose matter said frank with returning confidence fact that know be in house will be enough portrait be wonderful ca think why loathe so loathe because have be working at in ridiculous manner said margery to morrow regulate day for will leave morning to yourself after lunch will come out with for two hour at least will go up of little creek where went two year ago come in now be nearly dinner time when be alone portrait be in progress often sat in studio after dinner to night when margery proposed frank started up from where be sitting margery said please let sit here want to go to studio at be scene of crime said margery frank turned pale what crime asked what do know of crime margery put down paper be reading burst out laughing really be too ridiculous said be going to play second act of melodrama crime of working day taking exercise oh see said frank well let visit scene of crime to night margery have determined that frank did must behave quite naturally not allow to indulge even in disturbing thought so laughed again wiped off frank remark from mind otherwise behavior that evening be quite reassuring often when be painting have aversion to being left alone in interval though perhaps be more marked than usual margery did not allow to disquiet painting of portrait be always rather trying time though frank explanation of did not seem to in least satisfactory when one paint have said to once one be much more exposed to other influence one soul so to speak be on surface want one near who will keep eye on feel safe if have eye on margery know when religious people have be to church to revivalist meeting be much more susceptible to what see whether be sin sanctity be just because soul have come to surface be very unwise to go to see lot of strange people when be in state one know what influence may have on know what influence have on wish influence must make little le silly have replied margery went to bed quite happy in mind except on one point have be gifted by nature with superb serenity took much blustering wind to ruffle in main frank behavior be different not in kind only in degree from what have seen before when be painting always got nervous excited over picture really gave up to always talked ridiculous nonsense about personality influence though childlike desire to be with when be not working be more accentuated than usual drew very natural conclusion that be more absorbed than usual in work there be one point troubled have quite unaccountably shrunk from when ran to meet across studio have shrunk from again when saw face told that be own silliness not that be ridiculous of to try to cure frank of absurdity while be so absurd have shrunk back involuntarily a if from evil thing how absurd ridiculous of said to herself a settled in bed frank be frank be idea that be ceasing will cease to be frank have thought along be so supremely silly think supremely silly still yet shrank from a must from man who have committed crime then suddenly thought came to join one in brain what crime what do know of crime contact electric spark have be instantaneous for wrenched two thought apart have come together between have generated spark of light so without knowing knew for moment what be frank secret dared not tell chapter vii frank got up a custom be very early next morning went straight to studio margery keeping to resolve of night before left alone morning have sent breakfast in to ate hers alone in morning room knowledge that be with have have quieting effect on frank have slept deep dreamlessly a walked along passage to studio felt that hardly feared what must find there how must ghost of what be dead in have chance so to speak against near living reality of margery margery love be not good more powerful than evil when entered studio have wheeled portrait back into place supremacy of one side of nature over other be reversed instantaneously almost without consciousness of transition power thing hand have be working out for last few day have acquired be becoming overwhelming when margery be with actually with still held up better part when be alone with be good sank like lead in unplumbed sea be like heathen who make with own hand idol of stone wood then bow down before made believing that be lord over morning margery successfully fought against inclination to go to frank for be clear in own mind that have to work out salvation alone be afraid of being alone only way to teach not to be afraid be to let learn in solitude that there be nothing to be afraid of so yawned hour away over two volume novel by popular author wrote letter to mother ordered dinner tried to think be very busy be with certain sense of relief that heard clock strike one shutting up book went to studio frank be standing with back to door did not look up from work when entered came up behind saw what have wished not to see night before understood why always worked rapidly though never hurriedly knew at once what finished picture must be like idea be recorded gave sudden start little cry a sharp involuntary a cry of physical pain for meaning of first rough sketch have puzzled be now worked out saw before face of guilty man shrank shuddered a have shrunk when husband ran to meet across studio night before a have shrunk from when saw face for face looked out from canvas be same a husband face have so startled repelled be face of man who have wilfully stifled certain nobler impulse for sake of something wicked who be stifling still be face of man who have fallen when turned to look at frank saw that have in portrait seized on something stared from line of feature ah frank cried what have happened be horrible be horrible too frank did not seem to hear for went on painting heard murmur below breath yes horrible horrible for moment margery lost nerve completely be incontrollably frightened frank frank cried hysterically then cursed own folly be not way to teach laid one hand on arm with voice again in control leave off painting said leave off painting at once look at time heard right hand holding brush filled with paint dropped nervelessly to side brush slid from finger on to floor in moment face changed vicious guilty line softened faded expression became that of frightened child ah margery cried what have happened why be not here what have be doing margery have got between picture before have finished speaking have wheeled round with face to wall have be working long enough said be coming out for bit yes will be nice said frank picking up brush have dropped examining why be quite full of paint added a if remarkable discovery be quite worth comment dear how extraordinary said margery usually paint with dry brush oh have be painting morning so have said frank in same listless tired voice eye wandered to easel margery have turned round have got to let alone said guessing intention be not going to work more till afternoon frank passed hand over eye be rather tired said think wo go for walk will sit down here if will stop with very good for ten minute then must come out be lovely morning will only stroll frank looked out of window god be lovely morning said be insolently lovely have be dreaming think tree look a if be dreaming too wonder if have such horrible dream a think must have be asleep feel queer only half awake have have bad dream horrid dream did have nasty dream said sympathetically said be going to work so hard be dreamed instead frank seemed hardly to hear began by wondering whether ought to go on with portrait not said kept thinking will go on with frank broke in margery suddenly afraid of letting consent tell that must go on with frank roused at sound of eager voice understand said know that be running certain risk if do told about one of risk be running did be that partly be drawing about morning thought be in danger time be running risk of losing becoming something quite different to what be ran risk of losing care for except art with big ' dear asked margery with very biggest ' scarlet scarlet letter said margery triumphantly be reading last week account for symptom go on be more explicit know think be absurd said frank be better judge than know better than know better please god than will ever know however wo understand with regard to what told when paint picture think net result be picture instead of alone be wrong there be only just a before inasmuch a there be picture there be le of myself here in clothes picture be oil paint said margery buy that at shop yes brush too said frank picture be not only oil paint brush go on said margery well have got right to do in other picture have not mattered because one recuperates by degree one doe not put one self into painting feel differently be going into slowly inevitably will put be into at least know of while be painting what will happen to thing here pointed to ca say time be painting that thought with others be with a if have be written in fire on brain have got business to run risk ca estimate know have certain duty to perform to others be right for to risk for painted thing stood up margery said be not will tell rest there be risk run much more important much more terrible may tell may not said margery decidedly simply make fantastic fear more real to to speak of will not tell now be going out have one thing to tell listen to frank said standing up facing a said just now know nothing of risk run do know be that be in power a believe a believe to do something really good if go on with picture say that will like may be splendid piece of work without be artist silly child frightened of ghost want to finish because think may teach that have large number of silly idea in head when see that none of be fulfilled may help to get rid of in fact believe want to finish for same reason for be afraid to finish say will lose personality of personality say will get rid of great many silly idea if lose that part of personality will be delighted in fact be best thing must happen to a for other fear know what be want to know to speak of encourages to believe in there now have worked enough for present will go for stroll till lunch after lunch will go out again can work for hour two before get dark required margery resolution self control to get through speech be not pretty thing have looked out at from easel look have seen twice on frank face felt once be not pretty that work have very definite startling effect on knew from personal experience that anything must happen to entirely declined to believe be cross irritable odious a often told when be interested in work when be over became calm unruffled delightful again be fully determined must do portrait to allowed that must be relief when be finished frank got up at once with unusual docility a rule scowled snarled when fetched away from work made generally disagreeable uncommon state of thing gave margery great surprise well why say will be blessed if come asked moving towards door ah be quite willing to come said why must come always must come anywhere with followed towards door in passing suddenly caught sight of easel looked round like child afraid of being detected in doing something ought not before margery must stop have taken two quick step towards turned round in moment mood changed do see that said in whisper a if thing must overhear be what be morning when be not here knew ought to be painting wait minute margy want to finish bit be working at face grew suddenly pale look of guilt descended on like mist blotting out feature be what be making of said give palette quick sha' be minute margery caught up a have often done before palette brush from table where have left fled with to door give to at once shouted frank holding out hand for still looking at picture margery gave one long drawn breath of pain horror when looked at frank face then blessed sense of humor coming to aid broke out into light laugh half hysterical half amused oh frank cried look exactly like irving in beacbeth when say 'this be sorry sight never saw sorrier ' at sound of voice more particularly at sound of laugh turned looked at horror faded from face what have be saying asked said 'give dagger oh lady macbeth say that well here be come to frank will give frank walked obediently up to a stood in entrance to passage a soon a be outside studio banged door stood in front of triumphantly here be dagger said be not going to use now will finish that picture not like madman if look like macbeth more will simply die of will behave like lady macbeth then there will be pair of will walk in sleep down to sea wash hand day till get quite red now be coming out march chapter viii after lunch frank margery went down to river cruised about in little boat exploring a have explored hundred time before unexpected well known little creek ran up between hummock of broad backed hill shut in shadowed by delicate leaved beech tree when tide be high be possible to get way up into wooded retreat by remaining very still going quickly silently round corner might sometimes catch sight of kingfisher flashing up from willow darting along lane of flecked sunlight like jewel flung through air there have be frost first of year night before broad leaved dock hemlock lining bank have still drop of moisture on leaf like pearl moon stone semees on to green velvet wood have taken deeper autumnal tint in last two day already five ribbed chestnut leaf first of to fall be lying scattered on ground now then rabbit scuttled away to seek protection of thicker undergrowth young cock pheasant a yet unmolested stood looked at intruder margery be surprised to find how great relief of getting frank away from picture be horrible guilty look on portrait face more than that knowledge that be terribly true realization of husband expression disturbed more than liked to admit even to herself nothing determined not if ghost out of decameron sat in husband eye must make abandon resolution of compelling frank to finish did not believe in occult phenomenon of description painting of portrait must alter painter nature to get tired anxious be not same a losing personality first if one be working well hard be inevitable second be impossible be nonsense decidedly did not believe in possibility of losing personality with resolution to contrary must not help wondering what other fear have forbidden to tell be vaguely in own mind connected with strange shudder have felt when saw night before quite irrelevantly a seemed to image came into mind of something hidden rising to surface of sea giving up dead be on point alone distrusted resolution have made did not yet know clearly what feared realized dimly that there be possibility of becoming clearer to that when became clearer must have to decide afresh at present one desire be that must finish portrait finish a quickly a possible at rate have frank with now a have known loved life together that love must not risk at present did not see where risk must come in with away from portrait be again completely looked tired be rather silent often when turned from place in bow where be looking for concealed snag root in water to a punted boat quietly along with oar for stream be narrow to row in saw standing still oar in hand looking at when eye met smiled be like first afternoon be here margy be said on one of occasion do remember got here on september morning after travelling night from london after lunch came up very creek yes frank feel just a did then what did feel why why have got to myself at last did not care about anything else ah god cried frank suddenly what be asked frank ran boat into little hollow made in side of creek by small stream now nearly summer dry came sat down on bank just above margy dear said want to ask something quite soberly be not excited overwrought in way be be quite calm sensible be not a if horrible thing be with be about want to talk to about picture morning a told knew ought not to go on with went on because have terrible evil fascination for now too know ought not to go on with be wicked morning thought of afternoon spent here before knew be sacrificing that then did not care now be world to a always have be except when be with thing be that first day came here to very spot be fixed in mind now be here in same place on just such day let talk about oh frank be coward said margery appealingly know exactly what think about of course inclination go with raised from boat put hand on knee frank doubt do there be nothing in world must weigh against love must be reasonable if have very strong presentiment that must be drowned a sailed home must very likely be dreadfully uncomfortable must have walk back instead for anything there be many thing of know nothing presentiment fear horror in fact must be like child to take into reckoning let direct be for sake not mine that want to go on with portrait if followed inclination must say 'tear up let sit here together for ever ever ' frank leaned forward spoke entreatingly margy tell to tear up ah do dear may do with wish only tell to destroy margery shook head hopelessly disappoint frank said care for nothing in world compared to what reason must give for doing think often get excited upset over work be worth while because do good work be not permanently upset must give up being artist for if saw reason for telling to stop must do be because care for possibility that tell to go on with margery thought for moment of portrait terrible likeness bore to husband hesitated whole thing be too fantastic too vague did not even know what be afraid of be pleasant easy course be taking continued be pleasant look on face when shouted at to give palette morning frank looked puzzled what did do asked when did shout at morning just before came out shouted awfully loud looked like macbeth be just because want to look like macbeth permanently that insist on going on with want to get macbeth out of system that fantastic idea of yours that must run risk be original cause of nonsense when have finished picture seen that have run risk will know that be right frank stood up to morrow may be too late said do really tell to go on with frank dear be melodramatic be just a nice a must be way up here yes tell to go on with frank arm dropped by side for moment stood quite still leaf whispered in tree rippling stream tapped against boat then for moment breeze dropped boat swung round with current water made sound against a moved slowly round there be silence tense absolute silence then margery lay back in boat laughed laugh sounded strange in own ear be sure be one of occasion on ought to hear only beating of own heart a matter of fact come frank stand there like hop pole frank slowly let eye rest on did not answer smile margery paused moment come said again let go

matter with asked why do speak to like what nonsense be ca advise to give up because think much better for that must go on with waited for answer then bent to oar again green water hissed by a light boat cut through calm surface margery be sitting in stern managing rudder required nerve to guide boat among rock stood out from willower water frank terrible earnestness troubled did not shake resolution look at what way might deliberate conclusion be that be better must go on with there be reason there really be reason why must not there be reason why must wondered if have better see

margery heard door of studio bang behind chapter ix margery followed frank more slowly up to house have won point have refused in face of own inclination feeling to tell to leave picture unfinished to destroy having succeeded in for have be so intensely anxious reaction followed left to herself wondered if have be right whether be wise to trust to reason rather than instinct whether have not perhaps in dim uncomprehended way put frank in position of terrible danger where what in name of be rational must danger be yet there rose up before a if in answer to question remembrance of frank face while be painting must account for rationally be bound to confess must not be great relief to know that must soon be over important part frank have told must be done to day in hour two in whole range of human possibility must think of nothing must happen in hour two must justify frank fear be not well thought regarded finishing of portrait a sort of slight surgical operation must remove cause of mental disease from bodily indisposition sprang for present have to get through hour two alone busied with small unnecessary duty read more of small unnecessary book by popular author have referred to before little before five post came in among other letter for be note from jack armitage how go portrait concluded be to be summoned to see descent into bedlam ascent into heaven oddly enough there be artist here of transcendental tendency who hold exactly same view a frank belief in danger of losing one personality also belief in danger of raising ghost from one past life if one paint portrait of one luckily frank feel only danger of losing personality doe not think about ghost raising be glad for peace of mind perhaps for too that be so to fight two set of ghost simultaneously might well be too much for one woman even for margery laid down letter voice of reason within became gradually le insistent then died away frank have spoken of danger more terrible than one have told about must not hear there have be look on face frightened horrified must not think of once on beach at new quay have wished to tell something must not hear thing be impossible true be afraid felt suddenly unable to cope with fear now that have begun to share then armitage last word came back to beach hotel new quay will come at once margery felt ashamed of yielding justified yielding to herself presence of person in house must be good thing knew absolute necessity of keeping nerve in perfect order there be nothing so infectious a disorder of nerve got hat walked straight
