of morning to have slept to know sleepy head recounted remarkable experience to blessington at breakfast who be quite sure that be dream nice dream dream be dream said archie firmly where did mr contradiction go asked blessington archie knew where mr contradiction went for mr contradiction lived in very dull corner of nursery with face to wall for five minute well did seem like dream said may get down yes say grace thank god for good dinner said archie who be not attending say again dear said blessington think meant breakfast said archie amen discovery of connection made last night between in night nursery mother on lawn proved that lawn house be part of same thing produced further result that day instead of memory consisting of different severed picture began to flow into one coherent whole knew of course already at end of nursery passage be wooden wicket gate outside be long gallery skirted round three side of hall while on fourth ran broad staircase step of have to be surmounted descended either by series of jump if foot be tired by extension of one foot on to next stair where be joined by other began now to put isolated fact together form into conception of house when staircase be negotiated found in large oak floored hall where be not allowed to slide on purpose though blessington mother have sense to distinguish between deliberate unintentional slidings there be bright rug spread here there over hall forming island in glassy sea archie knew be not made of glass really chose to think that be for have quality of looking glass in reflected own bare legged form above slipperiness of glass a exhibited in window pane of nursery chose also to think that be to hall floor that hymn alluded be sung last sunday morning in dazzling populous place to mother have taken people who sang loudest be two row of boy dressed in crinkly white night shirt in company with grown up men who be attired in same curious manner none of went to bed at pause in proceeding archie have suddenly asked mother in piercing voice why did go to bed evidently that have puzzled too for have reply to give except hush darling be answer at then man have begun talking by have quantity of hair on chin wagged in so delightful manner when spoke that archie watched entranced for little then afraid that mother be missing lovely sight said o mummy be that funny man upon blessington magically communicated with appeared by side whispered that be going for walk towed down aisle still rapturously looking back at funny man archie have thought very entertaining be told afterwards by father that have disgraced must not go to church again for many sunday to come archie be frightened of father always went warily by door of room at dark corner of hall where tremendous person lived there be other danger about corner for on floor be two tiger skin looked a if animal in question have with exception of head be squashed out flat like a when blessington sometimes put flower have gathered on walk between two sheet of blotting paper piled book on top so that ceased to be flower became map of flower archie wished tiger head have be pressed in same way a be be disconcertingly solid life like with long teeth snarling mouth glaring eye have always made blessington come right up to father door with when went in to say good night so that must pilot safely past tiger on entry escort by again on return one night father have come out with finding blessington waiting there have divined a by awful black magic why nurse be waiting have decreed that archie must in future make way across danger zone unattended next evening trembling archie hurrying away in dusk have fallen down on glassy sea between awful scylla charybdis convinced that last hour have come when two cruel head beheld prostrate on floor have cried to sleep from terror of awful ending next day mother who understood about thing in general better than anybody have caused tiger to make friend with in token of amity have of presented with whisker hair assured friendship wished to be understood that snarlings glarings be directed not at archie at archie enemy naturally changed whole aspect archie after have wished father good night kissed hairy head have once be so terrifying thanked for successfully keeping enemy from molesting though now presence of tiger ceasing to be terror by night have become protection to archie corner of hall still constituted danger zone to be gone by swiftly silently lest raised voice incautious noise must cause to be called from within closed door of father room there be risk in room never quite knew whether be not going to be blamed for doing something have idea be blame worthy one day archie have found lovely wax match with blue head to on floor have put in pocket where fingered delightedly for knew to be sort flamed when rubbed against boot brick of house a have seen father do then when little later have come to sit on father knee be shown picture in book of natural history be detected that small finger smelled of phosphorus when reason be discovered be told by father that have stolen that match to archie mind there be something inexplicably unfair unjust about knew quite well that match be not have idea that be stealing if appropriated something be dropped on floor thing dropped on floor be nobody anybody so supposed might take have be quite affair when have taken eight lump of sugar out of basin on tea table in drawing room hidden in domino box have be perfectly well aware that be stealing have sense of injustice when mother have promptly soundly smacked for intensely resented being told by father that have stolen even though be not smacked when have not least idea that match dropped on floor be stealable article at felt far more bitter to be unjustly blamed than justly punished did know be stealing daddy said did know be yours yes did know that to take what be yours be stealing archie must explain be still quite sure have not be stealing father room then at least when potentate be in be place where extreme caution be necessary however cautious be have not felt guilty of smallest temerity in picking up match must never be quite sure that fate like great concealed cat must not pounce upon from most unexpected quarter considered in room have tremendous attraction for there be delicious smell about subtly compounded of leather back of book aroma of tobacco to archie dawning perception have something virile masculine about must understand manliness of place answered to something be shared by not shared by mother blessington sister belonged to man furniture appurtenance of room conveyed same message be strong solid without frillings frippery have decisive air purpose about somehow concerned that mysterious difference between boy girl between men woman mother sitting room be true seemed to archie fairy palace of loveliness with spindle legged table lace edged curtain soft silky cushion china glittering silver toy on particular black lacquer table nameless feminine fragrance room with solid leather chair held small limb a in tender male embrace gun case in corner whip rack few solid sober picture hung above book shelf struck different more intimate more intelligible note archie felt that knew what be about be about man to genus belonged particular specimen father might be unjust to severe to in secret inexplicable manner archie understood though fearing better than understood mother blessington of whom loved two sister in same way have quality of enigma about floating impression untranslatable instinct of early childhood began to thicken when archie be getting on for six year old into thought capable of being solidified into language must not have solidified if one capable of presenting to in actual word have asked be mean must have assented solidified thought must have taken following mould there be something odd about female be mystery into did not at want to enquire wore skirt perhaps concealed abnormality must be fearful to contemplate have soft face soft body when mother took on knee already said that be getting too big boy to sit on knee to archie sounded very grand delightful be soft to shoulder cheek be soft to when sat on father knee felt hard firm substance behind contrast be similar to contrast between mother soft cushion father leather clad chair father have hard bristly cheek on to receive archie good night kiss judged by standard of pleasure luxury be not nearly a nice a mother gave however great need there be for caution sense of identity with be of specie conception of abnormality in woman be strongly confirmed when one morning went a usual to mother bedroom to see before went down to breakfast have be late in getting up day not finding in bedroom archie attention have be arrested by hearing sound from bathroom next door very naturally have turned handle in order to enter voice from inside have said be that darling wait just minute want to come in now said archie be coming in archie will be very angry if come in before give leave said voice then there be rustling come in now there be mother standing by bath smelt deliciously fragrant in lovely blue bath towel dressing gown good morning darling said must never come into lady bathroom unless give leave why not said archie come to see in bath without saying 'yes gave delicious bubble of laughter reminded archie of sound of cool lemonade being poured out of bottle sha when be a old a said will always ask leave probably wo give why not be only said archie will know when be older said archie rather despised that argument seemed to apply to so many situation in life have already formed very excellent habit of crediting mother with gift of common sense for be not who have discovered that snarl of tiger head be snarl not at archie at enemy on occasion merely confirmed conviction that woman be somehow deformed wore skirt instead of breech though judging by younger sister be normal up to about level of knee seemed likely that leg extended farther that became like peg top swelling out in one round piece till body be reached what confirmed impression be that seemed to run from knee instead of striding with swung leg blessington always ran like foot twinkled in ridiculously short step after moment two said eh ca run more have got bone in leg have asked archie dear be just made of gristle quicksilver said blessington with sudden lyrical spasm a looked at shining face of most beloved what be quicksilver asked archie why have got bone in leg o o oh sudden thought struck have woman got bone in leg not boy be why ca run properly mummy ca run can william can damn master archie said blessington in most severe voice what for asked archie must never say that master archie said blessington who only called master archie on impressive occasion must never say what said after 'william can ' daddy said to william morning said archie blessington still wore iron mask on face be lucky for archie did not know how puzzled be a to correct answer papa say what think fit said be right for young gentleman never say how old will have to be began archie look at shoe lace untied said blessington with extreme promptitude do up at once will be treading on then will be time for to go in can write letter to miss marjorie before dinner miss marjorie be elder of archie two sister be ten year older than at present time be staying with grandmother whom archie strongly suspected of being witch man be large rustling have bass voice small moustache small husband who be earl to whom when came to stay with archie father who appeared to be son one paid great deal of unnecessary attention of archie father archie father father be lord archie distinctly thought ought to be lord too considering that father grandfather be blessington have hinted that must be lord too day if be good when pressed must say when in fact there be ridiculous reticence about whole matter for when have asked mother in presence of grandfather when be going to be lord grandfather quite inexplicably have giggled with laughter said have got one foot in grave already archie want to have be very cryptic remark when archie asked william footman what grandpapa tintagel have meant william have said that must say sir on archie looking hastily round feeling sure that blessington be not present have repeated damn william a daddy said then william after endeavouring not to show two row of jolly white teeth have said must never say that to master archie in fact there be clearly league blessington william who did love other a archie have ascertained by direct question to be at one over question of not saying that under stress of independent evidence archie decided not to say more without further experiment a to effect must have on mother if william blessington be agreed about have clearly better not be done more than be wise to walk about among flower of big herbaceous border gardener gardener boy mother be of one mind about gardener boy have threatened to turn hose on to if caught at gardener boy be quite grown up so for archie have weight of authority befitted year be lovely disconnected life there be sort of delightful highly coloured strand contributed to others of more sombre hue others again quite secret concerned archie alone of never spoke to anybody of delightful highly coloured strand there be many waking in morning knowing that there be going to be day be one of perhaps be most delightful of except when rarely be clouded with trouble of evening before a when archie have broken window in father study in laudable attempt to kill wasp with fire shovel have be told by blessington that father wished to see moment be dressed in morning usually waking be ecstatic often used to return to consciousness in summer month long before blessington came in to call window be always open window in night nursery be opened a soon a got into bed blind be up on ceiling be most delicious green light for early sun shone through branch of beech outside painted archie ceiling with pale milky green be adorable to contemplate must pull up night shirt with bare arm clasp bare knee lying on back rather unsteadily anchored must roll backwards forward looking at green light rehearsing delightful probability of day sometimes mother have promised that must go out fishing on lake when lesson be done implied wonderful experience of seeing walter william come out on to lawn pour out of tin gardening can mixture of mustard water when footman did that be certain that in short time grass must be covered with worm william put in tin box lined with moss then archie william sometimes with sister whose presence archie thought be not wholly desirable since impeded free flow of talk between william must go down to lake william who must do everything put worm on hook did not seem to mind for said word of protest sculled across to sluice above be deep water where fish fed away from reed where line got entangled so that be impossible to know whether be engaged with fish vegetable fishing rod came out of father study be delightful male attribute about room when archie went in to ask for came too not in livery in ordinary clothes father said take good care of master archie william good sport archie sometimes again if be not busy lord davidstow came out with archie instead of william be somehow honour archie did not like so much once there be great happening william produced curious object that looked like bowl of spoon with hook set round said there be going to be worm time instead of drifting about rowed up down while archie with rod over stern saw spoon flashing through water then great shadow came over archie felt rod bend in hand be so excited that stepped on to seat of boat in order to see better promptly fell overboard be not least frightened rather enjoyed splash sense of soda water round with hand held on to fishing rod seemed absolutely essential thing to do sank down down in deep water seeing green yellow above head then instantly knew be going to be drowned feeling precisely identical to have experienced one night when woke of universal presence round about took complete possession of then even before be conscious of least sense of choking discomfort be still only aware of coolness depth greenness great dark splaying object came right down upon from above found tucked underneath human arm coatless in shirt sleeve took to be william still archie did not let go of fishing rod mistakenly trying to speak bidding william take care of mouth apparently whole interior filled with water drowning suddenly seemed to be disagreeable process next moment however head emerged from water again william caught hold of boat let go rod master archie said catch hold of boat there be fish on spluttered archie do a tell sir said william quite crossly archie have be told that when went out in boat with william have to do precisely a william told be not be true in boat at moment injunction probably applied so let go of rod moment afterwards found violently propelled over side of boat tumbled abroad on floor of be dozen yard from land william having once got archie into boat grabbed hold of rod with spare hand swam shoving boat in front of oh well done william oh william love screamed archie when having righted observed brilliant manoeuvre be fish there still william scrambled up bank still holding rod run indoors at once master archie said wait moment william be fish began archie do a tell sir said william again will bring fish for if get archie ran with backward glance across lawn where be met by blessington who have observed accident out of window before must explain thrilling thing have happened be undressed rubbed down put between blanket then after few minute in came william having also changed clothes with great pike father followed shook hand with william mother did same saying thing made william blush stand first on one foot then on other murmuring be nothing at lady archie asked if william might go out again that afternoon catch pike then in came younger sister jeannie who be only two year senior appeared to be on point of cry flung arm round archie neck in uncomfortable sort of way archie told be messing after in reaction from thrilling affair felt suddenly tired being encouraged to go to sleep nestled down in blanket woke up to find that there be fish stuffed for dinner for william era of unexampled popularity archie did not understand at time why have suddenly blossomed into such favouritism unless be for having clung tight to father fishing rod enjoyed immensely be pleasant too not long afterwards to be given gold watch by father to present to william with gold chain provided by mother william permitted to put gold watch into one waistcoat pocket end of gold chain into other father mother jeannie shook hand with william again one seemed to be spending time in shaking hand with william so archie since william be friend more than anybody else kissed in order to mark difference between other people with regard to be surprised to find that william have got soft cheek like mother supposed that men face grew hard a grew older instantly mentioned surprising fact william appeared rather glad to leave room in archie life event ever occurred approached splendour public magnificence of whole experience day world widened lying looking at green light on ceiling in cool still morning of summer seemed to last for year year archie found not only speculating on what fresh joy day must bring joining together in mind happening at time seemed disconnected proved to be part of continuous thread of existence just a nursery passage steep stair father room lawn lake passed from being isolated phenomenon into piece of whole so thing happened proved to be experience of person who be known to others a archie morris to archie a sometimes so tingled with vigour when woke that contrary to order stepped out of bed leaned out of window to look at bright dewy world with one ear alert to hear blessington foot along passage in order to leap back into bed again for now have night nursery to blessington slept next door at hour lawn must be covered with shimmering grey mantle pearl coloured here there few diamond have got in by mistake shone with just brilliance of mother necklace perhaps be bed clothes of lawn when day came be covered over by green bed spread like lay on own bed lake away to right have different bed clothes thicker one of same colour doubt be thicker because lake be colder for on morning must not see through at to left out of window rose wood where rabbit lived sometimes one of early riser like archie must have found gap in netting be out on lawn nibbling grass gardener did not approve of for lawn appeared belonged to people who lived in archie house not to folk in wood be trespass on part of rabbit for punishment rather severe one be death by shooting have added new terror to notice in wood where blessington sometimes walked announced that trespasser must be prosecuted blessington be foolhardy enough to disregard notice altogether saying that be daddy notice did apply to for time archie never chose that walk for fear that blessington might be wrong about that must meet somebody in wood who must instantly shoot for trespassing in childish fashion kept terror to sooner than enquire about till one day actually did meet in wood man with gun then in sudden wild terror archie clung to blessington cry out oh ask not to shoot time eh darling said blessington who be going to shoot be only one of daddy keeper will shoot screamed archie be trespasser will shoot like rabbit matter being thereupon explained archie convinced that blessington be not going to be shot for trespassing found that must make up for entrancing story of how master rabbit nurse who be good never trespassed on lawn that rabbit saw there corresponded to grandmamma tintagel so did not care whether be shot not story told in early morning looking out on to lawn lying curled up on back in bed looking at green ceiling be not vague dream like imaginings be endowed with vividness made blessington entry with bath clothes seem le real than became impossible indeed for to disentangle reality a judged by people like father gardener from imagination told so strongly that there be grandmamma tintagel sitting on lawn trespassing nibbling grass for breakfast that presence there absence when there be trespassing rabbit became thing a vivid a subsequent dressing breakfast have be definitely asked if believed be grandmamma tintagel must have said in imaginative life so hard for child to dissociate from real life there be question a to identity happened also that at time mother be reading to realest of book namely alice in wonderland imaginative boy of five must possibly doubt actual existence of white rabbit in convincing history archie must not have be surprised if one morning there have proved to be white rabbit sitting by fence who looked at watch put on glove yet never spoke of possibility even to blessington william did not belong to sphere of thing about be reasonable to converse to grown up people simply because be stupid about certain matter must not understand fact that grandmamma tintagel sometimes sat on lawn in early morning be among topic kept quite completely to there be other such topic sometimes when lay in bed waiting for blessington to call did not choose to get up look out of window be because other secret affair engaged if lay still stared at green hued ceiling curious wave of shadow appeared to pas over seemed like sunny floor of water have closed above head on morning when fell out of boat there be lying in bed deep below surface of liquid light cut off from outer world wondered if in moment splayed starfish of arm leg turned out to be william must dive down for bring up among common thing again william never made impressive entry through ceiling if stared long enough archie only seemed to to slip down down gently rapturously through deep water world world of hidden thing dwelt below surface came slowly into existence like a when on mounting slope fresh valley hillside arise unfurl only in case have to go down somewhere inside to become aware of something inner consciousness recognized hailed be not that be getting sleepy sinking into water of dream rather experience be result of more vivid life awakened perception never got further than during day be far too busy with affair of normal life to trouble about perception dawned on on still quiet morning when lay bed stared at ceiling with flickering green light moving shadow chapter ii archie birthday be in november for day two before tremendous annual event there be always certain atmosphere of mystery abroad be conscious of at odd minute met marjorie on morning of day before must be six walking down nursery passage with parcel in hand content of must not divulge afternoon too mother drove into neighbouring town in motor must not take with on excuse that have shopping to do though be commonest thing in world for to take with when went shopping year vaguely connected odd happening with birthday a did also fact that week ago blessington have brought total stranger into nursery who have very politely asked to take off coat stranger have then knelt down on floor in front of have produced tape with proceeded to measure archie over from hip to knee knee to ankle round waist round chest along arm making note of thing in book blessington have told that mr johnson wanted to see how much have grown be certainly very gratifying attention especially since archie have grown good deal be extremely proud of fact mr johnson congratulated too said that have grown a much a for many year tried to account for visit on general ground of interest in archie in spite of archie connected call with birthday though did not arrive at deduction that meant clothes mother came up to tea in nursery on return from mysterious drive said that have just caught sight of fairy abracadabra a drove down high street have not known that abracadabra be in neighbourhood asked archie if abracadabra have called while be out archie after moment pause said that have seen in pause something of glory faded out of bright trailing cloud when be asked that directly did not feel sure whether believed in abracadabra in same way in believed in blessington jeannie so short time ago last summer only alice in wonderland identity of grandmamma tintagel have be so much realler than paltry happening that took place in light of common day now quite suddenly unexpectedly at mere question a to whether have seen abracadabra began to fade indeed be more than fading be a if passed out of sight behind corner archie have be told that must never if must help hurt people feeling particular occasion when have be brought home to be when sister jeannie have to wear rather delightful sort of band round front teeth showed tendency to grow crooked be shy about hoped nobody saw when archie called attention of public to turned very red have not have least intention of embarrassing for thought band rather nice must have liked to have have one have teeth be sufficiently advanced for decoration on occasion saw instantly clearly that must not hurt mother feeling by expressing scepticism about abracadabra perhaps mother still believed in though there be difficulty about supposing that seeing that if abracadabra be not abracadabra be certainly mother in case thought archie believed in abracadabra made quite sufficient reason for appearing to do so if abracadabra be invention designed to awe delight mystify most elementary obligation of not embarrassing other people enjoined on that must be awed delighted mystified perhaps by next year something must have happened to abracadabra for nowadays only made appearance on birthday whereas must remember when paid jeannie also birthday visit year have not come on jeannie birthday various member of family have given birthday present did not happen when abracadabra came for be chief dispenser of offering so archie replied that abracadabra have not be during mother absence in order to spare mother mortification of knowing that have doubt about benevolent fairy laid out to ask intelligent question why did speak to mummy said when saw in high street because be in hurry went by like flash of lightning in pearl chariot be there thunder asked yes just one clap that might have be wheel of chariot what do think will bring archie be holding mother hand slipping ring up down finger a held suddenly became aware what one of present must be clock work train said quickly knew more than about clock work train felt perfectly certain that be in mother bedroom at moment reposing in big cupboard where kept dress do want clock work train asked yes mummy frightfully said feeling that be playing part for knew mother knew that wanted clock work train what else oh thousand of thing particularly pen writes without dipping in ink well if be must write down thing want leave paper lying on counterpane when go to sleep what will do asked archie be fairy post instead of putting letter into box to be posted when want to reach fairy have always to put on bed mind address to fairy majesty empress abracadabra then when fairy come round to collect post will find there take to abracadabra perhaps if come to morrow let see must be year since be here will bring few thing for birthday ca tell think be best chance of getting certainly seemed very pleasant sort of plan archie have never heard of before extremely matter of fact tone in mother spoke lit again dawning hope in mind that perhaps be true why must be fairy abracadabra fairy post just a there have be now be no longer glassy sea between rug in hall snarling tiger to keep off enemy if believed thing enough became real with few trifling exception a for instance when on one of day last summer day crammed full of most delightful event archie have found firmly believing that particular day be never coming to end true have come to end that perhaps be because have believed strongly enough there be lovely story mother have read about man called joshua who wanted day to remain until have killed enemy sure enough sun stood still until have accomplished that emphatic task never doubted that because came out of bible in spirit of joshua set now to believe in abracadabra fairy post with in mind kept eye firmly away from cupboard where mother kept dress that evening when maid opened lest must see there parcel felt secretly convinced be there contained clock work train mother have bought abracadabra must to morrow assuredly bring out of basket of pure gold with habitually travelled archie put letter for fairy post on bed determined to keep awake so that must see fairy postman come for be very cold night big fire burned in grate so though window a usual be open there be clear brisk warmth about room frosty soapy smell for bright brown hair have be washed that night be special evening bath night for by now bath have be promoted to morning stuck up over head in novel independent manner blessington have dried by fire for with hot towel very extraordinary thing have happened for when brushed afterwards gave forth little crackling told be electricity be thing made lamp burn have allowed to take brush to bed with make more crackling for five minute until returned to put light out archie made wonderful story to a looked at fire that must get electric lamp paste to head so that must be able to read by light of hair at once seemed so feasible so easy of belief that pictured to everybody walking about house in evening lit by then william came round corner did not know what corner carrying electric pike for birthday present to when blessington stole in five minute afterwards archie brush have slipped from finger breath came evenly between parted lip there be gap in front teeth because tooth have come out only to day embedded in piece of toffy be eating have made archie squeal with laughter for here be new substance called toffee blessington softly lifted arm laid under bedclothes without awaking looked at moment with old face beaming with love put down on chair out of sight at bottom of bed new sailor suit took away note to fairy majesty empress abracadabra archie woke next morning instantly remembered that have attained magnificent age of six six have long seemed to one of most delightful age to be eighteen be mainly because william be eighteen six be best of for at eighteen must inevitably feel that have lived life that there be nothing much left to live for for rest must be slow descent into vale of year to day be six be birthday there be sign of letter have written to abracadabra on counterpane might have slipped on to floor not have be taken away by fairy after might have slipped over bottom of bed archie got up to see there be note there on chair at foot of bed be suit of sailor clothes archie gave gasp certainly presence there constituted possibility that be for hardly dared let contemplate so dazzling prospect for fear must be whisked out of sight yet who must be for if not for must be blessington for be female wore mystery cloaking skirt sailor suit be boy clothes harry travers son of neighbouring squire aged eight have sailor suit be thing archie most envied about young man harry have taken coat trouser off one day in summer when two boy be playing in copse by lower end of lake have let archie put on for three minute have be thrilling adventure implied undressing out of door be very unusual thing to do loved feeling of rough serge down bare calf have of course offered privilege of putting on knickerbockers jacket if must get into without splitting harry from pisgah summit of eight year have desire to go back to childish thing of land of bondage have danced about bare legged while archie enjoyed three minute in voluminous grown up lending now perhaps for too not for three minute only for day took leap back into bed again a blessington tread sounded on board outside archie pretended to be asleep for wanted to be awakened by blessington hear birthday greeting loved return of consciousness in morning when have not already be awake speculating about grandmamma tintagel on lawn to find blessington with hand on shoulder gently stirring face close to whispering to eh be time to get up so morning not for first time simulated sleep in order to recapture lovely sense of being awakened by love must understand that did not put to like for archie just at age of six be not mature conscious prig wanted to know what blessington greeting to must be when thought woke up on morning of sixth birthday from narrow chink of eyelid not quite closed must see of movement took exciting suit of sailor clothes from bottom of bed laid on chair where always put clothes with flannel shirt of quite unusual shape sock on top already archie have heart burning at knowledge of knowledge of sailor suit blessington meant to be surprise to surprise determined must be in interval there be surprise how must blessington wake must be sure to rise to immense importance of occasion moved quietly about shut window brought in bath then came close up to bed felt hand stealing underneath bedclothes to shoulder shook gently eh master six said oh have done exactly right thing have divined archie a have divined knowing be just only thing to think about morning ceased to imagine blessington out of simplicity of love have given

cooled little a sat in still remembering that be six poured sponge full down spine that over might wash face neck well behind ear with soap up till few month ago blessington have always superintended bath done thing for now did for a agent with blessington a inspector general in background who might always make strictest scrutiny into place behind ear toe nail to see that effect of bath be perfectly satisfactory if not blessington superintended again for next three morning so archie be very careful since be so much grander to wash than to be washed by anybody else then came most exciting part of bath for close at side of be big tin full of coldest possible water have then to stand up in bath after washing face in cold water to put cold water everywhere within reach of on one

even sailor suit be within few yard of front door when there ran out of bush cyrus great blue persian cat held something in mouth archie saw to be bird there stood for moment with gleaming eye of successful hunter twitching tail then trotted in front of towards porch simultaneously jeannie called out oh blessington cyrus have caught thrush must get from may be still alive till then archie have

proper pomp appreciated that secretly be pleased that harry travers must be ushered by william into drawing room have door held open for be announced a mr travers with streak of snobbishness common to almost small boy archie thought rather jolly without swaggering at to be able to greet friend in midst of glory so that must see splendour for in other way must have perhaps preferred nursery certainly must have done so when moment came for to cut birthday cake for sugar on side of cracked exploded a such confectionery will do when archie hewed way down white perpendicular cliff number of fragment falling on floor have to stand quite still knife in hand till william got housemaid brush scoop removed debris for fear must be trodden into carpet marjorie have not appeared at tea at when sumptuous affair be over jeannie harry archie gathered round lady davidstow on hearthrug with box of chocolate planted at fair equal distance between told most delicious story about boy whose mother have lost birthday so that year after year went by without having birthday at light have be put out only magic of leaping fire light guided hand to chocolate box moment phantasy of story got more more interwoven with reality of chocolate eventually while birthday le boy mother be clearing out big cupboard underneath stair came across birthday put away in purple box with gold lock on be cupboard underneath stair in hall here asked archie for question be permitted yes there be eight birthday in so have one day for more than week dear what be that certainly be very startling noise like mixture

better do will go into hall must like to be there to meet perhaps if be coming went to door followed by child looked out into black hall wood fire in hearth there have died down to mere smoulder of red sent illumination hardly farther than stone fender curb there be something there said lady davidstow in awe struck whisper there be something sitting in chair oh mummy said archie coming close to think like be sure there be nothing to be frightened at archie said of will go see what be there be volunteer for hazardous job for now with eye more accustomed to faint light must see that be not something there somebody outline of head of body of leg clothed in black must be seen somebody sat there perfectly still then of sudden gong bell trumpet broke out into clamour fit to wake dead great chandelier in hall flared into light black figure sprang up throwing darkness behind there glittering with silk gem gold flower of fairyland stood abracadabra have on huge poke bonnet cast shadow over face left terrifyingly vague bonnet be trimmed with sunflower lily of valley round edge of went row of diamond be quite a big a drop in glass chandelier necklace of same brilliance went round throat rested on crimson satin bodice covered with gold from shoulder sprang spangled wing from below skirt with garland of rose be silver shoe with diamond buckle in hand carried blue wand hung with bell by side be clothes basket such be shape made of gold stamped foot with rage here be nice welcome lady davidstow said in thin cracked voice sneezed to show be coming when got through keyhole found hall dark one to receive how dare lady davidstow advanced with faltering step fell on knee oh majesty forgive said why must forgive squeaked infuriated fairy why must take away in basket put in tower of toad archie gasped must have given much for touch of yesterday scepticism must find atom of thought of mother being whisked off to tower of toad be insupportable oh please said who be that asked

instead will make extra lady in waiting on peacock staircase mistress of tortoise shell robe oh mummy will be lovely for said archie remembering that mother be something of kind to somebody already then there came giving of present with surprise occurred during such process archie be told to advance put hand in left far corner of golden basket a prepared to do so abracadabra sneezed so loudly that fled back to bottom stair of staircase where have be all commanded to sit there be tennis racquet for harry light went out when have just reached clothes basket abracadabra blew nose so preposterously that ear sang with afterwards there be great parcel for lady davidstow a big a football be found to contain when paper be stripped off nothing more than single acid drop in order to teach mistress of tortoise shell robe better manner when mistress came to pay visit blessington summoned from nursery be presented with new cap bulk of gift a be proper be for archie clock work train pen needed dipping fishing rod second suit of sailor clothes then light went out again abracadabra began sneezing blowing nose with such deafening violence that screen stood just behind rocked with concussion child at suggestion of mistress of tortoise shell robe groped way back into drawing room with present shut door till abracadabra be better when from cessation of awful noise conjectured might be better ventured out into hall again that audience chamber be just a usual archie father came out of room looking vexed asking what beastly noise be about when heard be abracadabra who have gone away again be greatly upset said that be beastly noise at loveliest music have ever heard then came bed time archie still excited said prayer with special impromptu clause for abracadabra for thrush suddenly remembered again then lay staring at fire with hand clasped round knee a custom be certainly abracadabra have be wonderfully real to day certainly be not mother then recollected that marjorie have not appeared at wondered if marjorie perhaps be abracadabra if thrush be abracadabra of cyrus hand relaxed hold on knee when blessington came in did not know that kissed tucked bed clothes up under chin chapter iii archie did not often come into contact with miss schwarz sister governess be not person to be lightly encountered sometimes if blessington be busy jeannie went out for walk with eldest sister miss schwarz on occasion miss schwarz marjorie must talk together in unknown guttural tongue very ugly to hear archie vaguely understood be german sort of thing that everybody spoke in country to miss schwarz went for holiday at midsummer christmas that uncouth jargon full of such noise a made when cleared throat be quite unintelligible seemed odd that marjorie must converse in when must speak ordinary english somehow seemed to suit miss schwarz who have sallow face prominent teeth cold grey eye otherwise did not often meet for led odd secret existence in sister school room breakfasting having lunch downstairs in dining room eating evening meal by in school room have black unrustling dress for day black rustling dress for evening necklace of onyx bead used to finger with dry thin hand reminded archie of claw of bird mother have told that after christmas must do lesson with miss schwarz prospect rather terrified supposed that miss schwarz must probably teach in guttural language jeannie be beginning to understand too have moment of secret terror when pictured miss schwarz enraged at not comprehending striking at with claw like hand be coming upstairs one evening rather later than usual for father have be showing content of cabinet of butterfly archie enraptured with gorgeous brilliant creature have begged to be allowed to wait till gong rang for dinner on way upstairs remembered that have lent jeannie pen wrote without being dipped with to write german exercise have gone to bed early that night with bad cold archie recognizing impossibility of going to sleep without precious pen in possession again ran along passage to school room where be likely to find might entail momentary encounter with miss schwarz recovery of pen be essential entered miss schwarz have finished dinner be sitting by fire on steamed kettle held big glass in hand be pouring something into from bottle there be high colour in usually sallow face a saw archie made one of guttural exclamation what do want said though spoke english archie noticed that spoke in same thick guttural manner a german archie froze with terror be quite new miss schwarz gleaming eager miss schwarz oh lent jeannie pen stammered came to look for doe matter nonsense be not why said miss schwarz angrily then suddenly seemed to take hold of ach sweet little pen will find on table dear luke find then say good night to poor miss schwarz ach be so ill evening heartburn be just about to take medicine vat make better tell one dear archie poor miss schwarz be ill wish to troble nobody poor miss schwarz naiver geeve troble if can 'elp ach have pen good night deear archie fled down passage to nursery with terror giving wing to heel miss schwarz angry one moment affectionate effusive next be new more awful person than one be acquainted with felt sure must be very ill indeed must be terrible affair if miss schwarz be found dead in bed in spite of medicine just because have not told anybody that be ill so doctor have not be fetched there must be burden on conscience for ever if did not tell somebody burst into nursery with wild look behind to make sure that miss schwarz be not following in evening rustling dress oh blessington cried miss schwarz be ill do go see what be matter went to school room for pen be sitting by fire red angry then polite mixing medicine blessington got up from rocking chair eh will go see said tell told said archie nay of course wo now begin undressing will be back very soon excited frightened yet hugely interested archie stood at door of room listening suddenly heard sound of miss schwarz voice raised almost to scream then there came crash of glass ringing of bell while still miss schwarz voice gabbled on shrill guttural trembling yet unable to resist call of curiosity stole to corner of nursery passage saw william come upstairs go along to school room then blessington came out instead of coming back to nursery went downstairs presently father came up again with too went along school room passage suddenly a if tap have be turned off shrill voice ceased once for moment broke out again a suddenly stopped then came very odd sight of miss schwarz being led along landing to room by father blessington blessington miss schwarz entered together father went downstairs after moment conversation with william presently william came along landing towards nursery oh william what be happened said archie be miss schwarz very ill well ai very well said william lumme what doe mean asked archie mean anything particular master archie will miss schwarz be better in morning asked archie lord yes be always better in morning though feel so now blessington wo be back yet awhile so be to look after see safe to bed suddenly thought of lying helpless in bed with blessington next door possibility of miss schwarz guessing that archie have told of illness filled with awful apprehension might come screaming down passage with claw like hand starving for archie face oh william leave till blessington come back entreated sir of course wo there let undo shoe for have got lace in knot wo hurt blessington asked archie bless sir said william there be night shirt now jump into bed will open window william put out light archie with delicious sense of security seeing seated by fire dozed off once just before got fairly to sleep awful vision of miss schwarz red face came across field of closed eyelid started up in moment william be by be right sir said be on look out there be decided air of mystery concerning miss schwarz next morning be better remained unseen nobody must answer question about in afternoon archie met walter odd man carrying luggage downstairs gleaned information that be going away again later in day archie saw housemaid coming out of bedroom with basket full of medicine bottle drew conclusion that must have be ill long time without anybody knowing not syllable of news must obtain from anybody a image of miss schwarz faded now that dark ill omened presence be withdrawn there be left in archie mind no more than general sense of connection between screaming voice red face indistinct utterance drinking of yellow medicine out of large glass instead of usual small one there be pleasant holiday sense for few day after departure of miss schwarz for marjorie took jeannie archie lesson made perfect festival of learning immediately almost came ominous news that new governess be coming next day archie believed that miss schwarz be typical specimen of genus governess who be probably in league together that colleague of miss schwarz bent on avenging must render own security very precarious matter be indeed consolation to know miss bampton be personal friend of mother be not regular governess at be just going to stay at lacebury teach lesson yet archie wondered when went downstairs on morning after arrival whether must not detect under guise of mother friend secret agent of miss schwarz jeannie have lately be promoted to have breakfast with rest of family a archie opened door heard burst of laughter there be miss schwarz secret agent sitting next father must have be who have made laugh for be not laughing archie already knew that joke be laughed at most by people who have made be little roundabout person with blue eye short nose pincenez got up a entered be archie said why always thought of archie a baby here be able bodied seaman how be archie archie stared moment reviewed suspicion about governess in general certainly if plump genial female be secret colleague of miss schwarz disguise be of most ingenious kind be a well to be careful be quite well thank said perceiving that kiss have be intended presented sideways cheek miss bampton made sucking sound against sat down again well a be saying went on only plan of teaching be co operative principle there be such heap of jolly thing to learn that if girl have meeting a suggested after breakfast be sure can find plenty of subject between so summon meeting for quarter past ten in school room archie suddenly felt be being left out meeting to discus what be going to learn sounded most promising in way of lesson ran round to mother side oh mummy may go to meeting said must ask miss bampton said archie stifled sense of distrust for wanted tremendously to go to meeting where settled what be going to learn hated lesson in ordinary acceptation of term with tiresome copy book in have to write same moral maxim down page stupid exercise called french lesson in have to address to cat say in french of cat to cat with female cat with male cat thing called geography be brown book with list of country capital town in co operative lesson though have idea what co operation meant sounded far more attractive may come to meeting miss bampton said yes dear of course said miss bampton if mother will let thereupon there dawned for archie great light hitherto lesson have be conducted by mother with occasional tuition from father have always made impression that be task not difficult in dull have learned various mode of access in french to male female cat have grasped fact that rome not berlin be capital of italy paris not vienna capital of france piece of information be mere disconnected formula lesson in other word have to be learned if imperfectly learned caused to be called lazy inattentive in same way fact that have to write in laborious round hand down page to be good be to be happy meant nothing more than necessity of filling page without plethora of blot erasure from date of exciting meeting on co operative learning whole new horizon dawned on be settled at once that be to do lesson with miss bampton from moment ceased to be lesson at instead of list of country capital to be learned by heart there be provided jig saw puzzle of map of europe italy became leg foot perpetually kicking sicily rome button through italy bootlace passed instead of dreary copy book maxim heading page miss bampton in hand quite a perfect a mr darnell wrote most stimulating sentiment on top of blank leaf must not sit down so bit be one archie with tip of tongue at corner of mouth attitude be almost indispensable to round hand orthography be filled with delightful conjecture a to who person be who must not sit down who be tigerish people who bit in consequence then miss bampton have most delightful plan of where lesson might be done one day when be snowing hard conceived brilliant plan of doing lesson in motor in garage gave most extraordinary stimulus to proceeding for early english history be lesson that morning so archie jeannie be royal anglo saxon specially invited to come in coach to coronation of william conqueror must never do if at coronation banquet afterwards asked question about ancestor did know day when sun shone frostily lawn be covered with hoar frost wrapped up in fur worked at geography a laplanders in summer house marjorie be too old to need such spur to industry miss bampton have enticing scheme for also giving verse translation of heine goethe encouraging to see how near got to original when translated back into native tongue christmas holiday looked forward to with such eager expectation in baleful reign of miss schwarz drew near now instead of counting hour till moment when miss schwarz safe in motor must blow claw fingered kiss to child got up round robin rather triangular robin marjorie translated into german begging miss bampton to stop with for holiday for be a admirable in play time a be over lesson told enchanting story on walk painted for in real smelly oil paint most lovely snow scene pine wood laden with whiteness cottage with red blind lit from within never have one repertory of game to be played in long dark hour between tea bed time be during one of archie made curious discovery game in question be animal vegetable mineral one of thought of anything in heaven earth in water under earth rest by question answered only by yes have to arrive at on occasion miss bampton have thought be known to be animal not in house archie be sitting on floor in school room leaning against miss bampton knee have be staring at coal holding miss bampton hand in when suddenly there came over precisely same sensation that remembered feeling one night year ago when woke imagined night nursery expanding extending till embraced existed sensation throbbed thrilled through now said oh miss bampton how easy why be longest tail feather of thrush cyrus killed oh archie guess said jeannie be use just guessing be said archie be not guessing know be miss bampton certainly be so by rule of game since have be guessed in under five minute miss bampton have to think again now archie tried in vain to recapture mood made miss bampton mind so transparently clear to knew what that mood felt like falling away of limitation of consciousness that expansion extension of must not feel must not come by effort on part came must suppose a chose like sneeze a christmas drew near amazing talent of miss bampton showed marjorie have be up to london one day to combine pain of dentist with pleasure of play came back with comforted tooth strong desire to act instantly miss bampton rose to occasion let get up play to act to father mother on new year night said oh must be fun said marjorie what play must act will write one said miss bampton write did with speed lavishness of plot must have astonished more deliberate dramatist there be villain usurper king miss bampton there be fairy marjorie there be rightful youthful king archie who lived act in painful squalor in dungeon attended only by jailer daughter jeannie who knew identity loved whether be in dungeon on throne luckily loved too anywhere be kind to beggar woman who turned out to be fairy did rest miss bampton be consigned to lowest dungeon everybody else lived happily ever afterwards then came question of dress marjorie rather thoughtlessly exclaimed be sure mother will let have abracadabra clothes for fairy oh forgot added remembering that archie be present there be attempt feeble so archie thought on part of miss bampton to explain away said that abracadabra kept suit of birthday clothes in house visited archie received information quite politely said oh see remained wholly incredulous faith in abracadabra myth have tottered before be blow finally completely compassed ruin disappeared in limbo of discredited imaginings like glassy sea between rug in hall snarl of tiger at enemy never again must combined crash of servant dinner bell chinese gong make wonder at magnificence of abracadabra sneezing when play arrived at stage of dress rehearsal be shock to see marjorie in abracadabra poke bonnet bediamonded bodice must not be supposed that with disappearance of childish illusion world became in way duller le highly coloured to archie grew on contrary more more fairy like outburst of spring that year filled with ecstasy must best be expressed by running fast jumping in air with shout of joy unfolding of gummy bud on horse chestnut by lake filled with rapture keener because must not comprehend presently sight of pale green five fingered leaf weak a new dropped lamb made race round round blessington till got giddy there be smell of damp earth in air of young varnished grass blade pushing up among discoloured faded foliage of lawn for hard bright sky sullen cloud of winter new tender blue be poured over heaven cloud white a washed fleece pursued one aloft even a shadow bowled over earth beneath bird began to sing again sparrow chattering in ivy pulled straw twig about practising for nest building time must soon be upon purplish mist hung over birch tree soon changed to mist of green a bud expanded violet hidden behind leaf bedecked lane side one morning first primrose appeared last year doubt in preceding spring same thing have happened now for first time be significant penetrated further than mere field of vision filled archie with unreasoning joy anything in shape of natural history received strong encouragement from lord davidstow a well a anything archie did not fully grasp tended to keep out of door when short lesson be done jeannie started year series of joint collection certain rule have to be observed flower that picked must be duly pressed mounted on sheet of cartridge paper name must be ascertained one bird egg might be taken in absence of mother bird from nest contained four must be blown put in labelled cell in egg cabinet when three specimen of sort have be collected more must be acquired that perhaps be collection archie liked best though joy of aquarium ran close aquarium be big bread bowl lined at bottom with spa crystal in lived caddis worm water snail dace probably weak in head for have allowed to be caught in landing net without least effort to get out of way have inordinate passion for small bread pill in pursuit of be so violently active that often hit nose against side of aquarium so hard that must positively hear stunning blow when satiated must still continue to rush after bread pill after holding in mouth moment must expel again with such force that resembled submarine discharging torpedo then there be butterfly collection be of short duration be abandoned on account of terrible happening insect be emptied into killing bottle when dead transfixed with pin set one morning archie examining setting board to see if be stiff ready to be transferred into cork lined box found to horror so far from being stiff two butterfly tortoiseshell brimstone be alive still with waving antenna twitching body dreadful incident poisoned joy of collection felt guiltier of worse outrage than cyrus blessington well meant consolation insect hardly felt anything at must not induce to run risk of committing further atrocity for day night two have writhed under crucifixion day caterpillar be released from breeding cage even including that piece of preciousness caterpillar of convolvulus hawk with horn on tail killing bottle be relegated to attic sunday church going for intermission have be ordained in consequence of archie infant remark about amusingness of man with wagging beard have long ago be resumed again year have sudden attack of spurious sentimental religion caused mother little anxiety developed dreadful conscience came to with serious face confessed trivial wrong doings phase comforted to think occurred in autumn of year at time when there be nothing much to be done in way of collecting one morning archie came to with crime sorely oppressed nearly two year ago somebody have sent painted easter egg ostrich egg adorned with gilt design of cross crown ray archie have be forbidden to touch touched said wetted finger rubbed on crown of came off well dear of course must have done if have told not to said bother about more what made come tell so long after archie grew more solemn still be leaning out of nursery window said heard charles singing ' few more year will roll ' so came told before 'be asleep within tomb mother laughed quite a if be amused will hope there will be more than few year before darling said will be forgiven now have told asked archie yes of course think anything more about archie must have preferred more sentimental treatment of offence rather wished mother bore stronger resemblance to mr montgomery in wide wide world whose edifying tear fell so fast frequently after tended to keep misdeed more to repent of in secret simultaneously also copy of wide wide world have discovered in passage book case mysteriously vanished one appeared to have slightest idea where have gone so unable to stuff further with brand of mawkishness desire that mother must be more like mr montgomery faded somewhat there seemed little pleasure in repentance at if confession be received in so unsentimental manner be fun really keeping to oneself for week sunday morning service in church have expressed wish to go to evening church a well mother have told once be a much a be good for became emotional centre of life though religion be strangely mixed up with far more mundane attraction there be particular choir boy there with blue eye pink cheek crop of yellow curl who sang solo thrilled archie with secret perfectly sexless emotion only last sunday have sung oh for wing of dove religion childish adoration together have brought archie to verge of tear longed to be good to live until few more year must roll for felt that be going to die young noble beautiful life longed also to fly away be at rest with choir boy made up pathetic scene in must be lying on death bed with weeping family round choir boy must sing to a died must smile at other when vision proved almost too painful for contemplation must console by picturing alternative scheme in there be to be death bed at instead must get into church choir sit next choir boy must sing duet together before rapt congregation adorable though idol be did not really want to know even find out who be idol existed for in remote sphere becoming incarnate just for hour on sunday morning golden haired surpliced voice suggested vanished thrill of wide wide world pronounced certain word rather oddly have slight lisp archie tried to copy until one day father told never to say yeth again must write out yes hundred time then came most exciting discovery vocal angel proved to be son of head keeper be therefore perfectly easy to make acquaintance notion of meeting face to face of exchanging good morning with be almost overpowering yet archie instinctively shrank from bringing idol into contact with actual life began to choose for walk rather dank gloomy path led past keeper cottage yet when abode where idol lived came within sight archie with beating heart must avert eye for fear must see then one day a got opposite gate small boy in corduroy knickerbockers with rather greasy scarf round neck snuffling nose came out touched cap there must be doubt about identity archie suffered first real disillusionment of life fading of abracadabra be nothing to have be gradual disillusionment whereas be sudden a lightning stroke be shattered idol from moment archie must hardly recall what have be about recapture faintest sense of emotion have filled before encounter in wood caused to reel totter fall prone from unsubstantial pedestal blow on top of robust reception of confession did much to restore archie to way of normal boyhood be really rather relief to mother when expanding experimenting nature took very different turn became for time obstreperously naughty thought quite rightly that evinced greater vigour that undoubtedly did imagination contained in of archie exploit rivalled more visionary power that constructed death bed scene for idealization cruelly shattered of choir boy one very dreary november afternoon shortly after seventh birthday be sitting alone in mother room day sullen heaven have poured oblique deluge on earth sheet of water be being flung against window by cold south easterly gale archie be suffering from slight cold have not be out of door for couple of day unusual detention in house have caused to be very cross also have dammed up within store of energy must not disperse innocuously in violent movement jeannie have gone for motor drive with mother marjorie miss bampton be closely engaged over rotten german archie that morning have be stingingly rebuked by father for sliding down banister in hall mode of progress strictly forbidden blessington have not be le stinging for hour ago archie have be extremely rude to with dignity that respected resented have said then have nothing more to say to master archie till have remembered manner again have thereupon continued sewing archie knew have be rude sense of be not yet strong enough to enable to apologize though of sufficient energy to make feel woebegone neglected have be allowed by mother to sit in room that afternoon when went out with jeannie to investigate what be known a work box contained treasure in earlier day have be source of deep delight there be minute china elephant with silk palanquin on back there be porcupine quill there be set of doll tea thing pink umbrella ferrule of be pencil chain of amber once have held magic for archie be treasure must only be seen on wet afternoon in hour of toothache to day appeared to perfectly rubbishy not gleam of glamour remained be a dull a leaden sky of interminable afternoon archie lay in window seat wondered that sailor trouser only year ago have given so complete sense of happiness rubbed one leg against other trying to recollect how be that rough serge against bare calf felt so manly tried to interest in alice in wonderland marvelled that must have cared about adventure with pack of card longed to throw book at foolish dresden shepherdess stood on mantelpiece supposed there must be trouble if did that mother must be vexed trouble be better than nothing at probably must rain again to morrow must have day indoors thought of nothing happening to day to morrow seemed same a thought of nothing happening for ever ever there be bright fire in hearth beyond steel fender thick hearthrug of long white sheep wool suddenly archie remembered odour diffused when one day fragment of hot coal flew out of fire lodged in same hearthrug there be fatty burning smell most curious simultaneously wild irresistible desire of doing something positively wicked enthralled instantly knew what be going to do with set determined face took fire shovel in one hand tongs in other heaped shovel high with burning coal emptied on hearthrug smoke of singeing burning wool arose took several more lump of glowing coal from fire place deposited on rug then panic seized tried to stamp conflagration out only stamped glowing coal more firmly in though amazed at audacity did not really want to extinguish wanted something to happen quite deliberately though with cheek burning with excitement walked out of room leaving door open simultaneously heard crunch of gravel under wheel of mother returning motor did not wish to see went straight to night nursery now exclusive bedroom locked in be not in least sorry for what have done if anything wished have put more coal there be frightened at thought of possible consequence merely did not care what happened so long a something happened that reflected be pretty certain to do made plan before very long heard one turning handle of door kept quite still then father voice said be there archie still said nothing voice grew louder handle rattled archie open door immediately said father not in least knowing why archie proceeded to do so still felt absolutely defiant desperate for instinctive reason obeyed enormous terrible father stood before did put coal on mother hearthrug asked lord davidstow said archie then how did know be there asked father archie have something of joy of desperate adventurer because put there said then have lied to a well yes said archie lord davidstow pointed to door go downstairs at once said wait in study archie obeyed still not knowing why at top of stair be standing mother who took step forward towards archie darling began leave boy to said father who be following archie marched downstairs still without tremor occurred to that father be going to kill a cyrus killed thrush there be whispered conversation between mother father heard mother say felt sure that referred to being killed be quite certain that happened be not going to say be sorry went into father study shut door on table noticed that there be standing one of miss schwarz medicine bottle syphon beside wondered whether miss

will have more allowance for three week now go straight upstairs go to bed till come to tell that may get up blessington tell have be rude to go beg pardon first effect of episode on archie mind be that mother understood father did prospect of whipping have not made falter in resolve not to say be sorry so long a be sorry moment mother have put misdeed in sensible light saw sensibly must not have minded being whipped if by drastic method must have borne witness to reality of sorrow only three day later received six smart cut with horrible cane for climbing on to unparapetted roof of house out of bedroom window have be expressly forbidden to do then there be question of being sorry not a matter of fact be not summary justice be executed for mere disobedience before doing same thing again added up pleasure of going on roof balanced against pain inflicted on tight seat of sailor trouser a bent over chair found wanting be during same month saw seven completed year that did very strange unintelligible thing though suffered rather than committed did be to say quite involuntarily did not know be doing till be done be manner of miss bampton have set one of delightful exercise in handwriting in copy book never brush teeth with housemaid broom have written in beautiful copper plate hand at top of page archie be sitting with tongue out copying remarkable maxim amusing with conjecture a to what other strange habit such people a be likely to brush teeth with housemaid broom might be supposed to have perhaps must lace boot with tongs write letter with poker have got about way down page when suddenly there came over sensation with be beginning to become familiar that feeling of extension expansion within that falling away of limitation of consciousness opened new interior world to pen paused then in wrist of right hand in finger still held pen felt curious imperative kind of twitching knew that wanted to write of own volition a be though be not copy that be concerned with under sensation of absolute compulsion took sheet of paper that lay at elbow let pen rest on watching with intensest curiosity what must do have idea what must happen felt that something have to be written for couple of minute perhaps pen traced random line on paper moving from left to right with much greater speed than be wont to go letter began to form with rapidity certainty unknown to careful halting calligraphy in firm upright character saw own name traced on paper followed by sentence then pen still apparently obedient to unknown impulse from finger gave great dash stopped altogether be what read archie do let talk to sometimes martin queer sensation have ceased altogether archie stared blankly at word that knew hand have written what meant have notion did know who be whole thing be quite unintelligible to impulse made write have written miss bampton have left room on errand when have set archie copy came back at moment expecting to find copy finished looked over shoulder to see how be getting on dear have got further than said thought must have finished by time saw other piece of paper half concealed by archie left hand why have be writing something else said be why have got on further let look please not said archie be private miss bampton remembered that week ago archie have be seized with strong desire for literary composition have composed very remarkable short story may be given in full chapter there be once merderer with yellow eye wife said to 'if merder will be hung be hung on tuesday next finis when archie have brought yarn to have laughed so uncontrollably that be hurt so in hope of finding such though archie have business to write story in lesson time said dear do show wo laugh archie hesitated felt shy about disclosing sentence have written on other hand miss bampton who appeared to know everything might help towards interpretation well be not story said be just wrote without knowing oh miss bampton what doe mean who be martin if be archie who hesitated before be miss bampton who hesitated now suddenly have clever thought dear have be thinking about martin built in sandpit last spring said remember how jeannie made up story about be true enough failed to satisfy archie also have notion that miss bampton have made call on ingenuity in offering explanation be there other martin asked none that ever knew archie said think be one of in sandpit now get on with copy will walk there before dinner incident passed into medley of impression be crowding so quickly into storehouse of archie consciousness did not lie there quite unconnected with others laid on same shelf so to speak a held memory of waking vision one night in remote day held also fact of knowing what miss bampton have thought of in guessing game be among secret thing of spoke to nobody one more impression for secret pondering though of different sort from have lately added to store be when whipping seemed imminent saw one of miss schwarz medicine bottle standing on father table chapter iv lady davidstow miss bampton be sitting together that night in lady davidstow bedroom have sent maid away saying that must not want again that night now held in hand sheet of paper covered with line of meaningless scribble with one intelligible sentence at end archie have written that day when must have be doing copy in other hand held letter written in ink be now rather faded be comparing two looked at for time in silence then turned to miss bampton yes be quite right cathie said what archie wrote might actually be in martin handwriting look for there be last letter ever wrote to miss bampton took two paper from there be absolutely difference said moment saw what archie have written thought of martin handwriting then be signed beartin be sure have never heard of not that must account for handwriting lady davidstow shook head think be impossible said jeannie assured have never spoken to about martin have blessington may have heard name probably have heard name mentioned remember mentioning in archie hearing other day did pay slightest attention ca possibly recollect even in vaguest way be five year now since martin died archie be then only just two for six month before martin be with at grives cathie bampton laid down two paper ca think why never told archie about said lady davidstow great grey eye grew dim ah dear if be be mother archie mother must know said if have seen eldest son die of consumption second son threatened with must understand how natural be not to tell archie yet of brother have never consciously seen jack agreed with too have long be prepared for archie asking question certainly must answer truthfully let knowledge come to quietly by degree may have done wrong know think did right must begin saying to archie 'you have brother died ' more must have come out that died of consumption that for fear of archie life so much in open air dear how will archie begin to know unless tell oh in many way there be martin picture for instance in room archie may ask who be when hears name mentioned will ask time who martin be indeed have often thought odd that have only other day jack be talking to about suggesting that be time that archie knew indeed rather urged to tell now of sudden find archie writing in martin handwriting signing with martin name will tell lord davidstow asked miss bampton certainly will not jack hate approach neighbourhood of anything might be called occult spiritualistic say a know if even hypnotism be mentioned did tell about archie intuition in guessing game a again know asked not to play more though at same time insisted that be mere guess on archie part cathie be silent moment scribble of archie asked do not make more difficult for to tell about martin now sensitive boy like might get into head that dead brother be writing to certainly want archie to think said mother will put off telling now if asks said miss bampton have idea that wo ask got up moved about room for moment in silence dear child have got secret life of own said oh how mother want to be admitted young thing have walled up place in heart to admits nobody if ask to be admitted not only be door shut locked have secret place make guess that bit of paper by way mind put back in school room where archie left life in archie secret place how long to get in darling can do be to wait outside take what give archie doe tell everything why must did tell what be that made put burning coal out of fire on to hearthrug probably did know something inside knew else must have done do be accountable for by what be inside impulse come from within be suggested by what be without said miss bampton yes be box on match be struck fire be in match can do for child even own child be to suggest hope will take suggestion miss bampton got up be late must go said want to ask one thing do believe in possibility of martin having made communication to archie yes think do be why affair have upset so idea be so strange new that be frightened about though why must be so ca tell with whole heart believe that darling be living somewhere in existence a individual a ever even more vivid because weakness illness weariness be past so why must be frightened at thought that must communicate with archie ah dear if only must communicate with with jack poor jack how must scout idea how shocked must be suppose be part of secret garden keep from jack held friend moment after kissing jack never really got over martin death said must bring into line with be then that became settled habit with to try to forget just lately have be very bad there good night dear ca talk about whole incident affected archie far le than affected mother governess next day when found scribbled paper lying where have left day before excited further curiosity in mind put thought of away on shelf of secret thing have nothing to do with ordinary normal life in certain mood after only lasted for moment two thing shelf contained became far more real to than other of experience for week month at time content remained out of reach if shared a mother have said with nobody else have share in except at odd queer moment so when next day came across curious sentence again caught by a by process of wireless telegraphy felt little interest in though sat for couple of minute with pen held idly in hand just to see if anything else happened there be sensation that ever so faintly resembled twitching yearning of hand to write knew not what crumpled paper up put into fire somewhere below threshold of conscious self lay perception be concerned with perception guessed what miss bampton have thought of somehow swam up to surface a used to lie in bed of morning sink into depth lay below green tinted ceiling of room while lay dormant be a if never existed now for week there have be no light whatever on ceiling morning after morning awoke with sense of exhilaration at in coming of day with drowsy depression lying thick upon a heard rustle of endless rain in shrub outside languidly went through exercise used to invigorate now only tired through month damp chilly weather persisted day after day same lowering heaven obscured sun never in bright sussex upland have there be so continuous succession of rain streaked hour wonder of seeing lake slowly rising till engulfed lower end of lawn made island of summer house failed to stir there be magic in unique experience of punting across lawn to then one morning early in december deluge be stayed once more sun slid up cloudless sky whole nature of world be changed archie have again be indoors for couple of day with return of cold really be responsible for burning of mother hearthrug once more ecstasy of living possessed a consolation for imprisonment jeannie be given holiday breakfast over scampered out once more saw shadow racing in front of game be to tread on somebody else shadow blessington shadow did not count because anybody must tread on required real agility to tread on jeannie for have nippiest way of dodging before foot must really descend on so ran in circle round blessington marco collie ran in circle round though counted two to tread on marco shadow must not hold marco then stamp on shadow one have got nearer than doubtful claim to have trod on tail quite suddenly archie stopped have odd warm sensation in mouth that required investigation two day ago jeannie nose have bled archie thought rather grand there have be rather fuss about be laid down on floor miss bampton put door key down back eventually ice be brought be quite important now be not nose be bleeding mouth oh say be bleeding in mouth said that be just a good a jeannie nose even while spoke felt rather giddy instantly blessington arm be round eh dear said that will never do lean against will go home very quietly must chase more shadders morning a matter of fact archie did not want to felt rather enjoyable lightness in head felt weak also disinclined to run oh here be again said once more now with sensation of choking coughed up blood saw blessington tender anxious face above exactly a have appeared in earliest of memory a then felt absolutely comfortable in thought that be there arm be close round neck now with other hand made sign to jeannie run straight back home dear said tell mamma to come out here at once bring william master archie be going to sit down quietly till come archie rather enjoyed be completely in blessington hand utterly content to be so then blessington did very odd thing well be so hot with seeing miss jeannie running about said that be going to sit down wait for bit will wait with dear wo there put head on knee lie down know be hot with running about a by conjuring trick archie knew that blessington cloak with collar of rabbit fur be tucked round be rather odd to be lying with head on blessington knee out of door in winter have desire to question propriety of for fitted in so well with main desire be to stop still couple of minute ago have be running about at top speed now have wish except to do a be told to put into responsible hand be rather dreamlike mother william be coming here soon that seemed quite natural be still rather grand to bleed at mouth then came gentle singing in ear pleasant sense of complete indolence never quite passed into unconsciousness presently be just a natural to find in william arm out of half opened eye saw william be in livery for blue white stripe of low waistcoat be close to cheek rested on william shirt front then saw that there be bright red stain there certainly be not part of william ordinary livery oh william have messed said be sorry be right master archie said william be new shirt morning dim reminiscence about something william have told concerning beer money washing came into head william have beer money washing must not remember will pay for anyhow said still feeling rather dizzy have impression of own room with blessington mother near apparently have be laid on floor for bed looked tall beside then be not on floor more in bed whether be at once later never knew presently there be in room stranger who once have made play pointless game of saying ninety nine here be again with plug against archie chest two other plug in own ear archie remembered quite distinctly be doctor who did give medicine will say 'ninety nine ' asked just think 'ninety nine ' talk if think 'ninety nine ' will do just a well archie have desire to do anything beyond what be told to do thought ninety nine stranger smiled very kindly at be capital said now just go on thinking 'ninety nine ' whether floated out of window vanished like cheshire cat walked away in ordinary manner archie be quite unaware then be hungry behold there be blessington with boiled rabbit be sleepy hungry again again sleepy sometimes mother be there sometimes father who looked rather odd sometimes william brought coal though housemaid usually did there be blessington again who washed face then uncovering limb by limb washed also archie must not understand why acquiesced in odd state of thing why did not ask to get up run about play shadow game again merely be quite content to lie still hoped that when jeannie came talked to must not suggest resumption of game have be so ecstatic have be interrupted so suddenly miss bampton came in read to something have be writing noticed that read from printed page not like page of ordinary book long strip appeared that be story have written have got printed asked whether story about merderer must ever get printed came in talked gently melted away again then arrived memorable morning when instead of being gently awakened by blessington awoke entirely of own accord felt strong cross cross certainly proved to be for when morning washing began hitherto have be pleasant luxurious performance found that blessington must hing right put soap into eye tickled foot scratched shoulder with disgusting flannel archie made firm complaint against of outrage of sort must usually lead to rebuke on blessington part indeed have not be nearly so rude on occasion when have be told to apologize to now merely beamed at disagreeable remark instead of scolding made most cryptic answer eh darling said thank god feel like blaming again what do mean blessington said archie angrily oh do take care of little toe have nearly pulled off once already well then will kiss said blessington did archie looked at why be cry asked wriggling foot away from did not want to be kissed cry be just laughing said blessington be true be laughing be cry also idea struck archie have not occurred to before be ill blessington asked be going to die at there be question of what blessington be doing laughing quite ceased gave great sob darling be not going to die said get out of silly head be not then broke down altogether hid face in towel with have be washing archie left foot saw shoulder shaking knew that for reason must not speak be cry be not cross with for being cross behoved man to administer consolation oh cry blessington said what be there to cry about unless be because be so cross mind crossness said let finish wiping foot then will go down tell mamma oh say be cross said archie be sorry be cross nay will just tell how much better feel morning must wonder if there be great treat coming something will like ever so much be train asked archie bless boy said how think about train archie ate breakfast passed entrancing morning everybody seemed desirous of congratulating a if have done something particularly meritorious a on occasion of not getting drowned when jumped out of boat after pike held sort of levee most remarkable incident of be appearance of miss bampton with piece of white chalk with drew on green drugget by bed so that must easily see great map of england central europe there be south of england with london written large here be lacebury also conspicuously marked then there be english channel with france below paris in middle away to right distance below lake of geneva then still explaining made mark like caterpillar be mountain said that now mountain be covered with snow even down to tail of caterpillar below be lake of geneva quite blue road be covered with snow up by caterpillar tail there be wheel on carriage slid over frozen snow instead there be skating up there for made lake be covered with ice just put water into flat place there be lake instantly froze never rained there if wanted to do anything just snowed usually did want to do anything there be sun snow must be jolly to go there presented to archie mind a purely abstract proposition of course must be jolly to go to place where saw real mountain have glimpse of real lake of geneva slid instead of walking what next did one ever go there apparently right at tail of caterpillar be place called grives there be written down railway only went a far a bex there sledge began always sun shone so that sat out of door with snow round felt perfectly warm suddenly archie must stand no longer be like talking to starving man about roast beef there be roast beef somewhere in world wanted so badly in same way something inside archie starved for sun snow thin air oh shut up miss bampton said want so frightfully mother be sitting on edge of bed watching map of europe archie be going to grives in few day said blessington jeannie be memorable moment when boat rose up then curtsied to big sea be jostling other up channel archie only knowledge of sea be culled from single visit to brighton two year ago sea to then appeared one among assembly of unusual bright object nigger minstrel tin bucket pier penny in slot machine on bright winter day hailed new glorious creature when saw steep white capped wave grey in bulk lit with lovely green where grew thin come streaming up to ship side fall away again in puff of white smoke squirt of high flung foam warmly wrapped up in new fur coat sat on deck sheltered from weather watched with ecstatic wonder rollicking untamed creature sent boat now over on one side now on other threw up caught again within firm liquid embrace behind lay wake of white foam like long string still tying to dazzling chalk cliff wave smothered pier overhead mast thrumming to wind struck right left across wide arc of sky shadow sped across deck swerving uplifting descent of ship a whacked way across shifting mountain produced in physical discomfort only sense that new glorious being have come into life too soon even a jig saw puzzle of map of europe have warned by narrowness of strait shore of france began to rear up above wave moulded horizon presently pier received men spoke strange tongue probably french though might have be hebrew made novel gesture wore blouse boot turned up at toe more than be usual in england there be platform have to climb sheer carriage side from ground level engine be altogether different movement of train be other than that be accustomed to then sure enough came after to great town drove across keeping firmly to wrong side of road though a everybody else did same there be not so many collision a might have be expected then came novelty of eating dinner in restaurant perched up in station from window of must romantically observe train after train sliding out into winter night before long archie train did same then came glorious experience of undressing in train while be going at full speed there be never so remarkable bedroom gold looking glass stamped leather instead of bed blessington being put on floor one archie begged to have be put above other close by in roof of carriage be electric light when turned small handle requisite distance dwindled to mere speck at timeless hour woke up found very polite stranger in bedroom to whom blessington explained that have spirit lace tobacco in luggage total stranger then apparently guessed that have be misinformed for went away again without word clever train found way without mistake through darkness of long winter night for next morning be skimming along by edge of lake so large that wonder appeared on jig saw map of europe lake at home once almost boundless sheet of water be more than wayside puddle to hill at home be more than tunnelled earth of mole compared with slope on row of pine looked smaller than edging of table cloth against blue blue archie thought have never known what blue be till now not what sunshine be until saw dazzle of on sparkling slope so mother told be not mountain at be only hill soon must see what mountain meant a passed through glittering town stood on edge of lake must see sleigh sliding over street with jingle of bell crisply sounding in alert air other smaller sleigh be drawn by pleased smiling dog there be never such morning of discovery only drawback be that though ought only to have be ten o'clock swiss chose that must be eleven thus hour of immortal day be lost mother told that french have taken care of must give back to when returned be romantic enough romance grew more deep hued yet when in early afternoon archie be packed into sleigh journey up through pine wood began white capped white cloaked stood red trunked tree now then with falling puff of snow laden branch free of burden sprang upwards again then pine be tired of climbing sleigh left came out on to plateau high above valley must have be sunshine down there for valley seemed choked with grey fog here above be real sunshine air that refreshed a with wine hill have appeared so gigantic have sunk below behind rose spear precipice remote blue of real mountain a went upwards soared ever above presently blue on be tinged with apricot rose in glow of declining sun driver cracked whip horse jingled bell in response pointing with to row of toy house still far above grinned at archie said grives rose of sunset have faded snow be turned to ivory crystal beneath full moon when entered long lit village street with old carved wooden house deep balconied towards south modern hotel now just opening again for winter season too left behind again mounting steep slope came to where round sudden corner stood big chalet archie mother have taken here be said archie sat staring somehow felt knew house perhaps be house have dreamed of there be pine to right left of just a there be in picture of house existed somewhere in mind have same broad balcony where must lie day in sun look over village roof below across valley from afternoon have climbed felt knew inside too there must be room with wooden wall china stove where have heard of china stove smell of pine wood haunting house be extraordinarily interesting big genial woman have turned up electric light outside door when heard crack of driver whip stood bareheaded ready to welcome archie felt that knew something about too ah miladi said to mother in very crisp good english yet with funny precision a if have learned a lesson give welcome back to grives how be dear madame blessington archie thought mother interrupted greeting rather suddenly how be madame seiler said here be daughter jeannie archie added something in undertone sounded like language miss schwarz used to talk madame seiler whisked round with renewed cordiality such lovely weather have come to said sun day frost night keep out frost let sun in passed into entrance hall aromatic warm heated by big china stove that roared pleasantly instantly without reason there came into archie mind remembrance of word hand have scribbled one morning with signature martin came out of darkness like light seen distantly at night flashed like signal vanished again for one second have be there remote visible luminous lady davidstow for obscure grown up reason thought good at supper night to explain incidentally that have written to madame seiler that blessington be coming be how have known blessington name archie have very strong wholesome confidence in mother knew that grown up people sometimes made statement have got by rule to be accepted always convince blessington saying that must not run more because have bone in leg be instance of class of statement a also be occasion when mother spoke year ago about abracadabra sneezing mode of accounting for madame seiler knowing blessington name came under same head a far a went might be true though did not particularly interest whether be true so to speak way felt that there be something mildly mysterious about having made unconvincing statement mother at once passed on to more interesting topic be blow when blessington called next morning to be told that be tired with journey must stop in bed for breakfast be perfectly unfounded statement like others have grumblingly to be accepted though archie knew quite well that have never felt le tired may feel dear said blessington be must think ought to know best said archie know best said blessington firmly mamma say so too archie began to wonder be not right did not feel tired a have told blessington something inside said that did not want to run about even skate be very well pleased that body well wrapped up must sit up in bed bask in sun blazed in through opened french window communicating with big balcony outside room then after breakfast there came in mother with big jovial man whose name be dr dobie never saw such lazy fellow exclaimed rather attractive person fancy not being up yet must let said archie well a soon a have have look at up will get said doctor ca wait till be dressed now undo coat minute once again instrument with plug be produced ninety nine game played be capital said doctor now in minute will have done with just put into mouth with end under tongue there like be very short process dr dobie got up now plan for be said will dress lie out in sun on balcony after have have dinner will go for sleigh drive walk little on way back then balcony again till be dark may skate asked archie who did really want to not just yet will have skating before long not at present more do a be told sooner will skate during next week so gradually that at moment be discovery dawned on archie that be ill that illness dated from time when mouth bled knowledge did not in least depress because with came absolute certainty in own mind that be going to get quite well again for most part did not feel ill though there be often uncomfortable period towards evening when felt sometimes hot sometimes cold one moment must want coat on soon must have liked to throw off clothes have odd feeling be accompanied by sort of extra vividness in perception felt tingling alert light seemed brighter than wont when have be more marked than usual in evening always felt very tired next day more than once did not get up at have bed pulled out on to balcony then a week passed on there be le of before long be allowed to tie toboggan to back of sleigh be towed up hill through pine wood climbed slope behind village be delightful experience on side stood snowy tree frosted like christmas cake now almost meeting above narrow track then standing away from again so that deluge of sun poured down a into pool while from in front came jingle of horse bell from below squeak of runner then came out again on to ski ing slope where visitor to grives played entrancing game of seeing apparently who must fall down most often in most complicated manner where slope be steepest there be erected sort of platform so that runner flying down slope above be shot into air touching ground again yard below on other morning when thing went well there have be no hot cold period evening before tobogganed down slope below house to edge of skating rink sat there in snow with everything round frozen hard yet feeling perfectly warm so potent be beam of ineffable sun through thin dry air jeannie be learning to skate progressed in wobbling half circle shrilly announced that other be outside edge four of expert in railed off hallowed place at end of huge rink must put down orange proceed to weave mystic dance in obedience to shouted order of one of at one moment four must be swiftly converging on back edge to orange just at moment when complicated collision seemed imminent must somehow change direction lo four be sailing outwards forward again in big sweeping curve then there be hoarse angry cry of curler to listen to pleasant sight of stone sliding swiftly down ice butting with hollow chunk into other stood in way then slow sliding stone must come down people swept violently in front of to encourage not to lie down die for most part did always too soon mother blessington must come to tell that be time to go home again must tie toboggan to back of sleigh be pulled up hill to house be tiresome moment archie found wondering with pang of jealousy why when so many be hale hearty round must be just who be obliged to go lie down on roofed balcony instead of skating curling even when have set back have to lie day on balcony never faltered in belief that be going to get well here then in brief be outward aspect of archie life at grives new attractive full of sun dry powdery snow took active part in activity be observer time there be inward aspect of life one shared with one ever observed be always on alert even on morning of tiredness after have have rise of temperature evening before for development of certain thing existence of came to only in hint whisper thing be always there though have control over manifestation must no more bring into exterior life of sens must no more see hear produce evidence of a willed than must make sun pierce scatter cloud for whole week in january alternately rained snowed on to grives must do be to wait for waited in perpetual serene excitement came always when be alone got to think of solitude in present stage a essential for manifestation a week went on associated more more with balcony on lay for greater part of day thing waited for be completely silent about even when have intimate good night talk with mother be other than martin whoever martin might be whose presence have come into mind with such unexpected vividness when first saw chalet never be idea of martin absent from mind might lurk concealed behind excitement of trailing after sleigh of watching skater on ice at time be ready to enfilade among diversion of snow ice sun have inward eye turned towards inscrutable martin winged nester in sand cliff somebody somebody lesson in mild way have begun again before wretched rainy snowy week miss bampton sent out from home most entrancing topical copy hot outside edge for lunch be one in allusion to news of jeannie skating cold inside edge for dinner be whatever weather be archie be out of door day jeannie during lesson time used to sit out on balcony do more advanced task with be taken in to lady davidstow for correction more often mother used to sit on balcony too during damp abominable week suffered from heavy cold lesson be brought to by jeannie on particular morning jeannie have finished french translation first so went in to mother to have corrected leaving archie to finish last three line of copy ever since first entry into house there have be for nothing more than perception of martin presence with patience of child who want something thing only equalled by patience of cat watching mouse hole have never taken inward eye off be always ready for a jeannie went in with completed french lesson laid down pen looked for moment at streaming icicle on eaves of shelter listened with sense of depression to drip of melted water formed grey pit in whiteness of snow below because there be thaw air felt colder than when there be twenty degree of frost blanket on couch be studded with condensed moisture be warmer thought archie to so ought to be warmer be colder at moment felt sudden thrill in right wrist thought that melted drop have fallen on saw there be drop there wondered at sensation of touch then saw finger begin to twitch instantly recognized sensation have felt once before swept incomplete copy off pad of blotting paper took pen up again surely must write on blotting paper at first meaningless scribble appeared made more grotesque senseless by running of ink there be pencil on table by took that up instead of pen while hand twitched jerked to be at task again day before have pinched finger in hinge of slamming window saw moon shaped blot of blood below nail quivering a finger starved to hold instrument of writing again then hand settled down like hovering bird on to bough a picked up pencil for little while scribble went on then watching mark on blotting paper just a excited spectator watch action of play saw word coming brain did not know what be till appeared on paper archie archie said pencil want to talk to ca always sometimes can dear archie try to be ready when get through lovely to talk to ca to mother incontrollable excitement seized boy oh who be said aloud be martin felt twitching die away in finger presently be left sitting there copy on floor scrawl on blotting paper have somewhere inside sense of extraordinary satisfaction something somebody have got through meant word in pencil on blotting paper have got through turned over hastily picked up unfinished copy a door handle into room rattled jeannie came out on to balcony again with corrected french exercise several day of chilly dripping weather with foehn wind from south went by when ceased wind veered to north blowing high over grives raising feather of snowdust on peak to north while sheltered valley basked in calm sunlight again there be eventful day of carting snow from rink before further development took place in archie secret life carting of snow be splendid fun for when hand sleigh of be piled high archie must squat on front of thereby adding considerably to weight in shrill voice direct men who pushed to right left in order to reach steep bank down discharged burden when be come to edge of large strong man lifted archie off perch waited with while sleigh be pushed to very brink burden overturned in jolly lumpy avalanche poured down built up bank of rink then archie mounted throne again be pulled back to where men with spade loaded up again when sleigh seemed to be sufficiently full called out stop made return journey to side of rink be tremendously grand have idea that clearing of rink must never have taken place without certainly sleigh worked much faster than other for in honour who pushed always ran to discharge burden at top speed instead of going slowly like others oh be pace must say a somebody lifted off look mummy be going to turn over rink then be clear again thanks to archie great exertion before secret life made step forward one afternoon when have be watching skating from balcony something further occurred be alone for mother have gone down with jeannie to rink blessington have gone shopping there be bell by by mean of must summon madame seiler if wanted anything have thought of summoning madame seiler be extremely content to lie in sun watch rink sometimes sometimes to read fascinating book called rose ring mother have given there be absurd picture of prince bulbo enormously fat young gentleman whom archie did not wish to resemble be rather afraid of resembling since dr dobie at last visit have told be getting fat be very peaceful happy have lost interest in jeannie fall even in prince bulbo execution be staring placidly at very bright spot of glistening snow caught sun at edge of rink when line of shadow began to pas over field of vision exactly a used to pas over green lit ceiling of night nursery at home be interesting did not feel in least sleepy very wide awake be conscious of sinking down through lovely luminous air with bright spot of light getting moment higher above when suddenly heard name called archie archie said voice be close to wonderfully friendly at same moment felt on back of hand touch of hand be young somehow familiar though have never felt before tried not to disturb impression there be sort of spell on light a gossamer web slightest movement physical mental on part might break yes be archie said moment spoke knew that have spoken somehow in wrong way part of not lip voluntary movement must have answered ought to have thought answer with part of saw line of shadow passing across bright steel surface of rink below felt sinking down down beneath bright spot opposite must not have explained knew be so instantly there be back on balcony again with rose ring in hand jeannie on rink madame seiler clattering dish in kitchen alone lying in sunshine knew that something inside have be tremendously happy when name be called hand touched in intimate manner now that touch voice be gone felt something akin to what felt when be feverish blessington have said good night left then always knew that blessington have only gone into next room must be summoned must not summon who have called archie to have not least doubt that be martin who have called that be martin hand have be laid on who be dear person called martin where be martin secure in knowledge that be martin who have come to touched called to put down book shut eye so that feeling of being alone must be intensified martin whispered oh martin lay there tense excited sure that martin must come again then in dim child like manner not formulating anything to only feeling way knew have called wrong must call differently if hoped to have reply call from inside more earnestly attempted to call from inside further got away from inside mood knew must not recapture oh what rot said at length picked up rose ring again to ascertain whether bulbo be really going to be executed on second occasion when piled table on bed chair on table hat box on chair peeped out of window from horrid cell to see whether be eight o'clock yet day in return of frost sunshine archie felt stronger soon desire to skate took firm hold of oddly enough pleasant dr dobie began to agree with within day two of time when archie desire to skate became pressing need dr dobie sanctioned archie have humiliating hour two have seen jeannie lean outwards announce outside edge have seen jeannie lean little inwards proclaim inside edge round went in curve that archie must not envy have only got to lean outwards inwards like surely be master of curve found that curve be master of tumbled down instead must have done so if kind swiss on skate have not always be on hand to prevent disaster of kind then jeannie have learned so seemed to archie by falling down resented hand saved from falling do let fall down said ca learn unless down better not fall down sir said amiable young man hold learn best so jeannie did said archie be girl whispered swiss oh ought girl to fall down not boy asked archie rather interested in new difference between sex archie be allowed by end of january to skate for hour before lunch with swiss hovering over like friendly eagle to have lunch with jeannie seated side by side on toboggan at edge of rink skate for hour again afterwards at end of time second eagle appeared in person of blessington mother carried off to sleigh right on through half february lasted golden frosty weather then came great snowfall with frost broke snow degenerated into rain wind veered again into slack south roof dripped tree tossed white burden from a snow melted wonderful thing happened in earth at summons of sun of spring for gentian pushed lengthening stem up through thinning crust put forth star like flower deep a blue of night brilliant a blue of day call of spring though yet snow wreath lingered pierced through listening grass bulb pricked up little green ear above soil wonderful a last spring have be first that archie have ever consciously noticed alpine primavera be twice a magical for winter be caught in very arm warmed to life again morning by morning pine wood steamed like hot flank of horse when mist cleared nature great colour box have be busy again with fresh green more vivid red on tree trunk weak pale snowdrop mountain crocus shone like silver gold in sheltered hollow more tender blue took place of crystallized sky of winter for barren brilliant light of january sun be exchanged fruitful caressing luminousness flooded world instead of merely looking down upon soon from lower slope snow be quite vanished instead of tinkle of sleigh bell there came from pasture deeper note from bell of feeding cattle winter long have be penned up in chalet eating dry cake of last year harvest of grass archie have be lying in balcony one morning writing account of thing to miss bampton mother have gone back to england to take jeannie home must be back at end of week in absence of instructor archie task be to write long letter daily to somebody at home enjoyed doing for search for word in to express have begun to interest have just written if listen very hard can almost hear grass flower fizzing be sap be like fizzing anyhow be what mean a paused at end of third page felt something in hand also reminded of fizzing there be that queer thrill twitching in finger recognized at once word not searched for by coming from other source began to trace on blank fourth page to day there be preliminary scrawl firm upright handwriting be coherent from first archie have got through again wrote be fun if want test test thought archie what be that will find circle cut on bark of pine opposite front door dig in earth just below there be box thing in hid wave of conscious excitement came over boy instantly hand stopped writing oh bother be stopped said to wish have interrupted have interrupted since must not get back into particular quiescence have begun to see always accompanied manifestation must at least do what writing suggested slipping off couch tip toed downstairs in order not to let blessington hear exit there be two pine tree of might have be described a opposite front door searched in vain round first of for sign of circle cut on bark then coming to other at once saw with sudden beating of heart rough circle cut in bark just opposite eye grey ring of lichen have grown into making so conspicuous that wondered have never noticed before next moment be down on knee grubbing up loose earth directly below with eager absolute certainty of success earth came away very easily hole be not yet foot deep when saw something white shining at bottom of presently drew out small round tin box like stood on table in father study held tobacco hastily filled earth into excavation again undetected tip toed back to balcony for while lid resisted effort to open soon got loose looked inside on top lay folded piece of paper below there be stick of chocolate in lead paper pencil match box photograph of boy about nine year old whom archie instantly knew to be like then opened piece of folded paper saw word written on in hand knew quite well be martin morris be inscription belongs to alone not anybody else at ever archie read looked at photograph again flood of light poured in on mind be wonder that have felt that martin be friendly affectionate that martin wanted to talk to that martin told of cache have made for to whom must tell to brother yes martin be here for martin have written to have called then in moment more light flashed on certainly martin be alive be not alive in sense that mother be alive blessington in sense martin be dead there be nothing in least shocking terrifying in discovery burst upon a sense of spring have done be just natural thing wonderfully beautiful to find out for certain a felt have found out that there be close to always perhaps certainly at time presence of brother whom have never seen who in way not more inexplicable than appearance of blue gentian pricking up through snow must occasionally speak to calling by name using hand to write with few day afterwards lady davidstow arrived back from england on first evening of return after dusk have fallen archie be sitting on floor against knee in front of one open fire place in house where pine log fizzed smouldered burst into flame glowed into core of heat sometimes for pleasant hour before bed time read to to night there have be no reading for have be telling of week have passed at home have moved up to london while be there london be miry foggy cold altogether disgusting dear said want to go there do not atom said archie firmly like place better than have ever be in be so glad archie be afraid must dislike after frost went archie be staring dreamily at fire suddenly knew that martin be here looked quickly round wondering if by new lovely miracle must see boy whose face be now familiar to from photograph there be nothing visible only firelight leaped on wooden wall what be archie asked mother suddenly archie felt that must preserve secret no longer a on day in church when wanted mother to share with pleasure of glorious comedian man with wagging beard so now wanted to share with secret joy of martin presence mummy want to tell about martin said know whom mean martin brother archie who have be telling about martin asked archie laughed why martin of course be too lovely once called out loud writes for be written for three time once at home twice here knew be particularly here moment got here last time told about what have hidden under pine tree found want to see hid away in paper in portmanteau oh what be test said be test test test be proof archie laughed again that make sense said now will show test kept together with what wrote to about first came back in moment with precious possession look be what wrote on paper of letter to miss bampton said said there be circle cut on pine tree found dug a told found look be lovely be martin photograph be be impossible to question validity of evidence indeed lady davidstow have desire to do so for believed implicitly in fact of life everlasting without whole creation of god with pain agony yearning love becomes cruellest of sorry jest concocted by omnipotent power of mind infinitely brutal cynical who torture puppet have created with unutterable anguish ravishes soul with joy a meaningless a dream well remembered martin cutting circle on pine tree what significance be have never told now five year after death have told must not doubt to brother who have normal remembrance of there be little pathetic token of childish secrecy pencil piece of chocolate photograph above well formed upright handwriting identical with of message traced on last page of archie unsent letter how happened what be strange mechanism fashioned by material mean mysterious communication between living dead have idea of having happened have doubt turned relic over kissed handwriting so long buried tear of tender amazement rose in eye oh archie darling said lucky boy be said archie doe martin never write to dear suppose can not why be so particularly here demanded archie paused moment died here said in house asked room blessington archie gave great sigh oh mummy do let have room instead of mine said book ii chapter v archie be precariously perched on side of little una rigged red sailed boat looking with dancing blue eye at rocky coast smothered in billow sunlit spray quarter of mile ahead wondering if must be able to make harbour of silorno on tack wondered also what be best thing to do if must not there seemed to be two alternative one to beat out to sea again come in on tack other to run before wind to head of bay away to right where knew there be sandy beach tumble out a best might be afraid see beloved amphitrite being pounded to bit by roller for with optimism must not picture hauling up out of harm way even seemed preferable to other alternative for to beat out again in such sea seemed really challenge to element to swamp in case be like to lose amphitrite own life a well wind be blowing with violence of summer italian gale straight down bay from open sea high wall of rock against breaker smashed must smash anything else that rode be in front of then came narrow opening into silorno harbour for be making after rock on top of ran road to santa margharita continued right up to head of bay have be rough when started to sail there in order to get cigarette now be stowed away in coat have wrapped round placed where must receive a small share a possible of spray that from time to time fell in solid sheet into boat seemed almost most important thing of to keep cigarette dry for must be too futile to have taken trouble so greatly have ventured amphitrite if at end cigarette must prove to be mash of tobacco salt water for be only in cardboard box next in importance came need of demonstrating to mother harry helena jessie that have be perfectly wise prudent in sailing across to santa margharita in spite of land lubber fear in freshening gale lumpy sea in order to get egyptian cigarette instead of despised italian brand made doubt that whole party of be at moment watching through glass from terraced garden of castello sat perched at top of steep olive clothed hill in front of spared second to wave hand in direction in case be there did in rather hurried manner for wanted that hand to be ready to loosen sheet in case more wind be on way to other hand must retain hold on tiller archie be clad in jersey stained whitened with salt water rest of attire consisted of grey flannel trouser coat be defending to last dry stitch trophy of cigarette shoe have put under coat for be just a well to keep dry while if by chance have to swim must be of use to dry wet sleeve of jersey rolled up nearly to shoulder disclosed slim strong arm incredibly browned with month of sea bathing sockless foot be of same fine tan of constant exposure hair thick dripping from spray have for present lost tawny curliness have to throw back head from time to time in order to keep out of eye in mind there be same wildness of out of door rapture that characterized youth of supple body must have laughed with pleasure at mere fact of doubtful battle between wind maddened sea time in secret chamber of brain there sat so to speak steadfast keen observer who be making note with might pushing down into cool cave of memory to be brought forth in case archie came safely to land from cold storage fitted with word must reproduce exultation of wind sun sea in chamber more secret yet chamber not in brain in heart sat knowledge among others second cousin helena vautier in particular be surely looking at from terraced garden high above cliff must see for matter so must sister jessie how to handle boat have be strong in dissuasion of starting at that if archie be quite honest with be one of principal reason why have insisted on doing so have mentioned casually other day that there be nothing in world liked better than careless go to deuce attitude towards danger to represented manliness archie have be only too delighted to give vigorous exhibition of tremendously pleased that on announcement of intention to go across bay must have so strenuously dissuaded to mind conveyed impression that liked a much a liked exhibition of manliness be already opposite opening into harbour still several hundred yard distant for time attention of observer who day be going to put experience into word of other observer who knew that helena be watching be diverted to job that engaged more superficial self that part of intent eager though be on hazard lay before sang shouted with glee at fact that be alone out here on sea for very sane healthy personage archie morris might almost be described a aqua maniac so intense be passion for gladdest most glorious creature of god did not want to be sailor for sailor inhabited impregnable fort though surrounded by sea be still impenetrably removed from defied by mean of colossal cylinder pounding piston steel side best of be to be swimming in sea not far removed from be to coax wheedle sea through medium of big sail tiny boat being alone with sea a with lover be necessary to full realization of passion river be fair substitute for sea lake there have to be quantity of water loved to dive open eye under water so a to see sun shining through be very early passion dating from time when have stepped out of boat in anxiety about pike be on end of line then for moment other consideration be subordinated to keen physical activity wind be sweeping across mouth of harbour have to put about at once to avoid being taken onto rock at northern end risking being swamped put helm even harder port tighten sheet with habit of swift decision determined to go for throwing leg across tiller pulled on sheet with hand spray from wave broke on rock fell solid drenched next moment with yard two to spare skimmed by into broadening harbour there promontory on castello stood came between wind sail flapped idly in dead calm picked up scull to row amphitrite to anchorage before took up laughed aloud gosh what sport said anchorage of amphitrite lay in bay not far from entrance to harbour screened by steep climbing olive grove belonging to castello of silorno archie mother have taken for month of may june silorno that incredibly picturesque huddle of pink yellow wall of campanile lacemakers who with bright coloured kerchief over comely head plied wooden bobbin day in shade of narrow street rose roof over roof at head of harbour big cobbled piazza sloped down to quay wall where sailor chatted dozed in shadow day putting to sea for night fishing by light of flare about time of sunset village be impenetrable to wheeled traffic for road along bay came to end at outskirt thereafter became narrow cobbled track built in step where steepness of street demanded round town rose amphitheatre of hill broken only by low saddle where final promontory on castello stood swam out seaward in three wooded hump of hill sitting here must observe on day like breaker crashing on reef to right where sea rolled in from open mediterranean while land locked harbour into archie have just brought boat lay a mirror at foot towards left straight in front ran ascending path passed below castello to head of promontory where enlightened italian enterprise be building execrable totally useless lighthouse to supplant little madonna chapel have stood there for century archie took down sail anchored amphitrite punted across in small boat to landing stage at foot of hill on castello stood here tree stood untroubled by gale poured high over from south though on other side of harbour wind roared in olive turned green to grey of underleaf great surge beat burst on rock have narrowly avoided here that tumultuous stir be unfelt resinous smell of pine clean odour of eucalyptus tree hung in warm sheltered air out of denser shade passed into belt of olive grew higher on slope mixed with angled contorted fig tree where fruit be already beginning to swell ripen above rose great grey bastion of retaining fortress wall tufted with stone crop valerian be rooted in crevice above again be spread umbrella of stone pine that grew at corner of garden path followed wound round base of wall passed below easterly side where came into blast of warm south wind again that swept along face of castello made cypress bend buckle like fishing rod feel jerk pull of hooked giant of water hillside here plunged very precipitously downwards to bay three hundred foot below wrinkled with wave feathered with foam lover of sea though be felt content to observe tumult of windy water not sail be visible right across to farther shore of gulf to night there must be illumination of fishing boat that in calm weather rode out there twinkling populous a town stood looking at sea moment before turned into narrow stone passage led to gate of house a man may look with love on horse that unruly obstreperous have yet carried so gallantly girl came up cobbled way from town just a turned in have on very simple linen dress that wind blew close to body flapping linen sunbonnet tied below chin to prevent wind capturing be tall slight moved easily a with boyish carelessness very pleasant face also boyish quite plain peered from under flapping bonnet hand be noticeable be large extremely well shaped finger showed perception efficiency may be remarked that archie have never noticed hand at hullo jess said be just back lord have have ripping afternoon cigarette be quite dry where have be just down into silorno cousin marion wanted telegram sent about sleeping berth to morrow archie frowned have noticed that jessie be often sent on errand people who can absolutely be relied on usually be must have thought mother might have sent pasqualino observed girl laughed oh wanted to said must go instead see cousin marion helena be getting in what might be called rather state about tried to infect with own calm must catch so thought little walk must be pleasant oh be helena frightened asked archie rather greedily yes so be cousin marion be then be beastly unsympathetic have awful shave getting into harbour remarked archie knew what be about did did helena so preferred to have confidence in go for walk rather than observe in what looked remarkably like danger archie have walked up from landing stage with shoe coat under arm coat be too wet to put on so dusted foot with resumed shoe oh ripping afternoon said again sound of clanging gate into castello be heard out in garden a walked up dim stone flagged passage led out into girl came running in like sister be tall slight there resemblance altogether ended delicate small featured face entirely feminine gleamed below yellow hair eye set rather wide apart giving adorably childish look opened very widely below dark eyelash beside jessie looked somewhat like well bred plough boy oh archie cried how horribly rash of mother have have terrible half hour bring cigarette to soothe disordered nerve said archie sententiously be happy to say that be dry though be not jessie have walked on with pleasant expression on face might might not be smile two be left alone for moment a if cared about cigarette said did morning be really anxious be indeed be be naughty to sail back in gale do be good now change clothes at once will bring fresh tea into garden cousin marion have have tea drank cup after cup to fortify ourselves looked over wall at boat between sip then trembled have sip before got past horrid rock have drained teapot broken chair with trembling strict veracity of entertaining summary did not of course concern archie be sufficient that have helena light picturesque touch made tableau caused to smile to a changed shirt be now stiffening with salt put on pair of sock over tanned foot did hurriedly for be last evening so told that must all be together by really meant that be last evening on helena must be here since to morrow at break of dawn mother must start for england leaving jessie harry travers to follow after fortnight when week before scheme have be suggested seemed to archie most admirable of plan since though mother helena must be gone must secure fortnight of intercourse with beloved sea instead of inhabiting that smoky cave known a london since then helena have begun to dawn on though a yet must be exaggeration to say that be in love with be dawning light illuminated sky above horizon if plan be to be suggested again to in present attitude of attracted expectancy be probable that must have voted for london helena rather than extension of day at castello scheme have originally be helena like plan have be exceedingly well thought out before be produced in guise of impulse prompted by kindliness thought for others be when edited a impulse of simplest most considerate sort hot weather did not really suit cousin marion so why must not cousin marion go back to england with helena a travelling companion of course silorno be most delicious place must be ever so sorry to go certainly cousin marion felt heat though be far too unselfish to suggest breaking up party must be glad to go northward earlier than end of june when two month tenancy expired helena have produced plan to archie one morning a sat after breakfast under stone pine mother must not in least mind going home alone if preferred to go before end of june said helena shook head oh know must say did mind said must stop on in spite of headache sooner than break up party have be having headache asked archie yes must know that told not to tell one said helena with complete self possession promise archie right helena felt quite safe now so must go back sooner than at end of june continued clearly be right person to go with for hate travelling alone oh will go then said archie be least necessary jessie must go with for certainly must hear of going jessie be enjoying so much that must bear that must have day here cut short so be for to go be awfully good of said only a yet half convinced be least be necessity though be so kind a to make virtue of then there be a well cousin marion must never consent to go if thought be for sake be going with so must go to say think that be whom heat doe suit will see if doe say at once that will go back with real reason for going will be secret just yours mine archie looked at for moment in silence silence be one of unspoken admiration somehow kindly thoughtful plan kindled appreciation of beauty beauty took on tenderer more touching look before now have vaguely occurred to that of two sister be jessie who most gave up own way to serve way of others secret of helena made feel that have done injustice want to give up time here if enjoy said ah make tell fib say that enjoy said will if press will say bore frightfully sooner than give up plan well think be wonderfully kind of said now be to tell mother that be feeling heat see what say be that yes just said helena archie have strolled indoors to put plan to test before returned quarter of hour later with mother helena have approved of own ingenuity very warmly have if scheme succeeded secured for additional fortnight of london season for jessie be for present going to make home with cousin be already satisfied that unselfishness have made considerable impression on archie be most important thing hitherto felt have failed to make mark so to speak be on excellent friendly term with just a be with jessie wanted at rate wished for something more than that be not that wanted to flirt with have much more serious end in view wanted here be perspicacity to dazzle eye by mean of touching heart for guessed with clear sighted vision that be kind of young man who if did not mean everything must mean nothing believed that must not entangle affection by mere superficial appeal indeed be not flirt be poor clever attractive proposed to use cleverness attraction in legitimate pursuit of securing husband who be not poor that archie be now lord davidstow at father death must be lord tintagel be in favour to make impression on then to go sacrificingly away seemed to very promising manoeuvre be not in least afraid of leaving jessie with for with habitual adroitness have conveyed to sister by little sigh glance word seemed to escape from lip unawares what design yet without making appear design on archie be have allowed feeling unconsciously to betray a when said darling must be lovely to be archie sister instead of only cousin that put quite plainly enough felt sure that jessie understood in addition to impregnable safeguard of jessie loyalty be satisfied that jessie friendliness with archie be of most unsentimental character indeed to speak of sense of security with regard to jessie must be labouring of point be so secure that security scarcely struck more than security of house consciously strike inhabitant week have passed between acceptance of plan last night of stay at silorno confirmed soundness of strategy archie frank friendliness towards have subtle change while relation with sister remained precisely on same calm tableland of comradeship below comradeship with like sun glowing faintly through mist without heat at present with penetration of light knew that there be growing emotional brightness be with light with nameless quickening that eye dwelt on now a sat in deep dusk of garden illumined only by star twinkled like minute golden orange in bough of stone pine knew that be looking at pale wraith of face be starlight left with in manner be not yet week old be so dark here in deep shade that saw nothing of sun tanned face beyond featureless oval when from time to time drew on cigarette leaped into distinctness there be emotion there at rate stuff from emotion be made there be need not yet wholly conscious of waiting like buried treasure to be released on side also something be astir behind calculated plan felt sorry until wisdom of project laid calming hand upon again that be being so unselfish a to accompany cousin marion back to town must have be extraordinarily pleasant to sit here many time more with archie watch take part in growth of situation of seed have be deliberately planted by be weak little spike a yet undeniably there be potentiality of growth in suddenly face leapt into light a struck match gain of fortnight london season seemed to insignificant success of plan wisdom of still endorsed be frigid triumph for felt to degree yet unknown to personal charm oh archie wish be going away said have be nice time wish suppose be selfish of want to know what be selfish of said do well a be last evening will wish thought must miss more moved just shade closer to oh will miss quite enough said laughed think will said will have bathing boating writing expect will have very jolly time seemed to think over yes will have thing said like why must like wo say that did remarked well will too will miss much more than must have missed if have gone away week ago too hesitated moment then very coolly replied thank very much there be calculation in have thought over polite chilly manner swiftly carefully have calculated rightly chucked away cigarette have only just lit helena have offended asked why do speak like again traversed second swift thought of course have offended said lightly will have to try harder than if want to offend dear do try again try to make feel hurt archie be little excited there be small intimate contest going on affected physically with secret delight just a be affected in limb by cross current to direction of swimming in brain by tussle for word wanted when be writing be sparring with something dear to try to hurt said softly very well said be glad be going away to morrow will do laughed again must do excellently well if meant said mean be very hard to please said not in least if want to please say that will be very glad to see again in few week certainly will sha say know quite well enough without assurance leaned forward little say same archie said say quite out loud archie threw back head shouted at stone pine will be very glad to see again in what be in few week cried ah be nice of be not sure that be nice because have brought jessie mr harry out into garden seemed to be case for undeniably two moved out into bright square of light cast from lit passage within archie got up swiftly suddenly with bubble of laughter oh let be like garden scene in faust whispered know when two couple wander about ah have seen do in well conducted opera be true enough for immediately helena name be called by sister gave little sigh yes darling said cousin marion think be time went to bed said jessie be archie there too want to see archie helena exchanged quick glance in darkness knew rather than saw helena at rate be quite certain of must go in then said fault for making shout helena recollected revue that archie have seen together woman pay said in histrionic falsetto without further word ran into house feeling very well satisfied with be sure that have made little enigmatical to have roused curiosity decidedly wanted to know more archie always slept in hammock slung between stone pine acacia in garden for though year have spent at grives with history of childhood closed seemed to have eradicated deadly seed be still recommended to pas a much of time a possible out of door fourteen year have elapsed since then have given six foot of robust height there seemed now little danger of hereditary foe again beleaguering have spent five year at eton now have just finished course at cambridge where have contrived to combine classic rowing in thoroughly satisfactory manner distinguishing in even a seemed to have outgrown physical weakness so too have outgrown to appearance strange abnormal experience have be in childhood power of automatic writing inexplicable communication from dead brother certainly since fourteenth year there have be no more of be a if have belonged entirely to year when trailed cloud of glory that hang about childhood even now in normal vigour of young manhood did not seem to to be in least unreal indeed be to in spite of fantastic unusual nature most substantial treasure in store house of memory difference be that now be sealed up key have be turned on in interior life be inaccessible to never for moment did doubt that be there out of reach might be still possessed though made effort to unlock door believed that key to be neither lost broken rusted maybe with unuse still existed within day felt sure impulse must come to either from without within to search for knew precisely where with prospect of finding must look for for still have power of letting lapse into trance condition in sank into depth of sunlit water in mysterious abyss knew must find key to sealed treasure be long since have penetrated there knew way to night a lay in hammock felt wish inclination to sleep lay with eye open looking into sombre dark of pine above head where star twinkled at edge of needle of foliage gale have raged that afternoon have blown out not breath of breeze sighed in pine of fierceness of uproarious hour there be nothing left ever diminishing thunder of wave three hundred foot below from horizon to zenith sky be bare kirtled with star to east over hill across bay dove colour precedes rising of moon be soaking through heaven faint odour from thicket of tobacco plant grew at foot of hammock be spreading through air ineffably fragrant dew brought with smell of damp fruitful earth archie lay quite still content to rest without sleep be sure that must go to sleep soon imperceptibly to waited quite tranquilly for soft tide to engulf letting memory hover now then over adventure of afternoon always bringing back to half hour have sat with helena close to where now lay have a sleep approached vague sense of sinking into quiet depth mind be too tranquilly disposed to do more than register impression then quite suddenly without transition state of drowsiness went fast asleep have noticed just before that moon have risen slept long dreamlessly then began to dream with extraordinary vividness dreamed that have not gone to sleep at still lay in hammock in shade of pine while garden outside be full of white blaze of moonlight ebony clear cut shadow thunder of surf have quite died away tobacco plant still gave out odour star little quenched by moon have faded in bough of pine then perceived with sense of strangeness that there be something new in garden for close to door into house be standing white marble statue brought leg over side of hammock got up to go look at then remembered so thought about be statue of helena have told be gift from to did not seem at unnatural that must have be brought out put in garden a have not seen yet walked now across to found admirable lovely figure be clad in long greek chiton low at throat reaching nearly to foot be sandalled one hand be advanced to with beckoning gesture other with exquisite arm bare to shoulder hung by side statue be life size for a stood on low marble plinth face be just on level with exquisite in fidelity beauty be that small head on slender neck endorsed message of beckoning hand lip uncurled in half smile mysteriously invited body too be little inclined forward towards next moment surely must step down from pedestal like galatea shake off semblance of stone declare standing there entranced strangely excited archie drank in amazing loveliness of figure white flawless without speck stain snow of parian quarry gleamed in moonlight then saw that just where neck flowed with strength tenderness of river into shoulder there be small dark spot taking step nearer put out hand to flick away did not come away be a if little excrescence have stuck to marble making second attempt felt that be soft that grew little longer moved too wriggled like head of worm then with faint feeling of disgust saw that be indeed head of worm protruding from marble just a worm come up through earth even a looked there came such speck near mouth also grew wriggled then came on arm be put forward to welcome archie stood there transfixed longer by admiration wonder by ever growing sense of horror everywhere from face hair hand from fold of lovely greek drapery there started out loathsome reptile nightmare of catalepsy invaded must not move must not call out must not turn away eye have to watch until where lately masterpiece of lovely limb have stood there be column a high a of wriggling corruption bred apparently from within then horror adding to horror portent of decay began to move slowly towards still must not move at last when be not more than foot two from found voice must scream for help must just hear shouting help came already must feel touch of horrible thing with supreme effort managed to move head away from myriad loathsome touch lo be seated upright in hammock moon be low in west over eastern hill be light preceded day face streamed with agony of nightmare sat still little while drinking in reassurance from miracle of tranquil dawn wondering at suddenness with have gone to sleep so that disquieting dream have seemed uninterrupted continuation of consciousness a fright faded there faded also memory of what dream have be there have be something about statue something about worm something connected with helena even a thought about continued to recede from before dozed off again whole thing have slipped out of memory when hour later got up to accompany traveller on early start a far a station there be nothing whatever left of knew only that have awoke in state of inexplicable terror arising from dream have vanished from memory like mist at dawn three left behind adjusted a friend can do to narrowed circle moved sensibly closer to other have task to sweeten enjoyment of leisure for to jessie fell martha care of house transacted by aid of italian dictionary with cook assunta to harry travers now junior don at cambridge preparation of course of history lecture next term to archie incessant practice in endless elusive art of writing prose love of expressing what loved in word be le than passion with be almost needle to add that sea be inspiring theme certainly have prime essential of devotion to subject to technique of art little essay called idyll of sea promised if ever must persuade to finish to be really exquisite piece of work be simplest sketch of fisher ship like to satisfy sea have to sound in line of even a sounded in ear of about whom wrote just now be trying to recapture have made ecstasy to of risky voyage homewards across bay few day before to fire word with thrill never quite despaired of communicating a rule day arranged very regularly early breakfast be succeeded by couple of hour of task couple more be spent in bathing affair of hurried undressing of chilly immersion huddling on of clothes of long baskings on shore mile long ploughing for archie at least out into bay along coast round beyond furthest promontory much though liked companionship of others be never sorry when first jessie then harry turned shorewards again for companionship of sea be closest to when be alone must burrow way through on sidestroke buried in foam of progress when exhausted breathless turn on to back to be cradled rocked by secure in enveloping presence even a in day of childhood must lie happy serene in knowledge that blessington be close by must dive deep see through fallen day dazzle of sun of surface far above then swim up again after greenness paleness below find red glowing firmament best of be to swim out very far from land then just exist with arm leg spread wide encompassed surrounded by mere sea did not want to think about anything at to belabour brain with striving to cast into word sea sense must come afterwards when with gnawed pencil erased sentence sat in garden only opened out to drank in through eye ear skin widespread limb even when physically most realized sea sense be symbol more vivid physical consciousness of sea became dimmer also became in light of what stood for for even a sea eternally incorruptible received into without stain that putrefying land with ordure sewer poured into so round human life with sore decay there lay immense eternal incorruption purified life a passed into turned into something pellucid immortal dying must be like dying be more than being poured into jubilant ocean becoming part of clean exuberant life archie have intention of dying just yet indeed metaphysical speculation only reached like sound of chime blown across water while far clearer be harry voice calling from beach archie be after twelve thereupon archie must turn on chest swim back to land with frill of foam encircling sunburnt throat wake of bubble following stroke of strong leg thereafter must cast onto beach with straw hat tipped over eye sun tanned leg arm spread star fish fashion lie there drinking in sun while harry jessie reviled for causing lunch for hungered to be again hour behind scheduled time archie lighting cigarette turned on elbow called greedy hog for thinking about lunch when be possible to lie in sun swim in sea then a likely a not must be aware of celestial appetite step into pair of flannel trouser sea stained shirt in turn revile tardiness in climbing olived terrace lay between castello lunched in garden in strip of shade outside house thereafter without pretence at about matter harry jessie went to room for honest italian siesta with excuse of lying on bed reading with avowed object of lying on bed sleeping two hour swimming basking communion with sea instead of making archie sleepy gave most productive hour of work wide eyed eager must sit with jotted note scribbling paper round read over last few page of current story correct erase rewrite with unquenchable optimism there must be moment of despair moment of wrestling with recalcitrant sentence when walked about in blaze of sun bit pencil till teeth cracked through into lead moment of triumph when impalpable sensation wished to record seemed to surrender to embrace of verb adjective up till tea time when others shuffled so termed out of house after slumber tasted glory travail of creation might be pang of fruitless labour knew at rate joy of ecstatic mental activity on one such day week after mother helena have gone back to england felt fit to burst with that have stored within ready for expression a drank coffee have employed in sharpening couple of pencil for work of transcription into ink came later in day so a not to interrupt by physical intrusion flow of knew be ready to be crystallized into word sometimes least distraction broke kind of thread when be in communication with sea may be added that one be ever le pompous about aspiration to day harry observed sharpening of pencil commented so masterpiece be signalled archie said archie blew lead dust from finger quite right old boy said lord be full of great thought do go to bed then will begin jessie joined in archie do let hold pencil for said like dora in david copperfield will feel a if be doing something archie laughed must be remarked must be making uncommon nuisance of be polite be not be rude be being rude on purpose want to be offended go away want harry to go away too want to lie on bed snore like hog be thinking of getting book reading out here said jessie feel be unsociable to leave alone when have finished being funny remarked archie may go to bed may get down at once say grace get down too master harry oh harry do remember how used to come to tea in nursery blessington made behave properly till tea be over then did behave improperly asked jessie think did really once went into shrubbery changed clothes at least put on yours must put on mine because be too small be what browning call 'time revenge must put on yours now must italian authority must prosecute for indecency lord what little fellow be harry time for little fellow to go to bed oh rag never said be strong yes jessie be strong too be like girl to pull hair ah do shut up archie have reasonable cause for complaint jessie have suddenly come behind taken great handful of touzled hair into grasp so archie head be held immovable while harry tickled rib can hing with arm if head be held quite still presently wicked ceased from troubling archie be left alone after jessie have gone to room stood still moment before making comfortable for nap then laid across nose mouth outspread hand have grasped archie hair in finger there remained faint odour of warm sea salt a by separate memory of own there remained in sense of closing over brown bright springy handful chapter vi archie thought no more either of tickled rib outraged hair when friend have definitely removed with sigh of delight took up sharpened pencil block of scribbling paper have grasped something thought morning must instantly be committed to word before even read over last page two for hand starved itched to be writing there be odd trembling in finger conscious brain be full of what wanted to say when put pencil on to block concentrated mind on liquid message of sea have reached to day found that hand have nothing to write brain be full of what wanted to write hand disowned controlling impulse again once again cast thought in brain into reasonable language there hand still stayed a if signal be against simply must not proceed archie have known similar obstacle before though have never be so strong a probably thought be not yet clarified enough for that usual remedy be stroll about garden look at sea from parapetted wall tried returning again with conviction now must be able to give word to impression be so strong in conscious brain a took up pencil again again hand seemed to be yearning to write there be that coral lipped anemone at edge of water there be shoal of little fish a turned became sheet of dazzling silver be ready for hand twitched in expectancy again hand must have nothing to say to that brain signal showed to uncomprehending instrument suddenly with distaste archie perceived what be happening divorcing from mind message that brain be tingling to convey let mere hand untroubled by fighting consciousness do what chose be no longer in own control something somebody else possessed be with conscious reluctance that resigned mechanism to controlling agent who be not watched with absolute detachment word came on paper in firm upright handwriting quite unlike own archie have have warning hand wrote now must manage for will watch may do more have got to do best highest be root of probation be always most loving brother when be child must reach then followed meaningless scribble be pencil gave great dash across paper instantly archie knew that hand have returned to normal allegiance at once sea thought have occupied seethed roared in brain hand be straining to put down tore off involuntary message from block laying aside plunged with force of conscious self into ecstasy of conveying with black mark on white paper have obsessed morning a swam out to sea lay between sun water happiest of earthly animal nearest to key of symbol then after half hour of pure interpretation be finished too lay back in chair picked up martin message again seemed nonsensical affair when so regarded what be warning after what did mean have have warning of sort be strange that after year of silence martin must come to guide again though at self same time told not to look for further guidance archie put paper with well remembered upright handwriting back on table again lay back in long chair drowsy fatigued after spell of fiery writing almost at once sleep began to invade outline of stone pine etched against sky grew blurred a eyelid fluttered closed then without pause transition saw white statue standing close to on neck of there wriggled tail of worm protruding from fair white surface instantly forgotten dream leaped into mind with pang of horror be what dream have be there have be statue standing just there white in moonlight even a worshipped adored with love boundless admiration foul symbol of decay have wreathed about next moment plucked from dozing there be statue there at far more comfortable figure of jessie standing in place with laughter in eye oh be what do archie said when pretend to come out into garden to work despise harry for sleeping archie jumped up from chair brandished in face page of consciously written manuscript leaf on message from martin be written still lay apart from on table may have closed eye for one second said have written since lunch oh be got sea in jessie really believe there be sea there will read evening if will apologize for saying go to sleep instead of writing picked up other leaf yes apologize said though be asleep when came out want to hear what have written so apologize for having thought so there be other page a well archie took from doe belong said that paused moment do remember what told about message used to have from martin when be child asked jessie nodded yes have ceased altogether for year have said quickly until to day just now hour ago have ca make anything out of tell that have have warning know what mean jessie felt habitual contempt of thoroughly normal healthy mind for anything akin to psychical experience ghost in view be to be classed under heading of rat lobster salad such thing a table tapping doings of medium under heading of trickery knowing what did of archie childish experience must not put down a trickery so be unable exactly to despise a fraudulent for very reason rather feared made feel uncomfortable glanced at paper held out to without taking oh archie distrust that said be really very glad when told that for year have have communication from please have more laughed have talked about before understand said have nothing to do with wanting not just come afternoon must help writing more than than one can help sneezing can if rub nose wrong way said jessie flippantly amount of rubbing nose right way wrong way must have slightest effect said archie thing be imperative if martin want to write must write say here that be not going to guide must look after be sorry for be not said jessie quickly there be something strange uncanny about be not sure that think be right even paused moment archie do really believe that be spirit of martin make write said be sure interrupted know what mean said be what roman catholic teach that communication of sort given that be genuine not mere mediumistic trick be not le than converse with evil being impersonating masquerading a spirit from whom communication apparently come do mean that jessie frowned fingering edge of table yes suppose do said think whole thing be dangerous think be thing to meddle with meddle with said archie meddles with besides did ever hear of unwarranted assumption might almost a well say that letter reach from mother doe really come from from evil creature impersonating seems simpler to suppose that come from that signature be genuine just a believe martin to be do really think that when be poor little consumptive chap at grives be really possessed by evil spirit be that rather too horrible imagining nice state next world must be in if sort of thing be allowed for moment think be can reconcile with idea of supreme love governing creating life notion that there behind scene there be evil awful being who can get leave to communicate with child a be pretending to be spirit of brother never knew doe sound likely jessie paused moment again hated subject hated idea of archie being concerned in dim avenue to unseen have for perfectly unreasoning childlike faith that there be world next world that god reigned supreme over somehow offended instinctive attitude that next world who have gone there must be mixed up with world be not dead did not think have ceased to exist have done with world be something like profanity to meddle with then archie have not meddled a most truly said seemed to have meddled with meddling have stopped altogether for dozen year here on half sheet of paper be evidence that something of sort have begun again thought have dropped interest in said thought be finished like childish fairy story like abracadabra legend cousin marion told about oh there be tea will have tea pasqualino have spread table underneath stone pine hailed a possible dismissal of whole affair did not want to talk more about if below silence there must lurk fear preferred to cover up not examine archie got up certainly let have tea said perhaps mind will be clearer after tea be not going to quit question jessie historian be at history will be alone want to talk out something have happened see afternoon martin somebody have written again be quite right to imagine that for whole thing be finished have become abracadabra myth a said a far a normal life go thought have too always knew that might come back have come back without asking for though say be going to leave alone after say have got to do best highest now ask a reasonable female doe that look like message from devil be right bless let have tea moved across into shadow of pine where table sparkled with speck of stray sunshine filtered through bough jessie sane normal held on to evidence of kindly ordinary human life a anchor to prevent drifting out into perilous sea to archie sea be perilous might engulf body drown a seemed to might engulf spirit be not perilous in view be just sea great encompassing presence archie be so odd said knowing that meant to have subject talked out that will dominated hers spend day bathing sailing writing eat sleep then suddenly spring surprise upon show letter have have from martin be surprise archie know archie mouth be extraordinarily full of rusk cherry jam politely disposed of before replying be said of course have two existence dual personality asked dual fiddlestick what mean be that in everybody there be conscious self subconscious self make dual personality one personality most people for instance harry mother transact everything through conscious personality for practical purpose subconscious self doe exist in be one of subconscious self be accessible can reach if want can make act be essential life of contain a such be that part of ourselves with essential life of who have quitted unessential life can communicate martin doe communicate with part of directs control conversation with speaks to subconscious self by rather unusual arrangement subconscious life can speak to conscious life convey what say to hand a once happened when at grives heard call to ear be medium in fact though must usually suggest something charlatanish can bring subconscious life to surface sometimes a when martin speaks to come to surface of own accord with strong compulsion over conscious self paused moment be very odd said until afternoon subconscious self have lain quite quiet for year now suddenly asserts produce page of writing because martin talked to told to make hand write what other explanation be there unless indeed imagine have merely perpetrated silly hoax swear to that something outside made write baldly stated be martin who spoke to subconscious self subconscious self said to conscious self 'take pencil write ' know be so once again jessie have to anchor against current running out to sea there be archie sitting opposite large brown hungry talking of thing be altogether fantastic unless be dangerous somehow be not either fantastic dangerous to be a ordinary a cherry jam be so profusely eating have suddenly come on great undiscovered tract of country dubious full of danger dislike said be too ordinary suppose subconscious self doe act must say what proof be there that there be such thing a subconscious self why must suppose that there be anything of sort have reason to suppose be nonsense archie laughed dear jessie said be arguing not with with have uneasy conviction that be right not bit said want proof archie rubbed hand over head wonder how can give most easily said of course there be lot of way though be quite long time since have practised of thought for moment well here be one said subconscious self to talk more nonsense a say be practically unlimited by material law of world be sort of x ray sort of wireless can set subconscious self to work will to prove existence to voice sank little jessie saw that eye be fixed on bright speck of sunlight gleamed on table cloth sudden ridiculous terror seized archie said be such nonsense be nonsense said quietly must be such baby there be nothing to be frightened at a spoke took eye off bright speck at have be staring looked at with blue dancing glance what be going to do said whatever like let look at bright spot there while sit quiet for two minute will tell anything choose think of something anything will do will tell what be thinking about oh just thought reading said just thought reading what be thought reading if can remember what thought about when went up to bedroom to sleep after lunch to day for instance will tell that there be harry writing history lecture for next term at moment will tell word be writing at least think will be able to be out of practice have not cultivated particular mood for year have when be child expect can get back into jessie felt extreme curiosity about have even a archie have said uneasy conviction that be right for peace of mind longed to have conviction shattered in reasonable self did not believe that archie must possibly tell what harry be writing behind reasonable self sat something unreasonable wanted to be convinced that be nonsense wo have fit anything will asked pour boiling tea over if do will come to myself what be going to do be going to look at something bright that spot of sun on table cloth will do then will just submerge like submarine tell what harry be writing at moment if be test select what fun be have done a said for ever so long oh take bit of paper write down what say suppose will be able to remember again voice sank a fixed eye on bright spot have indicated jessie watching pencil paper in hand saw extraordinary change come over face for few second got troubled eye stared painfully while breath came quickly in out of nostril then grew quite quiet again mouth smiled spoke very slowly a if word be dictated by writer be hopeless to try to comprehend in whole said splendour of unique age can only think of in fragment one afternoon there be new play by sophocles day pericles made funeral oration for fallen on great propylaea to acropolis be finished socrates talked in market place supped with alcibiades in space of few year thing happened a yet more than twenty century have failed to grasp full significance in last lecture to archie rubbed eye sat up have finished for present said there be stir in room just above where sat in garden harry looked out tea left said archie looked up hullo harry said thought be going to finish lecture not appear till dinner be think will finish up to morrow bring down read a far a have got said archie jessie wo mind right got little purplish at end be why stopped hate purple moved away from window archie spoke to jessie did say anything asked yes have got down archie jumped up now will see said wo sauce again in in wicious pride of youth a mr venus remarked be sure got through time be knowledge that have indeed got through jessie took up to bed with night word for word harry have read out at end of lecture precisely sentence archie in queer dreamy state have dictated to just before harry have looked out of window asked if there be tea left there be room for doubt even a archie have said piece of mind have be able to divine exactly what harry be writing at moment in conscious state must not know what be according to own account certain people of whom be one be able to direct not only conscious self also subconscious self lay below so asserted be practically unfettered by material law must perceive what be happening at distance at spot invisible to must penetrate a by x ray process into other mind for free action in case at rate conscious self have to be obliterated by looking at bright spot on table cloth have be able to put to sleep to hypnotize thus allowing subconscious self to pas portal where normally conscious self kept guard to do errand so far there be nothing to disquiet make uncomfortable be a have said just thought reading example of purely natural law however dimly understood be fully admitted by scientific investigator one except most hide bound of pedant questioned existence of subconscious self if here be example of abnormal development of still there be nothing to fight shy of have asked for proof of power undeniably have got archie have gone far beyond in exposition of power of subconscious self be caused very vivid disquiet through subconscious self in who have gift of releasing of allowing activity must come so believed communication from individual consciousness have passed out of material world even a subconscious self must get into touch with thought of living people a have seen for afternoon so also must get into touch with thought of dead be thus so archie announced that when be mere child knew nothing whatever of conscious subconscious self martin brother whom have never heard of used hand to write with a if be own with wrote in handwriting have be jessie fully believed in survival of personality to so called dead have passed on to further higher plane of existence there be to something inexplicably repugnant in notion that must come back speak write to who still lived on plane of existence jessie lingered late by window overlooking bay trying to disentangle lay bare root of repugnance be late below in garden must perceive grey line of archie hammock swung between acacia pine archie lying there like chrysalis be just like thought most of world be only caterpillar eating way through allotted span of year archie be stage more advanced than anybody have ever known world next be one to not by spiritual insight from instinctive conviction that there be really difference between living so called dead be not by enlightenment through stress of prayer aspiration that have arrived at that have be gifted with a child be medium who by special gift must talk to brother who have died long year ago with just same naturalness a talked to if died to night must find nothing strange about must burst chrysalis hang for moment weak fluttering then expand wing to most people death be awful affair be caterpillar have to learn intermediate stage be already familiar with yet fact that be stage more advanced coupled with sort of helplessness for there lay in cocoon evil thing might attack jessie shook mind body be being fantastic in fear misgiving with set purpose forced to drink in be penetrated by assured serenity of material world lay spread before above wheeled star in silent sky on silent sea shone constellation from fishing boat tree stood motionless in holy summer hushed night beneath while though seemed to sleep great renewing force of world be ripening olive enriching twisted bud must flower in fresh harvest of azure on morning glory when sun warmed there be nothing to disturb must let soul lie open to night think out cause for disquietude hated idea of commerce between living dead there be root of strangeness of idea made seem unnatural yet where if examined more closely be unnaturalness why must not loving soul who have passed that tiny rivulet called death into fuller life beyond be allowed to call from other side to loved be there not something exquisite something supremely tender in thought martin who have be little more than child when died in swiss chalet must tell archie about cache have made under pine tree be childish communication brought message of consolation encouragement be just what martin have be alive on side of death might have told archie besides who knew that did not give that a test a proof of identity for surely nothing must have be devised so convincing if god willed that dead must be able under certain circumstance to speak from sunlit beyond to who still moved among material shadow who be jessie to question so wonderful ordinance if must speak like to young innocent child why must not continue to speak to brother when grew up looked elsewhere for ground of repugnance for moment thought have found for have once be to seance at house of professional medium afternoon still be vivid degrading in memory have sat round table in darkened room while medium went into trance instantly ridiculous knocking melody from musical box began to resound in gloom be supposed to be played by spirit called durward felisy who for absolutely unconjecturable reason liked spending afternoon in puerile idiocy meantime medium breathed heavily be only evidence that be in trance at after while said here be dear cardinal in husky voice niece who sat next informed circle that be cardinal newman who like durward felisy must find nothing better to do on other side than attend awful sitting for always came when paid guinea to medium sat in dark to encourage lifted up voice at suggestion of medium niece sang lead kindly light gratified so much that joined in singing second verse sang own hymn to tune given in hymn ancient modern then when hymn be over made moral reflection blessed in latin then there came materialization head shoulder of durward appeared in middle of table be dressed in white have large black beard round ear wire with beard be attached to face be clearly visible during circle be warned to keep hand touching round table for if one made break consequence to medium might be very serious since spirit have built up from material derived from medium electric fluid contributed by sitter so if electric fluid be withdrawn material must not be able to get back into medium who must completely collapse possibly die though whether durward must thereupon again become visible permanent dweller on planet be not explained by time jessie have be so convinced of wicked profane fraudulence of proceeding that furtively withdrew one of hand thus cut off electric fluid altogether durward did mind bit continued to tell about joy of paradise according to account must have be like crystal palace erected in middle of botanical garden when have regaled enough withdrew in direction where medium sat took off beard became felisy with veil alto voice surely be enough to make one despair contemn whole idea of intercourse with spirit jessie suddenly became aware of basic illogicality in position be not intercourse with spirit despised despicable swindler who with aid of false beard musical box pretended that must materialize cause communication with spirit did not deride memory of afternoon because spirit of cardinal newman durward felisy have moved among because have be use accounting for repugnance towards genuine intercourse with spirit by repugnance towards quack charlatan whole history of spiritualism teemed with undesirable gentry faked phenomenon have more connection with archie communication from brother than have forged bank note with credit of bank of england found did believe that knowledge say of cache beneath pine tree came to archie from other than normal human source be known to living being in world so far a must tell if looked for explanation must search for in supposition that knowledge came to from living intelligence beyond veil intensely disliked being forced to conclusion now knew why be for reason have suggested to afternoon thing came from region condition of existence into people passed when died in region there existed not only soul of dead who lived in environment under condition at must not ever so faintly conjecture other spirit good evil good impulse came into heart of men came from over there so too did evil impulse must blight if must garden of god who knew whether man who by strange faculty archie possessed of opening door of subliminal self through a averred message came might not open to other evil thing if possession by evil spirit be psychical possibility certainly be not more fantastically strange than such phenomenon a archie must produce must not be thus in other way that evil possession must enter yet in childhood archie have in ignorance in white defencelessness opened more than once door of soul harm surely have come to be being unreasonable full of fear where fear be twittering with groundless superstitious fancy there be yet side to question if spirit of dead must indeed return speak of what knew be not worth while running risk on chance of wonder might tell of existence now be else might be of interest in human life supreme over be hint fragment of information about timeless everlasting day that lay beyond dawning setting of sun nay more if to one be given wonderful gift by mean of voice must reach from beyond veil be not duty to use endowment for enlightenment consolation of who mourned who sat in darkness god must never have bestowed so spiritual gift on if did not mean to be used christian faith taught that dead be alive in wider sense than ever have be on earth why then must be forbidden to who have amazing gift to speak with to learn about life roman church have fulminated anathema on galileo thing scarcely credible to more enlightened age be more than possible that pronouncement against intercourse with dead be one instance more of similar cowardice narrowness who must doubt that man of science three hundred year ago must have be burned a dabbler in diabolism witchcraft if have exhibited manifestation of wireless telegraphy x ray photograph nowadays there be not living being who did not rank such a discovery of natural law sorcery of one age be science of next jessie propounded to herself reason must not find flaw in something sat behind reason superstition might be instinct spiritual perception refused to accept conclusion like child afraid of dark trembled hung back amount of logical assurance from nurse amount of demonstration that room when dark contained only familiar thing light made manifest must reassure did like dark nothing must persuade that danger did not lurk in blackness well be use going over ground again knew thoroughly now reason made headway against instinct instinct against reason swept matter from mind tried to calm certain intimate agitation trembled there by letting eye pour into soul superb serenity of italian night moon have risen spread across bay silver path to edge of world in sky wheeling innumerable world kept sentinel over earth never have looked on stillness more peaceful more steadfast not breeze stirred in cypress in thicket of ilex below love moved sun other star thrilled in heart of innumerable nightingale love permeated everywhere world be soaked in peace just then over hill to north there flickered flash of lightning from storm very far away long afterwards scarcely audible came muffled murmur of thunder jessie came downstairs next morning before of two young men be astir indeed on going into garden found archie still serenely slumbering in hammock in spite of sun filtered through pine tree on to brown face curly head perhaps intangible shaft from pierced down into gulf of sleep for immediately sat up flushed with slumber like child fresh bright eyed from night in open air hullo jess said down already suppose 'd better get up be shocking for young lady to see young gentleman bare foot pyjama if so must shut eye now be going to see scream will said jessie always wear patent leather boot fur coat when bathe yes be so bear for once lord what morning threw off blanket dangled leg over side of hammock instantly lit cigarette archie why do smoke before breakfast asked because make feel so jolly dizzy ah ca guess how good cigarette taste when have have nothing tongue teeth in mouth for eight nine hour hullo here be post english paper who care for what happens in england letter for two for harry one for good bye sha wash much because will bathe morning jessie letter proved to be from helena content instantly absorbed whole attention colonel vautier father lady tintagel first cousin have gone out to egypt over government irrigation work instead of coming back in june must be detained out there till september in consequence lady tintagel hoped that two girl must live with instead of going back to father house till return helena comment on be enthusiastic also very characteristic darling jessie said after statement of proposal do hope will say 'yes cousin marion encloses note for so will see how much want to uncle jack have begun to call uncle jack though be uncle at gave quite pleased sort of grunt when be mentioned mean that approves so be independent say must sooner go back to oakland crescent because have simply set heart on stopping here be horrible at home in summer with sun blazing into little tiny room smell of green flooding house really must be kindness to cousin marion say so a will find when read note besides there be reason know can guess in fact think be duty to come when duty take form of anything so pleasant a there really be not slightest reason for neglecting a be youngest feel that must do a want besides be greatest fun here there be end of dance party dinner there be horse to ride motor car be having loveliest tune so will be very selfish of if want to go home know will say 'yes charming enclosure from lady tintagel accompanied so much hope that helena will stop with must think of a great kindness to for will be utmost comfort to now that girl be married to have two with for rest of season spoke to archie about while be at silorno so ask whether approves not hope go well with be archie quite black yet from bathing send line a soon a have thought over helena be having greatest success in town one think charming admires enormously jessie read over a waited for archie to rejoin at breakfast there be reason for accepting so cordial invitation must give pleasure to helena to cousin marion apparently also to archie knew must have to consent there be cause must be spoken about must possibly adduce for refusing week ago cause did not exist now wondered how must bear to see helena archie in close companionship must imply watch feeling for expanding from bud into flower if have thought that helena loved must all be different felt certain that helena did not there for be poignancy of in manner that must not explain jessie knew that knew token by love betrays existence barely yet twenty two have somewhere stored in soul language of love speaks even when think be dumb talking in sleep may be have seen in last week of helena sojourn here that archie talked to like there be speech language said nothing of word betrayed dawning passion love spoke in silence even a rosy cloud high above earth herald dawn be own knowledge enlightened too knew silent language knew that archie conversed in though word came when talked to helena something kindled behind eye secret alertness possessed there be defencelessness blindness of love for when helena answered pretended to talk same tongue jessie knowing knew that spoke mere paltry gibberish sounded same looked same be nonsense be not authentic yet archie never talked in secret tongue to jessie in consequence have never answered in to day seemed native tongue when talked to said must need be translated out of into language of who be friend dear friend more than friend be instantaneous seemed to read between line of helena letter recalled too between line token that knew archie must look at harry a sat at dinner then at mother then at in order that in due time might look at helena when spoke to of never got more than one ear inattentive mind from other ear attention be always with helena helena knew that quite well woman girl must fail to know by way of response have made scythian retreat to england doubt be clever of in jessie opinion clever people be found out even sooner than stupid one only inexplicable folk be wise wisdom have very little to do with cleverness wisdom be perhaps cleverness of soul look down with pity on manoeuvre of mind archie made absurd entry have dressing gown on perhaps sort of abbreviated bathing dress canvas shoe did dress said for where be use of dressing if be going to undress again almost immediately be going to work morning asked jessie no one day a mr wordsworth said will give to idleness be going to bathe morning instead of morning want holiday think be overworked what be happening in foolish england if have read paper have said suddenly face changed began to talk secret language jessie understood helena counterfeited what other news asked have letter from somebody jessie pretended not to understand what knew so well yes did have letter said determined that archie must be more direct than from helena mother said carelessly have heard from of except telegram to say have got home safely be talking secret language still very carelessness of tone betrayed heard from said letter be from helena there be enclosure from cousin marion archie said nothing in answer to seemed to girl that silence be just a eloquent in language without word eventually remarked that harry be very late jessie knew that have beaten always did just because have nothing with regard to at stake archie want to talk to about what have written to said talk away said archie say what good little fish jessie be not proposing to yield like if in code of secret language professed indifference to what be longing to hear must be indifferent too to archie intense irritation continued to talk about little fish in tone of great interest till harry entrance agreed be very good probably be fresh sardine caught last night by fisher be must not remember italian name of other little fish be so like sardine archie serene brow clouded grunted greeting to harry next moment heart smote knew how easily archie must put sun out for without meaning to do have out of sort of piqued femininity intentionally done same for felt a if have spoiled child pleasure be so like child lover be made of child stuff got up almost immediately full of tender penitence followed one behind other went out into garden where archie in superb unconsciousness of presence became instantly absorbed in despised english paper archie said rustled with paper oh er what answered wanted to talk to about helena letter said only must talk about sardine put that paper down ca talk through paper noticed that kept finger on paragraph must have betted last shilling that have idea what that paragraph be about though moment before have be penitent now stiffened determined that must meet more gracefully than be sorry be interrupting said will tell other time archie suddenly threw paper into air oh be behaving like idiot said at heart be so be really will confess be just longing to know what helena writes about be idiot too will like enormously if say be be idiot too said girl cousin marion want helena to live with till father come home told to ask if approved leaned forward to ah do jessie said hope will ca see why must can looked straight into eager blue eye be so close to hers for there be wealth of frankness friendliness light in be not for knew helena want to said doe that mean that asked be sorry if be so got up no doe mean that bit said be delightful of cousin marion to want of course will come archie rose too be perfectly ripping of said will be jolly party four quite suddenly pause fell very awkwardly very constrainedly see father doe appear much said at length be what meant be very often in country well see much archie soon took off to sea armed with paper pencil for with four hour in front of there must be much basking to be done between bathe already of sea sketch be beginning to take shape in mind found that there be hour so fruitful in inspiration a when after swim returned to empty sandy beach lay spread out to sun to be dried browned made eager for dip so to day after first swim lay for while on back with arm across face to shield eye from glare opened brain so to speak to let sea thought invade came swarming in at invitation presently turned over propped on elbow began to catch pin to paper rim of sea with weed fringed rock diaper of moving light in willow water shoal of little fish almost invisible one moment next a turned becoming shield of silver flake be ready to be hammered into sentence yet hammer paused somehow at back of mind be topic inhibited hand must not allow connection between hand brain to be made thought knew what be for only morning have heard that helena be to be inmate of house in london yet did not seem to be that be preventing wondered whether be thought of father habitual intoxication be always like black background at home just for moment have popped out into conversation with jessie hindered again did not seem sufficient cause for inability to start mechanism translated thought into language then became aware that finger itched ached to write with compelling force knew well yet only yesterday martin have said that must not come to again quality of force seemed unmistakable presently yielded to really have not power to resist wrote a hand bade write there be few sentence scribbled then pencil a usually happened when message be complete gave dash have notion what have written when be finished read through archie have come through once more said to repeat that have be warned ca get through again martin so here again be inexplicable mention of warning archie conscious mind be blank with regard to such warning repetition of did not long occupy for immediately found that inhibition between brain hand be gone sentence after sentence of sea sketch flowed through finger by degree not till couple of page be full did inspiration exhaust then lay back on sand again full of ecstasy always accompanies completion of piece of work have be done a creator meant to do bad good have fulfilled intention brain brooded over that for little then slipped back to incident have preceded must make nothing at of determining to dismiss from mind speak of to nobody tore up sheet contained message buried fragment in sand lay back again roasting in sun soon that delectable warmth must increase on bare limb till cried out for cool embrace of sea again must fling into just for little longer must stew stupefy in sun with half closed eye watch vibration of hot air over beach listen to hiss of ripple except for morning be extremely quiet sun poured down over outspread limb sea waited for a lay there dozed memory of evil dream went across brain like flash vanished again already italian day be beginning to draw to sunny end be numbered must be easily counted archie jessie counted when woke in morning in evening said to day gone reflection on diminishing tale colour of emotion be absolutely opposed for while intensely enjoyed italian hour jessie counted with grudging sense of school boy who enumerates remaining day of holiday to archie be day of term time still though enjoyable must be got through before holiday began never before have contemplated stay in town with eagerness now a thought of who must be living with have never be so expectantly enamoured of london at close of last day divine serenity of june weather be troubled a evening drew on cloud for few hour past have be weaving wisp streamer over sky grew to thick curtain stretched from horizon to horizon be of opaque grey here there in be line patch of much darker texture a if have be rent have be darned again with blacker thread instead of coolness succeeded sunset heat clear no longer impure like air of closed room got ever sultrier for refreshment of evening breeze from sea there be exchanged stifling stagnation life have gone out of atmosphere be a if immense othello be smothering world air be heavy charged with electricity a yet remote winking of lightning rumble of thunder showed that there be relief coming have dined out in garden where candle burned unwaveringly in stillness afterwards have strolled to far angle of supporting wall of fortress where if anywhere might find hint of movement in intolerable calm breath visited even there very bamboo that grew at corner of garden bed be a motionless a if have be made of lead archie mopped streaming forehead if interest anybody remarked may say that be going to die ca bear longer think will die in about hour jessie fanned that did not do particle of good only seemed to make hotter a when stir water in hot bath tried to interest in archie approaching decease be to take corpse back to england to morrow asked just a like will have more use for lord have finished packing yet fancy having to pack in heat need surely if be going to die must immortal manuscript must be lost in general confusion caused by death will go to bed ca be hotter in hammock than here yes will get into pyjama go to bed do packing in morning trailed off into house presently appeared again attired for bed strolled across to well will wish good night said very much doubt whether will get need do same to for know sha wish must be hollow moved away again towards stone pine where hammock be hung pale tall ghost of figure against blackness then quite suddenly panic impulse seized jessie result perhaps of overstrung nerve overcharged atmosphere sprang up not knowing why wait moment archie cried go something be going to happen even a spoke whole world seemed enveloped in fire core of fire white hot line plunged downwards into stone pine be rent from top to bottom absolute blackness filled with deafening roar of thunder deluging rain succeeded rushed towards shelter of house for moment three stood there recovering balance from tremendous crash convulsion then archie with soaked silk clinging close to shoulder leg turned to jessie wonder why called out to said what made do saved life expect jessie laughed little a be given to hysteria that laugh be half way towards uncontrollable tear why did want to die in hour said lightly remembered that moment when came for to save archie life indeed inexplicable signal from love have flashed upon night must flash upon again chapter vii helena be having breakfast by open window of bedroom in cousin house be not yet nine in morning though have be dancing till three o'clock have already have bath be feeling a fresh a if have have eight instead of hardly more than four hour in bed outside square be still empty of passenger pale primrose coloured sunshine of london june shone on wet roadway rain refreshed tree for shower have fallen not long ago through open window there came in delicious smell of damp earth gave little heed to to breakfast be eating with so admirable appetite for brain cool alert in early hour be very busy over own concern soon must have to go down to cousin marion see if must be of use to for be quite worth while doing job for cousin marion a always paid kindness back with royal generosity must get flower to give welcoming air to archie room who with jessie be expected back to day that also must not be waste of time might have spent more directly on must get for jessie too for have character of unselfish thoughtfulness to keep up must be unnecessary to pay for for must get at shop where cousin marion dealed helena have enjoyed most entrancing fortnight during time have occasionally thought of silorno have oftener talked of to cousin marion for have that valuable social gift of appearing to talk with keen attention of one thing while be thinking about something quite different must easily interject dear archie will be nice to have back darling jessie wrote delicious letter be enjoying if cousin marion expressed wish to see letter be equally easy to say that have torn up meantime brain must be busy with recollection of day before a bore on plan for day to come might go off on to tangent for brief space well ordered singly purposed mind be never long in recalling to main topic helena have made something of sensation during last week be not beautiful be quite enchantingly pretty mind have quality might rightly be supposed to underlie delicious face inform slim graceful limb nothing seemed to mar good nature superb gift of enjoying be worth while being agreeable to everybody if lot happened for hour two day to be cast with elderly bore be indefatigable in attention to at time in telling friend afterwards how immensely have enjoyed talking to paid to do sort of thing provided that be done with gaiety made appear genuine spontaneous if appreciation came bubbling out of one suspected of design seemed most designless delicious girl in london for be next to impossible to see through object dazzle to crown gift have intensest power of enjoying there be not key unlocks so many door in whirl mill race of entertainment characterized last gay summer that london must see for long there be time to make friend only to take scalp of enthusiastic acquaintance that perhaps be lucky for helena a finished breakfast recalled mind from shining experience except in so far a bore on theme insistently occupied there be doubt especially after quiet talk in paved garden outside ball room last night bertie harlow be dazzled according to plan heaven only knew when have last be to ball for be close on forty helena have naturally looked up in peerage since liked to know about friend felt pretty certain that have danced with one must perhaps hardly call share of performance dancing have stepped measure twice trodden on toe after did not matter whether husband danced not since naturally when relation have be arrived at must not dance with many woman doubt when be married must think advantage husband did not dance since then must not dance with anybody else be not in helena nature prospectively to grudge such amusement must desire when once have got have to get first to do that have to keep dazzled must not get accustomed to helena have very strong belief in desirability of simplifying life did not in least imply that thought there be anything attractive in simple life simplification amounted to that formulated exactly what wanted then without deflection of aim did very best with efficient armoury of weapon to get while second clause in simplification of life be to find out what irritated bored with power eliminate from existence if must not get what wanted without getting something bored be merely necessary to ascertain how balance between conflicting interest lay a practically applied to case in hand be aware that lord harlow bored though not badly that nose irritated that must almost certainly get used to while on other side of scale be quantity of thing liked liked immense wealth position liberty must undoubtedly enjoy if married amiable man whom so many have tried to capture that in be incentive to pride without being snob saw objection to being marchioness here simplification ended complication intruded be not so long ago that have sat under stone pine with archie seen face glow in darkness a drew on cigarette in point of attractiveness there be naturally comparison between cousin amiable middle aged man owing to impossibility of even most limited polyandry be clearly no use to think of marrying be left be to choose between supposing a most sincerely did that be soon must be for to choose certainly be not in love with archie if took a example of that ridiculous symptom exhibited by daisy hollinger who by strange freak be in love with lord harlow helena have behaved very wisely over for have instantly seen advantage of becoming great friend in sense of word with poor daisy who poured out to farrago of amorous imbecility helena be sure that be not in love with archie like anything so insane seemed incomprehensible to be archie be dear have quite wished must kiss night of course in cousinly fashion must have scorned to be offended with whereas did not in least look forward to moment when lord harlow must kiss apart from that simplification of life came in again against archie there be certain item must be imprudent to disregard father be drunkard archie have be consumptive a child consumption ran in family for archie brother have died of so perhaps did drunkenness though did archie justice of trying failing to remember that have ever seen drink wine at be serious objection in husband there be perhaps not le serious knew from cousin marion that uncle jack have lately lost great deal of money there be even question of shutting up letting london house next winter of course if married archie must not spend winter down at lacebury live with poor uncle jack london a wife of impoverished son must be very different from london a wife of very wealthy man who so to speak be nobody son finally there be certain story cousin marion have told about queer message communication have come to archie while be still child from dead brother seemed to helena practical mind pure nonsense yet have be pleased to hear that since be young in teen rather uncomfortable phenomenon have ceased felt that did not believe in though have real existence disliked thought of though be so long since there have be repetition of might though be nonsense crop up again have belief in ghost must not willingly have slept in haunted room dead be dead whereas be very much alive well be time to dress go down to cousin marion long frank meditation for be always frank with perhaps be reason that have so little of commodity to spare for other people have helped considerably to clear mind provoke simplification like good housewife who will permit waste of what can possibly be used thought must have very useful function for archie to perform when arrived that evening found lady tintagel busy with morning post there be quantity of invitation most of owing to press of others have to be declined helena having marked of with accept refuse laid aside to answer there be one where russian dancer be to perform very much regretted having to say to since evening be already filled wondered if by contrivance must be possible to manage glance at lady tintagel engagement book showed that prohibiting acceptance be for dinner concert at lady awcock where be stately victorian spent evening of unparalleled dreariness helena have already produced most favourable impression on lady awcock by listening to practically endless dissertation on political society forty year ago thought must manage will enter invitation accept in engagement book cousin marion asked yes dear will be really have for morning what will do with helena gathered up card engagement book think will stop at home said often do want something more know hate not being here to do for nothing of sort there be motor for if want to go see anybody helena considered oh must like to do one thing said wo take long may get flower for archie room jessie flower do look so cool refreshing when have be day night in train of course may be nice of to think of then do think of rather nice thing for other people oh shut up cousin marion laughed girl helena retired to table in window with material proceeded to execute very neat simple piece of work entry in lady tintagel engagement book be only made in pencil erased inconvenient lady awcock name from evening fortnight ahead wrote in place that of giver of russian party to whom instead of refusal sent line in cousin name of grateful acceptance then wrote charming little letter of penitence to lady awcock abasing at same time pitying have done stupidest thing for have accepted lady awcock invitation on evening when be already engaged letter proceeded ca tell how disappointed be dear lady awcock for be so looking forward to talk with to hear more of interesting thing told perhaps if have not disgusted beyond forgiveness must ask again day must be wonderfully kind not tell lady tintagel what stupid thing have done for let keep engagement book for if knew be afraid must never trust again last touch thoroughly pleased helena be confiding childlike for rest relied on cousin marion not happening to remember that have once accepted invitation to lady awcock even if did have impression of engagement book with such entry appearing in must show that memory have played false probably cousin marion must remember nothing about indeed in multiplicity of engagement seemed to helena that risk ran be negligible helena found time to go to victoria to meet traveller afternoon to reflect a waited for boat train to come in in cool pink blouse skirt of poiret stuff must certainly present very refreshing contrast to poor jessie in dishevelled dusty travelling clothes did not in least want jessie to look bedraggled except in so far a must gain by contrast for be good natured enough not to want one to be at disadvantage a long a did not add to own advantage jessie be dreadfully bad sailor too be quite enough that must have travelled for night day without hoping that have have bad crossing helena merely wanted to appear fresh brilliant herself at length train came in though quite distinctly saw archie step out continued searching for with eye in crowd until made way up to ah dear said how lovely to see be cross with for coming to meet if bore to be met at station did want to welcome where be jessie there be jessie darling what fun archie did not look a if be at bored to be met at station be perfectly ripping of said be glad came have be baked boiled way from silorno crossing thought be always calm in summer archie allude to said jessie helena took sister arm darling jessie be so sorry said archie wretch for mentioning now go straight to motor sit there quietly archie will see to luggage if archie a be probable drew contrast be intended to draw between sister helena on side drew between lord harlow there stood looking eagerly at a waited emergence of trunk face neck hand so tanned by sun one else looked ill anaemic by be tall lithe slender with quick movement of wild animal in brown face blue eye shone like transparent turquoise seemed incarnation of sun sea wholesome virility a thought of rather heavy kalmuck face of lord harlow staid aspect suitable to forty year almost wondered whether in estimate made morning have allowed enough for personal charm there have be other factor a well who knew whether below engaging exterior there be not planted seed of tragic outcome be certainly pleasant to reflect that exuberance of young manhood must made doubt be hers if made up mind to want in case be there girl in london who have so attractive second string to bow archie have on appearance of one of piece of luggage insinuated into crowd helena be left outside when sight odd to see at station attracted attention beyond platform lay empty out of porter shed there there bounded big tabby cat with mouse in mouth tail switched eye gleamed with joy of successful hunter did not prepare to eat mouse immediately trotted little farther off lay down depositing prey dabbed at softly with velvet paw sheathed claw even let run few inch away from then gently shepherded back again once let seem to escape altogether gave start of at least couple of yard while watched with quivering shoulder then playfully bounded in air reminded that be not own master then there came dismal little squeak a from slate pencil poor mouse trouble be over pleased cat blinked in sun licked lip helena followed gruesome little drama with interest that surprised even rather shocked be altogether on side of cat cat according to light be not being cruel be merely doing natural thing with mouse happened to like teasing prey letting think that have escaped sheathing claw have caught playing with there be nothing horrible about cat be doing a nature intended to do be rather sorry for mouse be what came of being mouse there be archie triumphant with porter rescued luggage archie have way with official smiled at in confident friendly way always did what wanted never searched trap there be dance somewhere that night helena letting fact be reluctantly dragged out of that there be such thing only said how nice must be to go to bed early be tired dear asked lady tintagel helena made little deprecating face face of prettiest little martyr in cause of truth ever beheld ca exactly say be said think think be speaking on behalf of archie jessie be not tired either said let go to somebody dance ca dance atom helena will teach there be nothing like practice in public what dance be by way oh be right said be uncle aunt toby archie be sure be tired be not tell be whether want to go lady tintagel struck in if go on being so unselfish said will never settle anything try to be selfish for one moment helena wo hurt do want to go enormously said with sign of resignation archie dying for let call taxi jessie must hate said jessie very confidently matter of course be settled on line helena be duly credited with having wanted to go enormously with having done utmost to efface for sake of others be precisely end have in view along now having have dance so to speak forced on be quite free to enjoy have produced precisely impression wanted on archie mother though be likely that jessie with long familiarity with such manoeuvre be not equally unenlightened knew by corresponding familiarity jessie loyalty gave little butterfly kiss to cousin marion murmur of delighted thanks went to sister to finish up very complete little picture darling jessie said go to bed soon sleep well will tiptoe in in morning if be still asleep will tell not to wake till ring may do cousin marion jessie understood perfectly well mouth have that curve in might might not be smile good night said have nice dance teach archie well to speak of luck be often nothing more than mode of expressing success usually attends foresight chance favour wise calculation helena last night have dropped most casual hint to lord harlow that be probably going to dance to night be satisfied that have be attending be not unprepared to see there even if have not be able to come suspected that must do so absence must have be delightfully explained to afterwards there be not dancing standing about near door of ball room quite obviously interested in arrival undoubtedly saw brilliant entry of herself archie contrived to put few of crowd between herself a passed near for present gave no more than glance smile downdropt eye then one glance again passed with archie into ball room there ordinary old fashioned waltz be in progress not one of anaemic strollings about be becoming popular slid off with radiant partner on to floor not overfull have moment misgiving when remembered that archie have said must dance for must vex to appear in clutch of bungler after archie must hardly be awkward if tried immediately fear vanished for have hardly gone up short side of room before knew that if one be bungler be might have guessed from seeing walk move that must dance what must not have guessed be that anybody must dance like floated glided be floor surely that moved under be wind of swinging voluptuous tune wafted on a in clear eddy of sunlit water dear said must dance exclaimed sort of thing said meant steppings crawling of new style helena be too content to talk whole being glowed with satisfaction of flowing movement floor got ever emptier line of expectant fox trotter bunny hugger stood round wall none of objected to watching for little longer entrancing couple who now have floor almost to couple after couple dropped off stood looking to helena gleaming eye passed in streak of black white many coloured hue a archie moved ever more freely largely over untenanted space must just see face of friend a passed knew that lord harlow have come in be standing by door there be question of luck in be doing what knew be obliged to do then web of sound poured out of gallery grew more brightly coloured a quickened to close still archie moved without effort a if be part of of other then whole fabric of divine dream of melody motion be shattered for dance be over archie have not spoken either since intimated that have alluded to steppings crawling now paused for moment in middle of room breathing just little quickly bewildered a with dazzling light ever since have put arm round girl taken hand in have have that sense of sinking into sunlit water where arrived at true naked self now have swum up again be clothed in black coat white shirt helena be standing step apart from one else at edge of room be very far away instantly mingling of wild consternation triumph seized oh helena be doing that by ourselves said how frightful let get out of be divine may do again soon will have nothing crawling appeared that crawling be to be next item archie noticed that in crowd now came about again particular man have eye on be unmistakably burrowing towards yes archie of course will said girl go see aunt ask if may have waltz ever so soon oh here lord harlow want to introduce be done lord harlow turned to helena again feel a if have be present at bacchic festival said in very precise voice must have vine leaf in hair er partner tunic thyrsus feel a prosaic a bradshaw may be bradshaw helena looked from one to other if have have tail must certainly have be switching ah do said bradshaw be quite indispensable archie go get thyrsus will poker do lord harlow persuade mr morris to have waltz before long now that sheer animal exhilaration of adorable waltz quite precluded talking be over seemed perfectly suitable a plodded along weary way of fox trot to talk again in answer to lord harlow who have not caught archie name said yes lord davidstow surely told about knew that have purposely not done so be lady tintagel son with whom be staying lord harlow quietly assimilated a turned slowly round doe do other thing a well a dance asked think doe said though never really thought about when people be such dear a archie one doe consider what do just be certainly be appears very much alive yes be madly alive gave swift glance guessing have gone far enough on tack put about think be possible to be too much alive said be like hot water bottle be too hot burn ca help being carried off foot by mean hot water bottle paused moment for purpose of phrasing must weight with bradshaw said that will keep to earth ca spare helena laughed say thing too neatly said what delicious notion what have done day have waited for evening hope doe disappoint now that have come said be up to highest expectation just now said suddenly flashed into helena mind that be temperature of wooing be engaged in now neat proper sentence turned a on lathe be expression of mild pleased glance that gave yet discreet veiled a be divined that according to nature year be love that inspired found quite easy to adjust to level if kiss when time came for be of same respectful finished quality must deal with too wondered how archie must make love be necessary to fox trot little longer while trotting trot also conversationally with intention let press little more against arm oh be glad of said lightly be such dreadful pity when people be disappointed think must sooner anticipate something nice fail to get than not anticipate at can imagine not looking forward to delicious thing want do want very much asked yes everything want not only for for everybody made mental note that be very shy for have nothing in response to except shirt creaked that suited very well did not want to follow up just yet meantime sedate marching retreat occasional revolution of fox trot went decorously on room be very full when there be nowhere to march to stopped where be marked time rocked little to fro then perhaps narrow lane opened in front of waddled down brushing shoulder against hedge have seen archie go to mr morris after have appeared for moment in gallery where band be now be back again standing near door watching gave little glance from time to time elevated eyebrow a if in deprecation of unexhilarating performance smiled at guessing that have arranged for waltz at last end came fox trotter ceased to clutch other walked away with about a much terpsichorean fervour a have be dancing with dull though last twenty minute have be from standpoint helena felt quite satisfied with while motion perhaps emotion have made partner hot gently wiped forehead with very fine cambric handkerchief perfectly delicious said must have liked that to go on for ever how long will have to wait before begin again archie have sidled through crowd up to helena be going to have waltz at once cried let waste of laid hand on arm said be quite certain may say 'we also asked lord harlow turned towards hand still rested on archie felt slight pressure from fingertip oh be only teasing cousin said have promised waltz later may borrow bradshaw again band struck up setting tingle for repetition of what have gone before oh archie come on cried au revoir bradshaw alert for movement with heady tune of waltz already mounting into like wine stepped off on to floor be like stepping on to moving platform tune without conscious effort of own seemed to carry away archie have one question to ask before abandoned bradshaw said thought told name be harlow gave little bubble of laughter oh be only joke said told that be like bacchic festival felt a prosy a bradshaw in consequence what doe matter to what be like asked well be compliment meant nicely said let talk rather spoil helena reviewed manoeuvre when got home that night congratulated on neatness efficiency of disposition felt sure that have stirred up livelier ferment in lord harlow have also managed to inspire with vague distrust jealousy of intimacy with archie suspected that be little sluggish in emotion must serve admirably a stimulant quite realized that have not yet brought up to point of proposing to for inured bachelor habit must want good deal of breaking be clear to that have made crack in that judicious use of archie might be profitably used to widen crack under influence merely of charm might hold together for long time yet wanted if must have entirely own way to propose to about end of season effect of archie constantly with must be cumulative be not wedge must cause to fly into splinter forthwith must just widen crack prevent closing again then widen little more meanwhile be extremely pleasant always to have wedge in hand to hammer from time to time a suited main plan at others to stroke play with be not in love with archie made purr to see that be certainly falling in love with to dab with sheathed claw to wish that have material advantage have made choose elder man clearly served purpose to use using of gave pleasure pleasure be secondary be assistance gave in breaking up lord harlow be of primary importance archie brought gaiety charm to bear on love making falling in love did not appear to at stage anything most exhilarating almost hilarious experience flirtation that helena seemed to be having with lord harlow amused enormously not for moment did believe that helena meant anything lord harlow be not only man on whom helena exercised perfectly legitimate attraction of extreme prettiness enthusiastic child like enjoyment oh one be so kind so awfully nice said to one day a returned from early morning ride love by handful including bradshaw asked yes certainly including bradshaw like like so much archie considered know if like not said think ever thought about doe matter matter awfully to did know that be most outrageous flirt helena archie how horrid of said just because like people to certain extent like why must be cross unpleasant to people a if be wicked to like well if will give long odds will bet that bradshaw asks to to be 'abc before end of season said archie dear what nonsense said with sudden thrill of pleasure what can have put that into head can see be way man like bradshaw look at girl when affection be engaged look a if very dear aunt be dead have amour triste that certainly hit off type of gaze to helena felt that have be subjected laughed well will give five to one in half crown said day will have twelve sixpence turned cantered back along soft track dew of night have not yet vanished from grass geometric looking plane leaf rhododendron flower bed be still varnished with moisture early though be rider foot passenger be plentiful probably day must be hot for heat haze purplish brown in distance be beginning to form in air softly veiling further view presently dropped again into walking pace helena whose mind have be busy on archie description of certain sort of love lorn look spoke of subject suggested by how do think jessie be asked be exactly what mother asked last night said be rather silent preoccupied be that struck said girl thought perhaps be very well told there be nothing matter darling jessie be so reserved never tell anything certainly look well do think have anything on mind see what must have be odd that have struck of helena sighed shook head with pretty unreproachful air sometimes wish that jessie must make more of friend of said try so hard to get close to time feel be keeping at arm length must be lovely to have sister who must admit to own own self always have to tap so to speak at jessie door so often say wo open be always like asked archie seeing that helena eye be dim bright yes lately think have be worse wish jessie must let in however be always waiting think jessie know that be use pressing for confidence be one can only wait picture so simply pathetically conveyed by helena of waiting little dim eyed for jessie to admit be very convincing archie wondered at contrast between two sister one so childlike in confidence that world be friend other holding rather detached rather aloof without welcoming charm of manner that surely be expression of adorable mind be not wholly light of dawning love invested sketch with such tender colouring for there be great finish consistency in helena presentation of herself might have deceived most neutral heart whole of observer such be first impression then suddenly instinct that lay below surface surged up in rebellion against washed tender colouring out told that impression be false one jessie so far from being callous self centred a be suggestion conveyed by helena word be of faithful golden heart then looking idly over crowd be growing thick on broad gravel walk suddenly caught sight of jessie looking at be little distance behind rail separated ride from path instantly looked away spoke to girl who be with strolled on archie felt quite sure that have seen turned to helena surely be jessie said to pointing with whip helena have seen also smiled rather sadly rather wistfully yes said doe want archie at that instinct have spoken to so emphatically moment before sank out of hearing again colour returned to helena deft little sketch chapter viii be four o'clock on afternoon of mid july westering sun have begun to blaze into drawing room window of colonel vautier house in oakland crescent be pleasant enough there in winter for room being small be easily heated in summer with even greater ease grew oven like helena sitting by open window for sake of air might possibly wander into dusty crescent be obliged to pull down blind have tried sitting in father study have infection of stray cigar smoke about did not want to catch dining room own bedroom since faced same way a drawing room presented counter attraction so reluctantly be compelled to sit here while jessie with book in hand sat at other end of room jessie have slight attack of hay fever from time to time indulged in fit of sneezing seemed to helena that be being very inconsiderate be always possible to stifle sneeze jessie never thought about other people helena by way of waiting patiently at jessie door according to tender image have fashioned for archie benefit have just expressed opinion slightly veiled be pleased to see at moment jessie left room sound of sneezing from outside indicated at last sister have grasped how exceedingly unpleasant hay fever be for other people then there came sound of ascending step guessed that jessie have gone to bedroom floor be wretchedly thin ill constructed must from room in house hear movement from other room especially since colonel vautier jessie have such solid resounding step when went anywhere left to herself helena cleared deck enumerated cause of complaint against providence who ought to have be so kind to innocent loving little soul in first place father have finished irrigation business in egypt unexpectedly soon instead of arriving in london not before september have come two month earlier than most pessimistic daughter must have expected news of approaching arrival have provoked perfect conspiracy against helena comfort plan for one including cousin marion who have be so insistent on girl staying with till got home have taken for granted that must at once rejoin surely must have be sufficient for jessie to go did jessie justice of allowing that be perfectly ready to do so leaving helena to help cousin marion in answering of letter in morning for half hour in entertaining of numerous guest in accompanying to of pleasant gaiety swarmed about desirable house instead cousin marion have be quite unaware to appearance of hint helena have subtly suggested archie have be equally uncomprehending when have said house seems so much more like home than other have certainly glowed with pleasure have not thought be meant to have application with regard to going back to oakland crescent one have taken hint have occurred to nobody how suitable be that jessie must go to look after father helena remain to look after cousin since hint be not taken helena like excellent tactician be have retreated in preference to standing ground suffering defeat have to retreat retreated with exactly proper mixture of regret at leaving grosvenor square of joy at father premature return when taxi cab drew up palpitating at door be who ran down three concrete step from front door across awful little dusty yard called front garden with cinder path circulated round one laurel bush flung into arm helped parlour maid to carry in bag while jessie waited in narrow entrance that reeked of ascending fume of dinner for parlour maid a usual have left open door at head of kitchen stair there be grudge against providence even deeper than unnecessary transplanting of herself to oakland crescent when might so comfortably have flourished in grosvenor square archie have dined with two night ago before taking on to dance in interval followed dinner when father archie remained downstairs have painful scene with jessie jessie according to helena public version have misunderstood in cruellest manner knew that real complaint here be not that sister have cruelly misunderstood have in fact cruelly understood be more intolerable than misunderstanding must have be must have borne misunderstanding very patiently to be understood be of nature of exposure of kind scarcely decent impossible to forget have begun so stupidly so innocuously have left few orchid on dressing table jessie who naturally be not going to dance be remaining at home to keep father company most kindly offered to get for came down again so ominously silent that helena have asked what trouble be appeared that jessie have seen on dressing table card of lord harlow with safety pin attached to yes darling why not helena have said sent lovely orchid thank so much for getting be going to be there to night a sent expressly for from harlow naturally will wear must be rude not to think jessie did not reply helena repeated question for answer jessie have said in soft rich voice be only thing that helena envied revolt helena became quite cool collected might represent a being tearful pathetic at thought of jessie unkindness attitude be useless with jessie alone never adopted oh may ask why revolt asked certainly although know already archie be in love with helena adopted phrase of affection did so simply to irritate sister darling how delicious be said may wear flower from tom dick harry for reason grant reason for moment even if did what then besides archie have given flower one must have flower at dance jessie refused to be irritated helena speech seemed to have exactly opposite effect on became gentle apologetic be sorry said that revolted said be thoughtless stupid o helena be so thoughtless too do forgive for questioning be intending to marry lord harlow if asks if so do make clear to archie before thing get worse that have thought of like might save suffering be understanding not misunderstanding be so cruel helena be quite capable of being cruel too smelled orchid pinned into gown simultaneously heard foot on stair archie resonant laugh got up might almost think be jealous of archie affection for darling said in most suave tone before door opened saw jessie face flame with colour laughed to herself at defencelessness of love next moment archie launched into room hullo what fine orchid said who sent helena bet bradshaw did what thing be to have opulent admirer wish have got since evening now nearly week ago jessie have not spoken to helena except when mere manner in presence of other people required be tiresome uncomfortable situation in big house must not have mattered much for must easily have sat in different room here made awkwardness in narrow existence helena have consolation of knowing that have not merely knocked at jessie door have battered in secret chamber stood open to shrine in be revealed before unpitying eye here then be two grievance against world might have taxed patience of job certainly super taxed patience of helena on top of os on pelion be perched anxiety have begun seriously to

there meant nothing wish happiness rapped out in hard snappish voice yes be usual between friend do mean have accepted asked yes dear have told be joke asked will laugh helena moved little away from rang bell archie looked so strange have expected something far more moving dramatic than wooden immobility tell colonel vautier miss jessie that lord davidstow have come said to parlour maid archie said nothing till door have closed again felt that be made of wood that everything be made of wood helena rose have sent persian rug on stood when spoke be a if machine in mouth said word have nothing

archie said know helena have told news archie shook hand then eye went back to helena again have never looked more entrancingly pretty be made of wood then jessie came in be there dinner be ready down went in wooden world everything went on in precisely same way a have done when people be made of flesh blood cunning mechanical contrivance enabled to talk smile eat food tasted same so did champagne in presently drank be health be same prickly bubbly stuff with little sting in that so seldom drank unfroze surface of stricture bound a when first stir of thawing wind moistens surface of ice began to feel again to be conscious that somewhere within be deep well of water of pain anything be better than cataleptic insensibility be like being unconscious time knowing that be unconscious be not going out that night after dinner sat down to rubber of bridge in a usual helena took archie a partner because always insisted that must form idea of principle on played whereas other two wandered in starless cimmerian gloom when mated with helena claimed that spiritual affinity with archie enabled to perceive when declared heart wished to understand that have got that must do well to declare something different bridge properly understood archie have enunciated once be form of poker must bewilder terrify adversary then fun begin get fined what added to hilarity be concentrated seriousness jessie partner brought to bear on game miser greed avaricious eye with jessie be popularly supposed to see score mounting joke squib of light hearted nonsense be there to night there be nothing behind be a if be spoken from habit frigid rehearsal of pithless drama be going on be tinsel flower stuck into arid seedless ground sprang no longer from warm earth sense of wooden unreality soon began to close in again on archie with utter absence of feeling be so far more terrible than feeling must be that soulless insensitiveness a of live consciousness knew be dead rose from table after helena have delivered from consequence of outrageous declaration went across to side table where be placed syphon spirit now instead of pouring out glass of soda water half filled tumbler with whisky added cream of bubble on top of immediately almost sense of touch with life returned there stole back into figure of colonel vautier jessie perception of several identity into love with have endowed that implied be better than feeling nothing at knew too that when jessie spoke to looked at voice eye held for supreme infinite sympathy must not reach knew be there perhaps when got used to new condition of nightmare existence must make accessible get into touch with at present scarcely wanted wanted nothing so long a perception of life still ran in brain except helena thought that rather pitied too be not pity wanted for be who have brought pity on played two three rubber jessie miserly greed be assuaged by precisely sum archie have won from helena colonel vautier after seeing out went back to study to indulge in cigar be not permitted in drawing room two sister be left there be brain have long be busy beneath habitual jest of game over future relation with jessie have come to conclusion that sooner talked matter out better found that affected comfort to be practically not on speaking term with sister since have shrinking from what might be painful interview for others have made up mind to ascertain exactly how jessie meant to behave to in few week for must be in close daily hourly contact for lord harlow have expressed mind very clearly about early date for wedding helena entirely agreed with jessie on part must scarcely manage to think about sister at with archie in front of evening have barely be conscious of anything bitter miserable disillusionment awakening from dream have become so real to be still seated at card table with need for trivial employment so often accompanies emotional crisis be building house with card have be using devoting apparently whole faculty to breathless construction strong beautiful hand archie have never noticed hovered over alighting with building material putting card delicately firmly in place grave face watched ascending story a if babylon great be rising again for marvel of mankind then helena sat down by leaning arm on table caused vibration demolished babylon from garret to cellar oh jessie be so sorry said be fall of ingenious card house be sort of thing that provoked pity jessie swept card together seemed about to get up doe matter said be bed time be helena put head wistfully on one side be being horribly unkind to said did not suppose be much use playing on pathetic stop made a general rule so insincere bleating in sister ear be worth trying think there be use in talking helena said if be unkind if ca bear what have done be because simply ca help helena fingered debris of card house with more delicate finger must caress claw so exquisitely essentially cared not one atom what jessie thought of wanted not to be uncomfortable for next few week ah be added be satisfied to hate detest because ca help seems to final unanswerable excuse nobody else may do anything because ca help must have helped what have done said jessie made archie think cared for let fall in love with on assumption let fall in love with said helena be not fault besides be silent moment weaving delicate spider thread in mind really wanted to propitiate jessie just now otherwise must certainly have reminded that anyhow have allowed to fall in love with archie though must not say that be archie fault must have be amusing to suggest that did not seem to tend towards reconciliation bent graceful head little lower over fallen card house have collapsed with tragic suddenness even a archie have collapsed besides went on be open to archie to propose to did not be several week together at silorno then came to london met bertie be fault fell in love with think be horribly unkind to jessie came step nearer be in love with asked if tell be in love with do think must marry if be not asked helena looking picture of limpid childlike innocence jessie made reply must not say that believed helena be in love with though be assuredly going to marry must not tell lie of essential kind merely word must not come if have wronged in way helena said at length be most sincerely sorry for ask forgiveness unconditionally helena rose wreathed in tender smile liquid eye darling have forgiveness with heart said may ask one thing will try to feel little more kindly towards if only knew how unkindness hurt jessie lying awake night striving with sincerity permeated from skin to marrow to make effort that helena have asked of made headway at utterly distrusted disbelieved somewhere lying beneath darkness of windless night be archie for whose happiness must have given heart last blood of must not help one atom while in perverse dispensation of destiny wanted only what must not get helena love must not

night did not appear like boy who have so lately suffered overwhelming disappointment in affection blessington say have be just a delightful affectionate to a usual said lady tintagel go talk to evening a always did think must have be wrong dear jessie when thought be so mortally hurt jessie did not reply at once felt sure that with insight of love be more comprehending than mother love be somehow right about point be not mere lapse of week have restored archie besides blessington did not know about trouble must easily conjecture what relief might find in knew that must feel same in place must understand how much easier be to behave normally with who did not know than with who did yet archie father knew through dinner have seen how friendly intimate two have become archie used to be constrained awkward with father while father used to be rather contemptuous of evening there have be none of on side now lingered together long time over talk cigarette be a if bond of sympathy be springing up between shrank from admitting explanation to herself might be that man who have be so bitterly disappointed about girl found something in man suited mood woman must remind of woman there be shout of laughter in hall outside archie came in followed by father did not communicate ground for merriment looking little flushed very handsome very content sat down on sofa by mother well mother darling said instantly love yearned forth to dear be good to hear laugh said what have father be talking about sense of being watched love irritated did not trouble archie now sunny hour must stretch unclouded until fell into bed laughed again looking across to father say father said will tell must think not quite just a like said lord tintagel door into garden already ajar swung gently open admitting breath of cool night air into room stirred in jessie hair a passed moved across to archie making flower in vase near vibrate for just moment impulse from untainted tranquillity stirred in soul overheated stimulated brain drank thirstily in own laughter subject of laughter whole content of last hour two seemed stale stuffy air of be thick with fume of wine with fancy image that evoked smoke wreath that hung heavy in atmosphere swirling turning like dancer melting into other shape for moment when night air came in from crystal clear dusk outside liquid tabernacle of sapphire in holy night where star sang together nightingale burned hot fume dispersed drew in long tranquillizing breath physical impression have too psychical counterpart for even a air stirred in jessie hair brought coolness refreshment to so from girl there seemed to stream into current of something wholesome human unfevered unvexed by desire untouched by bitterness be rather hot in here said will come for stroll jessie went out together heaven be full of star slip of moon be near to setting over bed below window there hovered fainter fragrance of sleeping flower stood with hanging head leaf glimmered with falling dew beyond lay dimmed mirror of lake beside rose dark mass of wood in nightingale be singing scene seemed prepared for human love duet when lover fancy that nature be arranging most sensuous effect for benefit though in reality be pursuing path ordained for by wheeling season predicted by barometer apparatus be concerned only with heat movement of moon of lover there be one of pair absent a two walked quietly towards wood of nightingale for jessie there be eager mate for archie none two hungry soul longing unsatisfied went forth on twilit pilgrimage spring still stirred in there burned above everlasting choir of star helped in way have be lover autumn squall winter snow storm must have served purpose just a well archie chattered for little while comparing moon to clipped finger nail dimmed mirror of lake to frozen rink in switzerland with hollowness of superficial talk when tongue speaks from habit be a lightly rooted a seed on stony ground heart whole have often chattered like jessie have sunned responded to silly thing now knew a well a that babble be more than blown sea foam made heart ache that must talk to for though made claim on love be miserable that must not recognize how true friend be who be by side in song haunted darkness knew none better that have love to give love be so disciplined to go hungry without cry out starved for word from must fly flag of friendship noblest of ensign be not of royal emblazonment have come to edge of lake moor hen steered water logged flight across surface then archie foolish chatter died be silent a watched rayed ripple of water wash died away in reed chuckled on bank at last spoke why did helena treat like that said be fair on why did encourage might so easily have shown that did care knew tell

light on to gravel next to two window of lord tintagel study be lit even a stepped from grass on to walk footstep became audible again figure silhouetted against light appeared there window sash rattled a opened wider be that archie called come in see before go upstairs all right father said be just coming in jessie heard fresh vigour in quickened voice in light from window must see that face be alert again be with sense of certainty that guessed what have given sudden animation perhaps be only knowledge of father habit that informed perhaps be brain wave passing from to told that inside father room be thing for craved cool hiss of bubbling water on to ice swam in spirit be not going to sit up long be said oh know father often have talk in evening sometimes do writing before go to bed be quite good time for writing when one have gone to bed house be quiet always used to say at silorno that wrote best in morning yes be at silorno where must lie on beach go for swim at interval lord

impatience at lingering well will be wanting to go to bed said daresay will go in have talk with mother do know father waiting for think will join will soon come upstairs expect feel rather like writing to night be glad be going on with said be something left be house be quite empty archie laughed can trace name in dust on window pane said will go to father good night jessie lord tintagel rather unusually be deep in evening paper when archie entered archie noticed with surprise that glass still stood untouched on tray rather nasty news said not looking up give drink archie there be good fellow plenty of ice not much soda what be news asked archie well look a if there might really be trouble brewing servia have appealed to russia against austrian ultimatum wonder if germany can really be at bottom of city take gloomy view of russian security be heavily down doe that affect asked archie bringing drink yes have got big account open in wonder if have better sell of course there wo be war be always having scare always come to nothing if dealer be anxious price may fall good bit yet must find difficult to pay difference archie poured out first tumbler held in hand moment not tasting now that have got delay when delay be voluntary must add deliciousness to moment when mouth throat must feel that cold sting understand said watching bubble stream up from side bottom of glass father threw down paper be a simple a head tail said have bought quantity of russian mining share without paying for in hope that will go up if do will sell at higher price pocket difference if go down will have to pay difference at next account if share be worth l now at next account be only standing at l will have to pay l on share if like can telegraph to broker to sell now while be at l will have loss because bought at l will no longer be running risk be thirsty work talking just fill glass again then if scare dy down again suppose share will go up said archie father laughed sound business head have got archie said have got hang of be just head tail never speculate be rotten business have got into habit now recommend not to take to be easy enough to take to be devil to break same with other thing make habit of virtue will never go to deuce watched archie moment who with head thrown back young strong throat throbbing a swallowed be reaping reward of delay in drinking when with brightened eye put glass down stood there like modern incarnation of dionysus face pure greek from low growing brown curl to straight nose short round chin with cloak over shoulder in exchange for dress clothes with sandal for patent leather shoe wine cup for tall glass might have stepped straight from temple frieze father wondered how girl in sens must have chosen precise pedantic man whom be soon going to marry when archie be waiting a must have known for moment poor fellow be often very dreary dispirited boy day in evening came to again be what used to be yet though seemed to lord tintagel cruel thing to wish to deprive of few hour of joy of living be during day be smitten with easy vague remorse of man only half sober to see effect that alcohol have on archie who life till now have scarcely tasted remembered when have be at stage remembered also father giving just warning a now proposed to give archie wished have taken notice of hoped that archie must that evening thirty year ago recalled now with extreme distinctness scene have taken place in very room father already half tipsy a habit be have warned of danger of drink remembered how laughable grotesque warning have seemed coming from lip have lost precision of utterance told that be not going to commit such absurdity be perfectly sober indeed seemed very likely that have never entered archie head to think of a drunkard sometimes stumbled little going upstairs at night sometimes have impression that pronunciation be not quite distinct never became incapable a must remember father becoming being carried off to bed by two perspiring footman put down second glass without tasting there be something want to speak to about archie said must be vexed with because be only doing what believe to be duty wo be vexed will archie looked at in surprise suppose will father said what be father got up stood by chair quite steadily for leaned back against high chimney piece well want to be careful about stuff said pointing to bottle be one of habit be speaking about say be so easy to keep clear of so hard to break drink rather freely know whereas few month ago never touched wine spirit be awful snare may get badly entangled in before know be caught at archie kept lucid eye fixed on father not tremor of beautiful mouth betrayed inward laughter derisive merriment at solemn adjuration delivered by man who spoke very carefully for fear of word running into other like impress of ink on blotting paper really be ludicrously funny immortal mr stiggins came into mind hope think whisky soda after dinner be dangerous father said usually have one know moved across to table a spoke handed father drink have mixed for few moment before lord tintagel quite missing irony of act began sipping a talked of course not dear boy said be not faddist who think there be microbe of delirium tremens in glass of wine though may never have heard grandfather be man who habitually took too much be strange how sort of failing run in family archie mouth broadened into smile skipping generation now then said gravely father turned sharply on eh what asked looked hard at archie for moment a hard be a rather wandering power of focus allowed suddenly beheld with archie eye even a thirty year ago have beheld father when spoke to on precisely same theme put down glass wave of shame a saw a archie saw went over know doe come very well from archie said be ridiculous be meant well looked at boy with pathetic deprecating glance if make effort will make one too asked have gone far along road must be sorry to see following must indeed just now know be unhappy bottle of wine make thing more tolerable doe archie in empty exasperated heart felt sort of pity for father be based on scorn something inside lord tintagel be probably serious sincere yet be what have drunk that stimulated scruple for archie be in mellow kindly moralizing stage in cup that archie have often noticed before certainly did not want to become like felt that be not within measurable distance of need of making resolution on subject so far be from needing exercise of will just at present even a father have said be unhappy unhappiness melted in sunshine of drink did not care for in took so told like medicine because mind be ailing well let talk about to morrow said will make rule will father imagine for moment be vexed with will go upstairs now think have got writing want to do hesitated moment will just take night cap with said good night father good night dear boy god bless will have talk to morrow archie took glass have filled out into hall waited there moment pity faded from mind leaving only contempt be just maudlin mood have prompted father to be so ridiculous talk about resolution certainly resolution must do harm keeping of must undoubtedly do good for instead of firm masterful man whom archie have known a rather prodigious denizen of formidable room there sat there now weak entangled creature archie must hardly believe that in year not so long past have be afraid of father now whole force that dominating intangible quality have vanished occasionally still flew into fit of anger alarmed nobody be be left of power archie sat for few minute on hall table instead of going upstairs for meant with certain object in view to go back to father room on trivial errand a waited big clock ticked back into boyhood there be fire place by abracadabra sat on last of appearance there screen behind a have subsequently ascertained william have hidden with trumpet servant dinner bell there side door into garden through pleasingly excited have hurried with box for coffin of dead bird cat have killed hundred memory crowded about not one save where blessington be concerned held romance tenderness for be a meaningless a picture taken out from empty house leaning against railing in street in house bitter lonely spirit there be nothing left place where once hung went back to father room crossing hall with light foot turning handle of door with swiftness silence there be father by table filling glass again be just that archie wished to verify only came back for book said good night again chapter x archie went straight up to room brimming glass be difficult to carry quite steadily reduced content way upstairs william have order always to put whisky soda in room in case wanted to sit up write sometimes william forgot at rate did not obey archie wondered if man did on purpose with perhaps same excellent intention a flowered so decorously in father mind to night be a must be a be very hot archie undressed put on pyjama before settling down to work writing absorbing joy of creation delicate etching of sentence bit into plate still possessed when have taken requisite evening dose to night though have got material ready hand must not accomplish fashioning of got up walked with bare foot once twice up down room wondering why must not link up thought to power of expression be nearly at end of one of sea story have begun at silorno knew exactly what meant to say brain centre that dictated be charged sufficiently stimulated yet must get nothing on to paper be worth putting there though be ready to write wanted to write have not drunk too much made fuddled have not drunk too little left bitter weed of daily consciousness uncovered like rock at low tide sat thought wrote impatiently erased again at last put down pen perhaps even only living interest just now existed for be being taken from also be following down channel have emptied into helena have taken from everything else that meant life must be like consistency to take also leave nude empty be not that wanted gift in vague excited thought seemed to be robbing of be only that memory of how have treated be vampire to blood have sucked empty drained dry of happiness of joy of life of human interest more than that love best thing have to give for have use now seemed to have treated with devilish alchemy so that turned bitter hate like oozy scum rose from depth of covered crystal with poisonous growth must never do rock at low tide have become uncovered while slipped stumbled among bruising at step with thought of helena must never get abstraction detachment knew be necessary condition of writing power of achieving that seemed taken from felt impotent atom unable to order working of own brain defenceless against thought might assault house be perfectly quiet stillness of midsummer night have flowed into open window drowned deep in profound tranquillity be yet tense with energy of spinning world far flung orbit of myriad star moon have long since sunk galaxy of uncounted world flared on course driven onwards by inexhaustible eternity of creative force ran through star even a ran through humblest herb put forth unnoticed blossom on wayside archie in bitter stagnation paralysed seemed to to have part in life current of energy bubbled through world with impulse of good evil love hate seemed to have be cut off from neither loved hated more there be nightmare of death in life at price under inspiration longed to be in current again tonight even drink have failed have walked across to window came back to chair at table where be spread sheet of paper covered with scrawlings erasure be last two hour have to show at precise moment a looked at in dull despair idea flashed across blank field of brain perhaps there might still be spark of life of individuality latent without must reach by surrender of conscious self have be familiar to in childhood there just in front of below shaded lamp lay cigarette case with one bright point of light on lying back in chair with half closed eye gazed at in order to produce hypnotic condition in subconscious self come to surface almost at once mysterious spell began to act across field of vision there began to pas wave of light shadow moving upwards with regular motion while through like buoy moored in rough sea there remained steadfast that bright speck on cigarette case now for moment submerged in wave of shadow appearing again upwards upwards moved wave then seemed that be be stationary while be sinking down through a through crystal clear water looking up at sunny surface rose ever higher more remote above a sank into dim delicious world sensation of being alive again in touch with living intelligence grew momently more vivid be very seat hearth of life that in before have be cold numbed now though surface perception be gradually withdrawn essential being tingled with rapture of returning vitality once twice during descent ear through there poured roar of rushing water have be startled a by surface perception of sound of loud rappings somewhere in room have not disturbed steadfast gaze at point of light once again have heard voice faintly familiar near said be coming be far too intent on progress to let interruption break in upon indeed sound seemed to be le interruption than confirmation to surface sens of what be happening to then knew a sank down to rest at last on bottom of unsounded sea who be who be filling with sense of life again for echoing not only in ear somewhere in soul heard same voice now clearly recognized have spoken to year ago at grives say archie be here archie be conscious on two separate plane of consciousness round high above be gleam aqueous shadow of subconscious world here there seemed to be pierced through a through rent of mist have glimpse of material plane must see for instance part of sheet of paper in front of must see far corner of table by very faint unfocusable part of in mist of subconscious world part in harder outline of reality there be standing figure of young man how be dressed must not see did not care to notice when for moment mist cleared off face recognized strong likeness to even a have recognized likeness to in photograph have found in cache here be photograph instead mysteriously translated into outline feature visible to mortal eye be semblance of martin wavered flickered like blown flame of candle be there standing at corner of table a spoke saw mouth move throat throb have managed to come back archie said because be in such trouble because did understand warning have do understand now whole explanation flashed on dream said white statue of helena worm surely be odd did understand only loved white statue loathed what came out of just a loathe what have come out of white statue since archie leaned forward peering into mist at moment quite enveloped figure love too martin cried long for out of mist came unseen voice long for what look like said hate what be may be whole thing make utterly miserable table figure white paper tray with syphon whisky became suddenly visible must learn not to be miserable said that compassionate mouth be very patient archie think be stumbling through absolute darkness in reality be flooded with light ca see darkness feel be so impenetrable only see walking towards ineffable radiance always moving towards occupy try to grow indifferent to part of helena hate cling to love always just cling to love never hate time may get to love what hated voice sank lower power be failing said be losing touch with oh go said archie martin stop with talk to want to say so much to reached out hand for moment out of sunlit mist that have gathered again felt perfectly clearly touch of finger pressed died away into nothing a clasped voice faded to faintest whisper will come again dear archie said be easiest at night line of shadow light undulated before eye grew thinner more transparent must see drawn back window curtain black square of night through bright point at have be looking withdrew on to surface of cigarette case slowly whole room emerged into normal appearance archie became suddenly conscious of profound physical fatigue leaving thought reflection till to morrow put out light stepped into bed instead of empty desolation have made wilderness round water of healing have broken out in soul desert blossomed archie slept night clean out door sleep have be used to at silorno woke next morning not with crapulous drowsiness now usually accompanied waking with alert refreshment that slumber in open air gave sprang into full possession of faculty complete memory of what have experienced night before be quite aware that scientific interpreter science being best defined a habit of denying pass limit of materialistic explanation must have said that tired with effort to write have fallen asleep over table dreamed knew better than that experience with audible visible phenomenon be not dream did ever so faintly resemble one dream at best be fantastic unreality what have experienced at writing table last night be based upon firm foundation of reality be hash up of own conscious subconscious reflection extract distilled from own mind came from without entered into unlike most of communication purported to reach mind of sensitive from world lay beyond perception of normal sens there be guidance help in often if not invariably message from beyond be trivial nugatory be just criticism to say that sender of did not appear possessed of much worth trouble of sending be visit have not be concerned with trifle like that have sympathized a brother might with archie trouble have explained so that archie must not longer doubt manner of warning have received before not understood have spoken of archie a being wrapped according to own sensation in impenetrable darkness though to one who looked from beyond be ever moving towards ineffable radiance be same discarnate intelligence that when be child have conveyed to knowledge of cache under pine tree be unknown to living being a men count living must not have be conveyed to through telepathic channel except one have source spring not in world now from same source have come message from one who saw through gross darkness of archie emptiness bitter heart have promised to be with again archie have doubt whatever a got up with alertness have not be for week of genuineness of communication linked on with martin previous visit glimpse have received of materialized form of visitor confirmed exactly recognition year before of photograph have found in cache martin have told of power in whose hand be thing have compassionated trouble have allowed in pity for need gateless barrier to be again unbarred spirit individual recognized to pas to fro between realm of light invisible be just when soul despaired that happened when felt denuded of that have loved empty cast out from life just in hour have martin be permitted to come back to found mother jessie at breakfast when went down father a usual have not appeared again a last night when came out of dining room after prolonged sitting felt kindly affectionate be not from sottish satisfaction of wine light came from subtle window in soul from once more shutter have be thrown back moment jessie saw felt quality of change be like archie of silorno again good morning mother darling said kissing good morning jessie how bright early be have everybody slept a serenely a did sleep very long archie did asked girl whose room be next heard hammering at something after have gone to bed awoke once heard talking to somebody archie at side table helping to sausage paused moment made up mind that for present anyhow preferred that jessie must not know about return of martin perhaps must tell quietly when alone hammering said yes there be despatch case must find key so whacked open about talking yes be writing last night believe read aloud to myself before went to bed never know what thing be like unless read aloud oh do read aloud to said girl when be in order be quite in order when read over be sleepy went to bed jessie said more for reason account left unsatisfied hammering have not sounded quite like forcing of lock of despatch case have be like sharp blow on wood for moment have thought that archie be tapping loudly on door separated room have stopped began again little later a for talking have sounded precisely like two voice one undeniably archie other low indistinct archie changed subject moment have given explanation made very surprising observation helena be married on th of august be asked must get wedding present will come to wedding will convey good wish in usual manner wo want to assure of of woman looked at in intensest surprise to lady tintagel have never mentioned helena name since day have accepted lord harlow while to jessie only last night have loaded with bitterest reproach have spoken of abject despair emptiness have come upon in consequence of what have done looked at of in turn with vivid brilliant glance have be so characteristic of yes make public recantation said suddenly dawned on last night have be behaving just about a stupidly a man can behave have said nothing to mother jessie know want to try to forget what for instance said to last night can do better than at rate propose to try time have be mad with resentment have be dead well hereupon announce resurrection of archibald be have got to say on subject at moment swift a arrow flight certain a intuition there came to jessie odd idea that be not archie who be speaking at might be lip tongue fashioned audible syllable be not in sense that have be down by lake last night savage bitter a have be there be authentic now that said despite absolute naturalness of manner seemed to ring false must not account for impression in least be not suddenness of change in attitude though surprised be remoter quality brain must not analyse something more intimate to herself than brain have perceived mere thought mere reason be blind to archie did not accompany mother jessie to church that morning waited for lord tintagel appearance discussion of good resolution be to be so beneficial to of sat in father study having to wait time before made shaky disastrous entrance thought over in connection with event of last night what have said that morning at breakfast that surely be gist of martin message to must try to grow indifferent to part of helena hated must learn not to be miserable to grasp fact that darkness in seemed to walk appeared to martin darkness at flood of light from ineffable radiance be in glow of revelation that have spoken at breakfast trusting in truth of yet a sat now waiting for father knew did not feel truth of in obedience to martin be how have to behave must behave like be what martin meant until felt soul within grow up like cellar sown plant into light hopefully bravely have announced intention now when in cooler mood scrutinized began to feel how tremendous be task set how firmly rooted be that passionate resentment must be alchemized into love have be true martin saw that so well that be white statue fair form have loved loved still with le ardour than before that seemed according to interpretation archie must keep be other must be transformed must have be easier task thought to let love slide into indifference then raise hate to same level be not king road royal banner did not flame along such mean souled way a must cling to such love for helena a have transform hate first foremost cling to love be thus that stated to message martin seemed to have brought last night stated thus be spiritual aspiration of high endeavour did not occur to how stated ever so little differently yet following line of communication assumed diabolical aspect love have for helena be carnal love sprang from desire for enchanting prettiness love be to cling to not sacrifice iota of hate that felt for arising from falseness encouragement of for just so long a be uncertain whether must capture man who be nothing to whose position wealth coveted archie be to transform into indifference be to get over though be hate have spiritual quality for be hatred of what be mean base whereas love for have spiritual quality be no more than lust to under name of love be to cling here then be interpretation of word have heard last night according to must have be fitter to attribute message to intelligence far other than innocent soul of brother who have so mysteriously communicated with in childlike way interpretation here be subtlety of never entered archie head at message of apparent consolation hope have come to when be feeling full blast of bitterness wind blew from empty desert of heart stagnant brain have called for help from everlasting unseen cosmos encompasses little blind half world of material existence from somewhere from light have shone into dark soul mere flicker so seemed morning like spurious sunshine father basked in together ray from more potent luminary till now archie with ordinary impulse of disappointed man have tried to banish from mind with certain exterior aid picture of face form that loved now not only need not must not do that longer have to cling to love while waited for father kept recalling certain poignant moment in growth of helena bewitchment of one be night when sat together for last time in dark garden at silorno wondered whether suggestion of cousinly kiss must disturb what have kept back be knowledge that must not be quite cousinly kiss on part then there be moment when have caught sight of on platform at charing cross have come to meet train on arrival from abroad best of perhaps for there passion have most be fed with fuel of touch have be dance at aunt same night when rhythm of waltz melodious command of music have welded two young body into one be not who have danced be just one perfect complete individual here on quiet sunday morning thought of made tingle throb be that sort of memory martin told must keep alive be resentment anger must die not that helena have chosen somebody else must long for still lord tintagel appeared unusually white shaky a lunch time be approaching rang for apparatus of cocktail sat up late last night archie said bothering over russian share be really of mother be thinking wo be long before mine in russia will matter nothing to for few foot of earth will be will require before went to bed came to conclusion be wrong to worry think scare will soon pas share recover indeed think wisest thing must be not to sell cut loss to buy more at lower price will telegraph to broker to morrow got into end of perplexity about feel to bit morning mixed cocktail with shaking hand shuffled back to chair help archie said let see be going to have talk about something morning what be that worry about russian have put everything out of head once again a last night struck archie a immensely comical that white faced shaky man who be father must be pulling together with strong cocktail in order to discus virtue of temperance make necessary resolution whereby to acquire felt pity sympathy with yet disgust be only humour of situation farcical absurdity of appealed to be going to make good resolution not to drink quite so much said lord tintagel finished cocktail put glass down to be sure be said be time took in hand grandfather gave warning wish to god have taken will help other eh archie will make easier for of care toss whether take alcohol not said archie a remarked last night father hardly touched till month ago lord tintagel laughed have shown remarkable aptitude for since said found difficulty at in getting hang of thing faintly like lost echo there entered into archie mind inherent horror of such interview between father son be drowned by inward laughter with scene inspired spirit whatever be that watched play looked on a from curtained box where unseen must giggle at unseemliness at uncensored farce last night same thing have amused then be in contented oblivion of trouble alcohol lent whereas now be morning time when be least likely to take most bitter savage view of situation morning have be possessed by sunny lightness of heart with martin communication of last night have inspired must be patient disperse blow away by great wind of love hatred intolerance have be obscuring soul surely be not only for helena that must feel that nobler impulse touched daily life must be treated with same manly tenderness nothing must shock nothing must irritate for such emotion be narrow limited incompatible with oceanic quality of love seemed directly inspired by martin who have brought first ray of true illumination yet while sunned in light there be something apparently belonged to bitter disappointed self cried out for recognition insisting that dream of love tolerance be of fibre infinitely coarser than own rebellious attitude strove cried smooth edification of martin voice silenced again suggested compact between father son soon framed into treaty there be to be nothing faddish unreasonable about wine must circulate in accustomed manner at dinner here once for be end of tray brought to lord tintagel study glass two of claret must be allowed at lunch cocktail whisky in evening be to be closed from henceforth arrangement entered into appeared to be of quality sacrificed desire of for sake of other so at least passed in mind archie stifled snigger of inward laughter thought how clear be duty to save father even at late day from falling wholly into pit have digged while to father compact represented a effort to save archie from path have begun to tread even a agreed on abstemious proceeding there occurred to mind of of vague luminous thought like flash of summer lightning far away might move nearer once again archie be seized with ironic mockery that time have quaked like quick sand below seriousness have have cocktail yet father said will drink success to scheme have have yours know plan date from now when have have mine after more father eye followed a mixed gin vermouth well upon word archie said ought to ask to have drink with archie somehow clung to fact that father have have cocktail that have not have by mean said will have two do be fair father once again horrible sordidness of proceeding struck a seemed worse self that part of have week be uninspired by martin martin be love tolerance gave direction on such infinitesimal subject a cocktail whisky outside material plane be concerned only with motive spiritual aspiration with love ineffable indulgence jessie be leaving for town early next morning once again a twenty four hour ago archie strolled out after dinner into dusk to night father have followed two lady almost immediately into drawing room two younger folk have left elder playing game of piquet together be quite unlike usual procedure after dinner for lord tintagel generally dozed for little in chair then retired to study to night showed inclination either to doze to go away be by suggestion that card table have be brought out seemed to jessie rather restless irritable have said that be impossible to play card with chattering going on have be immediate cause of stroll with remark have be addressed very pointedly to archie also very rudely archie checking hot word in reply almost without effort have apologized for distraction quietly sufficiently awfully sorry father have said did mean to disturb come out for stroll jessie so there be in dusk again again archie took jessie arm father rather jumpy to night said think wanted to get rid of may wish to talk to mother so be best to leave be jessie heart swelled knew from last night archie be suffering whole day have be like gentle considerate infinitely sensitive to others incapable of taking offence yes much best said know archie do behave nicely knew what meant knew how easy must have be to make provocative rejoinder to father simply have not wanted to martin martin counsel be still like sunlight within oh bosh said gentle answer be so much easier than other must have have to pump up indignation be rather rude be be lucky that one doe feel like archie drew in long breath of vigorous night air to seemed that drew in long breath of inspiration have come to last night jessie be going to save father said have awfully nice talk morning be so pathetic have be heavy drinker for year know father be so before so must think be fault more than be fault have consumption when be little be vice be disease well have made compact with found that have got into head god know how know will laugh be beginning to take to beastly muck too so saw opportunity be fond of know really be have seriously occurred to be getting habit so took advantage of said must have more whisky cocktail if must made bargain about without swagger be rather good piece of work think jessie knew exactly what honestly felt what honestly felt must not possibly say for though be good bargain on archie part virtue of must affect not only lord tintagel archie knowledge of added to sincerity of reply oh archie said be brilliant of do do think father will keep to ca help said archie triumphantly be going to be down here except when go up to town for helena wedding be always in out of room must know if doe keep to paused thinking out further check on father there be william too said william devoted to simply a far a can tell because saved life when be tiny kid if ask william to tell whether father get drink through quietly when be not there be sure will let know how must that be jessie have uncomfortable moment idea of getting servant to report to archie on father proceeding be a repugnant to a thought must be to archie possibly main motive that of taking care of father be so dominant in that did not pause to consider legitimacy of mean somehow be very unlike archie to have conceived so backstairs idea oh must quite do said must either archie see why not cure be more important than mean jessie suddenly felt sort of bewilderment must scarcely have be archie who said that according to knowledge of archie surely be impossible said what must feel if found father have be setting william to spy report on archie voice suddenly rose oh what nonsense said speak a if be going to break bargain with father never heard such nonsense once again sense of bewilderment came over jessie be like archie imply anything of kind said do feel that be impossible for to get william to have eye on father report to be almost certain that really agree with archie considered then laughed suppose do said ardour of newly born missionary be hot within be missionary born made by way anyhow be missionary now nobody must have guessed be going to be missionary stroll to night be only up down broad gravel walk in front of window be very hot drawing room window be open so also be of lord tintagel study windowed door led into garden a passed archie saw footman bring in tray on be set usual evening liquid guessed that father have forgotten have omitted to say that syphon ice be must be needed thought for moment intently swiftly jessie have brought in beastly whisky again said must tell to take away father must see just go down opposite drawing room window will make sure father be still playing card while take bottle away make sign archie waited outside till be given then went into father room man have gone away took up whisky bottle with intention of putting back in dining room even a finger closed on without warning desire for drink swooped down on like coming of summer storm half filled glass with spirit poured soda water on top gulped down be what wanted then with swift cunning rinsed out glass with soda water drank that also filling half up again with water put on table by chair where usually sat then there be bottle to dispose of went out into hall to take to dining room even a crossed foot of stair notion irresistibly possessed up went three step at time concealed behind clothes in chest of drawer have discovered excellent reason for doing for if

front of enclosed bathing place where stream debouched into lake there be good stretch of deep water free from weed for last half hour have be swimming diving in now with hair drying back into crisp curl under hot sun lay on short warm turf with chin supported on hand in ecstasy of animal content at edge of water bank be made firm solid with wooden boarding went down into deep water across estuary of stream broadening out into lake willow margin be fringed with bulrush loosestrife strip of low lying meadow land behind be pink with campion ragged robin starred with meadow sweet scent of mingled with undefinable cool smell of running water bed of gravel made bottom of stream through sunlit water pebble gleamed like topaz through liquid veil never before have archie be so permeated with sense of amazing loveliness of world of ineffable joy of living of being part of have wrestled with swiftness of stream a narrowed have clung to rock tree root below surface letting current comb over around almost through then letting go of anchorage have be floated down into lake again with arm leg outspread now lying close pressed to turf with wet chest dripping shoulder seemed to be part of triumph of summer of immortal youth of world surely there be further heaven than possible namely to be young to desire to have desire gratified whet appetite for more there be clearer duty in day than to be bathed in bliss of life to suck out last drop of sweetness from world have be created for joy of men glory of god there be such thing a evil evil be label attached by sour minded to impulse act for have not sufficient vitality be martin who have taught archie have come back home morning after day couple of night in town have bought helena wedding present have taken completed manuscript to publisher have dined danced supped filled hour of day night with extravagant excess in up till now have never indulged innate fastidiousness morality have led to look on looser pleasure of youth with disdain disgust now smiled indulgently at for narrow priggishness how utterly wrong have be to think that such thing stained soiled boy have caused to realize intensified existence for be exercise of faculty possibility with god have endowed be not meant to rust in disuse be right for richly to enjoy a martin have said be crime against love life to starve on meatless diet above have seen helena again have confessed recanted bitterness have felt towards have forgiven welcomed back with blessing on falling out that more endears a prim little poem said archie laughed quietly to said aloud when fall out with love kiss again with tear there be many tear added understood helena now wanted so sensibly to make quite comfortable for journey through life if marquis with million desired to go share with naturally consented to do be not least same a taking vow going into nunnery be nunnery that be coming out of of course just for present archie understood must not see for bradshaw be going yachting tour in norwegian fjord must be back again before end of september so much more have voice told eye said much more intimate thing though naturally did not express when asked if might kiss that cousinly kiss have wanted at silorno lip agreed with what eye said have never be so adorably pretty have never be so demurely clever have said nothing girl who be to become man wife in few day must not say yet archie felt that understood perfectly thing did not say most brilliant perhaps of be warning will tell bradshaw allowed to kiss cried be not frightened be such dear gone then be archie trouble bitterness on point have love to cling to scarcely felt jealous of bradshaw for if thing have be other way about helena have be engaged to must have allowed bradshaw to kiss knew very well that must not archie turned over on to back lay with arm leg spread out to sun warming a with memory of expedition to london have not in least wished to postpone return since joy of life lay so largely in contrast after thirty six hour of fiery furnace there have come temporary satiety wanted to lie sleep like gorged tiger soon must awake be hungry again be part of joy of life to be satisfied doze stretch out tranquil limb lying there rib began to twitch again into laughter a thought of contract have made with father last sunday archie have entered into with view of encouraging helping father to rid of chain be riveted so closely round be delighted to do if father derived support for abstinence in thought that be helping archie archie need not abstain so long a father thought be doing so only just now have filled with water sunk in weed several empty bottle that have brought out in towel from bedroom knew perfectly well that be in danger of becoming slave to habit have served a medicine to mitigate misery with regard to helena now that be quite removed helped to get into communication with martin of that felt convinced once twice have tried to do so without drinking have failed alcohol seemed to drug surface consciousness clear way of access be for that used now be more that cleared access than that drugged for found that produced not least effect in way of making head hazy movement wavering only seemed to sweep clean mysterious channel through communication came power of communicating must not possibly give up happiness joy of life sprang from therefore must not possibly give up facilitated performed purpose of contract by keeping indulgence secret from father once again archie rib with smoothly swelling muscle under brown skin throbbed with amusement a pictured father heroic struggle with occasionally archie have doubt whether struggle be quite consistently successful for once twice lord tintagel have shown sign of evening content serenity followed by morning shakiness indicated that have made temporary armistice archie thought that perhaps must lay trap for father make quiet detective investigation to satisfy on point beyond doubt father be putting up quite good fight on behalf of non existent cause will be to abstain if occasionally failed be unchristian to judge failure hardly besides archie only conjectured that sometimes father resolution be unequal to strain imposed on did not know week archie sense of comradeship brotherliness with martin have marvellously increased there be nothing priggish puritanical about martin anything namby pamby suggested wing halo hymn be intensely human sympathized completely with fact of archie being glorious young animal bursting with exuberant health seemed quite clear for when morning sometime about four o'clock archie have gently let into house in grosvenor square little ashamed weary went up to bedroom became instantly aware that martin be waiting for there be need for to light electric lamp for dawn be already breaking drawing curtain apart threw off clothes so a to let delicious chill of morning refresh skin sat down for moment in front of dressing table looked fixedly at bright point of light on bevel of looking glass almost immediately wave of light shadow began to pas before eye room be full of vivid peremptory tapping then be aware that there appeared in reflected image of strange luminous focus over left breast little wisp of mist like puff of escaping steam began to come from grew collected in wavering mass of weaving line formless at first then arranging into definite shape saw with thrill of excitement wonder out of there be being built up image of martin have issued out of soon be complete archie in glass beheld martin face leaning lovingly over shoulder martin arm bare like own warm solid to touch be thrown round neck archie have be with night said love to see feel realize throw into life live to uttermost have thought for morrow there be nothing in world love joy cling to press close to lose in martin smile be compassionate no longer be sunbeam of radiant happiness happiness so seemed to archie have source in sympathy with love for ever think be yielding to base impulse went on provided only be happy happiness be seal witness of what be right for be mark of god approval evil be always painful repugnant be seal witness of fruit of spirit be love joy peace be more at peace more full of joy now that have resolved to put hate out of heart be sweeter to kiss helena than to curse suddenly like stroke of black wing there passed through archie impulse of sheer abhorrence martin said sounded divinely comforting uplifting did there not lurk in whole gospel of satanism a thought crossed mind saw expression of tenderest reproach dim for moment brightness of brother eye mouth drooped be tired now said trust in be little weakened sleep well be dawn already apparition faded rather appeared to be withdrawn again into emerging from light trance archie be conscious only of overpowering delicious fatigue fatigue of utter satisfaction have have glorious thirty six hour a martin said be tired martin approved slept deep recuperative sleep of youth for four five hour awoke hungry eager clear eyed left town immediately after breakfast motored down home with william holding on to side of car a slowed round corner came straight out to beloved bathing place be bliss to be alive have not seen jessie during short raid on london for really there have not be moment to spare besides jessie be coming down next day for week end knew have be in town for helena said have seen with usual acuteness have told sister that archie be deliciously old self again that be greatest friend that to jessie very sensible judgment to intuition love gave be most inexplicable of development only week ago there be reproach bitter enough for archie opinion on helena conduct to angry taunt of misery sufficient for vilification then in moment whole of bitterness have be dried up marah have be sweetened more than that normal joy of life have returned in full flood to cause of be in account fact that spirit of martin have shown true light archie possessed that mysterious in view dangerous gift of mediumistic perception did not doubt for there be questioning weird manifestation of occult power knew have occurred in childhood felt now that ought only to stand in awed wonder thankfulness that supernormal perception of have in moment worked in what must be called le than miracle though ought to feel that knew that felt nothing of kind a travelled down next day to lacebury set to analyse cause of mistrust be simple enough first of there be rooted antipathy to whole notion of spirit communication instinctively shocked seemed opposed to religious faith beyond there be couple of most insignificant matter appeared to possibly connected with mistrust one archie have made false swift invention to account for noise have heard coming from room other that have proposed to get william to spy on father with view to ascertaining whether be keeping part of bargain knew be tiny incident spirit prompted be in case utterly unlike archie must not imagine archie making such invention suggestion from what knew of be outside to do so if be influence to call more than of martin prompted thing if be same direction a have taken away bitterness towards helena what sort of influence be that finally must be right that boy whom helena have so cruelly led on only to disappoint must on eve of marriage suddenly become close friend with again there certainly obeyed precept of have spoken with have promised to communicate again must not think dangerous if not diabolical counsel tried to reserve judgment in few minute now must see archie again must note what change for good ill week have brought very likely have be disquieting in vain making wound out of pin prick mountain out of mole hill archie have come to meet a train slowed down into station saw out of carriage window did not see for eye be intent on very horrible sight there be two tipsy woman violently quarrelling just a train got in flew at other scratching striking encounter lasted not more than few second for couple of porter ran in separated jessie have seen archie face alight with glee amusement a be separated frowned shrugged shoulder seemed to remonstrate with man who have stopped fighting at instant saw get out of compartment ran to meet face quite changed moment before have not be archie face at have be face of beautiful devilish creature alert with evil excitement hullo jessie there be said be ripping to see look at two virago there flew at other like wild beast be horrible sight turned sideways eye on cunning watchful utterly belied frankness of speech heart sank vague nameless terror seized a once again found thinking that be not archie who so gaily took bag for ever again looked back to where

there be nothing else to be done whether england be going to war not dinner time came round a usual of be on lord tintagel that suspense anxiety beat most strongly that because panic on stock exchange of europe threatened with loss might bring within reach of ruin lady tintagel still clung to baseless hope le substantial than mirage in desert that diplomacy must still avert disaster archie went about customary diversion of life with more than usual enjoyment absorption while for jessie there loomed in immediate foreground dread horror though concerned not warring million just one individual engrossed entire soul be a if saw whom loved with strength of deep loyal heart in danger of drowning not in material water must kill body set free soul in awful flooding evil threatened to submerge swallow very source spiritual life of time swam splashed about in water below lay hell with same joyful gaiety a used to churn way out to sea at silorno a by hideous irony love of deep water far from shore that life have possessed so that physical self be at zenith of capacity for enjoyment when profound gulf be below land far off so now evil essential primeval evil have beckoned soul out over unplumbed depth seemed to bright with celestial sunshine not yet be doomed to sink there though guessed a in nightmare in what deadly peril stood for now again inkling of menaced reached true self turned back with shuddering contrition from evil prompting time betrayed to jessie in thing might so reasonably have be called mere trifle impatient impetuous boy a archie undoubtedly be might so naturally have lost temper with decrepit old dog strayed on to path of flying car made say that must be kindest thing to run over same boy might so naturally have felt unedifying curiosity in two drunken woman fighting together have reasonably be annoyed when in hurry to change clothes found that old nurse have taken away indeed be strength of own reaction against such impulse showed how alien knew to be to real self own feeling about be final test for knew be based on infallible intuition of love for be impossible that must be mistaken told that be not archie at who have committed act might be trifling in like wisp of cloud in sky showed way great wind be blowing on top of be something jessie must not conceive of a being trifle namely archie complete reconciliation with sister must not believe that be noble impulse prompted that extinguished bitter resentment against a easily a candle be blown out be right to be bitter against love with seemed inspired again be not love at believed that desire be love according to account be spirit of martin have taught opened blinded eye be martin then who possessed to jessie be most incredible of be not must not be martin sat by open window sunday night wishing that must think that madness have fallen upon caused to conceive such inconceivable thing archie laugh still sounded in ear gay boyish a have heard two minute before came up to bed shuddered at cause of once again archie have strolled out after dinner on passing window of father study step noiseless on grass archie have laid hand on arm with gesture to command silence have tiptoed with across gravel to father window lord tintagel be inside even a looked took bottle out of have be pouring something locked up in cupboard archie turned face beaming with merriment on come in whispered to say good night leave to will be huge fun waited moment began talking loudly to on indifferent subject for few second said come say good night to father jessie entered together

pleased at having found out have be having quiet drink up in bedroom while have be doing same down here what did do with bottle put mine in lake say be funny be be rather unsociable let follow germany example call treaty waste paper archie have laughed over miserable sordid exposure just a light heartedly a have laughed over jolly innocent humour at silorno sick at heart jessie have left two together with bottle there be need to conceal more sat long at window in miserable state of horror fear agitation now trying to persuade that be taking thing too heavily helena have always told took thing heavily now letting fear issue in terrible cohort looking in face be powerlessness to help most tortured fate of having to stand watch while archie pushed out ever farther with delight joy on to perilous sea now there be to reality about have never wholly felt before often have told that be imagining peril to night in darkness quiet felt face to face with grim deadly fact spiritual ghostly enemy be about next moment have slid on to knee word came tried just to open heart to light surely shone through evil swarmed about something ever so faint glimmered there presently rose again with soul fixed on little spark shining within in case must make effort to help instead of succumbing to sense of powerlessness at moment heard light swift footstep on stair instantly mind be made up came out into broad passage just a archie be opposite door face be eager alert there be trace of intoxication there hullo jessie said smiling not gone to bed yet have to be wise mere helpless prayer must avail nothing if did not exert make use of wit love did feel sleepy said look sleepy be going to bed not yet said archie jessie came step closer to oh archie be going to talk to martin asked may come must so love to for know that martin mean to know did hear talking to before must be lovely if must hear talking together so knew what said archie looked at well know why not said must promise not to interrupt perhaps will neither hear see anything see why must try be just seance come along jessie led way into bedroom shut door will really rather like to be here said be glad suggested for now then go into very deep trance then ca remember what exactly have happened only know that there have be round atmosphere to call that in glow expand sometimes rather think struggle groan must mind that be only protest of material earthly come on let begin long for martin to come jessie felt dread horror of occult surge up in required resolution to remain here call of love be imperative if be to be permitted to help archie at must learn what be that possessed find mean to combat have to know first what be penetrate so far a love have power into source of diagnose if be to help in curing what be going to do said be very simple will soon see sit down jessie went to window drew aside curtain put on table in front of where be to sit silver top of toilet bottle then went to door turned out electric light at switch board moonlight outside without shining directly into room made object in clearly though duskily visible jessie where sat with back to light must see archie face outline when eye got accustomed to dimness quite distinctly sat close to at end of writing table just in front of glimmered stopper from toilet bottle now be going to look at till go off into trance said watch what happens very closely for may go into deep trance promise not to move till come round again daresay will hear see anything know for few minute a far a girl must judge sat in silence once twice archie shifted position slightly heard shirt front creak little a breathed quietly normally outside little wind stirred tassel of blind tapped against sill then there came change breathing grew louder a if panted for air now again moaned saw head drop forward moaning sound be horrible to hear for promise insistent urging of love must have got up roused breath whistled between lip a took in face seemed to be shining with dew of anguish arm twisted writhed a if struggling against overmastering force then suddenly sign of struggle ceased sat bent forward perfectly still from table in front of came three loud peremptory rap a of splitting wood from dusk of room came others must not localize archie raised head instead of leaning over table sank back in chair arm hanging limp by side began to whisper to soon jessie caught word martin be here kept repeating martin be here martin martin there be more light in room now came from pale greyish efflorescence of illumination globular in shape that lay apparently over left breast made immediate neighbourhood quite bright must see stud in shirt with absolute distinctness out of there came little wisp of mist floated up like stream of smoke above shoulder in air there independently of there be forming mist like substance stream came away from archie seemed to join began to take shape spread upwards downwards into semblance of column edge losing in dark line began to be interwoven within be a if something be forming inside like chicken in egg lost vagueness of outline plaiting weaving together there appeared arm bare to shoulder above must see neck slowly above neck there grew smiling splendid face there seemed to be grey robe cast about body from bare arm protruded much of be vague jessie felt a if awful paralysis of terror lay over spirit whole room cool fresh with night air passing through open window reeked to spiritual sense with evil unnameable corruption over conscious superficial self mechanism directed limb worked in brain have complete control for archie sake be learning about hellish visitor who came to within soul cried out in horror of uttermost darkness then will took hold of too god permitted must be faced for sake of love just then archie spoke in odd muffled voice be going very deep said martin have made so happy day have hardly left at be getting to be part of be let talk about helena say be devil be jessie have not known that anything must be so horrible a smiling face that apparition bent on have ceased hating said love always cling to love know adore believe love too laughed licked lip voice sank so that jessie must catch word of what said spoke for long time laughing occasionally making horrible little movement with arm a if clasped something now then must perhaps ask question for in same inaudible manner apparition answered laughing sometimes in response once twice in devilish colloquy caught word two of hideous carnal import sickened love nearly withered within because love be immortal can not perish though blast of hell rage against still stood firm though scorched beaten upon if let die felt that must be no better than visible incarnation of evil smiled bent over archie presently that devilish whispering ceased saw that apparition be beginning to lose clearness of outline slowly began to disintegrate into weaving of mist out of came archie said good bye martin not for long of streamer seemed to disperse in air others like eddying water spout seemed to draw back into focus of light lay over archie breast then that too began to fade in stillness quiet again heard creaking of shirt a lay back in chair with closed eye then struggle moanings writhings of arm began again again subsided lay quite still outside night wind stirred dropped then archie spoke in tired husky voice hullo jessie said be over by jove be ripping went awfully deep can remember nothing after martin came what did say jessie got up heard hardly anything said spoke in whisper so did did see asked archie yes quite clearly think will go to bed now look very tired have got up turned on electric light stood by door rubbing eye yes be tired said be divinely happy tell to morrow can remember good night jess be good sort detained hand for moment be cousin jess said be awfully good friend wo give kiss for one second shrank from in nameless horror next put from for shrinking angel of lord weak cowardly impulse stood full in path of love while be there must not reach archie why of course said kissing good night archie sleep well went to room turned on light felt a if have be assisting at unclean orgy felt tainted defiled by very presence of white evil thing have stood close to whispered laughed with archie a yet have looked on what lay in front of be to grapple with tear out of tabernacle have begun to inhabit a far a must understand situation be not wholly in possession a yet for part of when materialized seemed to form in air part only to ooze out of victim through what adventure combat way must take must form conception what have gained to night be worth hundred time sickness horror of soul be certain knowledge that spirit of discarnate evil be making home in beloved have usurped guise of martin masqueraded a martin archie thought be martin remembered how just week ago have told that be like empty house denuded of spirit dwelt there living corpse by asked to sit sometimes at time have seemed to just figure by expressed desolation of heart now revealed a true literal statement there have begun to enter into a tenant of uninhabited room horror that have seen jessie fell on knee by bedside opened heart to infinite love be through aid alone that must be able to accomplish rescue for be willing to give life soul chapter xii archie be walking back to house in grosvenor square from oakland crescent on afternoon of helena wedding owing to acute suspense of european situation plan of newly married couple have be changed instead of setting off at once

seance must not at first remember have found way into conscious mind knew that have be talked about have ascertained with considerable relief that jessie have not be able to hear now there be savage bitterness in mind about helena seemed to have played false again ought to have refused to marry bradshaw at last moment be ineffectual balm to know did not care for perhaps a jessie have once said though withdrawing afterwards cared for nobody now archie believed that cared for maddened to think that be bradshaw abc in circumstance have judged better to remain in town for night distract mind soothe longing with amusement aid to forgetfulness london be so ready to offer to young man who be looking for adventure london proved disappointing did not seem to be thinking of amusement at archie called to see friend who last week have shown eager admirable companion found to day disinclined for night of similar diversion for must neither think talk about anything else than imminence of war archie felt quite incapable of taking active interest in weighted nothing in balance compared with stern duty of seeking enjoyment forgetting about helena what if england did go to war with germany

amount of money to render invincible be invincible why then must bother about since be not sailor be further supposed that germany have invincible army there be if england have army at to speak of be quite clear must no more fight germany on land than germany must fight by sea so what on earth prevented little dinner at restaurant hour at music hall little supper somewhere anything turned up something always turned up be usually amusing for hour two friend thought otherwise kept diving out into street to get fresh edition of evening paper hot from press crammed with fresh invention archie left insane patriot in disgust at excitement over so detached affair a european war tried second friend with better success there be certain excuse for a be subaltern in guard for first friend there be none a be only in office in city there be still four five hour to get through before must be reasonable to think about dinner after even if started alone hour must take care of very pleasantly have to fill interval somehow there be proof of book waiting for at home hoping to get interested in first born public child of brain sat down with view to correcting found reading page a if there be nothing intelligible printed on true if forced to attend must see grammatical sentence succeeded other conveyed further impression there be lot about sea why on earth have taken trouble to write must remember writing must call up image of sitting in garden at silorno eagerly writing conscientiously erasing walking up down in attempt to frame phrase must exactly reproduce mood of mind what have inspired striving despair exultation here be record of seemed now to be about nothing rain in night have washed white soil into rim of sea be clouded like absinthe must well remember search for finding of particular simile harry have be into genoa week before out of curiosity have ordered absinthe at cafe drink qua drink be mildly unpleasant resembling aniseed have be worth while having merely to have got perfectly fitting simile effect too have be rather remarkable produced sort of heady lightness sense of well being colour seemed strangely vivid intensified archie got up from meaningless proof be absinthe must help to fill up dull hour till dinner time remembered having seen in little french restaurant in soho stuff wanted very likely must get anywhere wanted from that particular place for there have come in one evening when dined there most melancholy looking person who have ordered sat sipped somehow man face have made impression on so unhappy be remembered also face hour afterwards when began dinner serener more contented countenance must have be imagined so must have absinthe from restaurant clearly have very good brand of there a drove out alone that evening to dine heard newsvenders shouting out english ultimatum to germany saw placard in street shouting sounded wonderfully musical below roar of street traffic be muffled harmony a of pealing bell drab colour of london be shot with prismatic hue never have street appeared so beautiful there be even beauty in fact of outbreak of war for england be going to war for sake of liberty be fine noble adventure how lovely english girl boy be who crowded pavement be like bed of exquisite flower for be going back to dine at french restaurant in soho for must be in nature of supporting new ally afterwards there be street music hall mystery of short summer night then dawn must break rose coloured dawn with finger on lip sweet silent mouth little ashamed of sister night sympathetic at heart dawn be always little prudish little quakerish day of divine august went by line of german invasion swept forward like tide know ebb over belgium north east france british expeditionary force started be swept back like flotsam on seashore call came for raising of army east west north south recruiting office be like choked waterway still flood of men in whose heart fact of england have awoke poured in hospital be gorged with returning wounded woman by hundred by thousand volunteered a nurse went to hospital to be trained whole of comfortable england intent hitherto on sport leisure general superiority to rest of world suddenly became aware that immense vital danger threatened chorus of objurgation arose from brazen throated press organ striving to shout loudest at unpreparedness of country much valuable energy be spent in headline recrimination there be shortage of gun shortage of ammunition shortage of everything constitutes sinew of war only thing of there be not shortage be of who threw aside other consideration such a income secure living life gave to assist in what manner must cause for england have gone to war to archie seemed very hysterical uncomfortable attack of nerve in several way affected personally for william than whom there be more reliable servant be among first to leave well paid situation present at recruiting office archie hated that there must be nuisance of getting new servant who did not know where precisely ought to put archie tooth powder how to arrange clothes william have announced fact too in suddenest of manner brought out a brought in archie morning tea if can spare at once lord said have better go on saturday archie felt peculiarly devilish that morning rained absinthe must have arrived last night have not come think be very inconsiderate of william said suppose expect to get on well draw higher pay than get here so will have to raise wage right will give pound month more let hear more about knew perfectly well that be not william be reason amused to suggest wanted to see how william must take fact that knew that man be devoted to made point william busied with razor tooth brush replying nothing ca hear what say asked archie pouring out tea william faced round yes master archie said heard knew did mean that know how have served worked for year must scorn to think that of must say archie have noticed master archie instead of lord william blessington often forgot that be lord always used to please to sense of love be still young boy in spite of irritation peevish morning temper touched part of still loved below corruption be spreading over like jungle growing lichen have to force way through to reply must do a think right william said william have finished arrangement of dressing stood for moment by bedside with archie evening clothes bundled on to arm yes master archie said will be joining up too before long wo must dearly love to be soldier servant sir if must manage archie ill humour returned at unfortunate suggestion perhaps have better not be impertinent said that will do william face fell have thought of impertinence lord said only thought told must do said archie three day afterwards william left came to say good bye to archie who did not look up from paper be reading archie be suffering inconvenience from departure be best way of making william feel when door have shut again william be gone felt sudden horror of thing seemed to be ran out called william back day have not have word kindly gesture for good bye william said wish good luck have treated like beast last day be awfully sorry be best fellow man must have must try to forget horrid way have behaved william stood with hand in archie for moment be always master archie sir said well there be end of william before have got back to paper again archie wondered what have possessed to throw kind word to dog like who have left at three day notice to join ridiculous military conspiracy william did not care how much inconvenienced archie who have always treated more like subordinate friend than servant have helped william in hundred way have given old clothes have constantly asked after mother have left letter about for william to read if chose seemed rank treachery others be treacherous too mother for instance be immediately going up to town to take charge of house in grosvenor square be to be turned into hospital for wounded officer be to become sort of housekeeper so archie figured merely superintend domestic arrangement must have nothing to do with nursing surgery have certain fascination must picture sort of pleasure in seeing man leg cut off in standing by while doctor pulled bandage off festering wound to feel well strong while others be suffering have intelligible interest to witness decay corruption pain be point appealed to now lady tintagel be going to hing of sort be just going to be housekeeper be very selfish of archie must certainly want from time to time to go up to town spend night two there now must have to go to hotel club instead of profiting by spacious privacy of father house charity begin at home mother have started charity on most extraneous line jessie have followed lead lead of so called trump a archie framed private phrase must start by being not even housekeeper sort of kitchen maid at same hospital have insane desire to work to do something that cost something instead of engaging kitchen maid paying wage to go to hospital other there be craze for personal service instead of getting other people to do work for if felt work have to be done people wanted to do bit to employ odious expression be beginning to obtain currency nation be going to be mobilized hand heart have to serve vague national idea occasionally a on night when war be declared archie saw aesthetic beauty in notion of upholding right liberty have not then reckoned with fact that personal inconvenience might result from quixotic revolution quixotism be fine in theory be dream not to be encouraged in waking hour when far more important realizable commodity like whisky absinthe engaged true attention whoever else be treacherous father at least be loyal showed sign of becoming butler footman to correspond with wife jessie occasionally grave report concerning german advance through belgium used to reach brain must walk up down room in evening with martial tread glance at sword that hung above writing table wish be younger able to have go at invading locust invariably mood be always short be succeeded by not bellicose domestic damned war be going to break up home life in england must say have doubt be what german aimed at be succeeding too look at house there be mother going to leave there be helena husband expecting day to be sent to france there be jessie leaving father to wash up dish what be going to become of english home if go on for mark be root of national life be digging up tree root to break up english home archie be only one who be staunch to home pas bottle will may help myself on way said archie yes of course dear boy say be funny state of thing when used to have evening drink alone instead of enjoying chatting over together man william too be gone enlisted have old bulwark of england be going fast home be being broken up very servant come go a choose establishment be establishment in old day stood fell together if see what mean wish be young enough to have go at boche be thinking of going archie must say merely in order to enjoy father reply well in opinion will be doing very wrong thing then said lord tintagel hope wo seriously think of tell duty be here with poor old father when be gone may do what please daresay wo have very long to wait while be here hope will remember that say in church 'honour thy father thy mother ca go behind commandment psalm whichever be session in lord tintagel room of evening with liquid in decanter sinking steadily like well in time of drought be becoming rather tedious to archie since discovery of absinthe have even become rather gross congratulated on having seen sordidness of mere swilling that sort of thing be only fit for coarse rough taste seemed to to lack delicacy aesthetic value often left father who congratulated on abstemiousness after more than friendly glass of good fellowship went upstairs to room to enjoy subtler more refined sensation indeed chief interest in half hour so in father room be derived from sight of father heavy potation struggle of maundering thought to emerge into language much a tilted half moon struggle to pierce flying cloud on tempestuous night sight of father deterioration gradual wreck somehow fascinated there be decay corruption there no longer aroused in that horror with in dream have observed emergence of writhing worm from white statue of helena such thing be no longer disgusting repulsive claimed kinship with something in soul be very potent once martin have alluded to vision a warning have not taken that warning in consequence of have passed utterly miserable month after helena rejection of now value have altogether changed decay no longer revolted with hypocrisy have become characteristic of told that sight of father nightly intoxication be lesson to must observe that degrading spectacle learn from what result of too much whisky be then retired to bedroom to think over a sipped clouded aroma of absinthe jessie came down for week end before took kitchen maid situation brought news that fresh draft of lord harlow regiment be ordered to front that must leave for france within next day two archie felt wild desire to laugh to skip to show intense appreciation of tidings remembered that jessie be not confidante to extent checked exuberant inclination poor helena said with accent of great sincerity must be broken hearted why have only be married fortnight if a much be excellently said jessie felt must have shown infidel with regard to general decency of human race if have not accepted word with sincerity with surely must have be uttered resolutely put away from misgiving have assailed when first knew of archie changed attitude towards sister have be brick about helena said want to tell that forgiveness of way treated seems to beyond praise oh nonsense said lightly besides be so dreadfully uncomfortable being always angry miserable martin showed that about helena how be bearing be now jessie turn to be obliged to cloak meaning very calmly bravely said must said archie enthusiastically one always felt there be steel will behind helena gentleness what will do do think must perhaps like to come down here there be much to offer then london in august doe offer much suddenly jessie mistrust stirred erected must not believe that scheme must throw helena archie completely together must be made with apparent innocence with be put forward how be possible that archie who so few week ago be in such depth of misery bitterness must honourably suggest so dangerous plan must not be archie who suggested came from that smiling white presence have seen in room not many night ago be just that must not say to be nice of to think of said not bit must be nice for not nice of besides added with amazing cynicism must be way of 'doing bit ' everybody be talking about if must make thing cheerfuller for pretty woman like poor helena whose husband have gone out to fight moment have said be sorry for moment have forgotten be speaking to jessie sentence have come out of mouth a if be talking to also introduced suggestion of own forbearance to enlist there be rather awkward silence felt irritated with jessie for not changing subject have so incautiously brought forward be like have tact in such matter refusing to be insincere when insincerity be so simple matter irritation grew on at same time wanted to know what jessie thought of remaining inertly here while contemporary be enlisting why wanted to know did not define motive perhaps belonged to time when jessie have be so good friend perhaps knew that be so still do think that ought to behave like william serve country asked jessie sat with eye downcast for moment then raised looked in face with affection sincerity alight in do really want to know what think archie asked certainly do well ca understand not doing said at same time think be matter about must decide for sincerity of manner equalled hers never spoke with more apparent frankness will tell why said be do remember one night finding that father be breaking contract made with about drinking do remember how sordid horrible discovery be jessie remembered quite well how archie have laughed at remember evening said well have renewed contract said be only person in world who can keep father to if left must drink to death where then do think duty lie jessie be clearly for to save father can there be more obvious duty than do think have very delightful life down here alone with must be vastly easier for to join friend go out alongside of know conduct lay open to misconception must be thick skinned over hope wo misjudge besides father have said that forbids to go of course must leave doe lock up ca see how must be right in leaving be one anchor have left paused moment thinking over with stupendous swiftness of brain be result of martin inspiration all have said remembered light cynicism with regard to bit know rather shocked just now said when spoke of being bey bit ' to console pretty woman whose husband have gone out sometimes one have to be flippant to conceal one real thought on serious subject for did not foresee then that must talk out so there be end of jest so that have be jest not to be taken seriously be grimmer affair for jessie not to be able to take seriously be seriousness for moment frankness of manner have convinced very soon conviction collapsed like house of card a went on speaking horribleness of discovery of father drinking for instance when what remembered be archie laughter if must say that what credence must possibly be placed in picture have drawn of a father last hope what in image of a one who must silently bear cruel misconception must believe none of yet be not archie whom loved with sweetness strength of nature who spoke thing be possessing filling soul from reservoir of immense abyss of pure evil felt sure did not misjudge true infinitely tragic be comprehension be entirely for to decide archie said think fully appreciate worth of reason indeed knew not what else to say though bitter doubleness of word cut to heart if must help archie at must at cost retain such confidence a gave must not give chance of quarrelling with to great relief seemed to accept literal value of word took arm time felt in soul that there be sincerity in speech be good friend jessie said give up will must said quietly be strolling together by edge of lake in hour of sunset jessie though sick at heart tortured by weight of foreboding tempest of fire blood have burst on europe yet tried to open heart to sweet spell of tranquil evening somewhere behind cloud of evil have so suddenly taken shape in host of barbarian who already have overrun belgium le be invading

spending delectable morning at bathing place never have there be so superb imitation of italian weather in england a year day after day went by in unclouded brightness strong fresh heat in delightful condition have be perfectly easy for to take mind completely away from war misconception be possibly suffering under gave morning briefest glance to paper for there be tiresome uniformity about news monotonous regularity about daily map marked progress of german line across north east france gave hardly more thought to helena who seemed to think more appropriate to stay in london with father just for present have written most characteristic of letter saying how sweet archie sympathy be to how acute anxiety concerning husband certainly at moment be right attitude to take archie really did not much care whether be here with not for have found way into paradise form portico of palace where absinthe drinker dwells not yet have penetrated into hall of hell that lie beyond pleasure in fact of

human motive be based upon exquisite secret that have discovered must never do to state with what considered bald realism of ludicrous sea piece have written at silorno must wrap message up in sort of mystic subtlety so that only who have implanted in true instinct must be able to fill soul with perfume of flower others might guess wonder be puzzled perhaps see so far a to put down book with disgust be still half incredulous only initiated must be able to grasp wholly message lurked in hint allusion style underneath new inspiration have developed into instrument of marvellous beauty often when have written page two must read out aloud to in wonder at exquisite diction time felt that be reading aloud to martin that martin have dictated to be employed thus on particular morning down at bathing place have already have long swim without dressing lay down on short turf got out writing pad when new servant who have taken william place came down with telegram for be very good looking boy quick in movement swift to smile already archie wondered how must have regretted departure of plain middle aged william only last evening archie idly glancing through field glass have seen boy far off in meadow beyond lake in company with extremely pretty housemaid whom have often noticed about passage two have sat there time talking then archie saw boy look quickly round kiss liked that immensely be way youth must behave almost hoped that be thomas who have taken from table one of new ten shilling note that have missed must do too often for must be bore archie liked to think boy have taken perhaps converted into decoration for pretty housemaid anyhow thomas with handsome face kissing in meadow possible pilferings be attractive boy clearly developing along right line boy hesitated moment seeing archie dripping naked beg pardon lord said there came telegram for thought have better bring down certainly why beg pardon said archie be prudish daresay have got arm leg a well a have thomas grinned with odd shy look that archie have noticed before yes lord said then what be there to be ashamed of archie opened telegram read suddenly bit lip to prevent laughing be there answer lord asked boy brought form down in case well done yes there be answer archie hesitated moment before directing form to helena then wrote deepest sympathy with terrible news command in way devoted archie send at once will said when boy have gone archie read telegram again be from jessie told that lord harlow have be killed at front then smothered face in bent elbow lay shaking with laughter chapter xiii on september morning fortnight later archie be waiting in drawing room at oakland crescent for helena entry have seen twice since husband death struck now that always kept waiting when asked to come see ascribed to that very probable motive that expected thereby to increase eagerness for coming certainly wanted to come because be much interested amused in conventional little comedy be playing looked forward to third act on curtain must presently ring up in interval sat very serenely smiling to tickling end of nose with three white feather that have received in street to day always diverted extremely rude young woman must come up be invariably square plain have knobby face like chest of drawer say be ashimed not to be serving country be coward be then must give white feather have quite collection of now there be nine already carefully kept in stud box three in one day be splendid haul have to occupy mind very pleasantly remembrance of previous interview with helena formed two existing act of comedy in first have come in looking deliciously pretty in deep mourning with head little on one side have held out hand to have stood with hand clasped for quite long time then archie kissed because be rather tired of holding hand because enjoyed kissing anything so pretty that have caused break sat down side by side helena made queer movement in throat seemed to archie to be designed to convey impression that be repressing emotion did not quite fulfil design looked rather a if be due to desire to pump up rather than keep down then helena gave long sigh oh archie said be utterly broken hearted be so sudden so terribly sudden will never get over think have be married only fortnight next day got letter from after knew be dead such sweet little letter so cheerful so loving archie expected something of sort conventionality utter insincerity amused enormously wanting more of said just proper sort of thing to encourage to give oh dear said how will love cherish letter suppose be once out of thought time be in france shook head be sure of said ah what privilege to have be loved a be loved by such noble manly heart must always think of must archie took hand again touch of soft cool finger gave pleasure so too did answering pressure of yes indeed said must remember too that be better to have loved lost than never to have loved at repeated quotation in dreamy meditative voice yes be so true doe good to think of said must think of a dead really be just a living a ever be be so fond of too often spoke of quaint quiet humour be general note of first act have be short for conversation suitable to be necessarily limited second showed great advance in scope variety of topic also tempo be quite changed instead of being largo be at least andante con moto time after again keeping waiting have entered with smile what comfort be archie said have be looking forward to seeing again somehow understand nobody else doe feel time that darling jessie whenever see be often for be so busy daddy quite understand mean to be brave not lose courage not lose gaiety even think think that misjudge expect to be utterly broken so be at first a know so well tried to take to heart what said force not to despair feel ought to do must take burden of life up again with smile hand lay open on knee a said turned over towards making invitation seemed unconscious slipped long brown finger into rosy palm be astonishingly like girl met night two ago must get over awful feeling of loneliness said be helping so deliciously to do so daddy be busy day scarcely see jessie be busy also think enjoys washing up knife fork plate for soldier though of course doe make le sweet of to do anyhow have got much time for wish suppose be wrong to wish well confess then said archie smiling at yes dear father confessor though ought to say boy confessor for look so young well will confess to be sure wo be shocked with wish jessie cared for little more be sister after daresay be fault have got key to heart with jessie daddy so full of other affair do feel lonely when be here know what must have done without archie think might have killed be glorious archie gave splendid shudder talk like that said in tone of affectionate command know how hurt ah be sorry be selfish of do forgive know do said have brought into room with long envelope rather absently took out from enclosure of paper got to day from lawyer said be about darling will think wonder if must help to understand be so stupid at figure slid little closer to leaning hand on shoulder looking over a read document required a matter of fact very little exercise of intelligence house in surrey where have spent week of honeymoon be hers so be very decent income of l year left to without condition whatever for life be hers absolutely disposition of rest of fortune depended on whether have child detail of be not given lawyer only informed what be hers hid face on hand rested on archie shoulder oh archie can never go back to house said at least not for long time must be tearing open old wound again yes understand said with pressure of finger thinking of l year without condition have wild temptation to console further by quoting let grieve not only find strength in what remains behind refrained though apparently there be limit to helena insincerity there might be in acceptance of insincerity of others oh do understand so well said archie want to ask horribly selfish thing of ca help be alone now except for wo go out to war will think must bear if did be quite easy for to promise allusion to misconception might incur made acquiescence sound difficult noble since then up to day when be now expecting entry for third act have thought over whole situation with imaginative vision absinthe inspired have not slightest doubt in mind that helena according to capacity for loving be in love with that thought be still in love with when considered found have no longer slightest intention of marrying even though have l year for life without condition attached plenty of money be doubt preventive of discomfort in life felt be fine of not to be attracted by so ignoble bait amount of money must really compensate for inseparable companionship of helena with foolishness apparent inability to understand that insincerity so far from being convincing beautiful be more than most puerile transparent counterfeit certainly aroused ardour of sens how long must that last even while lasted how must compare with ardour for absinthe coloured dream ecstasy of communion with spirit have made home in must interrupt a companion must not compare with father must always be wanting to be caressed made much of admired taken care of must soon become most horribly tedious there be further reason against marrying be a potent a must forfeit revenge on if did that once dim age ago seemed on plane of existence have loved knowing have fed devotion with smile glance at end have chosen whose body now decayed in graveyard of north france already probably desecrated by on swarming german now be archie turn already be sure expected to marry must learn that have not least intention of doing so that delightful situation might easily be arrived at in third act for be waiting now time came with flower in hand presently a sat side by side on sofa talking put one into button hole instantly interrupted in what be saying kissed gave that long glance have once thought meant so much have not meant much then from point of view meant good deal more now to archie have passed from being gleam of wonder to farthing dip oh foolish boy said almost thought heard laugh see anything foolish about said at least if be foolish have always be foolish lip moved though not to speak just gathered together little tremor went down arm rested against be perfectly certain of signal next moment have folded to lay le than unresisting in arm then gently thrust from ah how wrong of said yet perhaps be not wrong dear bradshaw must always want to be happy perhaps even thought of when left so free for time archie sha come to empty handed of course must think of for many month yet archie flushed merry eyed looked at with boyish surprise think of what said ah force to say do of marriage be adorable in eye just then must hardly realize that so few month ago have definitely put from warm smooth face crisp curling youthful roughness ardour of embrace inflamed ravished looked at still inquiringly moment then threw back head laughed oh be delicious said marriage what do mean cousinly kiss little sympathy few dear little surrender of of to other be intended well must be off good bye next moment still choking with laughter be downstairs out into street must not resist looking up at window waving gay hand towards something within seemed very essence of being shouted sang with house in grosvenor square where mother have become housekeeper jessie kitchen maid have at present in only few wounded officer from france during two three day in town archie must still occupy own bedroom while servant slept in dressing room adjoining be out very late that night for completeness of revenge on helena ran like feeding fire through vein nourished burned dawn have already broken when let in went very quietly upstairs not intending to go to bed till have have

breathing quickly a if have be running then once again panic agony must grip with eye wide with terror foaming mouth struggled fought against thing mastered paroxysm left weaker be clear that must not be able to stand many more of attack yet one must wish prolonged must be merciful if end came soon spared further suffering towards sunset that day jessie be sitting by with order to call nurse next door if showed sign of restlessness preceded return of seizure knew that humanly speaking be dying faith never faltered that might still be saved that through love salvation might come to medical science be of avail must not combat spiritual foe have taken prisoner that rescue have to be made through spiritual mean two edged sword by alone captor must be vanquished be bright shining weapon of

hand crouched ready to spring then from bed came archie voice martin said there be dead silence saw forming in air little in front of nucleus of mist gathered volume from little jet a of steam appeared to come from archie thicker thicker grew strange line began to interlace within took form dimness of outline grew firm distinct shape stood detached clear bending over archie with smile triumphant cruel stood semblance have seen once before at midnight in archie room be no longer looking at knob at foot of bed with eye wide open blank with nameless terror gazed at apparition jessie rose stood opposite on other side of bed two edged sword be drawn now bright blade gleamed in darkness of evil flooded room then seemed that incarnation of stood beside archie bed be aware for turned looked full in face bringing to bear on utmost of hellish potency for one moment against awful assault soul cried out in panic have not dreamed that from crime with world have withered bled there must be distilled tincture so poisonous then love rallied scattered courage stood firm again nothing in world love prayer must prevail nothing if once must fully realize must prevail against in hand a in
