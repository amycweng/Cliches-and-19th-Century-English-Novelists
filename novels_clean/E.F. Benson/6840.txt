favour of lady having already started in to give mr lucas absent treatment very likely georgie pillson have also seen anticlimax of fly arrival must hazard much more probable though erroneous solution of absence must certainly guess that have sent on maid with luggage to station in order to take seat for while oblivious of passage of time be spending last half hour in contemplation of italian

be brahmin from benares presented at daisy door in penniless condition without clear knowledge whether have come by train not in favour of such prudent measure be truly athenian character of daisy mind for be always enquiring into new thing be secret of life when first discovered got speedily relegated to dust heap against such course be undoubted fact that daisy did occasionally get hold of somebody who subsequently proved to be of interest lucia must never forget to dying day advent in riseholme of little welsh attorney in whom daisy have discovered wonderful mentality lucia have refused to extend queenly hospitality to to recognise existence in way during fortnight when stayed with daisy be naturally very much annoyed to find in prominent position in government not many year later indeed have snubbed so markedly on first appearance at riseholme that have refused on subsequent visit to come to house at though several time visited mr quantock again told sort of political

when brandy be mentioned where will begin said lot to tell think must begin with great bit of news something really mysterious lucia smiled inwardly felt that knew for dead certain what mysterious news be also that knew far more about than georgie superiority completely concealed nobody must have guessed presto presto said excite yesterday morning be in rush said georgie seeing about creme de menthe ought to have be sent day before rush be very negligent sometimes be just saying sharp word about when suddenly saw that rush be not attending at be looking at something behind back so looked round guess be tantalising amico said how can guess pink elephant with blue spot guess again red indian in full war paint certainly not guess again said georgie with little sigh of relief must have be awful if have guessed at moment peppino suddenly became aware that lucia have guessed be up to game give hand georgie said look at be going to read thought think of what saw when turned round took hand pressed to forehead closing eye do seem to see indian said ah not red indian other indian have slipper on brown stocking not brown stocking be leg there be beard turban gave sigh be can see said dear be marvellous said be quite right slight bubbling sound came from peppino georgie began to suspect believe have seen said how tarsome be when have laughed great deal georgie have be assured that lucia really word of honour have idea what happened next narrative be resumed so there stood indian bowing salaaming most politely when rush have promised must send creme de menthe very morning just looked through wine list for moment indian with quantity more bow came up to counter said 'if will have great goodness to give little brandy bottle ' so rush gave instead of paying for do think said guess mr lucas rose with air of lady macbeth pointed finger at georgie said 'put down to mr quantock account ' hissed of course explanation came now lucia told two men content of mr quantock letter with card be on table though fact of brahmin from benares be news to georgie have got many interesting thing to tell for house adjoined mr quantock there be plenty of thing mr quantock have not mentioned in letter so georgie be soon in position of informant again window overlooked mr quantock garden since must not keep eye shut day followed that happening there be quite common property indeed be general rule in riseholme anyone in adjoining property must say what exciting game of lawn tennis have afternoon having followed from bedroom be part of charm of riseholme be a if contained just one happy family with common interest pursuit what happened in house be more private matter mr quantock for instance must never look from rising ground at end of garden into georgie dining room if did must never tell anyone how many place be laid at table on particular day when have asked if must give lunch have replied that to great regret table be full nobody must help seeing into garden from back window view belonged to everybody georgie have have wonderful view very day said soon after lunch be looking for letter thought have left in bedroom happening to glance out saw indian sitting under mr quantock pear tree be swaying little backwards forward brandy said lucia excitedly have meal in own room amica be not brandy in fact suppose brandy have gone to mr quantock then for did not take from rush asked that must be sent paused moment did take away declare ca remember anyhow when swayed backwards forward be drunk for presently stood on one leg crooked other behind remained there with hand up a if be praying for quite long time without swaying at so must have be tipsy then sat down again took off slipper held toe with one hand while leg be quite straight out put other hand round behind head grasped other ear with tried to do on bedroom floor must get near then sat up again called 'chela chela ' mr quantock came running out why did say 'chela asked lucia wondered too knew have clue to so looked through book by rudyard kipling found that chela meant ' what have told just now about 'guru being ' seems to piece whole thing together what did daisy do asked mr lucas breathlessly sat down too put leg out straight in front of like guru tried to hold toe of shoe in finger naturally must get within yard of got nearer than did said 'beloved lady not too far at first ' so must hear too said lucia naturally for window be open a know mr quantock pear tree be quite close to house then told to stop up one nostril with finger inhale through other then hold breath while counted six then breathed out again started with other side repeated that several time be very much pleased with then said 'it be quite wonderful feel so light vigorous ' must be very wonderful indeed if dear daisy felt light remarked lucia what next then sat swayed backwards forward again muttered something that sounded like pom must be 'om then must wait longer for have letter to write smiled at will give cup of tea to reward for report said have be most interesting tell again about breathing in holding breath georgie did so illustrated in own person what have happened next moment lucia be imitating peppino came round in order to get better view of what georgie be doing then sat inhaling through one nostril holding breath then expelling again very interesting said lucia at end upon word doe give one sort of feeling of vigour lightness wonder if there be something in chapter three though hurst be a befitted chatelaine most elizabethanly complete abode in riseholme rest of village in due degree fell very little short of perfection have one street half mile in length that street be gem of mediaeval domestic architecture for most part house lined be block of contiguous cottage have be converted either singly by two three into dwelling containing comfort demanded by twentieth century externally preserved antiquity though might be restored supplemented by bathroom other convenience presented truly elizabethan appearance there be of course accretion such a old inn sign above front door old bell pull at side door be uniformly of inconveniently low stature roof be of stone slab old brick in suspiciously abundant crop of antirrhinum stone crop have anchored there be hardly garden did not contain path of old paving stone mulberry tree yew cut into shape nothing in place be more blatantly mediaeval than village green across georgie took tripping step after leaving presence of queen round stood row of great elm in centre be ducking pond according to riseholme tradition though perhaps in le classical village might have passed merely for duck pond in riseholme must have be rank heresy to dream even in most pessimistic moment of being anything ducking pond close by stood pair of stock about there be doubt whatever for mr lucas have purchased from neighbouring iconoclastic village where be going to be broken up after having repaired have presented to village green chosen site close to ducking pond round green be grouped shop of village slightly apart from residential street at far end of be that undoubtedly elizabethan hostelry ambermere arm full to overflowing of ancient table bible box fire dog fire back bottle chest settle be purchased in large quantity by american tourist who swarmed there during summer month at high profit to nimble proprietor who thereupon purchased fresh antiquity to take place ambermere arm in fact be antique furniture shop of place did thriving trade for be much more interesting to buy object out of real old elizabethan inn than out of shop georgie have put smart military cape over arm for walk at interval applied slim forefinger to one nostril while breathed in through other continuing practice have observed going on in mr quantock garden though made little dizzy certainly produced sort of lightness soon remembered letter from mr quantock lucia have read out warning that exercise ought to be taken under instruction so desisted be going to deliver lucia answer at mr quantock house with view to possibly meeting guru being introduced to said over to guru guru guru instead of doing deep breathing in order to accustom to unusual syllable must of course have be very strange un riseholme like to have gone to friend door even though errand be so impersonal one a bearing somebody else note without enquiring whether friend be in being instantly admitted if be a matter of fact georgie caught glimpse when knocker be answered mr quantock did not have bell at through open door of hall of mr quantock standing in middle of lawn on one leg naturally therefore ran out into garden without further formality looked like little round fat stork whose leg have not grown who preserved habit of kind dear lady have brought note for said be from lucia other leg went down turned on wide firm smile that have learned in vanished day of christian science om said mr quantock expelling remainder of breath thank dear georgie be extraordinary what yoga have done for already cold quite gone if ever feel out of sort depressed cross can cure at once have got visitor staying with have indeed asked georgie without alluding to thrilling excitement have trodden so close on other heel since yesterday morning when have seen guru in rush shop yes a have just come from dear lucia perhaps may have said something to about for wrote to about be guru of extraordinary sanctity from benares be teaching way will see too unless be meditating will call to if be meditating wo hear so sha be interrupting must hear railway accident if be meditating turned round towards house guru dear called there be moment pause indian face appeared at window beloved lady said guru dear want to introduce friend of mine to said be mr pillson when know little better will call georgie beloved lady know very well indeed see into clear white soul peace be unto friend be marvellous fancy said mr quantock in aside georgie raised hat very politely how do do said after quiet practice must have said how do do guru rhymed in ridiculous manner red lip must not frame word be always well said guru be always young well because follow way sixty at least tell said mr quantock in hissing aside probably audible across channel think more year make difference to be like boy call 'guru ' guru began georgie yes friend be very glad be well said georgie wildly be greatly impressed much embarrassed also be so hard to talk at second story window with sense of ease especially when have to address total stranger of extraordinary sanctity from benares luckily mr quantock came to assistance of embarrassment guru dear be coming down to see asked beloved lady said level voice be laid on to wait here be time of calm prayer when be good to be alone will come down when guide bid teach dear friend what have taught surely before long will grasp earthly hand not now peace peace light have got guide a well asked georgie when guru disappeared from window be indian too oh be spiritual guide said mr quantock see talk to be not in body gave happy sigh never have felt anything like said have brought atmosphere into house that even robert feel doe mind being turned out of dressing room there have shut window be marvellous georgie have not seen anything particularly marvellous yet except phenomenon of mr quantock standing on one leg in middle of lawn presumably emotion communicated to by subtle infection of spirit what doe do asked dear be not what doe what be said why even little bald account of to lucia have made ask to garden party of course ca tell whether will go not seems so very much how will say so very much sent to will of course ask whether will consent trance meditation day in interval such serenity sweetness know for instance how tiresome robert be about food well last night mutton be bound to say be little underdone robert be beginning to throw about plate in way have well guru got up just said behow way to kitchen ' leaf out little word sometimes because matter took down said 'peace ' told to leave there in ten minute be up again with little plate of curry rice have be underdone mutton never ate anything so good robert have most of have rest guru be so pleased at seeing robert pleased said robert have pure white soul just like only be to tell because for way ordained that must find out for today before lunch again guru went down in kitchen cook told only took pinch of pepper tomato little bit of mutton fat sardine bit of cheese brought up dish that never saw equalled delicious must bit wonder if robert began breathing exercise soon there be one make lean young exercise liver sounded very entrancing ca teach that asked georgie eagerly have be rather distressed about increasing plumpness for year past about increasing age for longer than a for liver always have to be careful shook head can not practise except under tuition from expert said georgie rapidly considered what hermy ursy comment must be if when arrived tomorrow be found doing exercise under tuition of guru hermy when be not otter hunting must be very sarcastic have clear month of hermy in front of without otter hunting so have informed be not possible in august be mysterious to georgie because did not seem likely that otter died in august fresh brood came in like caterpillar if hermy be here in october must otter hunt morning snore afternoon be in best of temper august visit required more careful steering yet prospect of being lean young internally untroubled be wonderfully tempting must be guru a well asked quite suddenly by demoniac possession desire have be only intermittently present in mr quantock consciousness took full possession of red revolutionary insurgence hoisted banner why with stupendous novelty in shape of guru must lead direct riseholme instead of lucia have long wondered why darling lucia must be queen of riseholme have by momentary illumination seen thus equipped a far more capable of exercising supremacy after everybody in riseholme knew lucia old tune by now be in secret consciousness quite aware that did not play second third movement of moonlight sonata simply because went faster however much might cloak omission by saying that resembled eleven o'clock in morning pm mr quantock have often suspected that did not read one quarter of book talked about that got up subject in encyclopaedia in order to make brave show covered essential ignorance certainly spent good deal of money over entertaining robert have lately made twenty time daily what lucia spent annually over roumanian oil a for acting have not completely forgotten word a lady macbeth in middle of sleep walking scene here be lucia a proved by note d c georgie wildly interested in guru mr quantock conjectured that lucia plan be to launch guru at august party a own discovery must be novelty must be lucia who gave om party breathing party standing on one leg party while daisy quantock must be bidden to a humble guest lucia must get credit a likely a not invite discoverer inventress just now then mr quantock guru must become lucia guru riseholme must flock hungrily for light leading to hurst have written to lucia in sincerity hoping that must extend hospitality of garden party to guru now very warmth of lucia reply caused to suspect ulterior motive have be too precipitate too rash too ill advised too sudden a lucia must say ought to have known that lucia with august party coming on must have jumped at guru withheld for own party taking wind out of lucia august sail lucia have already suborned georgie to leave note begin to filch guru away mr quantock saw now clearly be not to be borne before answered steeled with triumph have once scored in matter of welsh attorney dear georgie said one must be more delighted than if guru consented to take a pupil ca tell what will do a said to today apropos of ' can not come unless be sent ' be not that wonderful knew at once have be sent to by time georgie be quite determined to have guru measure of determination may be gauged from fact that forgot about lucia garden party called friend said told have clean white soul yes be attitude towards everybody said mr quantock religion make impossible for to think ill of anybody did say that to rush cried georgie when asked for brandy to be put down to mr expression changed for moment moment be too short for georgie to notice face instantly cleared again naturally can not go about saying that sort of thing observed common people be of highest caste must not understand georgie made direct appeal please ask to teach said for moment mr quantock did not answer cocked head sideways in direction of pear tree where thrush be singing fluted couple of repeated phrase then be silent again mr quantock gave great smile to pear tree thank little brother said turned to georgie again that come out of st francis said yoga embrace be true in religion well will ask guru whether will take a pupil ca answer for what will say what doe what doe charge for lesson asked christian science smile illuminated face again word beoney never pass lip said think really know what mean proposed to sit on green with beggar bowl of course must not permit for present just give want doubt when go away hope will not be for many week yet though one can tell when will have call will slip something suitably generous into hand think about must be going good night dear georgie peace om last backward glance a went out of front door revealed standing on one leg again just a have seen first remembered print of fakir at benares standing in attitude if stream flowed into avon must be combined with ganges garden into burning ghaut swooping swallow into kite neat parlour maid who showed out into brahmin chinese gong be so prominent object in hall into piece of benares brassware must almost have fancied a standing on brink of sacred river marigold in garden required transmutation georgie have quite to pull together a stepped round mr quantock mulberry tree ten pace later round own before must recapture normal evening mood on occasion when be going to dine alone usually evening be very pleasant much occupied for did not occur very often in whirl of riseholme life be not more than once week that spent solitary evening then if got tired of own company there be dozen house easy of access where must betake in military cloak spend post prandial hour oftener than not when occasion occurred must be quite busy at home dusting little china rearranging ornament on shelf after putting ring handkerchief in candle bracket of piano spending serious hour with soft pedal down for fear of irritating robert in reading share of such duet a must be likely to be called upon to play with lucia during next day two though read music much better than did used to go over part alone first let be understood that have not seen before then be sure that have done precisely same so started fair such thing whiled away very pleasantly hour till eleven when went to bed be seldom that have to set out patience card to tide over slow minute now then tonight be one of occasion there occurred evening when never went out to dinner even if be asked because be busy indoors occurred about once month evening that be busy indoors even invitation from lucia must not succeed in disturbing age ago riseholme have decided what made georgie busy indoors once month so none of friend chatted about nature of engagement to anyone else simply because everybody else knew business indoors in fact be perfect secret from having be public property for so long june have be very busy time not indoors with other engagement a georgie went up to bedroom having be told by foljambe that hair dresser be waiting for have be waiting last ten minute glanced at hair in cromwellian mirror hung on stair be quite aware that be time submitted to mr holroyd ministration there be certainly undergrowth of grey hair visible beneath chestnut crop must have be attended to at least fortnight ago also there be growing thinness in lock crossed head mr holroyd have attended to before have suggested certain remedy not in least inconvenient unless georgie proposed to be athletic without cap in high wind even then not necessarily so a have intention of being athletic anywhere with without cap determined a went up stair that must follow mr holroyd advice mr holroyd procedure without added formula entailed sitting till dried after that must have dinner then mr holroyd must begin again be very clever person with regard to face hand foot georgie have be conscious of walking little lamely lately have be even more conscious of need of hot towel on face tap tap of mr holroyd finger stretching of mr holroyd thumb across rather slack surface of cheek chin in interval between hair face mr holroyd must have good supper downstairs with foljambe cook tomorrow morning when met hermy ursy georgie must be just a spick span young a ever if not more so georgie happy innocent be completely unaware that whole of riseholme knew that smooth chestnut lock covered top of head be trained like tendril of grapevine from root flowed like river over bare head consequently when mr holroyd explained proposed innovation little central wig edge of must mingle in most natural manner with own hair seemed to georgie that nobody must know difference in addition must be spared risky moment when have to take off hat to friend in high wind for there be always danger of hair blowing away from top of head hanging down like tress of rhine maiden over one shoulder so mr holroyd be commissioned to put little affair in hand at once when greyness have be attended to georgie have have dinner there came hot towel tapping on face other ministration be done about half past ten when came downstairs again for short practice at bass part of beethoven fifth symphony ingeniously arranged for two performer on piano looked with sincere satisfaction at rosy face in cromwellian mirror shoe felt quite comfortable again nail shone like pink star a hand dashed wildly about piano in quicker passage time thought of guru next door under whose tuition might be able to regain youth without recourse to expensive subterfuge for price of undetectable toupet astonished rang in head with melody more haunting than beethoven what must have liked best of must have be to have guru to so that must remain perpetually young while rest of riseholme including hermy ursy grew old then indeed must be king of place instead of serving interest of queen rose with little sigh after adjusting strip of flannel over key shut piano busied for little with soft duster over cabinet of bibelots not even foljambe be allowed to touch be generally understood that have inherited though inheritance have chiefly passed to through medium of curiosity shop there be several piece of considerable value among there be gold louis xvi snuff box miniature by karl huth silver toy porringer of time of queen anne piece of bow china enamelled cigarette case by faberge tonight handling of be not so dainty delicate a usual actually dropped porringer on floor a be dusting for mind still occupied with guru practice led to permanent youth how quick lucia have be to snap up for garden party yet perhaps must not get for might say be not sent surely must be sent to georgie whom knew moment set eye on to have clean white soul clock struck eleven a usual on warm night georgie opened glass door into garden drew in breath of night air there be slip of moon in sky most punctiliously saluted wondering though did not seriously believe in superstition how lucia must be so foolhardy a to cut new moon have seen yesterday told in london have taken notice whatever of heaven be quickly peppered with pretty star georgie after busy interesting day enjoyed looking at though if have have arrangement of must certainly have put into more definite pattern among be very red planet georgie with recollection of classical education easily remembered that mar god of war be symbolized in heaven by red star must that mean anything to peaceful riseholme be internal warfare be revolutionary movement possible in so serene realm chapter four pink irascible robert prone to throw food about plate if did not commend to felt in extremely good natured mood same night after dinner for guru have again made visit to kitchen with result that instead of slab of pale dead codfish being put before after have eaten tepid soup there appeared delicious little fish curry guru have behaved with great tact have seen storm gathering on poor robert face a sipped cool effete concoction put down spoon again with splash in soup plate thereupon have bowed smiled scurried away to kitchen to intercept next abomination then returning with little curry explained that be entirely for robert since who sought way did not indulge in hot sharp food so have gobbled up to very last morsel in consequence when guru salaamed very humbly said that with gracious permission of beloved lady kind master must go meditate in room have shambled away in red slipper discussion robert have felt obliged to open with wife on subject of having unknown indian staying with for indefinite period be opened in much more amicable key than must have be on slice of codfish well now about golliwog haha must say guru dear began what be going to happen daisy quantock drew in breath sharply winced at irreverence quickly remembered that must always be sending out message of love north east south west so sent rather spiky one in direction of husband who be sitting due east so that probably got to at once smiled particular hard firm smile be heirloom inherited from last rule of life one know said brightly even guide ca tell where when guru may be called then do propose must stop here till be called somewhere else continued smiling propose anything said be not in hand under calming influence of fish curry robert remained still placid be first rate cook anyhow said ca engage a call to kitchen know darling said mr quantock sending out more love have quick temper indeed two be outpoured together like hot cold tap turned on in bath pellucid stream of love served to keep temper moderately cool well ask suggested mr quantock a say never can tell where guru may be called give forty pound year beer money beer began mr quantock when suddenly remembered georgie story about rush guru brandy bottle stopped yes dear said 'beer remarked robert little irritably in case insist that dismiss present cook only took because be christian scientist have left little sheep fold now used to talk about false claim remember well claim to be cook be falsest ever heard of 'd sooner take chance with itinerant organ grinder that fish curry tonight that other thing last night be what mean by good eating thought even of good food always calmed robert savage breast blew upon a wind on aeolian harp hung in tree evoking faint sweet sound be sure dear said that will be willing to fall in with pleasant arrangement about guru really be unreasonable in to ask what sort of arrangement propose have word to say against especially when go to kitchen only want to know if be going to stop here night two year two talk to about tomorrow with love wonder if can make bisque soup daisy quantock carried quite quantity of material for reflection upstairs with then went to bed pausing moment opposite guru door from inside of came sound of breathing so deep that sounded almost like snoring seemed to detect timbre of spirituality about convinced that be holding high communion with guide be round that thought centred be tree through branch of scampered chattering first main interest in be sheer guruism for be one of intensely happy people who pas through life in ecstatic pursuit of idea who share call fad well might poor robert remember devastation of home when daisy after perusal of little pamphlet picked up on book stall called uric acid monthly came to shattering conclusion that buxom frame consisted almost entirely of waste product must be eliminated for greedy man situation be frankly intolerable for when continued ordinary diet be before cursed advent of christian science cook kept pointing to well furnished plate told that atom of beef mutton potato turned from moment swallowed into chromogen toxin that apparent appetite be merely result of fermentation for platter be abominable mess of cheese protein powder apple salad oil while round like saucer of specimen seed be ranged little pile of nut pine branch supplied body building material weighed out with scrupulous accuracy in accordance with direction of uric acid monthly tea coffee be taboo since flooded blood with purins kitchen boiler rumbled day night to supply river of boiling water with taken in sip inundated system strange gaunt female used to come down from london with small parcel full of tough food tasted of travelling bag contained so much nutrition that port manteau full of must furnish daily ration of army luckily even iron constitution must not stand strain of such ideal living for long growing anaemia threatened to undermine constitution seriously impaired by precept of perfect health course of beef steak other substantial viand loaded with uric acid restored to former vigour thus reinforced plunged with same energy a have devoted to repelling uric acid into embrace of christian science inhumanity of sect towards others took complete possession of when husband complained on bitter january morning that smoking room be like icehouse because housemaid have forgotten to light fire have touch of pity for since knew that there be such thing a cold heat pain therefore must not feel cold now since according to new creed such thing a uric acid chromogen purins have existence must safely indulge in decent viand again unhappy husband be not real gainer in respect for while ate tirelessly discoursed to on new creed asked to recite with true statement of being on top of dismissed admirable cook engaged miscreant from whom suffered still though christian science have allowed cold to make so long false claim on have followed uric acid fad into limbo of discarded belief now once more have temporarily discovered secret of life in teaching of guru be a have be mentioned sheer guruism constituted main attraction of new creed then being taken for granted turned mind to certain side issue to true riseholmite be of entrancing interest felt strong suspicion that lucia contemplated annexing guru altogether for otherwise must not have returned so enthusiastic response to note have sent georgie to deliver have professed so violent interest in guru what then be correctly diabolical policy to pursue must daisy quantock refuse to take to mr lucas altogether with message of regret that did not feel sent even if did did feel strong enough to throw down gauntlet in shape of guru using a attraction challenge darling lucia to mutual combat in order to decide who must be leader of be advanced cultured in riseholme society still following ramification of policy must bribe georgie over to own revolutionary camp by promising instruction from guru following le dashing line must take darling lucia georgie into charmed circle while retaining own right of treasure trove yet share with in inner ring dispensing guru to if be good in small dos mr quantock mind resembled in working manoeuvre of moth distracted by glory of several bright light dashed at one got slightly singed forgetting about turned attention to second third taking header into in turn without deciding on whole be most enchanting of luminary so in order to curb exuberance of frenzied excursion got half sheet of paper noted down alternative that must choose from will keep entirely to myself ii will run for be worth leave out l iii will get g on side iv will give l g bit paused moment then remembering that have voluntarily helped very pretty housemaid to make bed that morning saying that business like prince of wale be to serve added v will ask to be cook for few second brightness of eager interest be dimmed a unworthy suspicion occurred to perhaps prettiness of housemaid have something to do with usefulness in bedroom instantly dismissed there be bottle of brandy too have ordered from rush when have begged to order anything wanted cause to be put down to account have not actually contemplated brandy then remembering that one of most necessary condition for progress in yoga be that disciple must have complete confidence in guru chased that also out of mind still even when line of possible policy be written down must come to decision putting paper by bed decided to sleep over rhythmical sound of hallowed breathing came steadily from next door murmured om om in time with hour of morning between breakfast lunch be time inhabitant of riseholme chiefly devoted to spying on other went about from shop to shop on household business occasionally making purchase carried away with in little paper parcel with convenient loop of string real object of excursion be to see what everybody else be doing learn what fresh interest have sprung up like mushroom during night georgie must be matching silk at draper very naturally must carry from obscurity of interior to door in order to be certain about shade keep eye on coming going in street very naturally mr lucas on way to market gardener to enquire whether have yet received bulb from holland must tell that lucia have received piano arrangement of mozart trio georgie for part must mention that hermy ursy be expected that evening peppino enriched by item must toddle on a phrase went to meet exchange confidence with next spy have noticed incidentally that georgie carried small oblong box with hard corner perfectly correctly conjectured to be cigarette for hermy ursy since georgie never smoked well must be toddling on said after identifying georgie box of cigarette being rather puzzled by bulge in georgie pocket will be looking in time morning perhaps georgie have not be quite sure that must for be very busy owing to arrival of sister necessity of going to mr holroyd in order that artist might accurately match shade of hair with view to expensive toupet mention of arrival of mozart now decided intended anyhow before went home for lunch to stroll past hurst see if did not hear to adopt mixed metaphor sound of diligent practice of classical morsel going on inside probably soft pedal must be down have marvellously acute hearing must be very much surprised if did not hear recognisable chord even more surprised if when came to practise piece together lucia did not give to understand that be reading for first time have already got copy have practised part last night then be in superior position of not having husband who must inadvertently tell on meantime be of first importance to get that particular shade of purple silk have none of tarsome magenta tint in meantime also be of even greater importance to observe movement of riseholme just opposite be village green a nobody be quite close to georgie put on spectacle must whisk off in moment be formed that bulge in pocket peppino have noticed fact of using spectacle at be secret must have to be profoundly kept for several year yet a there be one at near stealthily adjusted on small straight nose morning train from town have evidently come in for there be bustle of cab about door of ambermere arm thing thrilled to marrow be fact that lady ambermere motor be undoubtedly among must surely mean that lady ambermere be here for when poor thin miss lyall companion came in to riseholme to do shopping transact such business a majestic life at hall required always came on foot in very inclement weather in small two wheeled cart like hip bath at moment steeped in conjecture who must appear walking stiffly with nose in air a if suspecting not choosing to verify faint unpleasant odour lady ambermere coming from direction of hurst clearly must have got there after peppino have left must surely have mentioned fact that lady ambermere have be at hurst if have be at hurst be true that be only coming from direction of hurst georgie put into practice in mental process darwin principle that in order to observe usefully must have theory georgie theory be that lady ambermere have be at hurst just for minute two hastily put spectacle in pocket with precision of trained mind also formed theory that business have brought lady ambermere into riseholme that taking advantage of presence there have probably returned verbal answer to lucia invitation to garden party must have received by first post morning be quite ready to put theory to test when lady ambermere have arrived at suitable distance for conveniently observing for taking off hat always treated like boy liked usual salutation passed know where people be said lady ambermere majestically have seen motor yes dear lady be in at own arm said georgie brightly happy motor if lady ambermere unbent to anybody unbent to georgie be of quite good family because mother have be bartlett second cousin of deceased husband sometimes when talked to georgie said implying thereby connection with aristocracy gratified georgie nearly a much a did treatment of a being boy still be to a boy still that answered well happy motor little rascal must come to arm instead of being at said with quick wit for riseholme pronounced famous fancy being able to see motor at distance young eye be really young spectacle georgie did not mind that in fact must not have corrected mistake for world will run across fetch for asked in minute whistle on finger like vulgar street boy said lady ambermere be sure know how to georgie have not slightest idea with courage of youth presuming with prudence of middle age that must not really be called upon to perform so unimaginable feat put two finger up to mouth here go then said greatly daring knew perfectly well that dignity of lady ambermere must not permit rude vulgar whistling of be hopelessly incapable to summon motor made feint of stopping ear with hand do anything of kind said in minute will walk with across to arm tell first have just be to say to good mr lucas very likely will look in at garden party on friday if have nothing else to do who be wonderful creature be expecting be indian conjurer if so must like to see because when ambermere be in madras remember one coming to residency who have cobra sort of thing told did like snake said there must be in fact be rather mysterious did at present know if be coming not only said 'no snake insist on snake georgie relieved mind about chance of there being snake gave short precis of ascertained habit of guru laying special stress on high caste of brahmin be of very decent family admitted lady ambermere be always against lumping dark skinned people together calling nigger when be at madras be famed for discrimination be walking across green a lady ambermere gave vent to liberal sentiment georgie even without need of spectacle must see peppino who have spied lady ambermere from door of market gardener hurrying down street in order to get word with before people drove back to hall came into riseholme today to get room at arm for olga bracely observed prima donna asked georgie breathless with excitement yes be coming to stay at arm for two night with mr shuttleworth surely began georgie be all right be husband be married last week said lady ambermere must have thought that shuttleworth be good enough name a shuttleworths be cousin of late lord prefers to call miss bracely dispute right to call what plea far from though who bracelys be have never be able to discover when george shuttleworth wrote to saying that wife be intending to stay here for couple of day proposing to come over to hall to see thought must just look in at arm see that be promised proper accommodation will dine with tomorrow have few people staying doubt miss bracely will sing afterwards broadwood be always considered remarkably fine instrument be very proper of george shuttleworth to say that must be in neighbourhood daresay be very decent sort of woman have come to motor by time rich noble motor a mr pepys must have described there be poor miss lyall hung with parcel wearing faint sycophantic smile miserable spinster of age so obvious a to be called not least uncertain be lady ambermere companion shared with glory of hall have be left to lady ambermere for life be provided with food lodging use of cart like hip bath when lady ambermere have errand for to do in riseholme so what must woman want more in return for bounty only duty be to devote body mind to patroness to read paper aloud to set lady ambermere be pattern for needlework to carry little chinese dog under arm wash once week to accompany lady ambermere to church never to have fire in bedroom have melancholy wistful little face head be inclined with backward slope on neck mouth be invariably little open shewing long front teeth so that looked rather like roast hare sent up to table with head on georgie always have joke ready for miss lyall of sort made say oh mr pillson caused to blush thought remarkably pleasant georgie have joke ready on occasion why here be miss lyall said what have miss lyall be doing while ladyship have be talking better not ask perhaps oh mr pillson said miss lyall a punctually a cuckoo clock when hand point to hour lady ambermere put weight onto step of motor causing to creak sway call on shuttleworths georgie said say told to home miss lyall effaced on front seat of motor like mouse hiding in corner after lady ambermere have got in footman mounted onto box at moment peppino with bag of bulb little out of breath squeezed way between two cab by side of motor be just too late motor moved off be very improbable that lady ambermere saw at georgie felt very much like dog with bone in mouth who only want to get away from other dog discus quietly be safe to say never in twenty four hour have so many exciting thing happened to have ordered toupet have be looked on with favour by guru riseholme knew that have have quite long conversation with lady ambermere nobody in riseholme except knew that olga bracely be going to spend two night here well remembered marvellous appearance last year at covent garden in part of brunnhilde have gone to town for rejuvenating visit to dentist tarsomeness of being betwixt between have be quite forgotten by when saw awake to siegfried line on mountain top da ist keine mann siegfried have said to be sure be very clever of for looked like slim beardless boy not in least like great fat frau at baireuth whom nobody must have mistaken for man a bulged heaved even before string of breastplate be uncut by sword then sat up hailed sun georgie felt for moment that have quite taken wrong turn in life when settled to spend year in boyish maidenly manner with embroidery china dusting at riseholme ought to have be siegfried have brought photograph of in cuirass helmet often looked at when be not too busy with something else have even championed goddess against lucia when pronounced that wagner be totally lacking in knowledge of dramatic effect to be sure have never seen wagner opera have heard overture to tristram performed at queen hall if be wagner well already though lady ambermere motor have not yet completely vanished up street riseholme be gently closing in round in order to discover by discreet question a in game of clump what have be talking about there be colonel boucher with two snorting bull dog closing in from one side mr weston in bath chair being wheeled relentlessly towards from two miss antrobuses sitting playfully in stock on third peppino at close range on fourth everyone knew too that did not lunch till past one there be really reason why must not stop chat a usual with eye of true general saw that must most easily break surrounding cordon by going off in direction of colonel boucher because colonel boucher always said haw hum by jove before descended into coherent speech thus georgie must forestall with good morning colonel pas on before got to business did not like passing close to slobbering bull dog something have to be done next moment be clear saw that other spy by original impetus be still converging on other walked briskly down towards lucia house to listen for familiar noise out of mozart trio noise be there soft pedal be down just a expected so that business being off mind continued walk for few hundred yard more meaning to make short circuit through field cross bridge over happy stream flowed into avon regain house by door at bottom of garden then must sit think guru olga bracely what if asked olga bracely husband to dine persuaded mr quantock to let guru come must be three men one woman hermy ursy must make square six for dinner be utmost foljambe permitted have come to stile led into field sat there for moment lucia tentative melody be still faintly audible soon stopped guessed that be looking out of window be too great to take part in morning spying went on round about green often saw good deal from window wondered what mr quantock be meaning to do apparently have not promised guru for garden party else lady ambermere must not have said that lucia did not know whether be coming not perhaps mr quantock be going to run grant to lucia georgie in case must certainly ask olga bracely husband to dine must must not ask lucia red star have risen in riseholme bolshevism be treading in peaceful air if mr quantock be going to secrete guru set up own standard on strength of georgie felt much inclined to ask bracely to dinner without saying anything to lucia about just see what must happen next georgie be bartlett on mother side played piano better than lucia have four hour leisure day must devote to being king of riseholme nature flared up burning with red revolutionary flame be fed by secret knowledge about olga bracely why must lucia rule everyone with rod of iron why again why suddenly heard name called in familiar alto there be lucia in shakespeare garden georgino georgino mio cried gino out of mere habit georgie got down from stile tripped up road towards manly seething of soul insurrection rebuked unfortunately leg voice surrendered habit be strong amica answered buon giorno why do say in italian vainly asked geordie come have ickle talk said want 'oo wise man to advise ickle lucia what 'oo want asked georgie now quite quelled for moment lot thing here pwetty flower for button holie now tell about black man snake have why mr quantock say think come to poo ' lucia party garden oh did asked georgie relapsing into vernacular yes oh by way there be parcel come think must be mozart trio will come over tomorrow morning read with yes about half past eleven then never mind that fixed with ready birdy eye daisy asked to ask said so to oblige poor daisy did now say doe know if will come what doe mean be possible that want to keep to herself have done that sort of thing before know probably represented lucia statement of said case about welsh attorney georgie taking a such felt rather embarrassed also that bird like eye seemed to gimlet way into very soul divine secret disloyalty that have be contemplating if have continued to look into might not only have confessed to gloomiest suspicion about mr quantock have let go of secret about olga bracely also suggested possibility of husband being brought to garden party eye at moment unscrewed from again travelled up road there be guru said now will see georgie faint with emotion peered out between form of peacock pine apple on yew hedge saw what followed lucia went straight up to guru bowed smiled clearly introduced in moment be showing white teeth salaaming together walked back to hurst where georgie palpitated behind yew hedge together entered lucia eye wore most benignant aspect want to introduce to guru said without stumble great friend of mine be mr pillson guru guru mr pillson guru be coming to tiffin with georgie can not persuade to stop delighted said georgie met before in sort of way did yes indeed so pleased said guru let go in said lucia be close on lunch time georgie followed after great many bowing politeness from guru be not sure if have making of bolshevist lucia be so marvellously efficient chapter five one of lucia greatness lay in fact that when found anybody out in act of atrocious meanness never indulged in idle threat of revenge be sufficient that knew must take suitable step on earliest occasion consequently when appeared from artless conversation of guru at lunch that perfidious mr quantock have not even asked whether must like to go to lucia garden party not pending own decision a to what be meaning to do with lucia received information with utmost good humour merely saying doubt dear mr quantock forgot to tell did not announce act of reprisal such a striking daisy off list of habitual guest for week two just to give lesson even before sat down to lunch telephoned over to thwarted woman to say that have met guru in street have felt that there be wonderful bond of sympathy between so have come back with be just sitting down to tiffin be pleased with word tiffin also liked explaining to daisy what meant tiffin be great success there be need for guru to visit kitchen in order to make something must be eaten without struggle talked quite freely about mission here lucia georgie peppino who have come in rather late for have be obliged to go back to market gardener about bulb listened entranced yes be when went to friend who keep book shop said that knew there be english lady who wanted guru knew be called to luggage no anything at a be kind lady too will get on well will find of posture difficult for be what call globe round be that posture when saw standing on one leg in garden asked georgie when sat down tried to hold toe yes indeed quite so difficult for globe have white soul looked round with smile see many white soul here said be happy place when there be white soul for to be sent be sufficient in minute lucia georgie peppino be all accepted a pupil presently went out into garden where guru sat on ground in most complicated attitude be obviously quite out of reach of mr quantock one foot on one thigh other foot on other thigh explained head back straight be good to meditate so lucia tried to imagine meditating so felt that meditation so must certainly be on subject of broken bone will be able to do that asked what will be effect will be light active dear lady ah here be other dear lady come to join mr quantock have certainly made one of diplomatic error on occasion have acquiesced on telephone in guru going to tiffin with lucia about middle of lunch have be unable to resist desire to know what be happening at hurst must not bear thought lucia guru be together now own note saying that be uncertain whether guru must come to garden party not filled with most uneasy apprehension must sooner have acquiesced in guru going to fifty garden party where be public must keep eye control on rather than lucia must have enticed in be phrase like to tiffin only consolation be that own lunch have be practically inedible robert have languished lamentably for guru to return save stomach have left glowering over little mud water called coffee robert at rate must welcome return of guru waddled across lawn to where harmonious party be sitting at moment lucia began to feel vindictive calm of victory have permeated when brought guru in to lunch without bother at be troubled broken up darling daisy note containing outrageous falsity that guru must not certainly accept invitation have never be permitted to reach at assumed more sinister aspect clearly now daisy have intended to keep to herself fact that already suspected have made hostile invasion guru dear naughty thing said mr quantock playfully after usual salutation have passed why did not tell chela must not be home for tiffin guru have unwound leg stood up see beloved lady said how pleasant be take not too much thought when be only white soul who be together mr quantock patted shoulder be good kind om said send out message of love there be necessary to descend from high altitude lucia proceeded to do so a in parachute dropped swiftly at first then floated in still air be making such lovely plan dear daisy said guru be going to teach class be held hand up to head palm outwards closed eye seem to feel call said be sent surely guide tell there be sending of what call class yes teach learn learn leave to will walk little way off to arbour meditate then when have arranged will tell guru who be servant salaam om with guru in own house with intention to annex be wonder that lucia took part of chairman in meeting be to settle detail of esoteric brotherhood be to be formed in riseholme have not mr quantock be actually present lucia in revenge for outrageous conduct about garden party invitation must probably have left out of class altogether with sitting firm square in basket chair that creaked querulously a moved must not be completely ignored lucia took lead throughout suggested straightaway that smoking parlour must be most convenient place to hold class in must not think of invading house dear daisy said here be smoking parlour one ever sits in so quiet peaceful yes will consider settled then turned briskly to mr quantock now where will guru stay said must be too bad dear daisy if be to profit by class that must have trouble expense of entertaining for in sweet little house must be great inconvenience think said that husband have given up dressing room to mr quantock made desperate effort to retain property inconvenience at said quite contrary in fact dear be delightful having robert regard a most desirable inmate lucia pressed hand feelingly husband be too unselfish said often have said 'daisy mr robert be most unselfish people know ' have georgie ca permit to be so crowded only spare room know husband dressing room georgie know agree with must not permit dear daisy to be so unselfish bird like eye produced compelling effect on georgie so short time ago have indulged in revolutionary idea have contemplated having guru olga bracely to dinner without even asking lucia now faint stirring of revolt faded like snow in summer knew quite well what lucia next proposition must be knew too that must agree to must never do said be simply trespassing on mr quantock good nature if be to board lodge while teach of wish must take in with hermy ursy coming tonight have a little room a mr quantock will come here said lucia brightly a if have just that moment thought of there be hamlet othello vacant room be named after shakespearian play will not be least inconvenient will peppino will really like having here will consider settled then daisy made perfectly futile effort to send forth message of love to quarter of compass bitterly repented of having ever mentioned guru to lucia have never occurred to that must annex like while be cudgelling brain a to how must arrest powerful offensive lucia went sublimely on then there be question of what will pay said dear daisy tell that scarcely know what money be for one must never dream of profiting by wisdom if be to pay nothing for labourer be worthy of hire so suppose teacher be what if pay five shilling lesson will make pound lesson dear will be busy august now how many class will ask to give must say six to begin with if everybody agrees one day for next week except sunday be what wish yes then will consider settled mr quantock still impotently rebelling resorted to most dire weapon in armoury namely sarcasm perhaps darling lucia said must be well to ask guru if have anything to say to settling england be free country still even if happen to have come from india lucia have deadlier weapon than sarcasm be apparent unconsciousness of there having be for be use plunging dagger into enemy heart if produce effect whatever on clapped hand together gave peal of silvery laughter what good idea said then must like to go tell what propose just a like will trot away will see if agrees think of stirring dear daisy know how feel heat sit quiet in shade a know be real salamander sun be never troppo caldo for tripped off to where guru be sitting in wonderful position have read article in encyclopaedia about yoga right through again morning have quite made up mind a indeed proceeding have just shown that yoga be to put irreverently to be august stunt be still so deep in meditation that must only look dreamily in direction a approached then with long sigh got up be beautiful place said be full of sweet influence have have high talk with guide lucia felt thrilled ah do tell what said to exclaimed told to follow where be led said must settle everything for in wisdom love be most encouraging for decidedly lucia have be settling for opinion of guide be thus direct personal testimonial faint twitching of conscience be of very faintest that have grabbed dear daisy property be once for ever quieted proceeded confidently to unfold settlement of wisdom love met with guru entire approval shut eye moment breathed deeply give peace blessing said be who ordered that must be so om seemed to sink into profound depth of meditation lucia hurried back to group have left be too wonderful said guide have told that be settling everything for in wisdom love so may be sure be right in plan how lovely to think that have be guided by dear daisy how wonderful be will send across for thing will will have hamlet othello made ready for bitter though be to part with guru be impious to rebel against ordinance of guide there be trace of human resentment in daisy answer thing exclaimed have got thing in world material possession chain down to earth will soon come to darling lucia occurred to georgie that guru have certainly got bottle of brandy there be use in introducing topic might lead to discord indeed even a lucia went indoors to see about hamlet othello guru having emerged from meditation joined sat down by mr quantock beloved lady said be peace happiness guide have spoken to so lovingly of say be best guru must come here perhaps will return later to kind house smiled when asked that just now send here there be more need of here for already have so much light certainly guide be very tactful people for nothing must have soothed mr quantock so effectually a message of kind must certainly report to lucia when returned from seeing about hamlet othello oh do say have much light already guru dear asked be nice of surely said now will go back to house leave sweet thought there for will send sweet thought to home of kind gentleman next door georgie eagerly welcomed proposition for with hermy ursy coming that evening felt that must have plenty of use for sweet thought even forebore to complete in own mind conjecture be forming there namely that though guru must be leaving sweet thought for mr quantock must probably be taking away brandy bottle for georgie knew be only too apt to indulge in secret cynicism perhaps there be brandy to take away by time lo behold be being cynical again sun be still hot when hour afterwards got into open cab have ordered to take to station to meet hermy ursy put up umbrella with white linen cover to shield from did not take motor because hermy ursy must have insisted on driving did not choose to put in charge in year that have lived at riseholme never remembered time when social event work called have be so exciting varied there be hermy ursy coming evening olga bracely husband olga bracely mr shuttleworth sounded vaguely improper georgie rather liked that be coming tomorrow there be lucia garden party day after day there be to be lesson from guru so that god alone knew when georgie must have moment to for embroidery to practise mozart trio with hair chestnut coloured to very root shining nail comfortable boot felt extremely young fit for anything soon under influence of new creed with posture breathing must feel younger more vigorous yet wished that have be who have found pamphlet on eastern philosophy have led mr quantock to make inquiry have resulted in epiphany of guru of course when once lucia have heard about be certain to constitute head leader of movement be really remarkable how completely have done that in meeting in garden just now have just sailed through mr quantock a calmly a steamer cut through water of sea throwing off from penetrating bow like spent wave baffled though be for moment georgie have be aware that mr quantock seethed with revolutionary idea deeply resented confiscation of what be certainly property though be impotent to stop georgie knew just what felt be very well to say that lucia scheme be entirely in accord with purpose of guide might be so mr quantock must not cease to think that have be robbed yet nothing mattered if class found getting young active loving excellent under tuition be that notion have taken such entire command of for part georgie did not really care who owned guru so to speak if only got benefit of teaching for social purpose lucia have annexed doubtless with in house must get little instruction hint must not count a lesson after georgie have still got olga bracely to for have not breathed word of advent to lucia felt rather like one who when revolutionary idea be in air have concealed revolver in pocket did not formulate to precisely what be going to do with gave sense of power to know be there train came in looked in vain for sister have distinctly said be arriving by in couple of minute be perfectly clear that have done nothing of kind for only person who got out be mr weston cook who a world knew went into brinton wednesday to buy fish at rear of train however be immense quantity of luggage being taken out must not be mr weston fish indeed even at distance there be something familiar to georgie about very large green hold be dumped there perhaps hermy ursy have travelled in van because be such lark for other tomboy reason went down platform to investigate there be bag of golf club dog portmanteau even a conviction dawned on that have seen of object before guard to whom georgie always gave crown when travelled by train presented with note scrawled in pencil ran dearest georgie be such lovely day that when got to paddington ursy decided to bicycle down instead so for lark sent thing on may arrive tonight probably tomorrow take care of tiptree give plenty of jam love yours hermy p tipsipoozie doe really bite be only fun georgie crumpled up odious epistle became aware that tipsipoozie lean irish terrier be regarding with peculiar disfavour shewing teeth probably in fun in pursuance of humorous idea then darted towards georgie must have be extremely funny if have not be handicapped by bag of golf club to be tethered a be pursued down platform towing club after till got entangled in fell down georgie hated dog at time though have never hated one so much a tipsipoozie problem of life became more complicated than ever certainly be not going to drive back with tipsipoozie in cab became necessary to hire for abominable hound rest of luggage what on earth be to happen when arrived home if tipsipoozie did not drop fun become serious foljambe be true liked dog so perhaps dog liked be most tarsome of hermy thought georgie bitterly wonder what guru must do there ensued very trying ten minute in station master porter georgie mr weston maid called tipsipoozie good dog a lay on ground snapping promiscuously at who praised eventually valiant porter picked up bag of club by holding out in front of at extreme length of arm in manner of fishing rod with tipsipoozie on short chain at other end of bag like savage fish cursing swearing managed to propel into cab there be half crown gone georgie thereupon got into cab sped homewards in order to arrive there first consult with foljambe foljambe usually thought of something foljambe came out at noise of arriving wheel georgie explained absence of sister advent of atrocious dog be very fierce said like jam foljambe gave that supreme smile sometimes georgie resented now hailed a if be angel face smile will see to sir said have brought up tea will take care foljambe wo asked expect 'd better take care returned intrepid woman georgie a often said trusted foljambe completely must explain why went into drawing room shut door looked out of window when second cab arrived opened door put arm inside next moment emerged again with tipsipoozie on end of chain making extravagant exhibition of delight then to georgie horror drawing room door opened in came tipsipoozie without chain at rapidly sending message of love in direction like s o s call georgie put small chair in front of to shield leg tipsipoozie evidently thought be game hid behind sofa to rush out again from ambush just got snappy being tied to golf club remarked foljambe georgie a put jam into saucer must not help wondering whether message of love have not done dined alone for hermy ursy did not appear have great polishing of knick knack afterwards while waiting for one ever felt anxious at non arrival of sister for always turned up from otter hunting golf sooner later chiefly later in highest spirit at lark have have with amazingly dirty hand prodigious appetite when twelve o'clock struck decided to give up idea of appearance that night having given tipsipoozie more jam comfortable bed in woodshed went to room though knew be still possible that might be roused by wild cooees shower of gravel at window have to come down minister to gross appetite prospect seemed improbable soon went to sleep georgie awoke with start hour later wondering what have disturbed there be gravel rattling on window violent ringing of bicycle bell loud genial shout outraging decorous calm of riseholme certainly have heard something next moment repeated noise sent heart leaping into throat for quite distinctly heard muffled sound in room below instantly diagnosed with fatal certainty a burglar first emotion mingled with sheer terror be passionate regret that hermy ursy have not come must have thought tremendous lark must have invented wonderful offensive with fire iron golf club dumb bell even tipsipoozie lately abhorred must have be succour in crisis why oh why have not georgie have to sleep in bedroom instead of making cosy in woodshed must have let tipsipoozie sleep on lovely blue quilt for remainder of day if only tipsipoozie must have be with now ready to have fun with burglar below a be servant be in attic at top of house dicky slept out georgie be alone with prospect of having to defend property at risk of life even at moment a sat up in bed blanched with terror miscreant might be putting treasure into pocket thought of faberge cigarette case louis xvi snuff box queen anne toy porringer have inherited year made even life seem cheap for life must be intolerable without sprang out of bed groped for slipper since until have made plan be wiser not to shew light shuffled noiselessly towards door chapter six door handle felt icy to finger already frozen with fright stood firmly grasping ready to turn noiselessly when have quite made up mind what to do first expedient suggested with overpowering sweetness of relief be that of locking door going back to bed again pretending that have heard nothing apart from sheer cowardice of did not mind so much a nobody else must ever know guilt thought of burglar going off quite unmolested with property be intolerable even if must not summon up enough courage to get downstairs with life poker in hand must at least give good fright have frightened so must frighten must not have own way if decided not to attack single handed must at least thump on floor call out burglar at top of voice shout charles henry thomas a if summoning bevy of stalwart footman objection to course however must be that foljambe somebody else might hear in case if did not then go downstairs to mortal combat knowledge of cowardice must be property of others beside time hesitated be probably filling pocket with dearest possession tried to send out message of love be totally unable to do so then little clock in mantelpiece struck two be miserable hour sundered so far from dawn though have lived through year of agony since got out of bed actual passage of time a stood frozen to door handle be duration of few brief second then making tremendous call on courage felt way to fireplace picked up poker tongs shovel rattled treacherously hoped that have not be heard for essence of plan though have yet idea what plan be must be silence till awful surprise broke upon if only must summon police must come rushing downstairs with poker a professional supporter of law gained entrance to house unfortunately telephone be downstairs must not reasonably hope to carry on conversation with police station without being overheard by burglar opened door with so masterly movement that there be sound either from hinge from handle a turned peered out hall below be dark long pencil of light came from drawing room showed where reckless brute must be there too ala be case of treasure then suddenly heard sound of voice speaking very low voice answered at georgie heart sank for proved that there must be at least two burglar odds against be desperate after came low cruel laugh unmistakable sound of rattle of knife fork explosive uncorking of bottle at heart sank even lower yet for have read that cool habitual burglar always have supper before got to work therefore be about to deal with gang of professional also that explosive uncorking clearly indicated champagne knew that be feasting on best how wicked of to take unhallowed meal in drawing room for there be proper table there must be making dreadful mess over everything current of cool night air swept up stair georgie saw panel of light from open drawing room door diminish in width presently door shut with soft thud leaving in dark at desperation seemed pressed concentrated into moment of fictitious courage for unerringly reasoned that have left drawing room window open perhaps in few moment now must have finished meal with bulging pocket must step forth unchallenged into night why have never have bolt put on shutter like mr weston who lived in nightly terror of burglar be too late to think of now for be impossible to ask to step out till have put bolt up then when be ready begin again must not let go gorged with champagne laden with treasure without reprisal of sort keeping thought steadily away from revolver club sandbag walked straight downstairs threw open drawing room door with poker grasped in shaking hand cried out in faint thin voice if move will fire there be moment of dead silence little dazzled with light saw what faced at opposite end of chippendale sofa sat hermy ursy hermy have mouth open held bun in dirty hand ursy have mouth shut cheek be bulging between be ham loaf of bread pot of marmalade stilton cheese on floor be bottle of champagne with two brimming bubbling tea cup full of wine cork wire tin foil have with show of decency thrown into fireplace hermy put down bun gave great shout of laughter ursy mouth be disgustingly full exploded then lay back against arm of sofa howled georgie be very much vexed upon word hermy said then found be not nearly strong enough expression in moment of ungovernable irritation said damn hermy showed sign of recovery first a georgie came back after shutting window must find voice while ursy collected small fragment of ham bread have partially chewed lord what lark said georgie be most ripping lark ursy pointed to poker will fire if move cried poke fire be ask screamed hermy oh dear thought be burglar came down with poker brave boy be positively limit have drink georgie suddenly eye grew round awestruck pointing with finger to georgie shoulder went off into yell of laughter ursy hair said buried face in soft cushion naturally georgie have not put hair in order when came downstairs for nobody think about thing like when be going to encounter burglar single handed there be bald pate long tress hanging down one side be most annoying when irremediable annoyance have absolutely occurred only possible thing for decent person to do be to take a lightly a possible georgie rose gallantly to occasion gave little squeal ran from room down again presently called out have heavy fall on stair a went up to bedroom there have short argument with be possible to slam door go to bed be very polite in morning must never do hermy ursy must have joke against forever be really much better to share in joke identifying with so brushed hair in orthodox fashion put on very smart dressing gown came tripping downstairs again dear what fun said let have supper let move into dining room where there be table will get bottle of wine glass will bring tipsipoozie in naughty girl fancy arriving at time like suppose plan be to go very quietly to bed come down to breakfast in morning give fine surprise tell about now so presently tipsipoozie be having marmalade did just a well a jam be eating slice

foraged there be jolly plucky of georgie to come down beard real sport said hermy how old fol de rol de ray why did come down fight too georgie guessed that hermy be making humourous allusion to foljambe who be one person in riseholme whom two sister seemed to hold in respect ursy have once set booby trap for georgie mixed biscuit brazil nut have descended on foljambe instead on occasion foljambe girt about in impenetrable calm have behaved a if nothing have happened trod on biscuit brazil nut without smile unaware to appearance that there be anything whatever crunching exploding beneath foot have somehow quelled two who a soon a left room again swept up mess put uninjured brazil nut back into dessert dish must never do if foljambe lost prestige be alluded to by outrageously slangy name if mean foljambe said georgie icily be because did think while to disturb in spite of ride indefatigable sister be up early next morning first thing georgie saw out of bathroom window be pair of practising lifting shot over ducking pond on green till breakfast be ready have given short account of last night adventure to foljambe when called omitting episode about hair disapproval be strongly indicated by silence then studied contempt of manner to sister when came in to breakfast hullo foljambe said hermy have rare lark last night so understand miss said foljambe got in through

subject thrilled to marrow be breathing exercise contortion if persevered in must give youth activity faultless digestion indefatigable energy sat on floor stopped up alternate nostril held breath till mr quantock got purple in face georgie lucia red expelled breath again with sudden puff set rush on floor quivering with long quiet exhalation then there be certain posture to be learned in one of entailing bending of body backwards two of georgie trouser button came off with sharp snap felt corresponding member of brace thus violently released spring up to shoulder various other embarrassing noise issued from lucia daisy sounded like bursting of string tape everybody pretended to hear nothing at covered up report of explosion with coughing clearing of throat apart from discordance everything be fairly harmonious indeed so far from daisy introducing discord wore fixed smile must have be purely cynical to call superior when lucia asked amazingly simple question with regard to om sighed too at interval sigh be expressive of nothing patience resignation till lucia ignorance of most elementary doctrine be enlightened though rather pointedly looked in direction hers appeared completely unaware of presence have not after come here to look at lucia to listen to own whatever lucia might say guru at end lucia with far away look emerged might say in dazed condition from hearing about fastness of thibet where guru have be in commune with guide whose wisdom interpreted to feel such difference already said dreamily feel a if must never be hasty worried more at

for own with same odious greed a be already exhibiting with regard to guru year georgie have be faithful servant coadjutor now for first time spirit of independence have begun to seethe within scale be falling from eye just a turned into shelter of mulberry tree put on spectacle to see how riseholme be getting on without to assist at morning parliament absence mr quantock must be sure to evoke comment since yoga class be always to take place at half past twelve fact that must never be there must soon rise to level of first class mystery must of course begin to leak out that lucia be having course of eastern philosophy made pupil young light energetic there be sensation like great discovery solution of lucia foxy look broke on with suddenness of lightning flash since have be settled that must call for at six stationed in window of bathroom commanded perfect view of village green entrance to ambermere arm at five have brought up with pair of opera glass with intention of taking to bit so have informed foljambe washing lens did not at once proceed about merely holding ready to hand for use hermy ursy have gone back to golf again after lunch so caller must be told that be out thus

inexorability of march of destiny of fate knocking at door in immortal fifth symphony in hand carried note through glass georgie must see quite plainly be not little folded up sheet such a commonly used square thick envelope disappeared in arm georgie began thinking feverishly great deal depended on how long stopped there few little happening beguiled period of waiting mr weston desisted from wild career came to anchor on path just opposite door into arm while gardener boy sank exhausted on to grass be quite easy to guess that proposed to have chat with lucia when came out similarly miss antrobuses who have paid attention to at before ceased from pretty gambolings ran up to talk to so wanted word too colonel boucher little le obviously began throwing stick into ducking pond for bull

hand to a turned away so talk italian too thought georgie a dropped little crumb of information to friend on way to house domani mean tomorrow oh yes be meaning lunch be hardly necessary to add on table in hall there be one of lucia commoner kind of note merely half sheet folded together in own manner georgie felt that be scarcely more necessary to read for felt quite sure that contained excuse for not coming to house at six in order to call on mr mr bracely gave glance at before rolled up in ball for tipsipoozie to play with found content to be precisely what expected excuse being that have not done practising post script be interesting for told that have asked foljambe to give copy of siegfried georgie strolled down past hurst before dinner mozart be silent now there came out of open window most amazing hash of sound must just recognise a being piano arrangement of duet between brunnhilde siegfried at end must have be dull indeed if have not instantly guessed what that signified chapter seven fresh thrill went through atmosphere already super saturated with excitement when next morning lucia friend who have be bidden to garden party tightum be rung up on telephone informed that party be hightum that caused good deal of extra work because tightum robe have to be put away again hightums aired brushed valetted be well worth for riseholme have not slightest difficulty in conjecturing that olga bracely be to be among guest for cultured artistic centre presence of star blazed so regally in very zenith of firmament of art absolutely demanded hightum presence of poor lady ambermere though must not have liked have be powerless to bring out of cupboard delightful anticipation concentrated into one rose coloured point of joy when le than two independent observer without collusion saw piano tuner entering leaving hurst while third ear witness unmistakably heard tuning of piano actually going on be thus clear to penetrating mind olga bracely be going to sing be further known that something be going on between georgie for have be heard by one miss antrobus to ask for georgie number at telephone in ambermere arm etiquette forbade actually to listen to what passed must not help hearing olga laugh at something presumably that georgie said took part in green parliament that morning have be seen to dash into fruiterer out again before went in great hurry to hurst shortly after twelve thirty class on eastern philosophy under tuition of mr quantock indian be already beginning to be hinted at today in breathless excitement about prima donna nobody cared about might have be taking lesson in cannibalism nobody must have be interested finally about one o'clock one of motor in party have arrived yesterday drew up at door of ambermere arm presently mr bracely dear mr shuttleworth got in drove off alone be very odd conduct in lately married bridegroom be hoped that there have be no quarrel olga have of course be given direction a to hightum tightum when walked across to georgie house shortly after half past one only mr weston who be going back home to lunch at top speed be aware that be dressed in very simple dark blue morning frock must almost have passed for scrub be true that be exceedingly well cut have not look of having be rolled up in ball hastily ironed out again that usually distinguished scrub also wore string of particularly fine pearl round neck sort of ornament that in riseholme must only be seen in evening hightum even if anybody in riseholme have owned such thing lucia not long ago have expressed opinion that jewel be vulgar except at night for part wore none at preferring one greek cameo of uncertain authenticity georgie received olga alone for hermy ursy be not yet back from golf be good of to let come without husband said excuse be toothache have driven into brinton be very sorry said georgie need be for now will tell real reason thought that if lunched with must have to come on to garden party that be absolutely

done have odd nature when thing be done settled there be help for find adorable also find fatal objection to doing at if be consulted about before be done so not word will buy make garden furnish down to minutest detail engage servant then will give for birthday present have to tell somebody must burst georgie nearly swooned with fervour admiration what perfect plan said really like little riseholme be not question of liking be mere detail of not being able to do without like breathing must die if did want delicious hole in corner lazy backwater sort of place where nothing ever happens nobody ever doe anything have be observing morning habit be adorable nothing ever happens here will precisely suit when get away from work georgie be nearer swooning than ever at must hardly believe ear when talked of riseholme being lazy backwater almost thought must have be speaking of london where a lucia have acutely observed people sat in park morning talked of other affair spent afternoon at picture gallery danced night there be flippant lazy existence be far too much absorbed in project to notice stupefaction if breathe word said everything will be spoilt have to burst on georgie oh there be mulberry tree in garden a well a one in front be too much eye followed foljambe out of door know parlour maid be called paravicini grosvenor said be foljambe said georgie laughed knew be right said be practically same thing oh last night never have such awful evening why did warn husband must have have toothache then instead of morning what happened asked woman insane that ambermere parrot mean georgie be ten minute late have jet tiara on why did ask to dine at quarter to eight if meant quarter to eight instead of saying half past seven be actually going into dinner when came mournful procession of three moth eaten men three whiskered woman upon procession broke up a if have be riot act be arranged again a funeral procession georgie with lady ambermere be hearse dined in family vault talked about lady ambermere be pug talked about too said be of county family that mr lucas be very decent sort of woman that be going to look in on garden party today then looked at pearl asked if be genuine so looked at teeth there be need to ask about miss out moment said georgie greedily whenever lady ambermere spoke everybody else be silent did grasp at first for one have explained rule so stopped in middle of sentence waited till have finished then went on again precisely where have left off then when came into drawing room whiskered lady there little woman like mouse sitting there nobody introduced so naturally went to talk to before great parrot said kindly fetch wool work miss lyall ' miss lyall took sack out of corner inside be sacred carpet then waited for coffee cigarette waited waited be waiting still parrot said that coffee always kept awake be why then georgie came in with others must see by face that have have cigarette be then half past nine then man sat down between two woman pug sat in middle looked for flea then lady ambermere got up came across charmed circle to said ' hope have brought music mr shuttleworth kindly open piano miss lyall be always considered remarkably fine instrument olga waved fork on be impaled piece of pineapple georgie have purchased that morning at fruiterer stupendous cheek said thought must be joke laughed with greatest politeness be will hardly believe be one of whiskered one said that will be great treat put on face that everyone wear at concert be so stunned that sang lady ambermere beat time pug barked pointed finger at georgie never till day of judgment said when lady ambermere gnashes beautiful teeth for ever ever will set foot in house again in house will set fire to sooner there dear what good lunch have given may play croquet at once lucia garden party be scheduled from four to seven hour before earliest guest might be expected be casting eagle eye over preparation today be on very sumptuous scale bowl be laid out in bowling alley not because anybody in hightums dress be least likely to risk stooping down strong movement that game entailed because bowl be elizabethan between alley lawn nearer to house be large marquee where commoner crowd though crowd must be really common in riseholme must refresh even where none be common there may still be degree in rarity by side of general refreshment room be smaller tent carpeted with oriental rug having inside half dozen chair two seat can only be described a throne for lady ambermere olga bracely while lucia guru though throneworthy must very kindly sit in one of most interesting attitude on floor tent be designed only for high converse common guest if be good must be led into introduced to great presence while for refreshment of presence in interval of audience more elaborate meal with peach four sort of sandwich be laid in smoking parlour thus guest for whom audience be not provided must have felicity of seeing great one pas across lawn on excursion for food possibly trip over croquet hoop have be left up to give air of naturalness to lawn in smoking parlour elzevir two be left negligently open a if mr mr lucas have be reading work of persius juvenal when first guest arrived in music room finally be not usually open on occasion there be fresh flower piano too be open if have not seen elzevirs in smoking parlour must have be reasonable for early guest if penetrated here to imagine that mr lucas have be running over last act of siegfried minute before in visit of final inspection lucia be accompanied by guru for be part of domestic dramatis persona wanted to be discovered in special tent pointed out site of proposed discovery to probably first person will bring in here said will be lady ambermere for be noted for punctuality be so anxious to see must not be exciting if found have met before husband be governor of madras spent many year in india madras gracious lady asked guru too know madras there be many dark spirit in madras be at english residency yes say mr kipling know nothing about india will have much to talk about wish must sit on floor too listen to what say to other will be great treat said guru thoughtfully love who love wonderful country suddenly stopped put hand up to head palm outward there be wonderful vibration today said day feel that word be on way from guide great message of light oh must be wonderful if came to in middle of garden party said lucia enthusiastically ah gracious lady great word come not so come always in solitude quiet gracious lady know that a well a guru pure guruism social pre eminence struggled together in lucia guruism told that ought to be ecstatic at idea of great message coming must instantly smile on desire for solitude quiet while social pre eminence whispered to that have already dangled presence of high caste mystic from benares before eye of lady ambermere who only came from madras on other hand olga bracely be to be even more resplendent guest than lady ambermere guru surely olga bracely be enough to set particular garden party on giddiest of pinnacle awful consequence lurked a possibility if attempted to force guru not to immune in solitude quiet be that conceivably might choose to go back to pit whence be digged namely house of poor daisy quantock thought be intolerable for with in house have seen a dispenser of eastern mystery mistress of omism to riseholme in fact guru be august stunt must never do to lose before end of july rage to see riseholme making pilgrimage to daisy there be thin lipped firmness too about at moment felt that under provocation might easily defy desert felt have to yield so decided to do so in most complete manner ah yes said know how true be dear guru go up to hamlet one will disturb there if message come through before lady ambermere go away promise will come back went back to house where front door be already open to admit lady ambermere who be telling people when to come back for fled with heel of slipper tapping on oak stair up to hamlet softly shut out dark spirit from madras made even more secure by turning key in door must never do to appear a high caste brahmin from benares before anyone who knew india with such fatal intimacy for might not entirely correspond with preconceived notion of such person lady ambermere arrival be soon followed by of other guest instead of going into special tent reserved for lion took up commanding position in middle of lawn where must examine everybody through tortoiseshell handled lorgnette kept peppino by who darted forward to shake hand with wife guest then darted back again to poor miss lyall stood behind chair from time to time a ordered gave cape put up parasol adjusted footstool for took up pug put down a patroness required most of time lady ambermere kept up majestic monologue have pretty little garden here mr lucas said though perhaps inconveniently small croquet lawn doe not look to full size then there be tennis court think have little strip of grass somewhere use for bowl have not presently will walk around with see domain put pug down again please miss lyall let run about see want to play with one of croquet ball put in motion for will run with bless who be that coming up path at tremendous speed in bath chair oh see be mr weston must not go a fast a if pug be to stray on to path must be run over better pick up pug again miss lyall till have gone by here be colonel boucher if have brought bull dog must have asked to take away again must like cup of tea miss lyall with plenty of milk in not too strong know how like tea biscuit something for pug with little cream in saucer anything be handy wo come into smoking parlour have tea there lady ambermere asked peppino smoking parlour asked how very strange to lay tea in smoking room peppino explained that nobody have in probability used smoking parlour to smoke in for five six year oh if be so will come said better bring pug along too miss lyall there be croquet hoop be glad saw must have stumbled over perhaps oh be smoking parlour be why do have rush on floor put pug in chair miss lyall may prick paw book too see that one lying be old one be latin poetry library at hall be very famous for classical literature first viscount collected number many thousand of volume indeed be most wonderful library said peppino can never tear away from when be at hall wonder be great student often spend morning there do not miss lyall must have new glass put in window mr lucas on dark day must be very difficult to see here by way good wife told that there must probably be very remarkable indian at party brahmin from benares said must like to have talk with while be having tea kindly prepare peach for miss lyall peppino have heard about retirement of guru in consequence of message from guide being expected proceeded to explain to lady ambermere who did not take slightest notice a be looking at peach through lorgnette that one nearest look eatable said then see miss olga bracely though distinctly told must be here afternoon said mr lucas have asked sang to yesterday evening at hall very creditably indeed husband mr shuttleworth be cousin of late lord lucia have come into smoking parlour during speech heard fatal word at moment must gladly have recalled invitation to olga bracely altogether sooner than have alluded therein to mr bracely be one of irremediable thing of life since be use wasting regret on be only more eager for olga to come husband name be braced up to situation peppino be looking after lady ambermere said dear lady ambermere hope be taking care of very decent peach said lady ambermere south wall of garden be covered with be always of peculiarly delicious flavour hall be famed for peach understood that miss bracely be going to be here mr lucas can not imagine what make so late be always famed for punctuality have finished tea lawn outside be now growing thick with people in hightums lady ambermere a emerged from smoking parlour again viewed scene with marked disfavour two miss antrobuses have just arrived skipped up to hostess with pretty cry be dreadfully late said eldest be piggy fault goosie be yours said other how can be so naughty a to say be mine dear mr lucas what lovely party be being may go play bowl lady ambermere regarded retreating back a raced off with arm intertwined to bowling green who be young lady asked why piggy goosie miss lyall let pug go to bowl be very heavy elsewhere mr antrobus be slowly advancing from group to group with trumpet violently engaged in receiving refreshment conversation be not quite so varied a usual for there be attitude of intense expectation about with regard to appearance of miss bracely that made talk rather jerky unconnective then also have gone about that mysterious indian who have be seen now then during last week be actually staying with mr lucas why be not here more unconjecturable yet though not so thrillingly interesting be absence of mr georgie what must have happened to that be not flitting about on hostess errand being life soul of party be in vain that mr antrobus plodded on methodical course seeking answer to riddle mr weston in swifter progression dashed about in bath chair from group to group people seemed to be talking in animated manner must learn nothing mr antrobus must learn nothing in fact only information to be have on subject be what mr weston supplied have very high coloured handsome face extremely impressive manner a if be imparting information of very highest importance naturally spoke in loud clear voice so that have not got to raise much even when addressed mr antrobus wealth of discursive detail be absolutely unrivalled be quite best observer in riseholme last saw of miss bracely said exactly a if have be told to describe something on oath in witness box be little after past one today must have be after past because when got home be close on quarter to two be hundred yard from house when saw a soon a saw said to gardener boy henry luton who be pushing be son of old mr luton who kept fish shop when died last year began to get fish from brinton for did fancy look of new person who took on business henry went to live with aunt be father sister not mother for mr luton never have sister brother either well said to henry 'you can go bit slower henry a be late be late minute two more doe make difference ' ma'be ' said henry touching cap so went slower miss bracely be just opposite ducking pond then presently came out between elm have just ordinary morning frock on be dark blue about same shade a cape mr antrobus perhaps little darker for sunshine brightened up quite simple be nothing grand looked at watch on wrist seemed to to walk little quicker after a if be bit late just a be slower than be going must not go for be crawling along before got off grass have come to corner of church lane though turned head round sharp like at very last moment so a to catch last of have more than stepped off grass onto road before laurestinus at corner of colonel boucher garden of vicar garden hid from if ask mr weston stopped for moment nodding head up down to emphasize importance of what have said to raise expectation of mr antrobus to highest pitch a to what be coming if ask where think be going what be going to do said believe be going out to lunch that be going to one of house there just across road for made bee line across green towards well there be three house there there be mr quantock must have be else mr quantock must have have news of colonel boucher must have be that for colonel must have have news of know whose third house just there be mr antrobus have not completely followed powerful reasoning colonel boucher mr quantock be here eh said mr weston raised voice little be what be saying announced who be here whom must expect to see where be house be generally felt that mr weston have hit nail on head what that nail precisely be one knew because have not explained why olga bracely georgie be absentee now came climax bang on top of nail shrewd straight stroke so there be having lunch with mr georgie said mr weston now introducing name for first time with highest dramatic art must be seeing round house afterwards then when be time to come here mr georgie must have remembered that party be hightum not tightum there be miss bracely not in hightum at even tightum in opinion scrub doubt said to 'be very grand sort of party mr pillson must do other than reply for received notice that be hightum mine came about twelve must do other than reply 'yes miss bracely be 'good gracious must say 'and have only got old rag on must go back to ambermere arm tell maid for brought maid in second motor tell maid to put out something tidy 'but will be great bother for ' must say something of sort for pretend to know what actually did say must reply 'oh mr pillson must put on something tidy must be so kind of if must wait for while do let go together be what said mr weston made sign to gardener to proceed wishing to leave stage at moment of climax be why be late said be whirled away in direction of bowling green minute went on still nobody appeared who must possibly have accounted for three lined whip of hightums by degree lucia who have utterly failed to decoy lady ambermere into place of throne began to notice certain thinning on lawn guest must seem be not in process of dispersal for be long way off seven o'clock yet also none must be so ill mannered a to leave without shaking hand saying what delicious afternoon have spent certainly lawn grew emptier be utterly unable to explain extraordinary phenomenon until happened to go close to window of music room then looking in saw that not only be chair there occupied people be standing about in expectant group for moment heart beat high must olga have arrived by mistake have gone straight in there be dreamlike possibility burst like ray of sunshine on party be rapidly becoming nightmare to for everyone not lady ambermere alone be audibly wondering when guru be coming when miss bracely be going to sing at moment a paused window in music room be opened be odious head looked out oh mr lucas said goosie have got beautiful seat mamma be quite close to piano where will hear excellently have promised to sing siegfried be mr georgie going to play for be most delicious surprise how must be so sly clever a not to tell anybody lucia cloaked rage under most playful manner a ran into music room through hall naughty thing said do come into garden be garden party must guess where have gone what be about singing playing know nothing of herded incredulous crowd out into garden again in hightums one of only to meet lady ambermere with pug miss lyall coming in better be going miss lyall said kindly run out find people oh here mr lucas be very pleasant indeed thank good bye charming garden yes oh be very early said lucia be hardly six yet indeed said lady ambermere be so charming marched out after miss lyall out into shakespeare garden be soon terribly evident that other people be sharing lady ambermere conclusion about delight of afternoon necessity of getting home colonel boucher have to take bull dog for run walk off excitement of party piggy goosie explained to mother that nobody be going to sing by silvery laughter tried to drown just indignation presently lucia have agony of seeing mr quantock seated on one of throne have be designed for much worthier end peppino sitting in other while few guest drifted about lawn with purposelessness of autumn leaf what with guru presumably meditating upstairs still with olga bracely most conspicuously absent have hardly nervous energy left to wonder what must have become of georgie never in year of ministry have failed to be at elbow through entire duration of garden party flying about on errand like tripping hermes herding flock if wanted in one part of garden rather than like sagacious sheep dog coming back to heel again ready for further task today georgie be mysteriously away for have applied for leave given explanation however improbable of absence at least must have prevented lady ambermere only cornerstone of party from going away in what must be called huff have continued to tell lucia how marvellous be what beautiful party be having with prospect of two other much more magnificent cornerstone lucia have not provided further entertainment for guest there be not conjurer from brinton three young lady who played banjo trio even mild performing dove

autumn leaf be swept up a be by compelling broom clustered in heap in front of there have be great message word of might full of love peace never have there be word then even before have felt full thrill of once more door from house opened out came olga bracely georgie be true that have still blue morning frock mr weston have designated a scrub be perfectly new scrub if have be completely covered with paris label must not have made provenance one whit clearer dear mr lucas said mr georgie be terribly late be quite fault there be game of croquet must come to end life have be guided by only one principle be to finish game of croquet happens missed six train once by finishing game of croquet mr georgie be so unkind must give cup of tea let change frock dragged off to see won autumn leaf turned green vigorous again while georgie went to get refreshment for conqueror be introduced allowed to be taken with utmost docility how unlike somebody into tent with throne confessed to having stood on tiptoe looked into mr quantock garden wanted to see so much from other side of wall garden too might go wander over garden when have finished most delicious peach that world held be so glad have not have tea with mr georgie must never have given such good peach now departing guest in hightums lingering on village green little being rather sarcastic about utter failure of lucia party must hardly help seeing georgie olga emerge from house proceed swiftly in direction of hurst mr antrobus who retained marvellous eyesight a compensation for defective hearing saw go in simultaneously thought that have left parasol at hurst next moment be walking thoughtfully away in direction mr weston have be next to realize what have happened though have to go round by road in bath chair passed mr antrobus hundred yard from house pretext for going back being that lucia have promised to lend book by antonio caporelli be caporelto so once more door into garden opened out shot mr weston olga by time have made tour of garden might see house might there be pretty music room at stage just a mr weston be poured out in garden a with floodgate being unopened crowd followed came surging into shakespeare garden never have mermaid tail behind be secreted electric bell experienced such feverish usage pressure after pressure invoked aid pretext for re admission be soon not made at simply disregarded by parlour maid colonel boucher might have left bull dog mr antrobus ear trumpet miss antrobus piggy shoe lace other miss antrobus goosie shoe horn in brisk succession guest who have be so sarcastic about party on village green jostled other in order to revisit scene of irony miss olga bracely have be known to enter portal a many of who entered after found guru a well olga be in music room when crowd have congested hall people be introduced to sank down into nearest chair mr antrobus took up old place by keyboard of piano everybody seemed to be expecting something by degree import of longing be borne in upon olga waited waited waited much a have waited for cigarette evening before looked at piano there be comfortable murmur from audience looked at lucia who gave great gasp said nothing at be only person present who be standing now except hostess mr weston gardener who have wheeled mistress chair into admirable position for hearing be not too well pleased after must like to sing asked lucia yes ah there be copy of siegfried do play lucia must not smile more than be smiling already be very diffy asked must read georgie will try slid onto music stool to begin asked finding that olga have opened book at salutation of brunnhilde lucia have practised so diligently morning got answer olga standing by have assumed perfectly different aspect for gaiety lightness be substituted air of intense concentrated seriousness lucia did not understand at be looking straight in front of gathering in paying not smallest attention to lucia anybody else one two said lucia three now plunged wildly into sea of demi semi quaver olga have just opened mouth shut again said once more whistled motif oh be so diffy said lucia beginning again georgie turn over georgie turned over lucia counting audibly to made incomparable mess over piano olga turned to accompanist will try said sat down at piano made sort of sketch of accompaniment simplifying yet retaining essence then sang chapter eight throughout august guruism reigned supreme over cultured life of riseholme priestess dispenser of mystery be lucia never before have ruled from so elate pinnacle wielded so secure supremacy none have access to guru through class be held in smoking parlour meditated only in hamlet in sequestered arbour at end of laburnum walk once have meditated on village green lucia did not approve of have led still rapt home by hand class have swelled prodigiously for practically riseholmites now be at stage of instruction with exception of hermy ursy who pronounced whole thing piffle a gentle chaff for georgie sometimes stood on one leg in middle of lawn held breath then hermy must say one two three shouted om at top of discordant voice now that guru be practically interned in hurst have actually never set eye on for have not chosen to come to hightum garden party preferring to have second round of golf meeting lucia next day have be distinctly irreverent on subject of eastern philosophy since then have not be aware of existence lucia now received special instruction from guru in class by so prodigious be advance in yoga for must hold breath much longer than anybody else have mastered six posture while next class attended also consisted of other original member namely daisy quantock georgie peppino have got on very well too lucia have quite shot away from now if guru have other urgent spiritual claim on gave instruction to le advanced class herself for purpose habited in peculiarly becoming dress of white linen reached to foot have full flowing sleeve like surplice be girdled with silver cord with long tassel have mother of pearl button hood at back lined with white satin came over head below hem a sat taught in really rather advanced posture showed toe of white morocco slipper called teacher robe class taught consisted of colonel boucher piggy antrobus mr weston sometimes colonel brought bull dog with who lay snorted precisely a if be doing breathing exercise too general air of joyful mystery spiritual endeavour blew balmily round without doubt exercise deep breathing be extremely good for one evening towards end of month georgie be sitting in garden for half hour before dressing time thinking how busy be yet how extraordinarily young fresh felt usually month when hermy ursy be with be very fatiguing in ordinary year must have driven away with foljambe dicky on day after departure have quiet week by seaside now though sister be going away tomorrow morning have intention of taking well earned rest in spite of fact that not only have be host time have done amazing quantity of other thing a well there have be daily class to begin with entailed much work in way of meditation exercise a well a actual learning also have have job might easily have taxed energy to utmost other year for olga bracely have definitely bought that house without have felt that life be not worth living georgie month have at request be exercising semi independent supervision over decoration furnishing have ordered general scheme herself have sent down from london greater part of furniture georgie be commissioned to report on likely piece of old stuff that must find if expedition be necessary to act on own responsibility buy above secrecy be still necessary till house be so complete that georgie might be told by end of month riseholme generally be in state of prostration following on violent feverish curiosity a to who have taken house georgie have gone so far a to confess that knew most pathetic appeal a to owner identity have fallen on obdurate if not deaf ear not smallest hint must give on subject though incessant visit to house searchings for furniture bestowal of in suitable place superintendence of making of garden interviewings of paperhanger plumber upholsterer painter carpenter so forth occupied great deal of time delicious mystery about fact that be doing for so adorable creature rendered exertion positive refreshment thing in conjunction with youth giving study made feel younger than ever be discreet arrival perfect success of toupet no longer be there need to fear dislocation of espaliered lock felt so secure undetectable in regard that have taken to wearing hat be soon about to say that hair be growing more thickly than ever in consequence be not quite time for yet must be inartistic to suggest just couple of week of hatlessness have produced so desirable result a sat at ease after labour of day wondered how coming of olga bracely to riseholme must affect economy of place be impossible to think of with beauty charm fame personality a taking second place in life unless be really meaning to use riseholme a retreat to take part in life at be hard to see what part must take except first part one who by arrival at lucia ever memorable party have converted in moment from most dire of scrub in psychical sense to hightumest gathering ever known must not lay aside distinction pre eminence never have lucia scored so amazingly a over olga late appearance have effect of bringing back departed guest with compulsion of magnet over iron filing sending up whole party like rocket into zenith of social success riseholme knew that olga have come after playing croquet with entire afternoon have given free gratis for nothing treat a only wealthiest must obtain with most staggering fee lady ambermere alone driving back to hall with pug poor miss lyall be only person who have not shared in knew about next day for georgie have driven out on purpose to tell met lucia coming away how then must advent of olga affect riseholme social working generally how must affect lucia in particular what must lucia say when knew on whose behalf georgie be so busy with plumber painter with buying so many of desirable treasure in ambermere arm frankly must not answer conundrum presupposed inconceivable situation yet though inconceivable be shortly coming to pas for olga advent might be expected before october that season of tea party ushered in multifarious gaiety of winter must olga form part of moonlit circle to whom lucia played first movement of moonlight sonata give long sigh at end like rest of must lucia when have recovered little from invariable emotion go to say olga mia just little bit out of valkyrie must be so pleasant somehow georgie with imagination must not picture such scene must olga take part of second citizenness something of sort when lucia played portia must olga join elementary class of yoga be instructed by lucia in teacher robe must sing treble in christmas carol while lucia beat time said in syllable dictated by rhythm treble little flat poor ear georgie must not imagine of thing yet unless olga took part in social life of riseholme at be equally inconceivable what be alternative true have said that be coming here because be so ideally lazy backwater georgie did not take that seriously must soon see what riseholme be when life poured down in spate whirling punt along with finally what must happen to when olga be set a shining star in firmament already revolved about be aware like eager delighted little moon drawn away from orbit where have encircled so contentedly by more potent planet measure of detachment from old orbit might be judged precisely by fact that process of detachment be already taking place be marked by sense of pull of opposing force at great new star sailing into heaven have just picked up by force of superior power of attraction even a by momentary conjunction with lucia at garden party have raised to magnitude have never possessed before magnitude be still lucia doubt must be until great star appeared again then without effort shining must surely eclipse other illumination just a without effort must surely attract little moon to must lucia manage somehow other by sheer force of will by desperate hostile endeavour on other hand by supreme tact cleverness to harness great star to own chariot thought desperate hostile endeavour be more in keeping with lucia method quiet evening hour represented to a lull before storm actual quiet of moment be suddenly broken into front door banged house be filled with running footstep scream of laughter be not uncommon for hermy ursy to make sort of entrance at moment georgie have not slightest idea of how much further reaching be disturbance of tranquillity drew couple of long breath said om once twice be quite prepared to find deeper calm unshattered hermy ursy ran down step into garden where sat still yelling with laughter still georgie imagination went further than to suppose that one of have laid stymie for other at golf driven ball out of bound done other of thing appeared to make game so diverting to georgie will never guess cried hermy guru om of high caste extraordinary sanctity cried ursy brahmin from benares shrieked hermy great teacher who do think be said ursy never seen before recognised at once recognised too did run into hurst shut door georgie deeper calm suddenly quivered like jelly dear need howl so talk quite so loud said riseholme will hear tell without shouting who be thought recognised there be think about said hermy be one of cook from calcutta restaurant in bedford street where often have lunch said ursy make most delicious curry especially when be little tipsy said hermy be about a much brahmin a be always said came from madras always tip to make curry so be quite ignorant about money o lord said hermy wiping eye if be limit to think of mr lucas colonel boucher mr quantock piggy rest of sitting round cook said ursy drinking in wisdom mr quantock be on right track after when wanted to engage georgie with fallen heart have first to satisfy that be not one of sister joke then tried to raise fallen heart by remembering that guru have often spoken of dignity of simple manual work somehow be blow if hermy ursy be right to know that be tipsy contriver of curry there be nothing in simple manual office of curry making must possibly tarnish sanctity amazing tissue of falsehood with guru have modestly masked innocent calling be not so markedly in spirit of guide a retailed by be of first importance however to be assured that sister have not at present communicated upsetting discovery to anybody after to get promise that must not do so be not quite so easy for hermy ursy have projected round of visit after dinner to member of class with exception of lucia who must wake up next morning to find only illusioned person in place must like that know said hermy with brisk malice thought must serve out for never asking to house again after foolish old garden party dear never wanted to go said georgie know did rather wanted to tell did want to go be nice oh think can give up telling everybody have made such silly of think be real sport so do said ursy will soon have back at curry oven again what laugh will have with subsided for just a long a took foljambe to come out of house inform that be quarter of hour to dinner time return again rose obediently well will talk about at dinner time said georgie diplomatically will just go down to cellar first to see if can find something like good old georgie said hermy if be going to bribe must bribe well will see said georgie be quite right to be careful over veuve clicquot especially since be bottle of admirable beverage hermy ursy have looted from cellar on night of burglarious entry remembered that well though have chiefly from desire to keep thing pleasant about hair joined in fun have even produced half bottle tonight even more than then there be need for abolition of petty economy for situation must be absolutely intolerable if hermy ursy spread about riseholme fact that introducers innermost circle of yoga philosopher have sat at foot of gamaliel at at of curry cook from low restaurant indeed brought up second bottle tonight with view if hermy ursy be not softened by first to administer that also must then hardly be in condition to be taken seriously if still insisted on making house to house visit in riseholme tearing veil from off feature of guru georgie be far too upright of purpose to dream of making sister drunk be willing to make great sacrifice in order to render kind what inner circle must do about cook have idea must talk to lucia about before advanced class tomorrow morning anything be better than letting hermy ursy loose in riseholme with rude laugh discreditable exposure evening safely over must discus with lucia what be to be done for hermy ursy must have vanished at cock crow a be going in for golf competition at safe distance lucia might recommend doing nothing at wish to continue enlightening study a if nothing have happened georgie felt that romance must have evaporated from class a regard again might have to get rid of guru somehow only felt quite sure that lucia must agree with daisy quantock must not be told with thwarted ambition of being prime dispenser of guruism to riseholme might easily turn nasty let be widely known that robert have seen through fraud long ago have considered whether must not offer guru situation of cook in household for be so much better qualified might even add that leaning towards pretty housemaid have alone dissuaded evening went off with success more brilliant than georgie have anticipated be quite unnecessary to open second bottle of champagne hermy ursy perhaps under influence of first perhaps from innate good nature perhaps because be starting so very early next morning wanted to be driven into brinton instead of taking slower earlier train at station readily gave up project of informing whole of riseholme of discovery went to bed a soon a have rooked brother of eleven shilling at cut throat bridge continued to say will play guru whenever have to play knave georgie found quite easy to laugh at so long a humour of did not spread even said will guru then when took trick with knave of trump agitation uncertainty caused not to sleep very well in addition there be good deal of disturbance in house for sister have still packing in front of when went to bed doze preceded sleep be often broken by sound of banging of luggage clash of golf club step on stair a made ready for departure after while disturbance ceased be out of deep sleep that awoke with sense that noise have awakened apparently have not finished yet for there be surely faint stir of movement somewhere anyhow respected legitimate desire for quiet for noise whatever be be extremely stealthy subdued thought of absurd lark about burglar on night of arrival smiled at notion toupet be in drawer close to bed have substantial impulse to put on make sure that noise be not anything other than sister preparation for early start for must have have everything packed corded long before dinner if be to start next day except just suit case must hold apparatus of immediate necessity then dear hermy ursy be so ramshackle in way time must have bell put on shutter a have determined to do month ago then sort of noise must disturb more yoga class next morning be unusually to assemble at ten since peppino who must not miss for anything be going to have day fishing in happy stream flowed into avon wanted to be off by eleven peppino have made great progress lately have certain curious dizzy symptom when meditated be highly satisfactory georgie breakfasted with sister at eight have enticed motor out of to convey to brinton when be gone foljambe informed that housemaid have sore throat have not done drawing room foljambe must do when have cleaned young lady room there be hint of scorn in upstairs so georgie sat on window seat of dining room thought how pleasant peace quietness be just when be time to start for hurst in order to talk over disclosure of night before with lucia before class perhaps to frame secretive policy must obviate further exposure remembered that have left cigarette case pretty straw one with turquoise in corner in drawing room went to find window be open apparently foljambe have just come in to let fresh air into atmosphere hermy ursy have so uninterruptedly contaminated last night with fag a called cigarette case be not on table where thought have left looked round then stood rooted to spot glass case of treasure be not only open empty gone be louis xvi snuff box gone be miniature of karl huth gone piece of bow china gone faberge cigarette case only queen anne toy porringer be there in absence of others looked to a doubt have looked to burglar indescribably insignificant georgie gave little low wailing cry did not tear hair for obvious reason then rang bell three time in swift succession be signal to foljambe that even if be in bath must come at once in came with one of hermy horrid woolen jersey have be left behind in hand yes sir what be asked in agitated manner for never must remember georgie having rung bell three time except once when fish bone have stuck in throat once again when note have announced to that piggy be going to call hoped to find alone for answer georgie pointed to rifled treasure case gone burgled said oh god at supreme moment telephone bell sounded see what be said to foljambe put queen anne toy porringer in pocket came hurrying back mr lucas want to come around at once said ca said georgie must stop here send for police nothing must be moved hastily replaced toy porringer on exact circle of pressed velvet where have stood before yes sir said foljambe in moment returned must be very much obliged if must come at once said there be be robbery in house well tell there be be one in mine said georgie irritably then good nature mixed with furious curiosity came to aid wait here then foljambe on very spot said see that nobody touch anything will probably ring up police from hurst admit in agitation put on hat instead of going bareheaded be received by lucia who have clearly be looking out of music room window at door wore teacher robe georgie said quite forgetting to speak italian in greeting someone broke into philip safe last night took hundred pound in bank note have put there only yesterday in order to pay in cash for cob roman pearl georgie felt certain pride of achievement have be burgled too said louis xvi snuff box be worth more than there be piece of bow china cigarette case karl huth a well dear come inside said be gang be feeling so peaceful exalted will make terrible atmosphere in house guru will be profoundly affected atmosphere where thief have be will stifle have often told how can not stop in house where there have be wicked emotion at play must keep from can not lose lucia have sunk down on spacious elizabethan settle in hall humorous spider mocked from window humorous stone fruit from plate beside pot pourri bowl even a repeated can not lose again tremendous rap came on front door georgie at sign from queen admitted mr quantock robert have be burgled said four silver spoon thank god most of thing be plate eight silver fork georgian tankard must have spared last faint sign of relief escaped lucia if foul atmosphere of thief permeated daisy house too there be great danger that guru must go back there instantly became sublime peace said let have class first for be ten already not let thought of revenge evil spoil that for if sent for police now must not concentrate will not tell guru what have happened to of for poor peppino sake will ask to give rather short lesson feel completely calm om vague nightmare image began to take shape in georgie mind unworthy suspicion based on sister information evening before with foljambe keeping guard over queen anne porringer there be nothing more to fear followed lucia silver cord with tassel gently swinging a moved to smoking parlour where peppino be already sitting on floor breathing in rather more agitated manner than be usual with advanced class there be fresh flower on table scented morning breeze blew in from garden according to custom sat down waited getting calmer more peaceful moment soon there must be tapping of slippered heel on walk of broken paving stone outside for time must forget disturbance be rather glad that lucia be to ask guru to give shorter lesson than usual waited presently hand of cromwellian timepiece be nearest approach to elizabethan clock lucia have be able at present to obtain pointed to quarter past ten guru be little late said two minute afterwards peppino sneezed two minute after daisy spoke using irony must not be well to see what have happened to guru dear asked have seen guru morning dear said lucia not opening eye for be concentrating always meditates before class so do said daisy have meditated long enough hush said lucia be coming that proved to be false alarm for be nothing lucia persian cat who have quarrel with dead laurel leaf lucia rose like to interrupt said time be getting on left smoking parlour with slow supple walk that adopted when wore teacher robe before many second have passed came back more quickly with suppleness door be locked said yet there be key in did look through keyhole lucia mia asked mr quantock with irrepressible irony naturally lucia disregarded knocked said there be reply said beaster be waiting ' did answer suddenly georgie spoke a with report of cork flying out of bottle sister told last night that be curry cook at calcutta restaurant said recognised thought recognised come from madras be more brahmin than foljambe peppino bounded to foot what said let get poker break in door believe be gone believe be burglar ring for police curry cook be said daisy robert be right after knew what guru be best fitted for dear lucia then of course always know best have be fooling finely did fool knew when took away from what sort of bargain have made guru indeed be same class a mr eddy saw through fast enough now what be to do for part will just get home ring up for police say that indian who have be living with week have stolen spoon fork georgian tankard guru indeed burglaroo call there passion like hyperion have lifted upon foot stood there defying whole of advanced class short stout wholly ridiculous with revolutionary menace about be not exactly terrible a army with banner be terrible a elderly lady with long standing grievance have be accentuated by loss of georgian tankard be terrible enough to make lucia adopt conciliatory attitude bitterly repented having stolen daisy guru at if suspicion now thickening in air proved to be true after be not proved yet guru might still walk in from arbor on laburnum alley have not yet searched might be levitating with door key in pocket be not probable be possible at crisis possibility be thing must be clung to for otherwise must simply have to submerge like u boat searched garden found trace of curry cook made guarded enquiry of servant a to whether have be seen nothing must be learned about so when peppino took ponderous hammer stout chisel from tool chest led way upstairs knew that decisive moment have come perhaps might be meditating for indeed be likely that have good deal to meditate about perhaps peppino called to in most sonorous tone said that must be obliged to break lock if answer came presently house resounded with knocking a terrible a in macbeth much louder then suddenly lock gave door be open room be empty a have conjectured by now bed be unslept in opened drawer of wardrobe be a empty a room finally peppino unlocked door of large cupboard stood in corner with clinking crashing of glass there poured out cataract of empty brandy bottle emptiness be key note of whole scene blank consternation effect brandy said mr quantock in strangled voice there be fourteen fifteen bottle account for glazed look in eye dear lucia thought be concentration call distillation did take from cellar asked lucia too shattered to feel resentment still capable of intense curiosity no have standing order from to order little thing might want from tradesman wish have bill sent in week yes dear said lucia georgie eye sought hers saw buy first bottle said remember telling about be at rush peppino gathered up hammer chisel well be use sitting here thinking of old time observed will ring up police station put whole matter into hand a far a be concerned will soon lay hand on can do posture in prison for next few year know that be who committed burglary yet said lucia one felt be worth answering for others have tried convicted already will do same said georgie tankard said mr quantock lucia got up peppino mio said georgie daisy want before do anything at to listen to for five minute just consider what sort of figure will cut if put matter into hand of police will probably catch will come out that have be dupe of curry cook think what have be doing for last month think of class exercise everything have be made fool of for part simply must bear that everybody must know have be made fool of anything that what be hundred pound compared to tankard louis xvi snuff box be worth at least that without other thing said georgie still with secret satisfaction in being greatest sufferer be hundred pound not yours carissima said peppino be clear that lucia word be working within like leaven will go half with said will give cheque for fifty pound who must like to go half in tankard said daisy with bitter irony want tankard georgie said nothing mind be extremely busy there be olga soon coming to riseholme must be awful if found ringing with tale of guru glancing across to peppino saw thoughtful sympathetic look in eye seemed to indicate that mind be working on parallel line certainly lucia have given something to meditate upon tried to imagine whole story being shouted into mr antrobus ear trumpet on village green must not endure idea tried to imagine mr weston ever ceasing to talk about must not picture silence doubt have be taken in too here in empty bedroom be original dupe who encouraged rest after mr quantock enquiry dead silence fell what do propose then asked peppino showing sign of surrender lucia exerted utmost wile caro said want 'oo to propose daisy silly woman want 'oo georgie to tell to do if lucia must speak fink paused moment observing strong disgust at playfulness on mr quantock face reverted to ordinary english again must do something of sort said must say that dear daisy guru have left quite suddenly that have have call somewhere else work here be done have established class set foot upon way always said that something of sort might happen to believe have planned along said georgie knew thing must last for ever when sister recognised concluded be time to bolt with available property must lay hand on said mr quantock lucia fingered tassel now about burglary said wo do to let be known three burglary be committed in one night simultaneously daisy guru be called away guru indeed said mr quantock fizzing with indignation at repetition of insult might give rise to suspicion continued lucia calmly disregarding interruption must stop news from spreading now with regard to burglary let think moment have got such complete control of now that spoke have said only boaler know for peppino told not to say word till police have be sent for must tell carissimo that have found hundred pound settle that now georgie foljambe know said georgie then tell not to say word about put more thing out in lovely treasure case one will notice daisy robert be away said quite meekly for have be thinking thing over maid know when come back will notice loss of tankard did often use about once in ten year chance then said lucia just tell maid to say nothing about became deliciously modest again there said be just little rough idea of mine now peppino georgie will put wise head together tell to do be easily done repeated what have said corrected if went wrong then once again stood fingering tassel of teacher robe about study said for one must be very sorry to drop altogether because made wonderful difference to think felt same look at georgie now look ten year younger than did month ago a for daisy wish must trip about a doe must do must to drop everything just because daisy guru mean guru have be called away must look a if be really interested in what taught a if be only novelty of having brahmin among have attracted lucia smiled benignly at perhaps will find bye bye that ca progress much by said will drop quietly let drop with bang will certainly take elementary class a usual afternoon paused in robe just a usual said chapter nine fish for mr weston sent to brinton week since did not like look of successor to tommy luton mother lay disregarded on dish while with fork fish slice in hand a aid to gesticulation be recounting to colonel boucher

be going to tell last night tenant of old place asked lucia unerringly yes guess said georgie tantalizingly be last revelation wanted to spin out lucia decided on great stroke involving risk magnificent if came off in flash guessed why yoga class have come so super punctually of felt convinced wanted to have joy of telling after everybody else knew who new tenant be on top of bitterness be added acrimony of georgie whose clear duty be to have informed moment knew wanting to make same revelation to last of riseholme have already have suspicion for have not forgotten fact that olga bracely georgie have played croquet afternoon when must have be at garden party determined to risk for sake of spoiling georgie pleasure in telling gave silvery laugh started so have ascertained on flat above treble clef georgino did question a to who be really take in asked just a if have known along why miss olga bracely of course georgie fallen face shewed how completely have spoiled pleasure who told asked rattled tassel little bird said must run away to class will scold once again before settled down to high philosophy lucia have pleasure of disappointing ambition of class to surprise inform astonish good morning to said before settle down will give little bit of news now at last be allowed to dear miss olga bracely whom think met here be coming to live at old place will not be great addition to musical party now please splendid bravado be scintillation on hard highly polished surface have georgie be able to penetrate into lucia heart must have found complete healing for recent severe mortification did not really believe that lucia have known all along like who new tenant be for enquiry have seemed to be pointed with most piercing curiosity after lucia when did not forget part be fine actress perhaps time thought have be punishing have be fooling in ease certainly have not have joy of telling whether have guessed really knew be who have told there be getting over went back straight home drew caricature of if georgie be sitting with clouded brow lucia be troubled by nothing le than raging tornado of agitated thought though olga must undoubtedly be great addition to musical talent of riseholme must fall into line for instance bring music sing after dinner when lucia asked a regard music be possible that might be almost too great addition cause rest of gifted amateur to sink into comparative insignificance at present lucia be high priestess at altar of art must not think with equanimity of seeing anybody in charge of ritual at again to so eminent opera singer there must be conceded certain dramatic knowledge indeed georgie have often spoken to lucia of superb moment when brunnhilde woke hailed sun must lucia give up direction of dramatic art a well a of music point by point pricked out of general gloom hoisted danger signal then suddenly whole be in blaze together what if olga took lead not in particular in attempted to constitute supreme in affair of riseholme be very well for to be brilliant bird of passage just for couple of day drop so to speak moulted feather eagle feather on lucia party thereby causing to shine out from previous festivity making hightumest affair have ever happened be totally different matter to contemplate permanent residence here seemed possible that then might keep feather to line own eyrie thought of belshazzar feast writing of doom on wall be daniel enough to interpret thy kingdom be divided said given to bracelys shuttleworths rallied force if olga meant to show that sort of woman must soon know with whom have to deal not what lucia must give chance first of behaving with suitable loyalty obedience must even condescend to cooperate with so long a be perfectly clear that aimed at supremacy there be only one lawgiver in riseholme one court of appeal one dispenser of destiny own firmness of soul calmed invigorated changing teacher robe for walking dress went out up road led by old place to see what must be observed of interior from outside chapter ten one morning about middle of october lucia be seated at breakfast frowning over note have just received began without formality be written in pencil do look in about half past nine on saturday be silly for hour two will play game dance will bring husband of course bother to reply ob invitation said icily a passed to husband rather short notice be not doing anything be asked peppino be little imperceptive sometimes be that meant said there be little more informality about than one must expect probably be informal party said certainly seems most informal be not accustomed to be asked quite like peppino began to be aware of true nature of situation see what mean cara said so let go then will take hint perhaps lucia thought over for moment found that rather wanted to go certain resentment have be slowly accumulating in mind for day past began to leak out first before consented to overlook olga informality be fortnight since called on said have not even returned call daresay behave like in london in certain circle know that london be better for have be away twice since came said peppino have hardly be here for couple of day together yet may be wrong said lucia doubt be wrong must have thought that might have spared hour out of day by returning call however thought not peppino suddenly recollected thrilling piece of news most unaccountably have forgotten to tell lucia dear something slipped memory said met mr weston yesterday afternoon who told that hour ago miss bracely have seen in bath chair have taken handle from tommy luton pushed twice round green positively running doe not seem to of very prime importance said lucia though be thrilled to marrow wonder slipped memory caro carissima wait minute be not told weston that must have returned call that have got calling card impossible cried lucia must have printed at 'ye olde booke shop ' in afternoon may be so indeed if say so be said peppino anyhow said have got calling card see why must lie about be not confession one must be likely to make said unless be true even if be added anyhow explains why have not be here said peppino must naturally like to do everything in order when called on carissima must have be embarrassing if be out must not hand in card about mr shuttleworth asked in absent voice a if have real interest in question have not be seen yet at a far a can gather then will have host if drop in tomorrow night let go see cara said gaily apart from matter of call not being returned lucia have not a yet have reason to suspect olga of revolutionary design on throne have done odd thing pushing mr weston chair round green be one of smoking cigarette a came back from church on sunday be set down to bohemianism want of polish might be expected from upbringing if must call orphan school at brixton upbringing at terrific fact georgie have let slip in stern determination to know twice a much about olga a anybody else lucia have treasured have in last fortnight labelled olga a rather common retaining however certain respect for professional career given that professional career be to be thrown down a carpet for own foot after if olga be bit bohemian in way of life a exhibited by absence of calling card lucia be perfectly ready to overlook confident in refining influence of riseholme to go to informal party next day if felt so disposed for direct answer be asked for there be considerable illumination in window of old place when peppino set out after dinner next night to go to silly party kindly overlooking informality absence of return visit to call have be sloppy day of rain a be natural lucia carried very smart indoor shoe in paper parcel peppino have russian golosh on be immense snow boot in evening shoe be completely encased lucia preferred not to disfigure foot to extent be clad in neat walking boot must exchange for smart satin footwear in cloak room resumption of walking boot when evening be over be rather feature among lady be called cobbler at home two started rather late for be fitting that lucia must be last to arrive have come to door of old place peppino be fumbling in dark for bell when lucia gave little cry of agony put hand over ear just a if have be seized with double earache of peculiar intensity gramophone said faintly there must be doubt about from window close at hand came out excruciating strain of very lusty instrument record be that of vulgar catchy waltz tune taken down from brass band riseholme knew what opinion about gramophone be to lover of beethoven be like indecent profane language loudly used in public place only one so far a be known have ever come to riseholme be introduced by misguided robert quantock once have turned on in presence look of agony crossed face be such that have to stop immediately then door be opened abominable noise poured out in increased volume lucia paused for moment in indecision must be great magnificent thing to go home without coming in trusting to peppino to let be widely known what have turned back from door there be good deal to be said for for must be living up to own high immutable standard on other hand particularly wanted to see what standard of entertaining olga be initiating silly evening be quite new type of party for since have directed controlled social side of thing there have be no silly evening of kind in riseholme might be good thing to ensure failure of in case did not like by setting example of bored frosty face if went in gramophone must be stopped must sit wince peppino must explain feeling about gramophone must be suitable exhibition of authority might tell olga lucia put on satin shoe leaving boot till hour of cobbler at home came composing face to suitable wince be led by footman on tiptoe to door of big music room georgie have spoken of if will please to step in very quietly ma'be said room be full of people riseholme be there since there be not nearly enough chair lucia saw that at once large number be sitting on floor on cushion at far end of room be slightly raised dais to corner of grand piano have be pushed on top of with braying trumpet pointing straight at lucia be immense gramophone on dais be olga dancing be dressed in white soft fabric shimmering with silver left beautiful arm bare to shoulder be cut squarely simply about neck hung in straight fold down to just above ankle held in hand long shimmering scarf of brilliant red that floated undulated a moved a if inspired by life of own that drew out of slim superb vitality from cloud of shifting crimson with slow billow of silver moving rhythmically round body that beautiful face looked out deliciously smiling brimming with life lucia have hardly entered when with final bray gramophone came to end of record olga swept great curtsey threw down scarf stepped off dais georgie be sitting on floor close to jumped up leading applause for moment though several head have be turned at lucia entrance nobody took slightest notice of indeed first apparently to recognize presence be hostess who just kissed hand to then continued talking to georgie then olga threaded way through besprinkled floor came up to how wise be to miss very poor performance said mr georgie insisted must make fool of indeed be sorry not to have be here for said lucia in most stately manner seemed to very far from being poor performance very far indeed caro mio remember miss bracely si si molto bene said peppino shaking hand ah talk italian said olga che bella lingua wish knew have very good pronunciation said lucia tante grazie know everyone here of course now what will do next clump charade what ah there be cigarette wo have one lucia gave little scream of dismay cigarette for must be very odd thing said then relenting a remembered that olga must be excused for ignorance added see never smoke never oh must learn said olga now let play clump doe everyone know clump if will find out will dance there be gramophone to dance to lucia put up hand in playful petition oh please gramophone said oh like said olga be so horrible that adore a adore dreadful creature in aquarium think wo dance till after supper will have supper extremely soon partly because be dying of famine partly because people be sillier afterwards just one game of clump first let see there be enough for four clump please make four clump everybody will two more go out with mr georgie mr lucas will be a quick a can wo think of anything will make mr georgie blush oh there be heard be intense enjoyment of own party be rapidly galvanizing everybody into much keener gaiety than be at usual in riseholme where a rule hostess be somewhat anxious watchful fearing that guest be not amusing that sandwich must give out there be sit down supper when clump be over mr quantock have be first to guess beethoven little toe on right foot made lucia wince there be not enough men maid to wait so people foraged for olga paraded up down room with bottle of champagne in one hand dish of lobster salad in other sat for minute two first at one table then at asked silly riddle sent to kitchen for ham put out electric light by mistake when meant to turn on more then when supper be over took seat back into music room played musical chair at end of mr quantock be left in with olga be believed that said damn when mr quantock won georgie be in charge of gramophone supplied deadly music quite forgetting that be agony to lucia not even being aware when made sign to peppino went away having cobbler at home to herself nobody noticed when saturday ended sunday began for georgie colonel boucher be cock fighting on floor georgie screaming out how tarsome when be upset colonel boucher very red in face saying haw hum never thought must romp again like by jove most amusing georgie be last to leave did not notice till be half way home that have ham frill adorning shirt front hoped that have be olga who put there when have to walk blind fold across floor try to keep in straight line riseholme got up rather late next morning have to hurry over breakfast in order to be in time for church there be slight feeling of reaction abroad sense of having be young amused of waking now to fact of church bell middle age colonel boucher singing bass of few more year will roll felt mind instinctively wandering to cock fight evening before depressedly recollecting that considerable number of year have rolled already mr weston with bath chair in aisle tommy luton to hand hymn book prayer book a required looked sideways at mr quantock thought how strange be that daisy so few hour ago have be racing round solitary chair with georgie finger on gramophone while georgie singing tenor by colonel boucher ample side saw with keen annoyance that there be stain of tarnished silver on forefinger accounted for by fact that after breakfast have be cleaning frame held photograph of olga bracely have be astonished to hear church bell beginning conducement to depression on part be fact that be lunching with lucia must not imagine what lucia attitude must be towards party last night have come to church rather late having use for general confession sang with stony fervour wore usual church face from nothing must be gathered great many stealthy glance right left from everybody failed to reveal presence of hostess of last night georgie in particular be sorry for must have liked to show capacity for respectable seriousness presence at church that morning must have implied while lucia in particular be glad of for confirmed view that miss bracely be not must ever be true riseholmite have thought a much last night have said so to peppino proposed to say same to georgie today then came stupefying surprise a mr rumbold walked from stall to pulpit for sermon generally gave out number of short anthem accompanied manoeuvre today made such announcement discreet curtain hid organist from congregation veiled gymnastics with stop antic dancing on pedal now when mr rumbold moved from stall there came from organ short introduction to bach mein glaubige herz even lucia have allowed to be nearly equal to beethoven then came voice reaction after romp last night went out like snuffed candle at divine singing be charged with joyfulness of heavenly child grew low soft rang out again lingered tarried quickened into ultimate triumph singing must have be simpler simplicity must only have sprung from highest art now art be wholly unconscious be part of singer who praised god a thrush do who have made gaiety last night made worship morning a sat down for discourse colonel boucher discreetly whispered to georgie by jove georgie rather more audibly answered adorable mr weston drew half crown from purse instead of usual shilling to be ready for offertory mr quantock wondered if be too old to learn to sing georgie found lucia very full of talk that day at luncheon be markedly more italian than usual indeed put down italian grammar when entered drawing room covered up with essay of antonio caporelli possibly have connection with fact that have encouraged olga last night with regard to pronunciation ben arrivato georgio said ho finito il libro di antonio caporelli quantum memento e magnifico georgie thought have finished long ago perhaps be mistaken sentence flew off lucia tongue a if be perched there quite ready sono un poco fatigata dopo il dear how rusty be getting in italian for ca remember word went on anyhow be little tired after last night delightful little party be not be clever of miss bracely to get so many people together at so short notice once in while sort of romp be very well enjoyed quite enormously said georgie saw did cattivo ragazzo said quite forgot about poor lucia horror of dreadful gramophone have to exert calmness yoga have given not to scream be naughty with gramophone over musical chair unmusical chair a said to peppino did caro taking off putting on again so suddenly time thought be end e pronta la colazione andiamo presently be seated menu unusual thing in at luncheon be written in italian scribe being clearly lucia will want lot of georgino tempo week said for peppino have quite settled must give little after dinner party next saturday want to help to arrange impromptu tableau everything impromptu must just be sketched out first daresay miss bracely worked great deal at dance last night wish have seen more of be little awkward in management of drapery thought daresay doe not know much about dancing still be very graceful effective for amateur carried off very well oh be not quite amateur said georgie have played in salome lucia pursed lip indeed be sorry played in said with undoubtedly great gift must have thought might have found worthier object naturally have not heard must be very much ashamed to be seen there about tableau now peppino thought might open with execution of mary queen of scot be dreadful thing have lost pearl must be executioner priest then must like to have awakening of brunnhilde must be lovely said georgie have asked miss olga if will georgino mio quite understand said lucia party be to be for miss bracely be guest last night in spite of gramophone indeed hope will find nothing in house that jar on a much a gramophone jarred on have dreadful nightmare last night did peppino in consequence about brunnhilde tableau thought peppino must be siegfried perhaps must learn just fifteen twenty bar of music play while curtain be up can play same over again if be encored then how about king cophetua beggar maid must be with back to audience must not turn round at must be quite tableau will just sketch out a said have grouping two to make sure get in other way will see that there be dress of kind can just throw on tableau with little music serious music must be quite sufficient to keep everybody interested by time georgie have got tolerable inkling of import of be not at present to be war be to be magnificent rivalry throwing down perhaps of gauntlet none must venture to pick up to confirm view lucia went on with gathering animation propose to have game romp will call said for a far a know riseholme perhaps know little better than dear miss bracely riseholme doe not care for sort of thing be not quite in line may be right wrong be sure know a matter of fact care for sort of thing dear miss bracely did very best last night be sure be prompted only by most hospitable motif how must know supper too peppino counted nineteen empty champagne bottle eighteen carissima said peppino think told nineteen caro make very little difference eighteen empty champagne bottle standing on sideboard end to caviare sandwich be left over be too much though there be not nearly enough chair indeed never got one at except just at supper lucia leaned forward over table with hand clasped there be display about georgino know how hate display said shakespeare be content with most modest scenery for masterpiece must be great mistake if allowed to be carried away by mere wasteful opulence in year have lived here contributed in humble way to life of place have heard complaint about supper tea about quality of entertainment offer guest when be so good a to say bei to le mie invitazione art be not advanced by romping be able to enjoy without two hundred caviare sandwich being left over such wasteful cutting of ham have to slice chunk gave over over again before must eat georgie felt must not quite let pas well have excellent supper said enjoyed very much besides saw peppino tucking in like anything ask what thought of lucia gave silvery laugh georgino be boy said artfully in ' a so vulgarly call without thinking be saying nothing against supper be sure that peppino colonel boucher must have felt better morning if have be wiser last night be not real point want to show miss bracely be sure will be grateful for sort of entertainment have contented at riseholme for so long will frame on line will ask sundry to drop in with just few hour notice a did everything will be good there will be about something seemed to miss last night there be little bit how will say little bit of footlights about footlights did seem to to have be extinguished at church time morning singing of very fine aria be theatrical ca call le than theatrical fixed georgie with black beady eye smoothed undulated hair theatrical said again now let have coffee in music room will lucia play little bit of beethoven to take out nasty taste of gramophone likey gramophone at nebber georgie now began to feel able to sympathise with surfeited swain who thought how happy must be with be t'other dear charmer away certainly have be very happy with lucia year before t'other dear charmer alighted in riseholme now felt must lucia decide a have often so nearly decided to spend winter on riviera riseholme must still be very pleasant place of residence never be quite sure how seriously have contemplated winter on riviera for mere mention of have always be enough to make protest that riseholme must not possibly exist without today a sat heard rather than listened to series of slow movement with brief hazardous attempt at scherzo of moonlight felt that if talk of riviera came up must not be quite so insistent a to impossibility of riseholme continuing to exist without must for instance have existed perfectly well sunday afternoon if lucia have be even at timbuctoo antipode for a went away last night olga have thrown casual intimation to that must be at home if have nothing better to do cared to drop in certainly have nothing better to do have something worse to do peppino be sitting in window seat with eye closed because listened to music better so with head nodded occasionally presumably for same reason cessation of slow movement naturally made cease to listen stirred gave sigh with riseholme always acknowledged end of slow movement georgie sighed too lucia sighed sighed then lucia began again so peppino closed eye again georgie continued mental analysis of situation at present so concluded lucia did not mean war meant a by great armed demonstration to exhibit riseholme spirit in full panoply then crush into dazzled submission potential rivalry meant also to exert educational influence for allowed that olga have great gift meant to train refine gift so that might when exercised under benign autocratic supervision conduce to strength splendour of riseholme naturally must be loyally ably assisted georgie realized that tableau of king cophetua tableau a have said partook of nature of bribe if word be invidious of raising of pay be equally certain that prolonged recital of slow movement be intended to produce in mind vivid consciousness of contrast between romp last night present tranquil hour did not fail in respect lucia piano lid almost before have given sigh spoke think will have little dinner party first said will ask lady ambermere will make four with georgie miss bracely mr shuttleworth will make six rest will ask to come in at nine for know lady ambermere doe not like late hour now will talk over tableau so even lucia mind have not be wholly absorbed in beethoven though georgie a usual told have never played so divinely chapter eleven manoeuvre of next week became so bewilderingly complicated that by wednesday georgie be almost thinking of going away to seaside with foljambe dicky in sheer despair in after year must not without great mental effort succeed in straightening out effort caused quite buzzing in head that sunday evening lucia sent invitation to lady ambermere for dinner tableau to lady ambermere be people replied by telephone on monday afternoon that ladyship be sorry to be unable lucia therefore gave up idea of dinner party reverted to original scheme of evening party like olga got up on spur of moment with great care most anxious preparation rehearsal for impromptu tableau meantime went steadily forward behind closed door georgie wrestled with twenty bar of music of awakening of brunnhilde lucia intended to ask nobody until friday evening olga must see what sort of party riseholme must raise at moment notice early on tuesday morning devil entered into daisy quantock probably by mean of subconscious telepathy proceeded to go round green at morning parliament ask everybody to come in for good romp on saturday evening accepted georgie lucia olga be absentee so making house to house visitation went first to georgie with secret knowledge of tableau indeed be stitching robe to be worn by king cophetua at time hastily bundling under table regretted that be already engaged be rather mysterious might have planned for mr quantock knew evening when must be busy indoors since evening be never to be pried upon asked question went off to lucia to give invitation there there again be met with similarly mysterious refusal lucia much regretted that peppino be unable to come hoped daisy must have lovely party even a spoke heard telephone bell ringing hurried off to find georgie faithful lieutenant be acquainting with fact that mr quantock be planning party for saturday did not know how far have got at moment have got just way to old place walking at unusual speed lucia grasped situation with amazing quickness cutting off georgie with snap abandoned idea of party being impromptu rang up olga must secure anyhow telephone be in hall olga with hat on be just preparing to go out when bell sounded word of grateful acceptance be on very lip when front door bell rang too very long insistently have hardly left off when began again olga opened door there be mr quantock on doorstep with invitation for saturday night be obliged to refuse promised to look in if be not very late in getting away from mr lucas pop went cat out of bag romp must be lovely already evil of decentralisation overlapping be becoming manifest lucia rang up house after house only to find that inhabitant be already engaged have got olga georgie must begin good work of education crushing of rivalry not by force by pure refined example mr quantock have got everybody else in old day must never have happened for everything devolved round one central body now with appearance of other great star known law of gravity attraction be upset georgie again summoned to telephone recommended appeal to mr quantock better nature lucia rejected doubting whether have one what about tableau asked georgie three ca very well do tableau for miss olga to look at then lucia showed truly great merit of tableau doe not consist in number of audience said paused moment have got cophetua robe to set properly asked oh will do said georgie dejectedly on tuesday afternoon olga rang up lucia again to say that husband be arriving day so might bring on saturday to lucia cordially assented felt that husband wife sitting together looking at husband wife doing tableau must be unusual entertainment not characteristic of riseholme best began to waver about tableau to consider dinner instead also wondered whether have be wronging dear daisy whether have better nature after perhaps georgie might ascertain georgie be roused from little fatigued nap by telephone for have fallen asleep over king cophetua robe lucia explained situation delicately suggested that must be so easy for to pop in to dear daisy be very diplomatic there be nobody like georgie for tact so with heavy yawn popped in have come about business on saturday said daisy unerringly have georgie remembered character for tact how wonderful of to guess that said thought might see if must arrange something if put head together be such pity to split up mean have got miss olga husband coming have got everybody else said daisy brightly miss bracely be coming over here if get away early probably with such small party will oh must count on said be having tableau always take longer than think dear must have said that a be to be impromptu really believe head be going know how thorough lucia be be taking great deal of trouble about have heard about said mr quantock thought moment well want to spoil lucia evening said for be sure nothing must be so ridiculous a three people doing tableau for two others on other hand want to spoil mine for what be to prevent going on with tableau till church time next morning if wish to keep miss bracely away from house be sure after way behaved about guru well never mind that how must be if have tableau first at lucia then came on here if lucia care to suggest that to guest consent mind doing that by six o'clock on tuesday evening therefore telephone bell of riseholme be merrily ringing again mr quantock stipulated that lucia party must end at precisely if did end before that everyone must then be free to flock across to house proposed romp must even outshine olga be deep in study of manual of round game included hunt slipper georgie peppino took turn at telephone ringing up mr quantock guest informing of double pleasure awaited on saturday since georgie have let out secret of impromptu tableau to mr quantock there be reason why rest of riseholme must not learn of firsthand from hurst instead of second hand with promise not to repeat from mr quantock appeared that have better nature than lucia credited with to expect not to tell everybody about tableau must be putting virtue to unfair test so be settled said georgie a returned with last acceptance how fortunately have happened after what day have be nothing telephoning from morning till night if go on like company will pay dividend year return of own penny lucia have got quantity of pearl bead be stringing for tableau of mary queen of scot now that everyone know said might allow little more elaboration in preparation there be elizabethan axe at ambermere arm might borrow for peppino then about brunnhilde tableau be dawn be not might have stage quite dark when curtain go up turn up lamp very slowly behind scene so that shine on face lamp being turned up very slowly be wonderfully effective produce perfect illusion must manage that with one hand play music of awakening with other georgino be quite sure must said well then peppino must do before come on will have movement in tableau think will be quite new idea peppino will come in just two step when have turned lamp up will take off shield armour music will never last out cried georgie will have to start earlier yes perhaps must be better said lucia calmly real piece of chain armour too be glad remembered peppino have that marwill be cleaning now will give far finer effect than tawdry stuff use in opera then sit up very slowly wave first right arm then left then must like to practise now on sofa lucia have just lain down when telephone sounded again georgie got up be to announce dividend said tripped into hall be that mr lucas ' said voice knew yes miss olga said be oh mr georgie how fortunate said can give message now to mr lucas ca be perfect fool know horribly forgetful what be matter asked georgie faintly be about saturday have just remembered that georgie not know be going away for weekend will tell mr lucas how sorry be georgie went back to music room where lucia have just got arm waving at sight of face dropped took firm hold of well what be said georgie gave message got off sofa rising to foot while mind rose to occasion be sorry miss bracely will not see tableau said a be not acting in know that make much difference deadly flatness although olga absence made difference descended on three

with remarkable result for have tapped out that name be robert hers daisy whichever way turned georgie herded back on to stony path that have be bidden to take with result that when georgie finally permitted to go into music room be athirst for more genial companionship of lady olga got up a entered georgie so lazy said that be use asking do let have turn up down garden colonel there be divine

sorry said certainly riseholme be healthy bracing place perhaps do keep youth pretty well god bless day go by without one noticing to think that came here with atkinson close on ten year ago did very well for olga swiftly switched off onto be quite horrid for losing servant said servant do become friend especially to anyone living alone georgie foljambe now must be bit surprised if foljambe have mistress before very long really thought be just chaffing at dinner georgie marrying be wife will take of needlework off hand may ah may enquire lady name olga decided to play great card have just found so to speak in hand be most tempting stopped ca guess said surely be not absolutely on wrong track ah miss antrobus said one think call piggy must say there be nothing in oh have never occurred to said daresay be quite wrong only judged from what thought noticed in poor georgie daresay be only what must have done ten year ago fancy there be spark alive still let talk about something else though wo go in quite yet will felt quite safe in apparent reluctance to tell riseholme gluttony for news made imperative for to ask more really must be very dull said daresay eye new to place see more who be miss bracely laughed ah how bad man be at observing man said did see georgie at dinner hardly took eye off have great glorious reward colonel boucher face grew absolutely blank in

catching cold miss bracely what will husband say if find out have be strolling about with out of door after dinner yes will go in said be chilly how thoughtful be for georgie little knowing catspaw have be made of found being detached from mr weston by colonel suited very well for presently olga said must sing unless anybody minded called on to accompany stood just behind leaning over sometimes with hand on shoulder sang three ruthless simple english song appropriate to matter in hand sang attempt from love sickness to fly sally in alley come live with sometimes beneath rustle of leaf turned over whispered to georgie be cleverer than anybody ever be will die in night said once again more enigmatically said have be cad will tell about when have gone stop behind then whiskey came in insisted on young people having of finally saw off at door came running back to georgie have be cad said because hinted that be in love with mr weston dear be simply perfect believe to have be last straw if forgive need be clever simply must stand that for came on top of being so young well really said georgie know must be cad again be going up to bedroom may come too if like because command view of church road must sleep wink unless knew that have gone in with will be precisely like faust marguerite going into house be mephistopheles martha come quick from dark of window watched mr weston bath chair being pushed up lit road be colonel pushing whispered olga squeezing into corner of window look there be tommy luton on path now have stopped at gate ca bear suspense oh georgie have gone in atkinson will stop so will elizabeth have promised to lend foljambe house will live at do think be happy chapter twelve miserable lucia started run of extreme bad luck about time of adventure misadventure of guru seemed to be prelude perhaps news of want of recognition of august moon georgie have so carefully saluted may have arrived at satellite by october for have simply cut august moon there be fiasco about olga coming to tableau be cause of sending very tart reply via miss lyall to lady ambermere impertinence very next morning lady ambermere coming again into riseholme perhaps for very purpose have behaved to lucia a lucia have behaved to moon cut be irritating counter irritant to have be that lady ambermere have then gone to olga be told that be not at home though be very audibly practising in music room at time upon lady ambermere have said home to people got in with such unconcern of material world that sat down on pug mr quantock have heard home pug told cut lucia who be hundred yard away about also told about engagement of atkinson elizabeth be knew about event in house on lucia with kind smile have said dear daisy what slave people be to servant be sure mr weston colonel boucher will be quite miserable poor thing now must run home how wish must stop chat on green gave silvery laugh for felt much better now that knew have said be out to lady ambermere when be so audibly in then came second piece of bad luck lucia have not gone more than hundred yard past georgie house when came out in tremendous hurry rapidly measured distance between lucia mr quantock made bee line for mr quantock since be nearest olga have just telephoned to good morning said breathlessly determined to cap anything said news yes indeed said have heard georgie have one moment of heart sink what said atkinson eliz began said scornfully talking of of course have heard rest have why mr weston colonel boucher be going to follow example unless set get married first said mr quantock in loudest possible riseholme voice of surprise oh yes really knew last night be dining at old place be there olga settled there must be something to talk in morning will stroll on green few minute georgie have lovely time hurried from person to person leaving mr quantock to pick up few further gleanings everyone be there except lucia for accident of being further off than mr quantock must have be first to know when tour be finished georgie sat to enjoy warm comforting glow of envy surrounded nowadays meeting place at green have insensibly transferred to just opposite old place be extremely interesting to hear olga practising a always did in morning interesting though be riseholme have at first be little disappointed about for everyone have thought that must sing brunnhilde part salome part through day trifle of kind instead must perform upwards scale in gradual crescendo on highest most magnificent note must enunciate at top of voice yawning york then starting soft again must descend in crescendo to superb low note enunciate love lily lonely then after dozen repetition of must start off with full voice get softer softer until just whispered that york be yawning do same with love lily never must tell what might not sing morning there must be long trill leaping onto high note long note leaping onto trill occasionally sang real song be worth waiting for georgie did not hesitate to let drop that have sung four last night to accompaniment hardly have repeated that third time when appeared at window before riseholme called out georgie with trill at end like bird shaking wing before riseholme so in went have lucia known that must quite have wiped gilt off lady ambermere be being refused admittance in point of fact did wipe gilt off when about hour afterwards georgie went to lunch because told if there have be gilt left about anywhere must have vanished too when in answer to rather damaging remark made about poor daisy interest in love affair of other people servant learned that be of love affair of superior that riseholme have be talking for at least hour by now again there be ill luck about tableau on saturday for in brunnhilde scene peppino in agitation turned lamp be to be sunrise completely out brunnhilde have to hail midnight at rate very obscure twilight georgie be true with wonderful presence of mind turned on electric light when have finished playing be more like flash of lightning than slow wonderful dawn tableau be over well before though lucia in answer to usual pressing said must see about doing again felt that mr weston colonel boucher who made first public appearance a happy pair attracted more than proper share of attention only consolation be that romp followed at poor daisy be complete fiasco be in vain too at supper that went from table to table helped people to lobster salad champagne have not enough chair generally imitated have apparently made olga party so supreme success on occasion recipe for dish not dish be served up hunting of slipper produced exhilaration in chase far more untoward event followed olga came back on next monday immediately after lucia received card for evening at home with music in bottom left hand corner happened to be wet that afternoon seeing be shut motor coming from station with four men inside leaped to conclusion that be four musician for music second motor followed with luggage quite distinctly saw unmistakable shape of 'cello against window after more guessing be necessary for be clear that poor olga have hired awful string quartet from brinton played in lounge at royal hotel after dinner brinton string quartet have heard once at distance be quite enough lucia shuddered a thought of doleful fiddler be indeed strange that olga with opportunity have have for hearing good music must hire brinton string quartet after be entirely of piece with view about gramophone perhaps gramophone must have share in musical evening have said must go must be very unkind to olga to stop away now for olga must know by time passion for music so went sincerely hoped that must not be conducted to seat of honour be obliged to say few encouraging word to string quartet afterwards once again came rather late for music have begun have only just begun for recognised who must recognise if not early bar of beethoven quartet laid hand on peppino arm brinton beethoven said limply slipped into chair next daisy quantock sat in well known position when listening to music with head forward chin resting on hand far away look in eye nothing of course must wholly take away splendour of glorious composition be pleased that there be applause between movement for have rather expected that olga must clap interrupt unity of occasionally too be agreeably surprised by brinton string quartet seemed to have inkling though not many once winced very much when string broke olga be rather restless hostess came up to when be over so glad must come said be divine lucia gave most indulgent smile perfect music glorious said really played very creditably be little spoiled know for last time heard that be performed by spanish quartet know one ought never to compare have ever heard spanish quartet miss bracely olga looked at in surprise be spanish quartet said pointing to player lucia have raised voice rather a spoke for when spoke on music spoke for everybody to hear great many people undoubtedly did hear among whom of course be daisy quantock gave one shrill squeal of laughter like slate pencil from moment granted plenary absolution to poor dear lucia for greed grabbing with regard to guru instantly olga good nature awoke unwittingly for remark that be spanish quartet have be mere surprised exclamation have made guest of hers uncomfortable must at once do must to remedy that be shocking room for echo said do of come up little nearer will be able to hear playing so much better lose shade fineness here came here on purpose to ask to move up mr lucas there be dozen chair unoccupied near platform be kindly intention prompted speech for real riseholme practical purpose quite barren for many people have heard lucia remark peppino also have already be wincing at brinton quartet in fell moment bolshevist laid bony finger on sceptre of musical autocracy who must have guessed that olga must get spanish quartet from london to come down to riseholme staggering from blow have to undergo even shrewder stroke yet already in intelligence department have be sadly behind hand in news tableau party have be anything success one little remark of olga have shaken musically at rate up till moment have shewn mistress of italian tongue while to strengthen that be being very diligent with dictionary grammar dante paradiso then a by bolt out of clear sky temple too be completely demolished in most tragic fashion few day after disaster of spanish brinton quartet olga received letter from signor cortese eminent italian composer to herald completion of opera lucretia might come down to riseholme for couple of night figuratively lay at foot in hope that must raise up usher into world time have be writing a knew have thought of in name part must come down today tomorrow at moment notice by day night to submit to olga be delighted sent effusive telegram of many sheet full of congratulation welcome for wanted above thing to create part so must signor cortese come down very day ran upstairs with news to husband dear ' be finished said that angel practically offer now what be to do about dinner tonight jacob jane be coming suppose speak one word of italian know what mine be firm intelligible operatic not conversational what be to do hate talking english oh know if can only get mr lucas always talk italian believe at home wonder if can come be musical too will ask husband think that will be man over will be italiano olga wrote at once to lucia mentioning that cortese be staying with quite naturally saying nothing about usefulness of peppino being able to engage musician in own tongue for took for granted eager affirmative such great pleasure came back to for rest of day lucia peppino made up neat little sentence to let off to dazzled cortese at moment when said good night to shew that must have talked italian time have there be occasion for doing so mr weston colonel boucher have already arrived when lucia husband entered lucia have quite shock to see on what intimate term be with hostess actually called other olga jacob jane be most surprising almost painful lucia perhaps because have not known about soon enough have be little satirical about engagement rather a if be slight on that jacob have not be content with celibacy jane with friendship be sure wished nothing well indeed moment got over shock of seeing so intimate with olga must not have be surpassed in cordiality see little of old friend now said to olga jane jointly must excuse desire for solitude in first glow of happiness peppino remember that sweet time oh ever so long ago might have be tact might have be cat that peppino sympathised a remembered beautiful time be tact that be so long ago be cat altogether might be described a cat chewing tact there be slight air of patronage about if there be one thing mr weston must not must not did not even intend to stand be that besides have reached ear that mr lucas have said something about there being difficulty in finding bridesmaid younger than bride fancy how clever of to remember so long ago said then have most marvellous memory dear keep wonderfully olga intervened how kind of mr lucas to come at such short notice said cortese hate talking english so will put between will talk to time wo wo laugh at will when join in with atrocious attempt will buttress on other side with husband who will firmly talk across to lucia have to say something further exposure be at hand quite inevitably be use for peppino to recollect previous engagement oh italian be terribly rusty said knowing that mr weston eye be on why have not sent mr weston handsome wedding present that morning rusty will ask cortese about when have have good talk to ah here be cortese came into room florid loquacious pouring out stream of apology for lateness to olga none of be least intelligible to lucia guessed what be saying next moment olga who apparently understood perfectly told with enviable fluency that be not late at be introducing to explaining that la signora lucia understood husband talked italian did not need to reply to torrent of amiable word from addressed to for be taken on introduced to mr weston colonel instantly whirled round to again asked something not knowing least what meant replied si tante grazie looked puzzled for moment then repeated question in english in what deestrict of italy 'ave voyaged most lucia understood so did mr weston lucia pulled together in rome said che bella citta adoro rom e il mio marito non e vere peppino peppino cordially assented familiar ring of fine intelligible italian restored confidence asked cortese whether be not very fond of music dinner seemed interminable to lucia kept watchful eye on cortese if saw be about to speak to turned hastily to colonel boucher who sat on other side asked something about cari cani translated to while answered made up sentence in italian about blue sky venice very meanly said husband have be there hoping to direct torrent of italian eloquence to knew that a italian conversationalist peppino have rag of reputation left dismally regretted that have not chosen french of knew about a much instead of italian for vehicle of linguistic distinction olga meantime continued to understand that cortese said to reply to with odious fluency at last cortese having said something to made laugh turned to lucia have said to meesis shottlewort proceeded to explain joke in english molto bene said lucia with dying flicker molto divertente non e vero peppino si si said peppino miserably then final disgrace came be something of relief to have over cortese in excellent spirit with dinner wine prospect of olga taking part of lucretia turned beamingly to lucia again now will spick english said be one very pleasant evening enjoy very much ecco just once more lucia shot up into flame parlate inglese molto bene said except when cortese spoke to olga there be more italian that night even unique excitement of hearing olga try over great scene in last act must not quite absorb lucia attention after awful fiasco though sat leaning forward with chin in hand far away look in eye mind be furiously busy a to how to make anything out of so bad job everyone present knew that italian a medium for conversation have suffered complete break down be no longer real use when olga did not quite catch rhythm of passage to murmur uno due tre unconsciously to herself might just a well have said one two three for effect have on mr weston story must be over riseholme next day felt sure that mr weston excellent observer superb reporter have not failed to take in must not fail to do justice to blow after blow have be rained upon palace door be little wonder that whole building be quiver have thought of starting dante class winter for printed italian if have dictionary translation in order to prepare for class must be easily interpreted be spoken word have to understand without preparation at not in least knowing what be coming that have presented such insurmountable difficulty yet who when story of evening be known must seek instruction from teacher of sort must mr weston come to dante class must must must not lucia lay long awake that night tossing turning in bed in delightful apartment in midsummer night dream reviewing fell array of unlucky affair a eyed black shape against glow of firelight struck that same malevolent influence inspired for what have caused failure flatness of tableau omitting unfortunate incident about lamp absence of olga who be who have occasioned unfortunate remark about spanish quartet olga whose clear duty have be when sent invitation for musical party to state so that there must be mistake about that eminent performer be to entrance who must have guessed that must have gone to staggering expense of having down from london brinton quartet be utmost that sane imagination must have pictured be extremely sane imagination have pictured just that with such extreme vividness that have never occurred to that must be anybody else certainly olga must have put spanish quartet in bottom left hand corner instead of music then lucia must have known about have be speechless with emotion when have finished beethoven wiped eye pulled together again really looked a if olga have laid trap for even more like trap be horrid event of evening trap be not at too strong word for to ask to house then suddenly spring upon fact that be expected to talk italian be that open honourable proceeding what if lucia have actually told olga seemed to recollect that peppino often talked italian at home be reason why must be expected off hand like to talk italian anywhere else must have be told what be expected of so a to give chance of having previous engagement lucia hated underhand way be particularly odious in one whom have be willing to educate refine up to highest standard of riseholme indeed looked a if olga nature be actually incapable of receiving cultivation went on own rough independent line giving romp one night not coming to tableau on getting spanish quartet without consultation on third springing dreadful pentecostal party on on fourth olga clearly meant mischief wanted to set up a leader of art culture in riseholme conduct admitted of other explanation lucia benevolent scheme of educating refining vanished like morning mist through drooping eyelid firelight seemed strangely red have be too kind too encouraging now must collect force round be stern a dozed off to sleep reminded to ask georgie to lunch next day peppino must have serious talk have seen georgie comparatively little just lately drowsily uneasily wondered how be georgie by time have quite got over desolation of moment when standing in road opposite mr quantock mulberry tree have given vent to bitter cry of more misery more unhappiness nerve on occasion have be worn to fiddlestrings with fuss fiasco of planning tableau thus fancying in love have be just last straw fact that have be chosen confidant in wonderful scheme of causing mr weston colonel to get engaged distinction of being singled out by olga to friendly intimacy have proved great tonic be quite clear that existence of mr shuttleworth constituted hopeless bar to fruition of passion if be completely honest with be aware that did not really hate mr shuttleworth for standing in path georgie be gentle in way manner of falling in love be very gentle too admired olga immensely found stimulating amusing since be out of question really to be lover must have enjoyed next best to being brother such little pang of jealousy a might experience from time to time be rather in nature of small electric shock voluntarily received be devoted to with warmth that supposed devotion to lucia have never kindled in even went so far a to dream about in agitated though respectful manner without being conscious of unreality about sentiment really wanted to dress up a lover rather than to be one for must form notion at present of what felt to be absorbed in anyone else life be so full a be there really be room for anything else especially if something else must be of quality rendered everything else colourless state of mind quality of emotion be wholly pleasurable quite exciting instead of cry out more misery more unhappiness must now a passed mulberry say to more pleasure more happiness yet a ran down road to lunch with lucia be conscious that be likely to stand angel perhaps certainly one with flaming sword between interest of new life be undoubtedly beginning to bubble in riseholme to georgie found so pleasant to take little mug have filled with exhilarating liquid if lucia proved to be standing in path forbidding approach too be armed for combat with revolutionary weapon consisting of rolled up copy of of debussy music for piano olga have lent few day have be very busy over poissons d'or be further armed by complete knowledge of italian debacle of last night from knowledge of lucia judged must constitute crisis something must have to happen several time lately olga have so to speak run full tilt into lucia have passed on leaving staggering form behind in case so georgie clearly perceived olga have not intended to butt into stagger anybody time have knocked lucia down purely by accident if accident occurred with such awful frequency be to be expected that lucia must find name for must have to be christened with riseholme appetite for complication event georgie guessed that be not likely to go empty away from lunch in addition there be other topic of extraordinary interest for really there have be very odd experience at mr quantock last night when italian debacle be going on little way up road be not going to bring out at once lucia hailed with most cordial manner with superb effrontery began to talk italian just a usual though must have guessed that georgie knew about last night bon arrivato amico mio said why must be three day since met che la falto il signorino what have got there georgie having escaped being caught over italian have made up mind not to talk more ever oh be little thing by debussy said want to play one of to afterwards have just be glancing through bene molto bene said come in to lunch ca promise to like georgino be debussy man who always make want to howl like dog at sound of gong where did get from olga lent said georgie negligently really did call olga to face now by request lucia bugle began to sound yes must think miss bracely must admire that sort of music said suppose be too old fashioned though will not condemn little piece of debussy before have heard old fashioned yes be certainly too old fashioned for music gave last night dio mi oh did enjoy asked lucia sat down without waiting for peppino poor miss bracely said be very kind of in intention to ask must have be kinder to have asked mr antrobus instead have told not to bring ear trumpet to hear that lovely voice for do justice there be lovely note in voice lovely to hear that voice shrieking screaming away in what called great scene be simply pitiful there be melody above there be form musical composition be like architectural building must be built up constructed how often have said that must have colour must have line otherwise can not concede right to say have music lucia finished egg in hurry put elbow on table hope be not hide bound limited said think will acknowledge georgie be not even in divinest music of be not blind to defect if there be defect moonlight sonata for instance have often heard say that two last movement approach first in perfection of form if be permitted to criticise beethoven hope may be allowed to suggest that mr cortese have not produced opera will render fidelio ridiculous really be chiefly sorry for miss bracely must have thought worth while to render not unworthy to interpret fidelio time trouble that cost rather than to seek notoriety by helping to foist on to world fresh combination of engine whistle grunt non e vero peppino how late be lucia have not determined on declaration of war without anxious consideration be quite obvious to that enemy be daily gaining strength therefore sooner came to open hostility better for be equally obvious to mind that olga be pretender to throne have occupied for so long be time to mobilise have first to state view plan of campaign to chief of staff did not quite like evening peppino did caro went on mr cortese appearance be like huge hairdresser touch on piano if can imagine wild bull butting at key will have idea of above italian gathered that be neapolitan know what neapolitan dialect be like tuscan roman who between believe lingua toscano in bocca romana remember know how to speak own tongue find neapolitan totally unintelligible for speak for mio sposo a well want to understand what roman understand la bella lingua be sufficient for hear that olga must understand quite well said georgie betraying complete knowledge of have happened that may be so said lucia hope understood english too music have not ' h ' when spoke english have not slightest doubt in own mind that italian be equally illiterate doe not matter see mr cortese linguistic accomplishment concern music doe if poor miss bracely with lovely note be going to study appear a lucretia be sorry if be so news really be rather magnificent be war a well of there must not be slightest doubt riseholme by time knew that lucia peppino have not be able to understand word of what cortese have said here be answer to back biting suggestion vividly put forward by mr weston on green that morning that explanation be that lucia peppino did not know italian must not reasonably be expected to know neapolitan dialect language of dante satisfied humble need found difficult to understand cortese when spoke english did not imply that did not know english dante tongue shakespeare tongue sufficed be word of libretto like asked georgie lucia fixed with beady eye ready eager to show how delighted be to bestow approbation wherever be deserved wonderful said felt so did peppino that word be a utterly wasted on formless music a be poor miss bracely voice how did go peppino let think lucia raised head again with far away look amore misterio said amore profondo amore profondo del vasto mar ah there be poor bella lingua again wonder who wrote libretto mr cortese wrote libretto said georgie lucia did not hesitate for moment gave silvery laugh oh dear said if have heard talk must know must not have well have not have enough of mr cortese work news what did do last night when peppino be in purgatorio georgie be almost equally glad to get off subject of italian le said in of italian better be dining with mr quantock said have very interesting russian woman staying with princess popoffski lucia laughed again dear daisy said tell about russian princess be guru dear how easily people be taken in guru well be in same boat there took guru on poor daisy valuation still believe have very remarkable gift curry cook not princess popoffski now have seance said georgie indeed princess popoffski be medium georgie grew little dignified be use adopting that tone cara said relapsing into italian be not there be having purgatory at olga be very remarkable touched hand round table there be possibility of fraud lucia view on psychic phenomenon be clearly known to riseholme who produced be fraudulent who be taken in by be dupe consequently there be irony in baby talk of reply dood said very dood listen carefully tell lucia georgie recounted experience table have rocked tapped out name table have whirled round though be very heavy table georgie have be told that have two sister one of whom in latin be bear how did table know that asked ursa bear know then while be sitting there princess went off into trance said there be beautiful spirit present who blessed called mr quantock margarita a may know be italian for daisy lucia smiled thank for explaining georgino said there be mistaking irony of georgie thought must be ironical too did know if knew said thought might be neapolitan dialect pray go on said lucia breathing through nose said be georgie said georgie that there be georgie not far off be odd because olga house with mr shuttleworth be so close then princess went into very deep trance spirit be there took possession of who be that asked lucia name be amadeo spoke in amadeo voice indeed be amadeo who be speaking be florentine knew dante quite well materialised saw bright glorious vision flashed upon lucia dante class might not even though be clearly understood that cortese spoke unintelligible neapolitan be complete success if only attraction be that taught dante must be quite different proposition if princess popoffski controlled by amadeo dante friend be present might read canto first then hold seance of amadeo via princess popoffski must take charge while be simmering in mind be important to drop irony be extremely sympathetic georgino how wonderful said a know be sceptical by nature want evidence carefully sifted daresay be too critical be fault fancy getting in touch with friend of dante what must one not give tell what be princess like be sort of person one must ask to dinner georgie be still sore over irony to have be treated have solid fact behind that daisy quantock margarita have declared that in circumstance must permit lucia to annex princess have forgiven lucia for annexing guru considering that have only annexed curry cook be not so difficult be quite determined to run princess yes might ask said if irony be going about there be reason why must not have share lucia bounced from seat a if have be spring cushion will have little party said three dear daisy husband princess think will be enough psychic hate crowd because disturbs influence mind say believe in power yet be quite open minded must like to be convinced let see be doing nothing tomorrow let have little dinner tomorrow will send line to dear daisy at once say how enormously account of seance have interested must like dear daisy to have something to console for terrible fiasco about guru then georgino mio will listen to debussy expect anything if seems to formless will say so if seems to promising will be equally frank perhaps be great can not tell about till have heard let write note first be soon done lucia having sent by hand came into music room drew down blind over window through autumn sun be streaming very little art a have once said must stand daylight only shakespeare dante beethoven perhaps bach must compete with sun georgie for part must have liked rather more light after debussy wrote such very odd chord sequence that be not necessary to wear spectacle lucia sat in high chair near piano with chin in hand tremendously erect georgie took off ring laid on candle bracket ran hand nimbly over piano poissons d'or said goldfish yes pesci d'oro said lucia explaining to peppino lucia face changed a elusive music proceeded far away look died away became puzzled chin came out of hand hand came out of covered eye before georgie have got to end answer to note came sat with in hand released from covering eye tried to beat time on last note got up with regretful sigh be finished asked yet feel inclined to say be going to begin ' have be fed have drank in anything yes warned must be quite candid there be verdict be sorry vewy sowwy played be sure beautifully georgino be buono avvocato said must be said for client will open note before discus more fully give georgino cigarette peppino be sure deserves one after accidental pulled up blind again in order to read note a read face clouded ah be sorry for said peppino princess doe not go out in evening always have seance there daresay daisy mean to ask evening soon will keep evening two open be long time since have seen dear daisy will pop round afternoon chapter thirteen spiritualism thing pertaining to swept over riseholme like amazing growth of tropical forest germinating shooting out surprising vegetation rearing into huge fantastic shape in centre of wonderful jungle be temple so to speak that temple be house of mr quantock strange providence be origin of mr quantock week before have toothache being no longer in fold of christian science found that be good at to tell that be false claim false claim might be be so plausible at once that quite deceived went up to london to have falsity demonstrated by dentist since collapse of yoga flight of curry cook have embarked on mystical adventure starved for new fad then when first visit to dentist be over tooth required three treatment went to vegetarian restaurant to see if there be anything enlightening to be got out of be delighted to find sitting at very small table with very communicative lady who ate cabbage in perfectly incredible quantity have round pale face like moon behind cloud enormous eyebrow that almost met over nose strange low voice of husky tone pronunciation quite a foreign a signor cortese wore very curious ring with large engraved amethyst turquoise in since in first moment of conversation have volunteered information that vegetarianism be only possible diet for who be cultivating psychical power mr quantock asked if weird finger ornament have mystical signification have one be gnostic one be rosicrucian other be cabalistic be easy to picture mr quantock delight adventure have met with smiling mouth mysterious eye in course of animated conversation of hour lady explained that if mr quantock be like searcher after psychical truth cared to come to flat at past four that afternoon must try to help added with little diffidence that fee for seance be guinea a left took card out of case encrusted with glowing ruby gave be princess popoffski now here be curious thing for last few evening at riseholme mr quantock have be experimenting with table found that creaked tilted tapped in most encouraging way when robert laid hand on then something whatever be that moved table have indicated by rap that name be daisy robert a well a giving other information must not so easily be verified robert have grown quite excited about be vexed that seance be interrupted by wife expedition to london now how providential be have walked straight from dentist into arm of princess popoffski be barely half past four when mr quantock arrived at princess flat in pleasant quiet side street off charing cross road small dapper little gentleman received who explained that be princess secretary conducted through several small room into presence of sybil room so mr quantock thrillingly noticed be dimly lit by oil lamp stood in front of shrine containing image of great spiritual guide from moses down to madame blavatski smell of incense hung about there be vas of flower on table strange casket set with winking stone in last of room princess be seated for moment mr quantock hardly recognised for wore blue robe left massive arm bare up writhed serpent shaped bracelet of many coil fixed eye on mr quantock a if have never seen before made sign of recognition princess have be meditating said secretary in whisper will come to herself presently for moment meditation unpleasantly reminded mr quantock of guru nothing must have be le like ill starred curry cook than majestic creature eventually gave great sigh came out of meditation ah be friend said do know that have purple halo be very gratifying especially when be explained that only most elect have purple halo soon other elect soul assembled for seance in centre of table be placed musical box violin hardly have circle be made light turned down when most extraordinary thing began to happen perfect storm of rappings issued from table began to rock violently presently there came peal of laughter in high voice who have be here before said that be pocky be dear naughty boy so mr quantock neighbour explained to so full of fun when on earth have be hungarian violinist still invisible pocky wished all much laughter joy then suddenly said 'ullo 'ullo 'ere be new friend like mr quantock neighbour with touch of envy in voice told that pocky clearly meant then pocky said that have be having heavenly music on other side that day that if new friend must say please must play of so mr quantock trembling with emotion said please pocky instantly began to play on violin spirit tune have just be playing on other side after that violin clattered back onto middle of table again pocky blowing shower of kiss to went away amid peal of happy laughter silence fell then deep bass voice said be coming amadeo out of middle of table appeared faint luminousness grew upwards began to take form swathe of white muslin shaped in darkness there appeared white face in among topmost fold of muslin with roman nose melancholy expression be not gay like pocky be intensely impressive spoke line in italian when asked to repeat piece of dante mr quantock knew be italian because recognised notte uno caro familiar word on lucia lip seance came to end mr quantock having placed guinea with utmost alacrity in sort of offertory plate princess secretary negligently prominently put down on table in one of other room waited to arrange for seance most unfortunately princess be leaving town next day on much needed holiday for have be giving three seance day for last two month required rest yes be off tomorrow princess said for week at royal hotel at brinton pleasant bracing air always set up after will be back in town do know that part of country daisy must hardly believe ear brinton said live close to brinton whole scheme flashed completely upon even a athene sprang full grown from brain of zeus do think that might be induced to spend few day with at riseholme said husband be so much interested in psychical thing must be guest too hope if rested for few day at brinton first if came on to afterwards then if be thoroughly rested perhaps must give seance two know mr quantock felt great diffidence in speaking of guinea in same sentence with princess have to make start if be thoroughly rested said if little circle perhaps of four at usual price must be worth while just after dinner know nothing else to do day rest there be pretty drive beautiful air very quiet think may say more comfortable than hotel must be such pleasure mr quantock heard clinking of bracelet from room where princess be still reposing there stood in door looking unspeakably majestic very gracious so mr quantock put proposition before secretary coming to rescue on subject of usual fee when two day afterwards mr quantock returned to riseholme be to get ready spare room robert room next to for thrilling visitor whose first seance georgie piggy have attended on evening of italian debacle quantocks have taken high magnificent line about usual fee for seance expensive line then roumanian oil have be extremely prosperous lately mention whatever of fee be made to guest offertory plate be put in prominent position in hall there be fumbling for change discreet pressure of coin into secretary hand entire cost be borne by roumanian oil princess mr quantock apparently be old friend spoke to other at dinner a dear friend princess declared in most gratifying way that have be most intimate in previous incarnation without allusion to fact that in incarnation have met for first time last week at vegetarian restaurant be kind enough be left to be understood to give little seance after dinner at house of dear friend so publicly question of money never came up now princess be to stay three night therefore a soon a mr quantock have made sure of proceeded to fill up of seance without asking lucia to of be not that have not fully forgiven for odious grabbing of guru for have done that on night of spanish quartette be rather that meant to make sure that there must by possibility be anything to forgive concerning conduct with regard to princess lucia must not grab so call daisy power of forgiveness into play again if never came near daisy meant to take proper precaution that must not come near accordingly georgie piggy be asked to first seance if did not go very well must not particularly matter with olga mr shuttleworth be bidden to second lady ambermere with georgie again to third quite apart from immense interest of psychic phenomenon be deadly work for must be bitter indeed to lucia to know a most undoubtedly must that lady ambermere who have cut so firmly be dining twice coming to seance daisy must again be repeated have quite forgiven lucia about guru lucia must take consequence of what have done be after first seance that frenzy for spiritualism seized riseholme princess with great good nature gave further exhibition of psychical power in addition to seance even a georgie next afternoon be receiving lucia cruel verdict about sybil be looking at hand of colonel boucher mr weston unerringly probing into past lifting corner of veil giving glimpse into future knew that two be engaged for have learned from mr quantock in morning drive did not attempt to conceal fact how must be accounted for looking impressively from one to other said that woman no longer young tall with fair hair have crossed life have be connected with one of for year past be impossible to describe elizabeth more accurately than mr weston in high excitement confessed that maid who have be with for fifteen year entirely corresponded with what princess have seen in hand after that took only moment further scrutiny for princess to discover elizabeth be going to be happy too then found that there be man connected with elizabeth colonel boucher hand to transferred gaze trembled with delightful anticipation seemed to see man there be not quite sure be there man who perhaps have be known to for long time there be then by degree affair of elizabeth atkinson be unerringly unravelled be little wonder that colonel pushed mr weston bath chair with record speed to ye signe of ye daffodil by greatest good luck obtained copy of palmist manual at of informal seance attended by goosie mr antrobus even stranger thing have happened for princess hand a held little preliminary conversation began to tremble twitch even more strongly than colonel boucher mr quantock hastily supplied with pencil quantity of sheet of foolscap paper for trembling twitching implied that reschia ancient egyptian priestess be longing to use princess hand for automatic writing after few wild scrawl plunge with pencil princess though still continued to talk to covered sheet after sheet in large flowing handwriting when be finished princess sunk back in chair proved to be most wonderful spiritual discourse describing happiness harmony pervaded whole universe be only temporarily obscured by mist of materiality mist be wholly withdrawn from vision of who have passed over lived in midst of song flower light love towards end there be le intelligible passage about fire from cloud be rendered completely intelligible very next day when there be thunderstorm surely unusual occurrence in november if have not happened mr quantock interpretation of a referring to zeppelin must have be found equally satisfactory be wonder after mr antrobus piggy goosie spent long evening with pencil paper for princess said that everybody have gift of automatic writing if must only take pain patience to develop everybody have own particular guide be very next day that piggy obtained script clearly signed annabel nicostratus jamifleg followed very soon after for mother sister so there be jealousy crown apex of manifestation be undoubtedly three regular seance took place to three select circle after dinner musical box resounded violin gave forth ravishing air sitter be touched by unseen finger when everybody hand be touching around table from middle of materialisation swathed in muslin be built up pocky came visible to eye played spirit music amadeo melancholy impressive recited dante cardinal newman not visible to eye audible to ear joined in singing lead kindly light secretary requested to encourage with blessed profusely at conclusion lady ambermere be so much impressed so nervous of driving home alone that insisted on georgie going back to hall with consigning person to pug miss lyall for three day of princess visit there be practically subject discussed at parliament on green except latest manifestation olga went to town for crystal georgie for planchette riseholme temporarily became spiritualistic republic with princess a priestess mr quantock a president lucia time be almost insane with pique jealousy for sat in vain waiting for invitation to come to seance must long before three day be over have welcomed with enthusiasm place at one of inferior informal exhibition since must not procure princess for dinner asked daisy to bring to lunch tea at hour day night be convenient made peppino hang about opposite daisy house with order to drop stick let hat blow off if saw even secretary coming out of gate so a possibly to enter into conversation with while positively forced one morning into daisy hall cried margarita in silvery tone on occasion margarita came out of drawing room with most determined expression on face shut door carefully behind dearest lucia said how nice to see what be just popped in for chat said have set eye on since evening of spanish quartette so long ago a be well must come in again sometime very soon wo day after tomorrow will be much le busy promise to look in then have visitor with have not asked lucia desperately yes two indeed dear friend of mine be afraid must not like know opinion about anything connected with spiritualism be silly of have be dabbling in oh how interesting said lucia be always ready to learn alter opinion if be wrong mr quantock did not move from in front of drawing room door yes said then will have great talk about when come to see day after tomorrow know will find hard to convince kissed tip of finger in manner so hopelessly final that there be nothing to do go away then with poor generalship lucia altered tactic went up to village green where piggy be telling georgie about script signed annabel be repeated again for lucia benefit be too lovely said piggy so annabel guide writes hand quite unlike mine lucia gave little scream put finger to ear gracious said what have come over riseholme wherever go hear nothing talk of seance spirit automatic writing pack of nonsense dear piggy wonder at sensible girl like mr weston propelled by colonel whirled up in bath chair palmist manual ' be too wonderful said jacob sat up over till know what hour there be break in line of life just at right place when be so ill in egypt be most remarkable when tommy luton brought round bath chair morning have at garden door because gravel just laid at front door wheel sink so far into 'tommy said 'let look at hand moment there on line of fate be little cross that mean bereavement came just right did jacob when be thirteen for be fourteen year mr luton died just year ago of course did tell tommy for only told to wash hand be most curious have planchette come yet mr georgie will be most anxious to know what writes so if have got evening free night soon just come round for bit of dinner will make evening of with table turning planchette palmistry now tell about seance first night wish must have be present at real seance of course mr quantock ca find room for everybody be sure be most kind of to let colonel come in yesterday afternoon be thrilled with who know that princess did write palmist manual for on title page say be by p might be popoffski a easily a not perhaps princess allusion to there not being room for everybody be agony to lucia laughed in most silvery manner perhaps peppino said must ask mio caro if wrote doe stand for pillson georgino be author of palmist manual ecco believe be be not quite wise for one detested irony more than mr weston be sharper to detect must never have be ironical just then indeed have dropped into italian said be sure be il signer peppino il signer pillson who wrote believe be principessa so ecco did not have delicious evening at miss bracely other night such lovely singing so interesting to learn that signor cortese made up lovely word for though did understand much of sounded so exquisite fancy miss bracely talking italian so beautifully when none of knew talked at mr weston amiable face be crimson with suppressed emotion of few word be only most insignificant leakage very awkward pause succeeded be luckily broken by everybody beginning to talk again very fast brightly then mr weston chair scudded away piggy skipped away to stock where goosie be sitting with large sheet of foolscap in case hand twitched for automatic script lucia turned to georgie who alone be left poor daisy said dropped in just now really found very odd strange what with craze for christian science uric acid guru medium one wonder if be quite sane so sad must be dreadfully sorry if have mental collapse that sort of thing be always so painful know of first rate place for rest cure think must be wise if just casually dropped name of to mr robert in case last craze seems so terribly infectious fancy mr weston dabbling in palmistry be too comical hope did not hurt feeling by suggesting that peppino wrote manual be dangerous to make little joke to poor mr weston georgie quite agreed with did not think necessary to say in what sense agreed with day now lucia be pouring flood of light on quite new side of character have be undeveloped like print from photographic plate lying in dark so long a be undisputed mistress of riseholme so struck now since advent of olga have taken up critical ironical standpoint previously have reserved for londoner at turn have to criticise condemn where once must only have praised so few month ago there have be that marvellous hightum garden party when olga have sung long after lady ambermere have gone away be garden party splendour success of have be hers one have be allowed to forget until olga came back again moment happened began to sing on own account after so georgie thought have perfect right to do whole aspect of affair be changed romped riseholme did not like romp sang in church be theatrical gave party with spanish quartette brinton be publicly credited with performance then have come mr quantock princess lo must be kind to remember name of establishment for rest cure in hope of saving poor daisy sanity again colonel boucher mr weston be intending to get married consulted palmist manual so too helped to develop a with acid print have lain so long in dark poor thing said lucia be dreadful to have sense of humour be sure hope that colonel boucher will thoroughly understand that have none before speaks fatal word then have none either have often noticed that two people without sense of humour find other most witty amusing sense of humour expect be not very common gift miss bracely have none at for call romping humour a for poor daisy what can rival solemnity in sitting night after night round table with someone who may may not be russian princess russia of course be very large place one doe not know how many princess there may be there thrilling over pot of luminous paint false nose calling amadeo friend of dante be too much for georgie asked mr quantock princess to dine with said hoped there must be seance afterwards must have done that if thought be only false nose pot of luminous paint may have be impulsive said lucia speaking very rapidly daresay be impulsive if impulse lie in direction of extending such poor hospitality a can offer to friend friend be not ashamed of far otherwise when see observe awful effect of so called spiritualism on people whom must have thought sensible well balanced include poor dear daisy among then be only thankful that impulse did not happen to lead into countenancing such piffle a sister so truly observed about poor daisy guru have come opposite georgie house suddenly drawing room window be thrown up olga head looked out have fit georgie to find here said good morning mr lucas be behind mulberry did see something happened to kitchen range ca have lunch at home do give have brought crystal will gaze gaze can see nothing at present except own nose window be psychical mr lucas be last straw lucia grievance have be flocking together like swallow for flight to crown came open annexation of georgie there be olga sitting in window unasked demanding lunch with silly ridiculous crystal in hand wondering if lucia be psychical silvery laugh be little shrill started full tone above normal pitch dear miss bracely said be afraid be much too commonplace matter of fact to care about such thing be great loss know deprives of pleasant society of russian princess be made differently be very lucky must get home georgie certainly seemed very lucky that everyone be not precisely like lucia at moment there must have be quarrelling walked quickly off georgie entered house lucia have really be remarkably rude if allusion be made to be ready to confess that seemed little worried friendship must allow candour demanded allusion of sort be made there be certain flush on olga face explained that have be sitting over fire princess visit came to end next day world knew that be going back to london by be express lady ambermere be quite aware of drove in with pug miss lyall meaning to give lift to station leaving mr quantock if wanted to see guest off to follow with princess luggage in fly doubt have be ordered daisy have intention of permitting sort of thing drove calmly away with dear friend in georgie motor leaving baffled lady ambermere to follow not a liked did like though not much found on platform among perfect crowd of riseholmites who have strolled down to station on lovely morning to see if parcel have come lady ambermere took very little notice of managed that pug must give paw to princess a took seat waved hand to mr quantock dear friend a train slid out of station late lord have russian relation said majestically how did get to know met at potsdam be on tip of mr quantock tongue be afraid that lady ambermere might not understand ask when have be to potsdam be grievous work making joke for lady ambermere train sped on to london princess opened envelope hostess have discreetly put in hand found that be right hostess have also provided with admirable lunch secretary took out of gladstone bag when be finished wanted cigarette a looked for even after have found continued to search for something else there be musical box there curious piece of elastic violin be in case there be white mask still continued to search about same time a gave up search mr quantock wandered upstairs to princess room le highly vitalised nature than hers must have be in stupor of content be more in frenzy of content than in stupor how fine that frenzy be may be judged from fact that perhaps smallest ingredient in be utter defeat of lucia cared comparatively little for glorious achievement be not sure that when princess came back again a have arranged to do on next holiday must not ask lucia to come to seance indeed have little pity for vanquished so great be spoil never have riseholme risen to pitch of enthusiasm with good cause have done so now for of wonderful exciting thing have ever happened there seance be most delirious better even than excitement of riseholme be cause of excitement for spiritualism truth of inexplicable psychic phenomenon have flashed upon tableau romp yoga moonlight sonata shakespeare christian science olga uric acid elizabethan furniture engagement of colonel boucher mr weston tremendous topic have paled like fire in sunlight before revelation have now dawned by practice patience by zealous concentration on crystal palm by waiting for automatic script to develop attained to highest mystery must evoke cardinal newman pocky there be bed in sybil have slept there be fresh vase of flower difficult to procure in november still obtainable loved to have standing near there be chest of drawer in have put clothes mr quantock pulled open one by one finding fresh emanation vibration everywhere lowest one stuck little have to use force to smile be struck from face a flew open inside be billow billow of finest possible muslin fold after fold of drew out with there came pair of false eyebrow recognised at once a being amadeo muslin belonged to pocky a well needed moment concentrated thought in swift succession rejected two course of action that suggested first be to use muslin must make summer garment for year chief reason against be that be little old for muslin second course be to send whole paraphernalia back to dear friend with without comment must be tantamount to direct accusation of fraud never more if did must dispense dear friend to riseholme like expensive drug must not so utterly burn boat there remained only one other judicious course of action got to work have be cold morning clear frosty have caused good fire to be lit in princess bedroom for to dress by still prospered in grate mr quantock having shut door

at price in spite of discovery felt by mean sure that must not ask princess to come again minister to spiritual need have hardly got downstairs when robert came in from green where have be recounting experience of last seance looked a if there be chimney on fire said wish be kitchen chimney then perhaps beef might be so raw a be yesterday thus be comedy intertwined with tragedy chapter fourteen georgie be very busily engaged during first week of december on water colour sketch of olga sitting at piano singing difficulty of be such that at time almost despaired of accomplishing for problem of how to draw face mouth wide open yet retain likeness seemed almost insoluble often sat in front of own looking glass with mouth open diligently drew own face in order to arrive at principle of change of line took place certainly shape of person face when mouth be wide open altered so completely that must have thought quite unrecognisable however skilfully artist reproduced elongated countenance yet georgie must easily recognise face in glass a forehead eye cheek bone alone retained wonted aspect even nose seemed to lengthen if opened mouth very wide then how again be to indicate that be singing not yawning preparing for sneeze most successful sketch at present looked precisely a if be yawning made georgie jaw long to yawn too perhaps shape of mouth in two position be really same be only sound led to suppose that open mouthed person be singing perhaps piano must supply necessary suggestion olga must not sit down at piano merely to yawn sneeze for must do anywhere then brilliant idea struck must introduce shaded lamp standing on piano then face must be in red shadow naturally entailed fresh problem with regard to light light seemed to present le difficulty than likeness besides must make dress key of piano very like indeed when came to painting again despaired there must be red shadow on face yellow light on hand on green dress presently whole thing looked not so much like olga singing by lamp light a lobster salad spread out in sunlight more painted more vividly did lettuce leaf dressing lobster emerge from paper so took away lamp shut be mouth there must be at piano just going to sing artistic agony have reward more than compensated for for regularly now took drawing board paint box across to house sat with while practised there be none of love lily low yawning york now for be very busy learning part in lucretia spending solid two hour at morning georgie began to perceive what sort of work implied to produce spontaneous ease with brunnhilde hailed sun more astounding even be fact that mere learning of note be preliminary to what called real work when have got through mere mechanical part of must have to study then when practice be over must indulgently sit with head in profile against dark background georgie must suck one end of brush bite other wonder whether must ever produce anything must dare to offer by daily poring on face grew not to admire only to adore youth beauty by daily contact with began to see how fresh how lovely be mind illuminated georgie be going to scold said one day a took up place against black panel be selfish little brute think of nothing own amusement did that ever strike georgie gasped with surprise here be spending whole of morning trying to do something must be worthy christmas present for to say nothing of hour have spent with mouth open in front of glass cost of beautiful frame have ordered yet be supposed to be only thinking about of course olga did not know that picture be to be hers how tarsome be said be always finding fault with explain well be neglecting old friend for new one said dear must never drop old friend for instance when did last play duet with mr lucas oh not so very long ago said georgie quite long enough be sure actually mean sitting down thumping piano with when did last think about make plan for talk baby language who told ever did asked georgie gracious how can possibly remember that sort of thing must say at guess that everybody told now poor mr lucas be feeling out of neglected dethroned be on mind rather be talking to about because be largely fault now be talking quite frankly so fence say be mine know exactly what mean be perfectly wrong primarily be mr lucas fault because be quite stupidest woman ever saw be partly fault too turned round come georgie let have out said be perfectly powerless to do anything because detests have got to help help drop selfishness before came here used to run give treat like going to tableau listening to stupid old moonlight sonata talking seven word of italian then came along with earthly intention except to enjoy holiday got into head be trying to run place instead of be so just say 'yes yes said georgie well put in odious position helpless position did best to be nice to went to house until ceased to ask asked here for everything thought must amuse until ceased to come took notice of rudeness be

fact that olga be most frequent think will drop be reasonable for since riseholme have new absorbing excitement few week to say nothing of current excitement of daily life followed that even most thrilling pursuit must not hold stage for very long still interest in spiritualism have died down with rapidity of seed on stony ground even mr quantock seems to have cooled said olga husband be here last night looked rather bored when suggested table turning wonder if anything have happened to put off what do think must have asked georgie with riseholme alacrity georgie do really believe in

duty there be spice savour in so doing that came entirely from fact that olga wished to by service be pleasing in be distasteful in tended to cut off from if have to devote time to lucia still delighted in doing believe be falling in love with time said georgie to be wonderful be big be at moment thought be violently diverted for robert quantock came out of house in tremendous hurry merely scowling at georgie positively trotted across green in direction of news agent instantly georgie recollected that have seen there already morning before visit to olga buying new twopenny paper in yellow cover called todd news have have few word of genial conversation what must have happened in last two hour that made robert merely gnash teeth at georgie now make second visit to paper shop be impossible not to linger moment see what robert did when got to paper shop with aid of spectacle georgie perceived that presently loaded with whole packet of paper in yellow cover presumably todd news flesh blood must not resist craving of curiosity making detour so a to avoid being gnashed at again by robert who be coming rapidly back in direction strolled round to paper shop asked for copy of todd news instantly bright december morning grew dark with mystery for proprietor told that mr quantock have bought copy possessed of further information must be obtained except that have bought copy of other daily paper a well georgie must make nothing of having observed robert hurry into house again went on errand to lucia have seen what robert did when got home be doubtful if must have avoided breaking into house snatching copy of todd news from robert went to study locked door drew out from under blotting pad first copy of todd news that bought earlier in morning put with rest then with furrowed brow turned to police report in time after looking at laid paper down did same to daily telegraph daily mail morning post daily chronicle finally be last of daily paper perused daily mirror tore in shred said damn sat for while in thought trying to recollect if anybody in riseholme except colonel boucher took in daily mirror felt morally certain that one did letting out of study again locking door after went into street saw at glance that colonel be employed in whirling mr weston round green instead of joining hurried to colonel house for there be time for half measure fixed atkinson with eye said must like to write note to colonel boucher be shown into sitting room saw daily mirror lying open on table a soon a be left alone stuffed into pocket told atkinson must speak to colonel instead intercepted path of bath chair be nearly run over stood ground in perfectly firm voice asked colonel if there be news in morning paper with colonel decided negative ringing joyfully in ear went home again locked for second time into study there be luxury when fell danger have be averted by promptness presence of mind in living through moment of danger again robert opened todd news for gave fuller account read over paragraph in police news headed bogus russian princess now gloated over line have made shudder before when read how marie lowenstein of gerald street charing cross road calling princess popoffski have be brought up at bow street police court for fraudulently professing to tell fortune produce materialised spirit at seance in flat sordid detail followed detective who have be there seized apparition by throat turned on electric light be woman popoffski throat that held secretary hezekiah schwarz be discovered under table detaching electric hammer fine be inflicted moment mental debate be sufficient to determine robert not to tell wife be true that have produced popoffski then have praised applauded for that le than have be convinced of popoffski integrity high rank marvellous psychic power together have soared to pinnacle of unexampled greatness in riseholme world besides poor daisy must be simply flattened out if knew that popoffski be better than guru glanced at pile of paper at fire place have be cold morning clear frosty good blaze prospered in grate out of copy of todd news tore page on be printed police report fed fire with page after page put upon never have so much paper be devoted to one grate up chimney flew in sheet of flame sometimes be afraid have set on fire have to pause shielding scorched face until hollow rumbling have died down with page from two copy of daily mirror holocaust be over unlocked door again one in riseholme knew one must ever know riseholme have be electrified by spiritualism even now seance have be cheap at price debris of paper caused to be removed by housemaid be hardly done when wife came in from green thought there be chimney on fire robert said must have liked to be kitchen chimney a said other day stuff nonsense dear said lunch time be yes ah there be post none for two for looked at narrowly a took letter perhaps subconscious mind according to dear friend theory held

indeed said have written to appeared to try to remember well really believe have said be remiss of must send long budget one of day time looked narrowly at have secret wondered a well a must be georgie found mission none too easy be only thought that be labour of love something very like enabled to persevere even then for first few minute thought might prove love labour lost so bright unreal be lucia have half crossed shakespeare garden have clearly seen standing at window of music room when stole away next moment strain of slow movement played very loud drowned bell on mermaid tail so completely that wondered whether have rung at a matter of fact lucia peppino be in midst of most serious conversation when georgie came through gate be concerned with deciding what be to be done party at hurst sometime during christmas week be a regular a festival year everything be so unusual who be to be asked in first place certainly not mr weston for have talked italian to lucia in manner impossible to misinterpret probably so said lucia with great acidity must be playing child game with promesso be equally impossible to ask miss bracely husband for relation be already severed on account of spanish quartette signer cortese a for quantocks did peppino expect lucia to ask mr quantock again ever then there be georgie who have become so different strange well here be georgie hastily sat down at piano peppino closed eye for slow movement opening of door be lost on lucia peppino eye be closed consequently georgie sat down on nearest chair waited at end peppino sighed sighed too who be said lucia sharply why be georgie what stranger be news be delivered in coldest of tone lucia snatched morsel of wax off eb have heard none said georgie in great discomfort just dropped in lucia fixed peppino with glance if have shouted at top of voice must not have conveyed more unmistakably that be going to manage situation ah be very pleasant said peppino have be so busy lately that have seen nobody be quite country cousin so town mouse must spare little cheese how be dear miss bracely now very well said georgie saw morning lucia gave sigh of relief be good said peppino do hear

nice young man making orange flower wreath choosing bridesmaid how naughty be yes then dear daisy how be still entertaining princess look in court circular morning to see if princess pop pop popoff be if princess popoff have popped off to see cousin czar again dear amount of malice envy uncharitableness lucia managed to put into quite unrehearsed speech be positively amazing have not thought over beforehand for moment came out with august spontaneity of lightning leaping from cloud not till that moment have georgie guessed at tithe of olga have felt so certain about double emotion took hold of be immensely sorry for lucia never having conjectured how must have suffered before attained to so superb sourness adored intuition have guessed wanted to sweeten outburst be not quite over yet though lucia felt distinctly better georgie said though be sure be such stranger ought to call mr pillson what have be doing playing miss bracely accompaniment sewing wedding dress day raising spook night yes lucia have caught yes from lady ambermere having found peculiarly obnoxious laid down proposition asked question then confirmed mr cortese said be still roaring out marvellous english italian yes what full life lead georgie suppose have time for painting now be not bow drawn at venture for have seen georgie come out of old place with paint box drawing board direct attack on did not lessen power of sweet charity have sent here blew bugle to rally good nature for be capable have be painting lately said at least have be trying to be doing little sketch of miss bracely at piano want to give on christmas day be so difficult wish have brought round to ask advice must only have screamed with laughter at be dreadful failure much worse than gave for birthday fancy keeping still in lovely music room send to pantry will do something better for next lucia try a might must not help being rather touched by there be golden autumn woodland bleak december yellow daffodil rose of summer have blacked over by boot boy said take down georgie let send to be blacked be much better there be playfulness behind sarcasm now peeped out from made most of will do presently said just now want to engage peppino to dine with on christmas day now be tarsome say be engaged one can never tell with party asked lucia suspiciously well thought must have just one of old evening together again said georgie feeling remarkably clever will have quantocks sha colonel mr colonel peppino mr rumbold will make eight be more than foljambe like must lump mr rumbold be always singing carol christmas evening with choir will be alone ah carol said lucia wincing know will provide with little wad of cotton wool do come will have just party of eight have asked one yet perhaps nobody will come want peppino rest may come stop away do say approve lucia must not yield at once have to press finger to forehead so kind of georgie said must think be doing anything on christmas night carrissimo where be engagement book go consult be grand manoeuvre for hardly have peppino left room when started up with little scream ran after so stupid cried put in smoking room poor caro will look for ever so long back in minute georgino naturally be perfectly clear to georgie wanted to have short private consultation with peppino waited rather hopefully for return for peppino felt sure be bored with achilles attitude of sitting sulking in tent came back wreathed in smile instantly embarked on question of what to do after dinner romp certainly not why not tableau again question be still under debate when went in to lunch be settled affirmatively during macaroni lucia said that wanted to work to death so get rid of have thought peppino of having little holiday on riviera anyhow must put if off till after christmas georgie mouth be full of crashing toast at moment must only shake head a soon a toast must be swallowed made usual reply with great fervour georgie be hardly at complacent when walked home afterwards thought how extremely good natured have be for must not feel that marvellous forbearance be sort of mistletoe growth on quite foreign really to nature never before have lucia showed so shrewish venomous temper have not thought capable of for gracious queen there be substituted snarling fish wife then a georgie calmly pursued pacific mission of comfort to olga have ordained how fish wife wrinkle have be smoothed out asp withered from tongue have imagination ever pictured lucia saying such thing to must have supplied with sequel complete severance of relation between instead of that have consulted truckled to truckled yes have truckled be astonished at why have truckled beautiful mouth kindly eye of olga supplied answer certainly must drop in at once tell result of mission perhaps must reward by calling darling again really deserved that must say something nice to be day of surprise for georgie found olga at home recounted without loving of substance sarcasm of lucia own amazing tact forbearance did not comment just narrated fact in vivid riseholme manner waited for reward olga looked at moment in silence then deliberately wiped eye oh poor mr lucas said must have be miserable to have behaved like be so sorry now what else can do georgie to make feel better think have done everything must have be required of said georgie be must do to keep temper at will give party at christmas because promised must oh be ten day to christmas yet said ca paint portrait give for present oh think must playing moonlight sonata georgie felt terribly inclined to be offended tell olga that be tired of to be dignified say be unusually busy never have shown such forbearance towards downright rudeness a have shown to lucia though have shown that for olga sake seemed to be without single spark of gratitude continued to urge request do paint little picture of repeated must love make young interesting think over anyhow perhaps will think of something better than now wo go secure guest for christmas at once georgie turned to leave room just a got to door spoke again think be brick said somehow undemonstrative expression of approval began to glow in georgie heart a walked home apparently took for granted that be going to behave with perfect tact good temper that have shown did not surprise in least have almost forgotten to indicate that have noticed at that a thought about seemed far deeper compliment than if have told how wonderful be took for granted more le that must be kind pleasant lucia said have not fallen short of standard chapter fifteen georgie christmas party have just taken seat at round rosewood table without cloth hoped that foljambe must be quick with champagne because there have be rather long wait before dinner owing to lucia peppino being late conversation have be little jerky lucia a usual have sailed into room without word of apology for be accustomed to come last when went out to dinner on arrival dinner be always announced immediately few second intervened be employed by in saying just one kind word to everybody tonight however gratifying utterance have not be received with gratified response to be accustomed there be different atmosphere abroad be a if be no more than one eighth of entire party must never do to hurry foljambe who be little upset already by fact of there being eight to dinner be two more than approved of lucia be on georgie right mr colonel a have decided to call on left next her be peppino then mr quantock then colonel then mr rumbold who resembled grey hungry mouse mr quantock completed circle round to lucia again everyone have small bunch of violet in napkin lucia have largest have also footstool capital good soup remarked mr quantock ca get soup like at home there be dead silence why be there never silence when olga be there wondered georgie be because talked somehow caused other people to talk tommy luton have got measles said mr weston always said have though there be measles about came to work a usual morning be going to sing in carol tonight suddenly stopped georgie gave imploring glance at foljambe looked at champagne glass took notice lucia turned to georgie with elbow on table between mr quantock what news georgie said peppino have be so busy that have seen soul day what have be doing planchette looked brightly at mr quantock yes dear daisy need ask what have be doing table turning expect know how interested be in psychical matter must be too if only must be certain be not dealing with fraudulent people georgie felt inclined to give hollow groan sink under table when awful polemical rhetoric began to unbounded surprise mr quantock answered most cordially be quite right dear lucia said must not be terrible to find that medium dear friend perhaps whom one implicitly trusted be exposed a fraudulent one see such exposure in paper sometimes must be miserable if thought have ever sat with medium who be not honest fine wretch well though if be caught deserve georgie observed must least understand sudden blank expression cross robert face for moment looked a if be dead have be beautifully stuffed georgie gave cursory thought to for amazing supposition dawned on that lucia have not be polemical at be burying instead of chopping with hatchet be instantly confirmed for lucia took elbow off table turned to robert dear daisy have be very lucky in spiritualistic experience said hear on side what charming medium have georgie quite lost heart to word be delightful said robert of course be dear friend of daisy one have to be very careful when one hears of dreadful exposure a wife said that occur sometimes fancy finding that medium whom believed to be perfectly honest have yard yard of muslin false nose two concealed about must sicken of whole business loud pop announced that foljambe have allowed champagne at last georgie hardly heard for glancing up at daisy quantock observed that same dead stuffed look have come over face have just now noticed on husband countenance then looked up at other with glance to bristled with significance agonised questioning imploring petition for silence seemed to inspire be a if have made unwittingly hopeless faux pa then instantly looked away from other again neck seemed to crack with rapidity with turned right left burst into torrent of speech to grey hungry mouse colonel respectively georgie be utterly mystified riseholme instinct told that there be something below riseholme instinct must not supply faintest clue a to what be of quantocks seemed clear knew something perilous about princess surely if daisy have read in paper that princess have be exposed fined must not have touched on so dangerous subject then curious incident about todd news inevitably occurred to must not fit case since be robert not daisy who have bought that inexplicable number of yellow print then robert have hinted at discovery of yard yard of muslin false nose why have done that unless have discovered unless georgie eye grew round with excitement of chase unless robert have other reason to suspect integrity of dear friend have said at hap hazard in case what be robert reason for suspicion have not daisy read in paper of damaging disclosure have daisy also having reason to suspect princess alluded to damaging exposure in paper by pure hap hazard anyhow have looked dead stuffed when other alluded to mediumistic fraud have said how lucky own experience have be oh georgie almost said aloud what if robert have seen damaging exposure in todd news therefore bought up copy be to be have then indeed must look dead stuffed when daisy alluded to damaging exposure in paper have stray copy escaped did daisy know what did robert know have exquisite secret from other lucia be being talked to across by mr weston who have also pinned down attention of peppino on other side of at precise moment flood of mr quantock spate of conversation to colonel dried up robert must find nothing more to say to hungry mouse georgie in backwater of own thought be whirled into current again before sank caught mr quantock eye put question arose from exciting backwater have heard from princess lately asked robert head went round with same alacrity a have turned away oh yes said two day ago be robert heard yesterday said robert firmly mr quantock looked at husband with eager encouraging earnestness so did said be getting jealous interesting dear yes dear haw haw said robert again eye met time georgie have doubt at be playing same game now smiled smirked at other have not be playing same game before now recognised that there be conspiracy between be host business for moment be to make guest comfortable not pry into inmost bosom so before mr weston realised that have whole table attending to said will get out of robert after dinner will tell mr quantock before atkinson came to colonel said mr weston going on precisely where have left off be five year before elizabeth came to let see be five be four half four half will say have servant whose name be ahab crowe said georgie yes said mr weston hastily finishing champagne for saw foljambe coming near yes ahab crowe married too just like atkinson be going to be odd coincidence in tell colonel that if ahab crowe have married must be with still who can say that 'd have fancied elizabeth if have believe that colonel must ever have well will leave alone spare blush be not what be saying whom do think ahab crowe married can have ten guess must never come right for ca be common name be miss jackdaw crowe jackdaw never heard anything like if ask colonel about will confirm word have said weston why be quite commonplace in comparison be sure be event enough for lucia gave silvery laugh dear mr weston said must really tell at once when happy day will be peppino be thinking of going to riviera georgie broke in sha do anything of kind said what be to happen to 'oo very selfish lucia conversation broke up again into duet trio lucia must have private conversation with host hour ago so georgie reflected have be walking round other like dog going on tiptoe with tail very tightly curled growling gently to aware that hasty snap breach of smallest observance of etiquette might lead to general quarrel now have reward of icy politeness there be more ice except on plate politeness be not matter of etiquette at present might be considered republic one knew what be going to happen after dinner not word have be said about tableau lucia dropped voice a spoke to put in good deal of italian for fear might be overheard non cognosce anybody asked tablieri mean be to sit in aula while salone be being got ready si said georgie there be fire when go out keep there domestichi be making salone ready molto bene then peppino just steal away la lampa be acting beautifully tried over several time everybody be tummin ' said georgie varying cipher so nervosa said lucia fancy doing brunnhilde before singing brunnhilde ca bear georgie knew that lucia have be thrilled delighted to know olga so much wanted to come in after dinner see tableau so found quite easy to induce lucia to nerve up to ordeal so passionately desired indeed be hardly le excited at thought of being king cophetua at moment even a cracker be being handed round sound of carol singer be heard from outside lucia have to wince a good king wenceslas looked out when page king sang speech other voice grew piano so that effect be of solo voice accompanied when page sang lucia shuddered that be small red haired boy who nearly deafens in church whispered to georgie hope voice will crack soon said very discreetly so a not to hurt mr rumbold feeling for trained choir everyone knew that king be mr rumbold said charming to other after have sung liked that boy voice too said mr weston tommy luton used to have lovely voice one struck a better trained even than tommy luton great credit to mr rumbold grey hungry mouse suddenly gave shrill cackle of laugh quite inexplicable then georgie guessed got up now nobody must move said because have drunk 'absent friend yet be just going out to see that have bit of supper in kitchen before go on trembling leg must scarcely carry to door ran out there be dozen little choir boy four men one tall cloaked woman divine said to olga aunt jane thought voice very well trained come in soon wo yes flourishing swimming said georgie lucia hoped voice must crack soon be being lovely explained about food in kitchen hurried back to guest there be riddle of quantocks to solve there be tableau vivants imminent there be little red haired boy coming in soon what christmas night soon after georgie hall began to fill up with guest yet not word be said about tableau grew so full that nobody must have said for certain whether lucia peppino be there not olga certainly be there be mistaking that fact then foljambe opened drawing room door sounded gong lamp behaved perfectly hour later one brunnhilde be being extremely kind to other a sat together if really want to know view dear miss bracely said lucia be just that must be brunnhilde for time being singing of course a say help out can express so much by singing be so lucky there be bound to say have qualm when peppino be georgie suggested must do brunnhilde siegfried said must be so terribly difficult slow have to be slow to keep gesture slow when can not make mere illustration of what be singing well be sure be very kind of to be so flattering about be difficult to do thought out for yourself said olga marvellous ah if have ever seen do said lucia be sure must have picked up hint king cophetua wo give little word for dear king cophetua be so glad after strain of brunnhilde to have back to audience even then there be difficulty of keeping quite still be sure know quite a well a do from having played brunnhilde georgie be very much impressed by performance of mary queen of scot now shrinking of flesh resignation of spirit be what tried to express must come help next time attempt sort of thing again will not be quite soon be afraid for peppino be thinking of going to riviera for little holiday oh how selfish said olga must do lucia gave silvery laugh be very tiresome about going to riviera said promise that will give up yet will see gracious how late be must have sat very late over dinner why be not asked to dinner wonder will scold georgie for not asking ah there be dear mr weston going away must say good night to must think very strange if did not colonel boucher too oh be coming way to save trouble of moving general move be certainly taking place not in direction of door to where olga lucia be sitting be snowing said piggy excitedly to olga will mark footstep well page piggy goosie said olga hurriedly goosie be tableau lovely carol said goosie adored carol guessed did guess mr lucas olga resorted to mean trick of treading on goosie foot apologising be cowardly because be sure to come out sometime goosie again trod on dangerous ground by saying that if page have trod like there be need for footstep to be marked for be snowing fast mr weston wheel left deep track in spite of daisy robert have not gone fifty yard from door when came to full stop now what be said daisy out with why did talk about discovery of muslin only said that be fortunate in medium whom after picked up at vegetarian restaurant said suppose may indulge in general conversation if come to why did talk about exposure in paper general conversation said mr quantock in one word so be be yes said robert may
