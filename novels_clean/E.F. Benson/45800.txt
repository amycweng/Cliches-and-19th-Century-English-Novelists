check pestilence relieve suffering of home already stricken with wife however though not heart only effort active support be ever at service of charitable scheme have not in least seen way to accompanying if thurso thought have better go by mean let do so failed to see what object there must be in accompanying must compensate for inconvenience of leaving town just now for must see nothing gained by journey of of since be in hourly communication with agent reliable careful man who must see that everything medically desirable be carried out be not aware how either presence hers must be conducive to effectiveness of sanitary measure yet since knew that husband looked on many question with different eye from hers have more attempted to dissuade from going than have tried to persuade to come up with have seemed quite obvious to maud thurso must not go by without publicly privately criticising wife refusal to go have simply taken place indeed have not even felt inclination to criticise thing kept catherine in london be such a must ill be cancelled maud have hardly offered brother companionship have just joined at early dinner driven to king cross with perhaps seemed almost equally natural to that must come in case state of thing found on arrival seemed to to have rendered coming imperative even in last twenty four hour there have be portentous increase of case panic

doctor be there nurse a thurso have ordered be obedience to order till came have be so hard to enforce for alone knew have be right in coming apart from reason of sentiment forbade to be absent since word from expressed wish be more potent than order doctor might give for feudal obedience to long kindly race of landlord be far more paramount than medical advice since laird ranged on side of doctor who ordered window to be opened when other folk of commonsense must be inclined to shut chink cranny by air might enter give cold to patient forbade solid food even to puir body who have be cry out

behind opera ball to make short work of night gave food for certain quiet contentment contrast be so pleasantly violent be like moment when one step suddenly out of blare brilliance of ball room where one have enjoyed waltz quite immensely onto quiet tented balcony with tree of park in front above serenity of starlight on slightly larger scale that contrast be hers now have stepped out from london into tranquillity of caithness moor to say that have not regretted leaving town must be untrue have at rate regretted clear necessity of leaving coming up here with brother have be necessary for to go must not possibly have done otherwise though be sorry if allowed mind to dwell on to have cut off from delightful thing be going on in town from ceaseless stream of friend whom one met day night who be amusing so diligently even a have be amusing be still quite clear that somebody must come up here with thurso that since catherine did not propose to come be obvious person to do so no more wasted sigh over what be missing in town than wasted sigh when lost fish that particular fish be off must angle for fish instead there be fish everywhere there be situation a far a knew out of nothing be to be captured here indeed have fish already hooked for have come to keep house for thurso to make thing cheerful for a far a must to prevent being prey to boredom depression when came home in evening after long day spent in fever stricken village have already found that there be room for skill nature have for many generation adopted very reasonable plan with regard to gift devoted to raynhams a

generation among child will endow one of with leave rest to look after have adopted latter most sensible alternative now for six seven generation of raynhams one of many child have always be endowed with extraordinary beauty while others have to be content with certain air of distinction pleasantness after made plainness of feature matter of small account sometimes nature have made error of

courage of high breeding ever concealed private hell from world turning brave tranquil aspect to even though must wear mask for wore none often saw inward torture when others knew only of pleasant courteous man not gay of manner denoted quiet enjoyment of world habitual serenity maud got up from seat in window closed sash for air grew instantaneously chilly sun have dropped behind hill to north

instantaneously acted reacted on other for thurso anxiety about people purely mental spiritual condition have kept awake last night have come down morning with one of excruciating neuralgic headache to have be liable life suffering mind have called in body to suffer with bodily pain have reacted back on mind making poor fellow not to put too fine point upon most abominably cross to maud at breakfast then since there be day work in front of for sake of have come up here in racking pain be really incapable of doing have taken remedy have always by in theory disliked having recourse to a much a maud disliked taking when after breakfast have said to maud simply ca go down there if did must help in way unless get rid of agony have agreed that be occasion for laudanum strolled across to fire held out hand to blaze shone through finger making look a if be redly luminous in from within then suddenly with little dramatic gesture a if carried trouble palpable burden in hand threw into fire having consigned to destruction walked back to window again yet knew in that be not thus easily got rid of for went very deep there must be explanation of undeserved suffering what be how must be just that child must be cursed with inherited disease how must be just thurso very kindness concern for tenant must give hour of blinding torture there at last be figure on road without putting on hat went out to meet saw at once before must clearly see face by limpness dejection in walk that be horribly tired in pain that since now there be something for to do enabled to get rid of own dejection since cheerfulness serenity must be brought into action so before actually met called to oh thurso how late said have idea that be after half past eight have got sinking inside a be probably quite unparalleled let dress then can dine at once be sure dinner be ready because distinctly smelled soup something roast baked apple rolling richly out of kitchen window nearly burst into tear because wanted so much well how have day gone looked at in sort of despair oh maud be too awful said twelve fresh case to day know what to do when head be like be worse than useless ca think ca face thing took arm poor dear old boy said have be bad day no be right in morning after laudanum came on worse than ever after lunch well not exactly after lunch because did have maud gave little exclamation of impatience thurso be too bad said know perfectly well that if go without food too long always get one of headache be slightest use saying that there be time for lunch because biggest lunch that ever happened can be eaten in ten minute whereas headache take hour hate to be in pain what fool be dear be wicked also knave fool because make of absolutely use to anybody when be like smiled at infection of energy put little life into well forgot about lunch till pain came on said be turned full on at once after simply must eat be use trying if be meant to imply that be not going to have dinner said make grave error be going to have soup meat roast apple if attempt to deny will instantly add toasted cheese in fact think will in case thurso be silent moment ah poor wretched people began maud rudely decisively interrupted be not going to hear one word about till have finished dinner said afterwards because will be better then will talk remember how if be quite well nurse always said that must be better after dinner always be unless ate too much wonder whether be dinner that did mere suggestion call from omnipotent infallible nurse dinner said oh damn head added in sudden burst of tired irritability pain be rare with even to maud yes with pleasure if will make better wonder if be entirely dinner know there be something in suggestion though prefer supplementing suggestion with practical measure who be people who be always quite well because think be must think be fool said yes be not official title ca think of better one said by way well no nothing said maud withdrew arm from with dignity be extremely ill bred said mind in least want to know what be going to say in fact must much sooner did not tell having begun must if have decent manner go on thurso laughed sharp though neuralgia still be be already beginning to think of thing apart from how can say that asked be bursting to know well yes be do tell sha' maud think will change though be so late a have be in out of house day need can begin without if like put nose in air did really imagine be going to wait for asked thurso went upstairs still smiling at maud unbridled curiosity especially since there be mystery reason for secrecy about have stopped telling merely be not quite sure whether wanted to do have be on point of proposing in be of perfectly unexciting nature bare dull fact of matter be have let salmon fishing of river here until end of july to american whose name at moment must not remember afternoon a came out of one of cottage have passed one of gillie carrying rod gaff walking with young man of clearly transatlantic origin whom felt sure must be american in question remark have refrained from making to maud be that might be neighbourly to ask to dinner a made hurried toilet found debating reason for against doing with perfectly unaccountable earnestness a if decision way be one must conceivably be of importance on one side reason against asking be that hospitality must offer be of plainest most baked apple kind served in shrouded room that must probably get much better dinner at inn where be quartered also felt that if have come up to caithness to fish must much sooner that landlord did not ask to dinner since hospitality if accepted must mean curtailment of cream of evening rise so perhaps truer hospitality must be shown in not burdening tenant with necessity of inventing excuse of accepting tiresome invitation then suddenly man name bertie cochrane flashed into mind thurso have thought so odd to sign lease by abbreviated name in case must be kinder not to ask mr bertie cochrane to come three mile in order to eat scotch with tired landlord who must probably be suffering from severe neuralgia on other hand thurso felt perfectly unaccountable desire to see have just met passed in village street after coming out from one of fever stricken cottage where young stalker of be lying desperately ill at moment too be screwed down to rack with hideous unnerving pain feeling utterly dispirited beaten hopeless for second eye have met cochrane just for half second by chance perhaps perhaps by reason of subtle animal magnetism people posse thurso have suddenly felt soothed encouraged maud knew have something of magnetic quality to be with always braced to livelier optimism in case effect have be magical there be nothing particularly remarkable about man be rather tall young clean shaven with pleasant boyish face suggested plenty of cold water open air be at moment thurso have felt almost inevitably inclined to speak to thank to tell how bitterly head ached how miserably dispirited felt to tell also that have made feel better impulse have be quite absurdly strong in moment have passed going respective way afternoon subsequent to chance encounter remembrance of mr cochrane strolling down to river talking in so pleasant friendly manner to gillie have never be wholly out of mind cochrane have seemed incarnation of health contentment other day have found scarcely possible to believe in existence of such quality so remote be from then antagonism to mr cochrane have begun to take root in seemed millionaire in happiness leaving pauperism round well be unlikely must meet again reason of hospitality be sufficient for not asking to accept finished dressing without severe return of pain just a be ready to go downstairs came suddenly back again in such stab spasm of anguish that for moment held on to dressing table with clenched hand bitten lip dripping forehead then eye fell on bottle of laudanum stood by looking glass though never before have taken two dos on same day yet never before after one dose have suffered pain so agonising excruciating a to day impulse be incontrollable must no longer reason about expediency of next moment with shaking hand poured full dose into graduated glass drank few moment have made feel faint sick with pain after drinking sat down to wait for divine relief must come so quickly on very sensitive excitable nerve drug exercised almost instantaneous effect not soporific at tranquillising at same time immensely stimulating pain must fade like melting away of vapour of breath on frosty morning till became incredible memory while even a faded warm tingling glow began to invade be a if after frost bitten arctic night sun of south must pour beam upon brain happiness content must unfold like magic rose miraculously opening rosy petal in luminous peace of summer morning sense of unspeakable well being must sprawl blossom over consciousness have not to wait long before second on watch have just taken up when agony seized have ticked into minute divine remission of pain began increasing a increased there came that extraordinary glow of content so that couple of minute afterwards be not so much in utter relief of pain that body revelled a in ecstasy of supreme harmonious sense of health then a always spread like tide of warm incoming water to mind horror suffering have seen that day in fevered village ceased to weigh upon darken with sense of possible responsibility certain helplessness instinctively mind ceased to dwell on thought of stalker whose life be nearly despaired of went to bedside where life have be almost despaired of yesterday have seemed to pause at very entrance of valley of shadow have crawled back little way into life again shadow from valley still lay over face be set towards living already divine drug have done that for stopped pain of mind seemed even a stopped torture of anguished nerve have sat down for moment to recover from physical faintness have seized at savage assault of pain have sat down also in order to abandon with greater receptiveness to rapture of effect that knew must come with remission then after few minute more got up remembering two thing first that maud be probably waiting for though have scorned notion second that evening for first time be consciously revelling delighting in bodily mental sensation that opium produced apart from anodynic quality hitherto have taken purely medicinally sparingly also in order to relieve pain when pain be frankly intolerable when paralysed power of making exertion that be clearly called upon to make having taken like medicine have in intention done more than profit by medicinal advantage of restorative quality to night knew if honestly looked at spring of motive that have done something different have drunk with different desire true pain have be in almost demoralising in intensity when drank have waited for desired not only remission of glow of exquisite well being that harmony of sensation drug gave be even more heavenly than cessation of acutest pain after minute so got up thereby interrupting blissfulness of sensation for maud must wonder why tarried a went downstairs third thought suggested by secret friend in brown bottle occurred to must not let sister know that have taken second dose to day arising from that must conceal from how suddenly completely pain have gone lest must guess suspect already felt half ashamed of mixed motive have led to taking yet yet supreme sense of physical well being be just now prevented from feeling acutely anything if maud suspected up to point of asking if have dosed again well in case must be wise to follow example of sir walter scott have business to ask question answer whatever might be be responsibility not perhaps must be better to minimise possibility of asking have better appear silent suffering till dinner be nearly over then confess that dinner have done good have told that must must be delighted to see efficacy of prescription that pain left suddenly must be no surprise to often left a suddenly a came on a if be turning of tap flashed instantaneously into mind just a man take in landscape at glance though may take many word to describe what moment vision have conveyed to thought flashed there too there be authentic paradise in little bottle whether one have be in pain not there be garden of eden felt that must willingly endure torture if at end must push open golden gate again walk past flaming sword of guardian pain weighed light compared to pleasure surely hour of paradise now then must not hurt drop of water on lip of dive felt perfectly willing weighing two in balance of mind to pas through hell of torture for compensation then faintly far away came suggestion that even without hour in hell there be paradise still open maud have be very hungry have already finished soup when came downstairs according to plan said little nothing till have caught up on something roast indeed first question have be demand for second supply of maud gave approving nod have eaten lunch now a soon a began to eat be conscious of being extremely hungry second supply vanished with same briskness a first then leaned back in chair a plate be changed like telling that be right said because will only confirm belief in own wisdom be nothing if not honest dinner suggestion have certainly done trick lady neuralgia have turned off tap turned off with same firm hand a turned on doe even drip will allow even that be suggestion that made do who care how happened will allow anything yes two roast apple please think will have toasted cheese have lunch must remember oh thurso be so glad said so often wish must take of not toasted cheese silly for think must wish so much when have got remarked oh say must like know must bear lot of pain if knew otherwise must be somebody else be difficulty must be if be only own tell frankly bear most awfully well be cross with because know mind at breakfast do mean asked know be be sorry be mad with think show to other people do dear only to must have mentioned looked at moment in silence then laughed grew grave again before spoke understand said then poisonous fume of drug stirred recommended caution in brain think must always understand said think must always tell everything about to day then said may tell about now oh how wise be not letting talk before dinner be sure be taking neuralgic view be be thinking only of poor sandie who be afraid be dying instead of thinking about donald fraser wife who seems to be little better though yesterday thought must not live be lady neuralgia who made remember one forget other there be something else too wanted to talk about with be maud made plan only morning must have told before paused moment that last sentence again be though absolutely true effort of self justification have acquiesced in deceiving maud on one point must that point come forward felt a if have to tell not only that be showing whole truth about know will feel with said though doubt catherine will make fuss when know if ever doe will probably paint everything with carbolic must turn house into hospital for poor folk for at least who can be moved here think of case appears in one of tiny house what happens there be three perhaps four room in whole of family have to live in two room at most three sick room too where be most important that there must be plenty of air be ten foot by twelve one small window dr symes agrees with think at rate that case must have much better chance up here moving be easy have one ambulance bed have ordered more to day from inverness lit cigarette saw maud looking at with shining eye be thurso whom knew loved then went on there be big dining room here said will hold dozen bed there be hall will hold eighteen must think there be bedroom there be billiard room also up here nurse can look after twice number of patient that can attend to in scattered cottage look after all much better so have given order dr symes will move up here to morrow whom think can be moved without undue risk fresh case will come up here at once of course will go back to town appreciate tremendously coming here at now will be impossible for to stop in house maud laughed dear asked oh will stop here of course ca leave maud left place dragged chair up beside thurso be admirable said be excellent idea moving up here so excellent that wonder did not think of first a for going back to town how on earth can stop here with house crammed full of typhoid patient same way a can leave here when leave maud there be 'but maud ' go unless turn out into cold bleak night oh let poke up fire be sure there be frost in case will die of exposure on lawn to begin with there be risk of infection to go on with must catch if there be oh why not because one be mercifully allowed to get through day work came up here a 'pal if went to bed with typhoid must be anybody 'pal besides have have typhoid already at present moment be going to play at picquet owe nine shilling from last night chapter ii maud have happened to come across in book be reading on way up to scotland account of epidemic of typhoid in charitable lady vicar wife of place sat by bedside of patient held hand fed with cooling fruit occurred to a possible though not very likely that treatment of typhoid have undergone alteration even a radical a indicated since have have disease on arrival have asked doctor quoting remarkable passage if must telegraph for supply of cooling fruit excellent dr symes though not given either to joking quick in perception of joke have laughed immoderately cooling fruit said feed with cooling fruit lady maud will soon stop epidemic because everybody will be dead then checked laughter be good of to come said have work up at house just keep lord thurso because know from moping being miserable be glad came with when be away down in village do what please apart from cooling fruit suggest being out of door can will have work in evening sun wind rain pray god get will fit best for advice came into head next morning after have seen thurso off to village be counsel jumped with inclination since according to view world especially world of out of door be swarm of delightful congenial occupation of none be so entrancing a catching sea trout on light rod with light tackle since river must be full of inimitable fish ran within half mile of house there be great difficulty in way of putting doctor recommendation into practice knew of course nothing of fact that thurso have let fishing to american whom have met yesterday in street have decided not to ask to dinner thurso be not to come home to lunch day a house must be full of workman busy shifting furniture making room ready under superintendence of one of doctor for reception of typhoid patient maud went off to river without word to anyone except order for sandwich lunch with heart be high exultant in spite of surrounding calamitous condition turning of house into hospital be entirely characteristic of thurso rejoiced to think that comfort not money alone be being sacrificed to sufferer be cheap charity to give money to spend merely unless expense pinched one be far more real effort of sympathy to turn house into feverward be that brought people into knowledge that somebody relief implied somebody else trouble thurso be rich cost of what did be of account be more active sympathy sandie poor fellow special fishing gillie be down with typhoid case a knew be very serious so set off alone with sandwich in creel light rod landing net feeling rather heartless for so much expected enchanting day have to huge degree that sensible gift enabled when have done best in one direction to enjoy pleasure lay before in being satisfied that must not be of slightest use during next hour at home in village with cooling fruit let go with regard to excitement of river side natural joie de vivre gilded employment for angling for sea trout have need of gilding since be gold already nothing must be more entrancing for hour one might cast unclaimed fly upon water yet never lose confident anticipation at moment swirl of submerged strength activity must bend rod to glorious curve that fisherman know to be true attack of what have never seen like everything else that anybody really feel to be worth while doing keeping account alone being excepted mystery romance illuminated pursuit a walked down to river else thurso trouble fever stricken village tragedy be sponged off mind heart be le tender solicitous than have be attention be engaged instead mixed with excitement of anticipation dreadful thing might be in store for by river be in mind for to fish with big sea trout fly might easily attract notice of sea trout mightier cousin in case good bye probably to light tackle a be sport to catch sea trout on salmon rod maud took chance with light heart day be one of grey day rare in north where grey day implies for most part east wind suck colour out of land sky with soft breeze from south west made heather hillside golden gorse river more brilliant full of colour than even direct sunbeam preoccupied though maud be with prospect of fishing mind kept paying little flying visit to beauty of morning five minute after have left house be absolutely alone sight either of human form human habitation broke intense solitude of eye ear to such a make so dear intimate companionship for loved pleasant thing of earth honey scented heather sunshine of gorse close silent friendship of nature unvexed undistracted by human presence to a to st francis tree be dear brother sky river dear sister somehow also very sea trout in slaughter of hoped to spend delightful day be blood relation beloved by must not have explained that attitude at must frankly have admitted that implied inconsistency there fact be here at last be rushing jubilant river rainy may have filled from bank to bank struck at bridge pool at head of stream be spanned by swaying airy suspension bridge from pool took name deep water lay on near side considerable piece of willow water on other just beyond willow must cast over ran little channel knew well since be favourite place for sea trout so crossed swaying dancing bridge debating within choice of fly river be high sky grey sea trout must probably prefer rather large fly so unfortunately must salmon however must chance that big fly be certainly correct game five minute be enough for soaking of cast adjustment of rod already with attack of fisherman heart make that organ apparently shift from normal position into throat began casting from just below bridge with longest line of be capable must not reach that channel of deep water if did not do that might a usefully go fishing in pail like simple simon there be nobody within sight next minute have kilted skirt till must wade out over barren shoal water stand where with cool bright water flowing nearly up to knee yet leaving skirt unwetted must reach deeper water beyond well knew what wet skirt meant to one who proposed to walk fish day heavy clinging blanket made activity lightness of going out of question a waded out hitched inch two higher then for moment have to pause to laugh at figure must inevitably be presenting be there anyone to see there be knitted jersey for upper half tweed cap for head much kilted skirt stocking for rest beauty vigour grace of limb forgot to consider just a beholder have there be one might have paid scanty attention to cap jersey skirt from where stood must cast over coveted channel dozen time fly went on quiet unerring circuit then suddenly gulp fin broke surface just below with gulp heart jumped upwards from throat into very mouth owner of fin have not touched fly oh rapture danger of be sea trout fresh run salmon at that pure sporting instinct usurped other feeling light though rod be light tackle since there be salmon in river felt interest in jock scott must try to catch might probably must break then must be broken have gaff very well must do without be heavy fish too have seen enough of for what desperate heavenly adventure waded ashore being far too wise in science to cast over again at once preferring to wait minute two before tempted again a gained dry land saw that there be man half way across bridge just above pool carried salmon rod over shoulder fishing bag slung by strap must not of course be fishing here on thurso water guessed must be going over to scarsdale where knew that new tenant have taken lodge gave only slightest most fleeting attention being far more interested that moment in one particular fish than in particular man took further notice of except that unkilted skirt inch two for showed really too much of what be called leg then without giving further glance at figure on bridge who have paused there watching walked back again through willow to point ten yard above where have raised fish in order to make sure of casting over again unkilted skirt dragged little in water must have waded neck deep after fish also popped in out of mind there be man watching have objection to gallery when be fishing must show how to well probably lose salmon on trout tackle with trout rod yard by yard moved down to where dear monster have risen before there be again time fin broke surface only submerged boil came at fly be true attack suddenly bent rod sudden message on line at same moment out of corner of eye saw that man have moved from place on bridge be coming up behind on bank that occupied infinitesimally that really knew be that be possessor of light trout rod fitted with light tackle at far end of at present moment there happened to be salmon landing net be somewhere on bank a far a went must be just a useful to if have be at jericho instead immediately fish bolted down stream reel sang shrilly then like express train came back with calmness of despair reeled in thinking for moment meant to go up under bridge in case there must be need to soak cast look out fly changed mind once more after two three rush be opposite to just where have hooked originally shaking head so seemed for rod jerked jumped yet line ran out maud have moved back across shoal water during manoeuvre so a to gain shore again for knew must get somewhere where must run when from close behind came level pleasant voice be well hooked said saw take will be off down stream in minute there be hundred yard of rapid before next pool must get to shore quick if be be ready to run maud still thought of nothing fish have already begun to bore slowly away into deep water on far side of river knew well what must lead to replied to voice a if have be only own thought be identical with be communing yes know said be making for deep water now there splashed way through margin of shoal water nearly tripping up over submerged stone just a fish felt full current of river be off full finned down stream reel screamed out in couple of second there be dreadful length of line between fly gained smooth turf of bank be off like arrow after when just before matter be desperate bend in rapid brought nearer to still running reeled hurriedly in then oh blessed haven reached deep water at head of pool below swimming there in small circle allowed to recapture more of line then still without taking eye off water for felt sure that owner of voice have run down behind spoke to again humour of situation be have only very lightest tackle said for came out after sea trout luckily fish doe know must be so kind a to get landing net left on bank just below bridge saw brought said voice know what want for be twenty pounder voice be very pleasant friendly one maud probably noticed that instinctively for spoke to man whom have never seen a if be of own class anyhow here laughed suddenly wonder what be going to happen next said be joy of fishing be oh look for first time fish jumped showing from head to tail splashed soundingly back into pool again far side of twenty pound remarked voice told gillie be glad to say to be down here by eleven will bring gaff must be here minute there will be gaffing going on just yet turned out to be perfectly true dozen time in next quarter of hour maud knew that be within ace of losing fish behaved like lusty fresh run monster that be making disconcerting rush down to very tail of pool running out line almost to last yard before have time to follow down steep stony bank then must seek very deepest hole lie there sulking jiggering putting most dangerous snapping strain on light tackle then with rush must come straight back towards so do what must there be long perilous moment though reeled in with lightning hand when be on slack line at length began to tire little instead of hurling about pool allowed to drift now then with stream that too be dangerous have to treat with utmost gentleness since dead weight press of water be against then again spark of savage pride must flare up must protest against mysterious compelling force be weakening ah poor darling said maud once a struggle grew le voice answered yes be just how often feel said minute two more passed be gillie here yet asked yes came ten minute ago will gaff for will who be asked maud be duncan fraser lady said voice oh then duncan please said be that rude of be so sorry see know duncan have often gaffed fish for get further down duncan lie down get below let see there be several agitating moment yet time fish drifted with stream towed little nearer to bank though be very weak now protest feeble be still capable of momentary violence at last be mere log floating with fin out of water broad silvery side shining with swift crafty movement duncan have on bank maud laid down rod turned away kill quick duncan said be done then with fine inconsistence oh what darling cried quite fresh from sea too then for first time maud turned to look at owner of voice found tall pleasant looking young man smiling at be really extremely obliged to said see how must have landed without gaff there be nowhere in pool where can tail fish laughed at why think be so said be much more debtor have never seen fish so beautifully handled look at tackle too well never oh know water said make so much difference though must explain how then suddenly conjunction of total stranger american too so must hear with rod on brother river in company with one of brother gillie struck a odd be afraid fish have detained very long said be fishing at scarsdale suppose be fishing here said at least will walk down mile two try lower pool be more solidly incomprehensible yet man did not look in least like poacher trespasser how did come about duncan be with maud grew just shade dignified though be still quite cordial be sure will excuse said know be brother river lord thurso again stranger laughed with sincere quiet merriment oh yes know said see have be kind enough to let fishing to until end of july maud stood quite silent moment situation so horrible be dawning on that be unable to speak what have said that thurso have let fishing then what be poacher caught red handed by tenant what said say again stranger took off hat may introduce said be mr bertie cochrane excuse really ca help laughing why be just killing maud already flushed with excitement exercise grew perfectly crimson oh what be to do said be too awful how can laugh can never forgive raised eye to again saw there such genuine kindly amusement that in spite of horror laughed too oh make laugh said be too dreadful poaching thought be who be going to poach be be yes be serious said be for to make condition maud have one moment fleeting terror that be going to make as of a phrased ask to kiss hand do something dreadful did not look that kind of donkey oh condition be not difficult said only insist on not cutting short day fishing said must fish more thank very much really think must think must make effort must consider a insisting wo get in way in yours meant to go couple of mile down did indeed situation five minute ago be so appalling have quite lost horror be no longer unfaceable have maud be told that morning that in inscrutable decree of fate be going to be caught poaching before lunch must have wished earth to open swallow sooner than anything so unspeakable must happen to while even two minute ago there be nothing in life so impossible a must continue career of poaching captor be so unaffectedly friendly amusement also at horror cause of so sincerely kind that be no longer horrified really mr cochrane be too good of said must first put at ease about one thing do know how dreadfully sorry be have very slightest idea that thurso have let fishing oh by way really be lady maud raynham why yes said paused then be settled whole situation have gone vanished before perfect simplicity kindliness smiled back at thank very much said will love to have day on river duncan said pray keep if wish otherwise will send home wife be ill of typhoid oh please let go home then said maud then cochrane turned to gillie get along home with duncan said be sure tell that will find wife still improving think will find be be getting better morning if give of medicine will be just helping helping mind to get worse again understand if find when get home be worse give by mean wo find that will find be better yes gaff landing net lunch have got thanks so off with let heart go singing god looking after morning a always did be going to get quite well lose sight of let lose sight of have apparently quite forgotten about maud a spoke have turned side face to a talked to gillie though during little speech kindliness merriment have twinkled in eye twitched in mouth when situation have be unfolded between maud be still there yet there shone through now vital intense seriousness have laid hand on rough homespun of duncan shoulder spoke with quiet convinced air of authority then nodded dismissal to turned to maud again while duncan trudged off down riverbank be so sorry for lord thurso said think be downright good of to have come up here right in middle of season just because folk be ill be real kind of then suddenly eye fell on silver mailed fish that still lay on bank hi duncan called out after retreating figure take ladyship fish up to house duncan came back with difficulty folded big fish into bag shouldered paused moment before went again looking at cochrane with doglike eye that though trust yet beseech wife be better sir asked ever so much be beginning to know that a well a do now off with for have got to look after baby a think ca make happy give real good time let pull that great beard of yours watched duncan tramp away again with heavy peasant footed tread down bank dear blind soul said half to be getting near dawn with night maud be already arrested with regard to companion paid be to say good deal more attention to than paid to nine tenth of casual stranger with whom be a now accidentally brought into somewhat intimate contact have arresting quality whatever be compels attention may be called animal magnetism vitality of superior kind have nothing to do with love hate like dislike though may coexist often doe with of have not for instance even occurred to to wonder whether liked disliked be utterly indifferent to only knew that have arresting quality in manner be very quiet rather boyish quite well bred rather good looking in none of respect be different from casual crowd there be knew something distinguished from men woman that have ever seen pause of second two a duncan took up fish be sufficient for to determine in what distinction lay be be so happy happiness of sort have never yet seen surrounded like atmosphere of own be given to others to breathe have breathed radiated from hundred of people be happy thank god be very common gift happiness that now encountered be on different plane be happiness distilled sublimated seemed normally to dwell on height to others in fine moment can attain seemed happy in way that extraordinary good news make others happy for moment two hour two yet be retrospective happiness happiness of vivid memory be normally gushed from a from unquenchable spring impression be made a strong impression be made in moment there be pause between parting speech to duncan fish laden taking up again casual thread of talk be thread casual one for last word to duncan seemed to come from very heart soul of man from spring of happiness do tell said why did say to duncan that wife only thought be ill convinced happiness of brown eye looked at moment before answered doe come somewhere in shakespeare said 'there be nothing thinking make so ' word to same purpose yes if take literally said maud must conclude that if must only think be well poor soul must be be hard to think that when happen to have typhoid brown eye grew graver happiness a well a gravity seemed to deepen certainly be hard said indeed be impossible unless can think right when can do that rest follows maud suddenly felt slightly antagonistic to remembered few word have have with thurso last night about people who say be always well because think be conclusion that must be fool have tacitly agreed with then be little vexed with mr cochrane because honestly did not seem to be fool have ever have toothache asked briskly never if have must sound nonsense doe just express truth then name have be unable to remember last night came back to ah be christian scientist said think pain illness be unreal laughed know said now be sure want to get on with fishing so there be rod please keep gaff be far more likely to hook salmon in upper pool than be down below have changed subject with such undisguised abruptness that must not help remarking on yet sudden a have be there be hint of ill breeding rudeness about merely spoke quite courteously of something else do always change subject a quickly a asked smiling always if think may be led into discussion about christian science with stranger who pray think rude lady maud one ca talk about subject mean more to one than whole world with people who ask question about out of sort of well derisive curiosity also proselytise think there be better way of making truth known word be extremely direct again hint of rudeness want of courtesy be ever so faintly suggested though maud still felt antagonistic knew that most sensitive person in world must not have found offence in so perfectly friendly good natured be tone made very plain statement without least touch of resentment fear of arousing generous fair minded gave in at once beg pardon said be quite right there be touch though really not more of what so justly call derisive curiosity in mind have business either to feel show may ask question with touch left out honestly left out why of course hundred said then why proselytise asked a be convinced of truth of doctrine be duty to spread cochrane let eye wander from face over hillside fragrant with heather murmurous with bee then looked at again for first time saw that be different from eye have ever seen in face of man woman for be unmistakably child eye full of child disarming frankness almost terrible honesty can spread thing in many way said preaching be not primary way chose went about doing good ' maud felt suddenly seized with shyness be instinctive to most anglo saxon when religion put in appearance in conversation be suddenly tongue tied with many people doubt reticence on religious subject be due to fact that since have religion there be nothing for to talk about be not so with religion formed very vital essential part of life be not thing to be publicly trotted out like so since subject have so unexpectedly profoundly deepened with last remark be who rather precipitately changed now see said please leave gaff must immensely like since be so kind to try for sea trout two having poached one salmon without leave must contemplate poaching even with so if hook will break so will present river with fly cast by way of amende maud felt vexed annoyed with be not managing well thought must be giving quite false impression by chattering stupid nonsense in order to get away from subject of religion then rather more natural topic suggested namely idea of offering hospitality have occurred to be rejected by thurso do come dine with to morrow said eat of own fish thurso must be delighted be just squatting in house know eat live in one room caretaker wife cook ah how stupid of forgot thurso be turning rest of house into typhoid hospital by evening place will be full of patient so please say ' point blank if like thought will quite understand childlike eye looked at in frank unveiled admiration why be just splendid of said a for coming to dinner will be delighted scientist be often told be inconsistent be not quite so bad a to mind coming to house where few poor soul think be ill so au revoir lady maud many thanks maud be girl of great singleness of purpose generally when be out for day fishing number of moment in thought about thing unconnected in way with fishing scarcely made total at while other subject be present in mind be there only in very dim distant fashion to day during hour fishing indulged in between mr cochrane departure lunch thought persistently strayed from fishing when eventually made windless seat in heather overlooking pool have just fished even brace of silvery sea trout have already caught prospective brace two that promised before evening occupied very small part of meditation christian science have indeed touch of derision for philosophy philosopher though be not worth while even to deride be derision founded on ignorance only for last year alice yardly friend of hers have joined church have seemed to maud most suitable thing for have always thought that alice though dear be fool now knew certainly however mr yardly did not in least resemble mr cochrane in matter of folly because be clearly impossible to think of a fool in matter of proselytising for mr yardly used to proselytise with almost touching ill success by hour pouring out perfect torrent of optimistic gabble about nonexistence of pain sickness be prostrated moment afterwards by one of nervous headache to be subject must boldly trying to nail smile to face label false claim though be pedantically accurate imitation of real thing demonstrate over being interpreted meant that assured two three million time that must not have nervous headache since there be nervous headache in divine love nothing existed except divine love after must go to bed wake up next morning without headache be delighted with success of demonstration have banished then dreadful delirium of word appalled confused hearer text be torn up from root by inconsequent hurricane sent hurtling at head paragraph from mr eddy key to scripture squirted at a from hydrant to convince maud a far a must see of what put rather differently to herself when said that mind have great influence over matter that mr eddy have not be first to discover view of question proved to be utter mistake must not do for mr yardly at who insisted that there be such thing a matter never have be since existed only in error of mortal mind of there be really last winter too alice have have false claim of influenza after week of demonstrating over not taking ordinary precaution have developed into further false claim though pretty imitation of congestion of lung three week further demonstration over congestion of lung combined time with stopping in bed though have really nothing to do with a must easily be explained in hour two have led to complete recovery subsequent recital of wonderful cure at wednesday testimony meeting to great edification of faithful when maud asked why if be going to condescend to stop in bed at especially since stopping in bed have like flower of spring nothing to do with case must not have done so when have false claim of influenza instead of waiting for further false claim of congestion led only to kind christian science smile voluble explanation with torrent of psalm mr eddy to point out once again from very beginning that did not have influenza at further progress in fact must be made in such discussion for though mr yardly be far from refusing to answer question poured forth in answer so turbid flow of pure twaddle with so stern determination never to be brought up to point at issue that be impossible for inquirer to proceed sickness illness be inconceivable said mr yardly because everything be infinite mind mortal mind have more real existence than have matter whether maud asked how be that impression of there being such thing a headache broken leg have come in whether wanted to know why mr eddy said that tobacco be disgusting if there be such thing appeared to alice to state over over again in variety of way fact about infinite mind be satisfactory answer to question of kind of course alice be silly seemed sometimes to have mind mortal otherwise though be dear same maud a sat here now eating sandwich in sheltered nest of heather with wild bee buzzing about infinite beneficent power of nature pursuing function heedless of interpretation that meddlesome mind of man might choose to put upon felt that have done injustice to subject about inquired when derided just because woman who be very silly gave absurd answer to question though quite simple be of utmost profundity in concerned origin of evil sickness mr yardly have not be christian scientist long maud now told that be absurd to expect at once for understood so little before to understand everything now what nettled though indeed be not easily nettled be to find that same dear stupid person did profess to be able to explain everything mind matter god alike claimed to have recaptured faith of child at once to be able to argue like theologian about maud be professed believing christian have brilliant atheist subtly questioned on doctrine of incarnation knew quite well that many of question must be completely unanswerable because be christian did not follow be theologian hoped that must not try by turning blinding squirt of text upon questioner to make believe that must explain mystery of material spiritual world must not many thing be mysterious why not say so that thing be mysterious did not prevent being christian believed too root doctrine of christian science namely that god be author of world be immanent there surely be wiser truer to confess that one did not understand whole working of world in detail for if one did one must manage alice yardly maud felt sure must undertake post with greatest pleasure pretty mess must make of thought for alice must never even contrive that carriage must call for anybody at right time place constantly went out to dinner on wrong night for confusion of hostess yet law of gravity so maud believed be in sound working order if one asked mere child to explain explained imperfectly incorrectly that proved nothing against validity of law only proved inability of exponent so too in christian science one person surely knew more about than mr yardly in probability le than maud confessed to herself that present derision have be founded on explanation want of given by scientist whom have always thought silly doubt there be others who be not silly what pity be that silly one be allowed to gabble like alice have tried to proselytise with effect only that maud have be almost fanatically convinced of absurdity of faith mr cochrane have pointedly refused to proselytise perversely enough felt must like to hear what have to say about too have that childlike faith childlike eye alice eye be not childlike resembled shining button in railway carriage great fish jumped clear out of water in pool at foot noble silver sided salmon for moment made fisherman heart leap in throat be use trying for fish jumped like never took fly besides have gaff then smiled at herself for knew that though reason be sound enough be not real cause why still sat in sheltered place be interested in something else wanted to think about mr cochrane did not seem silly in fact must have bet on verdict of intelligent impartial jury with regard to point what if asked when came to dine to morrow night few of question onto alice have turned squirt of irrelevant text there must be derision on side now for in half hour of self communing have convinced that wanted to know there be such thing a illness have said that have practically told duncan that what then if made appeal to told how many of poor folk have died from typhoid be suffering now asked to stop yet be too much to ask seemed profane a if asked to invest in insignia of divinity might not for must ask now without derision without so far a must manage unbelief in huge power christian scientist healer at rate distinctly professed to wield might not relieve one sufferer make well one of forty who must be lying sick in house to morrow then there occurred to parrot like answer of alice yardly when have asked same question be parrot like be glib without conviction sense of true meaning of word when said be wrong to make cure for sign lot of text from gospel of course came up a reinforcement how hopelessly misunderstood maud did not want sign wanted that suffering must be relieved be not human to withhold power merely because must be interested in seeing manifested be inhuman to withhold if possessor really believed be besides for what except exercise have be given there be thurso be better that must not know that intended to ask cochrane to do indeed that must not know that have asked there alice yardly contention again with text seemed to to be possibly true be reasonable anyhow to suppose unbelief might hamper power of faith just a dampness hindered function of frictional electricity if thurso be not told there must be none of impeding counteraction did not disbelieve honestly wanted to believe derided no longer be at bar of conscience able to say that have open mind on subject believed in miraculous cure of ancient day there be known reason why modern day must not witness again yet why have mind changed why have derision vanished again be truthful with acknowledged that be probably owing to mr cochrane personality seemed wise gentle self reliant because relied on infinite power entirely trusted in power be exactly that made maud trust yes be have gone over ground wished to traverse thereafter be absorbed in watching fly traverse element chapter iii shifting removal of furniture banishment of carpet preparatory to reception of patient next day together with installation of necessary for sick room be complete when maud got home that evening found dr symes who have come up to superintend just on point of leaving have very cheering account to give concerning several of patient whom maud asked after there be one cause at least for thankfulness since fresh case have appeared during day be rather strange said for have not yet be able to discover what cause of epidemic be so have not intentionally cut off source of infection god know be quite content not to know what be provided be cut off yes indeed said to morrow will fill up bed here yes be sorry to say of course be taking certain risk for sake of fresher air better attention will be able to receive up here will move very serious case ah dear lady doctor get sick at heart sometimes doctor though be prescriber of drug wonder how much good really do with powder potion wonder if content of chemist shop cabalistic prescription be measurable by side of fresh air quiet conviction on part of patient that be going to get well if belief that drug be going to make well surely be spring of faith said laughed well well may get better how choose wo quarrel with said by way must like to say just once how splendid be of lord thurso to give up house like be absolutely thurso idea said though of course seemed obvious when suggested wanted to send back to town have come in yet do know yes came in hour ago in great pain fear with one of neuralgic headache be rather overdone want rest maud made little quick movement towards not seriously so asked mean that there be anything to be anxious about anyhow want to be anxious said a long a be continually anxious get constantly tired headache will probably be rather frequent have have attack during last three day pain like be good for nobody certainly hope will get rest soon want to become chronic chronic yes nerve know form habit like everything else maud be silent moment anxiety have felt while be waiting for thurso to come in last night reminded again of presence did not much want to speak of after be speaking to old doctor whom have known since be child also very much wanted to be reassured take laudanum when be in great pain said be that wise must be unwise of to do so frequently continue doing so for long there again be reason why want nerve to form habit of pain did not know by way that took be prescribed for of course oh yes know be dr symes seemed to dismiss that from mind then be business of mine said now hope to day there be cause for hoping that have seen worst of epidemic there have be fresh case to day so before many day be over think lord thurso can get away tell frankly that will be glad when can ought to go now do think asked maud dr symes considered before replied think ought to stop here said at length be true be running certain danger of producing chronic irritation how will say exasperation of nerve also there be certain risk in continuing to take laudanum after be sensible be certainly brave think for present sense of duty be right in keeping here order nurse order be obeyed when know be here be backing up have idea of difficulty have before came well must get back to village again lady maud like plucky people like brother good night patient will begin to arrive early to morrow dr symes brisk active for sixty year grey head hopped nimbly onto bicycle rode off feeling that maud have done good apart from raynhams notion of british aristocracy be founded on curious volume known a society novel book wife read aloud to in evening with horrified gusto work presented class in more lurid le pleasant light lord thurso sister be so simple so good to use ordinary word in most ordinary sense made more fuss over reception of forty patient suffering from typhoid into house than must have made over few friend dropping in to tea thought of risk inconvenience seemed to have occurred to of appeared to most natural thing in world that house must be turned into hospital though professionally believed that there be risk still felt that wicked countess marchioness in leper lady babylon must not have behaved quite like indeed for one half moment let wonder what even mr symes must have said if have suggested taking case into house have seemed to beautiful girl whom have left on doorstep with fishing rod in one hand landing net weighed down with dozen sea trout in other perfectly natural thing to do be courageous acceptation of event did good thurso to sister great relief came down to dinner in most equable cheerful spirit trace of headache have vanished maud thought dr symes must have be mistaken about for a have said have only guessed that thurso must be in great pain in case be part to try to take thought away from fever neuralgia darker side of thing instantly began on own poaching comedy by river thurso have broken record to day said have done most awful thing have ever be done after went out morning took rod down to river to look about for sea trout be firm in salmon oh saw hook when mr bertie cochrane appeared how must forget to tell have let fishing there be tied to to fish watched play of course did know from adam for moment thurso be almost a horrified a maud have be good lord said hope lost fish not at be entirely owing to mr cochrane landed for in nick of time down came duncan gillie not ours at with gaff mr cochrane looked on with interest sympathy thurso have laid down knife fork huge grin be beginning to take place of horror go on quick said will mr cochrane have rod said supposed be going over to scarsdale be not so with slight addition of stiffness thanked for help said that be river explained oh thurso did ever asked to come dine to morrow eat of own fish be coming thurso shouted with laughter oh must not give to have be there when light broke on said to ask to dinner add insult to injury be caught poaching poaching know then ask rightful owner to have did tell by way that be typhoid hospital yes did mind oh maud oh maud american too will probably telegraph account of to new york press will come out over state with enormous headline oh think not said be sure must do thurso recollected own meeting with cochrane think must said because met in village yesterday evening agree doe look like go on be that enough asked afterwards sat talked a if have be caught poaching at begged to go on fishing too did somehow so simply naturally that thanked did go on caught six sea trout too be just going to have of really made easy for to say 'yes ' in fact must have be absurd to say 'no thurso laughed again that almost beat everything said be absolutely brazen not in least when see mr cochrane will understand how simple be have seen a told occurred to then that might ask to dinner be that began to suggest last night be so curious to know what be going to say that stopped maud looked at reproachfully oh thurso if have gone on must have saved from said understand how be possible for to accept thurso considered yes even though did not speak to think perhaps do did look to be sort of man whose sea trout might catch after have caught poaching salmon be rather high compliment be great gift to be able to make people not ashamed of must have absolutely sunk into earth mr cochrane must very kindly have pulled out said maud at least pulled out there be short pause during maud occupied mouth with sea trout mind with question a to whether must tell thurso mr cochrane be christian scientist remark that be not plan to proselytise decided against doing so then thurso spoke again do know to day be first on have felt absolutely swamped water logged with depression anxiety said there have be fresh case since morning duncan wife who like sandie be almost despaired of have taken sudden inexplicable turn for better be dying of sheer exhaustion from fever now day have be gaining strength gaining quickly too though must have said there be strength left saw duncan evening really wondered whether have be drinking drinking asked maud why be tee totaller worst sort of drunkard remarked thurso rather cynically oh be cheap thurso looked up at then nodded quite right said be pity sorry old darling duncan a sober a be soberer go on interest well lead back to mr

sharply sideways moment with movement of vague suspicion headache said have seemed much like headache evening have why only dr symes told be afraid be in pain be delighted be mistaken thurso shrugged shoulder lord what bad guess skilful doctor make said half want people to be ill so that may have pleasure of curing maud naturally asked further question told that dr symes have simply made what thurso called bad guess knowing seemed to odd that must have thought that thurso have be suffering if have not for be only when be in extreme of pain that anyone must guess that be on rack for have to be strongly screwed before visibly winced for one moment flashed through mind that have be in pain have perhaps taken laudanum to stop have well not chosen to tell so yet answer though a matter of fact be slightly evasive in form clearly bore construction that have be free from pain day so dismissed that at once telling that be scandalous of though involuntarily only momentarily to suspect thurso of insincerity thus pause only lasted moment before spoke of something else in moment have said to will tell two sat up rather late night for maud disliked going to bed nearly a much a disliked getting up be usually thurso who moved adjournment to night be extraordinarily alert a have said to day have be first on there have be break in tempest of illness be devastating village spirit seemed

week house be to celebrate re entry into london life with adequately magnificent ball wife who have stopped in town be seeing to arrangement when catherine undertook to see to thing be unnecessary for anyone else however closely concerned to feel anxiety a to completeness with must be seen to heard from catherine morning said at least heard from typewriter did not even sign be up to eye in million affair hope be well really seems to that most of festivity a well a charity of london must collapse unless saw to there be ball next week will go up for night though whether stop depends on how thing go on here of course will come maud looked at in mild surprise be a if have said of course will have breakfast to morrow be not improbable said did really suppose that house be going to make debut again not there oh well did know said do now what fun will be will be crammed with king queen like 'alice in wonderland ' thurso what good thing catherine be so smart hate word be be magnificent said

catherine must quote again say have special go third ' with preference for special not at doe care be often go third talk to people on top of omnibus doe go in cab say be middling like party of twenty to meet serene transparency if ca have twenty five million horse power motor up get on omnibus never stop either because of horse run after jump quite beautifully do admire so thurso laughed so do be something to admire wife when have be married twelve year maud made little sideways movement in chair a if position have become suddenly uncomfortable brother continued believe woman ever existed who be so obviously admirable said went to opera together night before came up here a be going on to large ball afterwards be well suitably dressed maud felt a always felt when thurso talked like a if file have be drawn across teeth tried to turn not conversation tone oh how asked with deep genuine interest for like sensible girl loved beautiful clothes especially when beautiful people wore always make everybody else look dowdy overdressed that must be such fun well have diamond palisade a call in hair what call ruby plaster down yes dress said maud know plaster dress goodness know what be made of looked know what whipped cream look like compared to cream looked like whipped gold sort of froth of gold not yellow gold melba be in middle of jewel song when came in at end of nobody be paying slightest attention to glass in house be turned on catherine got up threw cigarette end away be wife added four word carried ton of irony maud got up also hated be process of file again knew that thurso talked to one like deplored that felt like oh be such pity dear said that be wife oh thurso worst of spoke then pity that feel like that be such splendid people really bore get on nerve remarked maud gave little frown gesture of disapproval must never say such thing said be mistake to say just because be well partly true if be untrue must not matter to let say true thing when thing be pity only make more real speech confirms everything good gracious if people must only hold tongue on unpleasant topic how thing must improve oh be philosopher looked at with great tenderness affection be said like anyhow go on maud gave long sigh do justice said more than doe justice allow for other thurso believe be happy more than be why do think that carves forty eight hour out of day fill while world look on in envious admiration be ideal always attains even husband clap hand maud took by shoulder shook gently idiot said dreadful idiot shut up be going to bed thank for catching so many beautiful fish be not sure that thank for asking mr cochrane to dinner to morrow said love quiet evening with thanks dear get on tolerably too good night what nice day have be what nice thing have got to think about to send to sleep fresh case of typhoid to day for people headache for salmon for be so sleepy that mind going to bed maud began then stopped must not tell in be ashamed of having taken laudanum be ashamed also of having deceived for saw have done that since then be ashamed of there be need that must know well be nothing thurso manner be atrocious said yesterday to day have begun to say something then stopped will keep doing that to morrow will see how maddening be laughed again good night dear old boy said next day be wholly given up to installation of typhoid patient carpet rug curtain have be rolled up unnecessary furniture removed bed brought up down from basement higher floor so that utmost accommodation might be provided in big room on first floor dr symes in consultation with other doctor have settled that be better to run little risk move even bad case up here since day be dry warm for sake of more immediate attention greater abundance of fresh air than be possible when patient be scattered about in tiny cottage room ambulance going backwards forward day brought grave burden by five in afternoon work of transportation be done house be full afterwards doctor went round of whole house found result satisfactory not one apparently have suffered from move now instead of patient being in small ill ventilated room be airily housed with facility for constant supervision from nurse most too be going on well there be one case of gillie be a serious a must be a often when strong be ill seemed a if fever vampire like sucked out strength thrived grew strong on dr symes before left have given order that must be sent for at once if further unfavourable symptom occurred duncan wife be true have be through passage no le perilous that very morning with wish to be hopeful be unlikely that two must be snatched from very snap of jaw of death thurso have be in house day when move be finished went down into room where maud lived feeling desperately tired intending to get hour sleep before dinner to have intention however strong laudable innocent doe not imply that very best effort be able to put into effect instead in instance have sooner composed to sleep than felt that though surface of brain be drowsy tired beyond word something below be broadly staringly awake have lain down on sofa with face averted from light eye shut so a to give utmost welcome to sleep be not sleep that came series of vivid though unreal image born of memory first interminable series of stretcher with swathed fever stricken burden came up stair just when be beginning to feel that monotonous procession be precursor of sleep image twitched claimed attention maud have gone fishing poaching yesterday have enjoyed good sport thus procession of stretcher gave way to vision of landing fish after fish dead beat silver sided till seemed that iteration too must end in unconsciousness something jarred instead catherine stood at head of stair in thurso house dressed in ruby with sort of love in mist of gold round receiving king queen queen king in crown again ended not in slumber in something very antagonistic to there be just little stab be hardly pain inside head a remote a sound of electric bell in basement then be repeated time louder more insistently a if ringer on one hand be impatient a if bell be beginning to come up back stair then be right to call pain now sound grew louder finger pressed bell more firmly while bell came closer be quite wide awake now surface of brain secret cell alike opened eye then said out loud be in for seemed to be case for prediction began to be instantly fulfilled half drowsy similitude of electric bell vanished instead there be pain clear clean pain stabbed dozen time with firm practised touch a pianist strike chord two before begin piece then paused for moment immediately afterwards began again differently instead of stabbing at nerve laid cold steady finger on that finger grew quietly steadier colder till something inside head seemed to ring with a musical glass ring when be adroitly stroked then came brilliant passage of sort of pain a if orchestra have begun to accompany masterly solo then a horn hold long lazy piercing note pain pierced dwelt in while wonderful arpeggio of torture from neighbouring nerve crossed be prelude in room upstairs must reach in ten second there stood on dressing table bottle not very large contained not only antidote instant cure of suffering also blissful content gift of ecstatic well being very fact that yesterday have so lightly so seemed now have recourse to deceiving maud have uncorked paradise made at moment brace against temptation of resorting to again if have got to bear pain really appeared just now that have then must set teeth bear sooner than at cost of step in formation of damnable habit drug into remission from pain what even now when be suffering hell tempted more closely into sense of divine harmony of being that drug gave longed that pain must cease longed even more for seventh heaven of content be in small bottle with brown elixir then desire disguised made more insidious approach there be guest coming to dinner to night must not simply retire to bed leaving maud to entertain mr cochrane alone on other hand did seem to to be physically possible that must be able to sit through dinner if in state for already bead of anguish be thick upon knew well that be prelude be only orchestral performance soon curtain must go up singer must be there too be intolerable enough now have never known so full orchestra yet must stifle must extinguish singer by little draught swallowing in throat will intention remained firm be not going to silence like for now knew quite well that desire for drug be acute not only because of blessed relief from pain that must give because of intense physical enjoyment that brought then with head splitting buzzing with pain went upstairs to dress make ready to entertain guest there be forty other guest too in house be well looked after also be in bed lucky devil breeding what be implied by much abused word includes courage of quiet rather heroic kind since have stirring aid to help moral trumpet drum to stimulate to shining deed yet demand greater command of self greater obedience to courtesy of life to be courageous in hum drum unexciting circumstance than in to romance adventure be auxiliary certainly to night thurso perfectly natural even gravely convivial manner towards guest sister while be suffering pain of most excruciating kind be courage that in small difficult sphere deserved sort of domestic victoria cross though most people have more manliness than anybody else must have credited with when pain have got to be borne heart rending situation faced yet to have ready smile attentive ear genial manner under such circumstance be fine exhibition of courage of good breeding more than too thurso have faced before dinner when little bottle on dressing table reminded that pain need not be borne moment longer than chose through dinner thurso achieved outward sign of inward well being be through remissness failure on part by instinct born of intimate knowledge on maud that knew be going through hell of physical torture sometimes just bit lip suddenly stroked long moustache sometimes in middle of sentence must make pause be scarcely noticeable a if considered for word sometimes gripped knife fork so that skin over knuckle showed white be talked quite easily naturally made reference to maud poaching expedition satisfactory result a far a dinner be concerned for salmon be excellent went on to speak of epidemic have brought up north at last show sign of abating said though be still ignorant of source of in fact there have be fresh case to day yesterday maud looked up at mr cochrane wishing rather intently that must preach gospel felt that might do thurso good at rate take mind off pain flickered round like shower of dagger gospel be veiled at rate think be so good of to bring case up here said lady maud told yesterday that be doing so be sure must help towards recovery to remove people from surroundings associate with illness to fresh bright place paused moment one see that day said if associate place with pleasure be pleased to go there again mind left to cling so strongly to material thing if one have be happy in certain room one think that surroundings will tend to produce happiness again be one of illusion get rid of last thurso began to speak mean said then stopped for access of pain so sharp seized that must not get on maud saw gave sudden quick look of sympathy annoyed for first time cochrane saw too after moment recovered went on mean will always associate house with typhoid sick suffering people asked be not very cheering bertie cochrane smiled looking with happy childlike eye first at maud then at host mean just opposite said will always associate house with recovery with sweeping away of illness pain dinner be at end pause of cigarette lighting followed bertie cochrane have taken one a spoke did not light laid down again on cloth then got up lord thurso be wonderfully brave said be sure feel in horrible pain let go right away now have enjoyed coming up to dine with lady maud ever so much for last minute two pain have become so much more acute that thurso forehead dripped with perspiration dinner too longing drunkard desire to get to room take dose from that healing bottle have be growing like nightmare figure now when pain in spite of gallant effort to conceal be discovered desire became overwhelming must no longer master pray think of going away said if will excuse for few minute think will go upstairs have medicine there that never fails to set right will be down again quite shortly yes may a well confess pain have be pretty bad for one moment appeared that cochrane have something on tip of tongue for turned eagerly to thurso who have risen be wiping face be clear to maud when did speak that be not giving expression to original impulse will be delighted to stop said if lady maud doe not mind being on hand wanted so much to ask about one two of pool on river thurso left room cochrane turned to with same eagerness a have shown minute ago be so willing so eager to treat brother said did like suggesting to did not know if must not think very special kind of lunatic maud shook head knew quite well must be perfectly idle to suggest thing to thurso indeed to sense too there be something unthinkable about calling into play power rule world in order to cure neuralgia besides poppy juice though did not wholly like taking must do that other be like cracking egg for breakfast with steam hammer oh thank very much said medicine always put right instantly turned conversation to subject have suggested spoke of certain pool in river have found difficulty in fishing satisfactorily thurso meantime half blind with pain have almost run to room for longed for relief awaited there a desert parched traveller longs for water keenly a desired cessation of pain much more keenly did thirst for ecstatic sense of well being that drug produced day even before racking neuralgia came on have be almost unable to think of anything that have thirsted day for stimulated consciousness that huge vivid sense of happiness already seemed to proper normal level of life already too be beginning to be dishonest with just a yesterday have be dishonest with maud even a poured out told knowing be untrue that must not be taking if mr cochrane have not be dining with be inhospitable impossible to send away five minute after dinner be equally impossible that must spend evening alone with maud though so far a went be true be not essential truth took glass in hand torturing now that relief be near assured with voluntary delay even a caged beast have be roaring for meat sits fierce snarling when have be given before begin to assuage hunger pang now know can satisfy deliberately prolonged for moment more stabbing pain sat down in easy chair put foot up on in order to make quite comfortable before drank room looked north west have dined early so that sun still shone in at window flooding room in cool crystal light then drank inside head during last hour felt a if sort of piston rod from cylinder have be making firm stroke onto bleeding mangled nerve end of piston rod be fitted sometimes with blunt hammer so that crushed nerve sometimes with sharp needle point went deeper seemed to penetrate very home heart of pain then perhaps piston rod must cease for few second while iron toothed rusty rake collected smashed fragment of nerve together again so that hammer must not fail to hit squarely made neat little pyramid of piece on place where must descend raking together image be so vivid to that almost believed that actually took place be about worst part knew that in minute hammer must begin again now few moment only after have taken dose change began though hammer did not cease to fall blow no longer produced pain produced instead warm tingling sensation like hand feel when spread out icy finger to friendly blaze that tingling warmth felt way gradually through head passed down neck slowly flooded body limb to toe finger tip forgot what pain meant be unable to realise even before piston rod ceased to beat what connoted knowing only what oncoming of tide of physical bliss be like sense too be quickened stimulated sun still shone in at window burned with ruddier more mellow light glory of be soft incredibly brilliant to quickened sense of smell air came in through open sash be redolent with honey scent of warm heather blind have be little drawn down over top of window whereas when be dressing for dinner hour ago sound of flapping against frame be fretting irritating thing now seemed to to give out flute like vibrating note while taste of cigarette have lit five minute ago brought up with have flavour new exquisite present moment sensation of be quickened into vividness of dream life while be vaguely that remembered that downstairs maud be sitting with very pleasant american fellow who have come to dinner at dinner remembered again vaguely that be not sure if liked now appeared to be most charming of companion with gate of paradise here upstairs flung wide for reception must not fix mind very clearly on doubt if made effort must recall more about remember name just now eluded effort be one thing certainly must not make since might disturb destroy perfect equilibrium on be balanced there be really reason so now appeared why must go downstairs again maud poaching friend must talk about fishing for awhile then ah yes bertie cochrane must go away must easily understand own non appearance have suffered torture inquisitor master of rack must refuse to grant little rest compensation then for moment breeding habit of whole life jerked to foot with intention of rejoining a courtesy decorum demanded drug have taken be already more powerful than told with authority that ecstasy of consciousness must be trespassed on interfered with by presence of others must if went downstairs be necessary for to extent to give attention to instead of letting be absorbed in exquisiteness of own sensation sensation have nothing in common with dulled perception of sleep intoxication be lifted onto plane more vivified than normal basked in super solar sunlight then still without suggestion of sleepiness intoxicated consciousness most wonderful vision rather intentional visualisation of scene mood magic in beauty passed in front of turned into keats be listening to nightingale losing in embalmed darkness to charmed music of immortal song weariness fever fret be remembered only a traveller arrived at long desired home remembers weariness of way spirit seemed to draw away from life though still intensely living be in love with death loosed from impediment of body then curve be suddenly turned next moment be mounting higher than blithe spirit of lark must carry hung in clear interstellar ether so remote that sun above earth below seemed about equal in size shape of england coast of europe be visible a in map set in dim blue sea then still mounting turned eye upward looked undazzled into high noon of heaven yet though be noon infinite velvet vault be sown with sparkle of star sun star shone there together slip of crescent moon made company of heaven complete again still vividly awake without least hint of drowsiness aspect of firmament be changed star became globule of sparkling dew empty space of ether took shape until above that have be heaven be transformed into huge bed of blue acanthus leaf on dew of star lay sparkling sun be still there in centre of round sky took shape of petal of flower be centre spike of gold in immense blue blossom be thick with petal a rose pure of shape a daffodil too vision to host of heaven contributed be own born of own brain so short time ago be bound on rack of torture sordid suffering now be nothing remembered have be in pain more how cheaply have purchased at price of copper coin jewel of consciousness little draught relieved of physical pain have brought astounding joy have made whole machinery of universe to serve vision star be drop of dew on acanthus leaf of infinite space sun burned in centre of unique flower few minute ago have half started to go downstairs now raving of lunatic in bedlam be not more distant from mind than thought be absorbed in contemplation of thing brain with aid have given can re create out of object be used to see without wonder be real world easy of entry to who have sense to turn key while material world be dream vague pale compared to reality meantime below bertie cochrane maud have for ten minute talked unmitigated fishing maud though in general to talk fishing be to one of most entrancing form of conversation provided talked to real fisherman a be now doing be giving lip service only to subject for inwardly regretted finality of few little frozen word about thurso with have so successfully dismissed subject of christian science matter of duncan wife of wanted to know more for very shame pride two so verbally opposed be often really identical must not go back to subject have so unmistakably snuffed out while in confessed genuine dislike of preaching be equally unlikely to approach again have said that though disliked preaching loved practice have just leaned forward over dinner table where still sat pride in pocket to ask question about when interruption came one of nurse entered beg pardon lady said thought lord thurso be here will be back soon said maud can do anything think dr symes ought to be sent for at once lady said sandie mackenzie have very high fever hour ago did like look have just taken temperature again be below normal be worst can happen suddenly like dr symes told to send for if there be change for worse thought have better come tell lordship maud got up did quite right to come tell nurse said will have sent for at once be very serious yes lady mean perforation said know that be good to send for doctor one must do what one can maud nodded thank said will see to nurse left room going back to patient maud stood there for moment without moving for have mused about by river yesterday came back to mind in spate vividly instantaneously only yesterday have heard mr cochrane tell duncan that wife be better though morning have be ill almost beyond hope of recovery yet day to day have be mending swiftly steadily thurso be upstairs too opportunity have desired be completely given have started to go to ring bell order someone to go down to dr symes house summon way stopped seemed almost a if mr cochrane have expected for have wheeled round in chair when stopped be facing quiet cheerful looking at with strong childlike eye mr cochrane began eye met again felt antagonistic to have element of certainty about seemed to one have right to carry then simplicity made easier to be simple with moved step nearer step further from bell know whether be right to ask said to begin with if what nurse think have happened be quite useless a said to send for doctor ask either in spirit of derision curiosity ask then said quietly yes life be at stake can go to poor sandie make live if so will have known life have landed hundred fish for if say will quite understand that feel honestly be quite sure that be not right for to do so will be sorry will in way question decision so ask will go to sandie maud did not know that human face must hold such happiness a saw there answered at once why certainly will said if be to make better must while be treating whether think be improving not send for doctor there must be none of will go to if wish if go case be in hand not that under direct care of divine love can not tell how long may take to cure know patient be healed sooner than others respond more quickly than others to healing power if ask to make well believing can will do so must trust completely otherwise hinder must be sure be not asking only to see if can maud went through long moment of dreadful indecision knew be taking tremendous responsibility for though if nurse be right sandie be beyond human power yet be serious thing to refuse to send for doctor be impossible not to trust strong happy confidence a hesitated spoke again still quite quietly quite cheerfully why hesitate said choice be very simple choose direct power of god to make sandie well reject think for moment be who make well can do more than doctor look on only a window through sun shine so choose lady maud hesitated no longer please go to said oh be quick human cry sounded there be terrified at choice what if sandie died have not sent for doctor not done must have be done yet did not revoke decision be frightened stranger whom have seen yesterday for first time soothed like child there be nothing to be frightened at said have chosen right faith know that flesh be weak rather faith be weak while flesh be strong bind control sometimes so that true will be almost powerless let be silent minute moved chair round again to table where have dined made backward sweep of hand overturning breaking glass so a to clear little space leaned head on hand clasping finger over eye to shut out sight of material thing brought whole mind home to one great fact from sprang own life health happiness namely belief in presence omnipotence love of god from fishing from preoccupation of life from thurso from maud from false belief in illness pain called winged thought home settled in soul like homing dove with power of soul mind have to realise central fact root from whole world sprang nerve fibre material though be have to be instinct with a have said to maud be window through sun shone window then have to be polished cleaned to be made speckle of dust of anything must cast shadow hinder ray from penetrating for minute two remained motionless then got up from chair come up with lady maud said since have asked in sincerity must like to see since be ready to believe for like israelite will stand still see salvation of god maud did not hesitate now something of have realised reached sun streamed in through window yes will come said nurse mile who have come down to tell maud be busy with patient in room two having gone upstairs to first floor inquired of nurse where sandie be knew maud of course by sight supposing that cochrane be new doctor expected to day from inverness asked question merely took through billiard room where be twenty bed into smaller room beyond where sandie have be placed alone at door mr cochrane turned to thanks said will not need then two entered cochrane closed door gently behind maud have never yet in life seen to whom great white presence have drawn near now when looked at bed face of man who lay there knew that supreme moment must nearly have come so unlike life be what saw sandie gillie whom have known so well with whom year after year have passed so many pleasant windy day on moor by brown sparkling river be barely recognisable grey pallid mask with skin drawn tight over protruding bone of face be scarcely human upper lower lip already growing bluish in tinge be drawn back so that in jaw teeth be exposed even to gum eye wide open bright dry looked piteously way that with pupil dilated with terror soul frightened at dark lonely journey on none must be companion sought for comfort reassurement sought in vain be delirium of fever caused that active scrutiny be fear dumb appeal hand thin white lay outside blanket too be active picking at cochrane have seen that before knew what meant quickly pulled chair to bedside leaving maud standing sandie said just listen here minute think be ill maybe think be dying at least mortal mind tell that have let believe now there be not atom of truth in why man god be looking after have sent here evening to remind of forgetting have made poor body sick be trouble maud looked from mask on pillow to man who sat by bed if one face be dark with shadow of death lay over other be so lit illumined with life that seemed possible even now that death for grimness nearness might have to retreat force irresistible radiant seemed to be challenging a yet did not dare hope must only wait watch then there be silence cochrane took mind off else off poor sandie even to abandon to knowledge belief in only power that healed lived though evening be cool bead of perspiration stood thick on forehead a concentrated strength power of belief into realisation of then again after quarter of hour raised head looked on glassy dying face on pillow spoke more eagerly more insistently than ever how can be ill if only realise that there be nothing real in world except god infinite love fix on that be only sin that make able to be afraid sick in pain be god will for sandie wo have be that old cheat devil who make sin who make think be sick tell too that be poor sinful body so be have forgotten big thing about god have wiped away jesus took dear master took sickness too on shoulder nearly staggered even for moment paused again for minute more be silent absorbed in realisation of believed time seemed absolutely unconscious of maud presence in silence looked back from to have be death head on pillow saw not exactly to amazement to intense awe that certain change have come over be possible of course that first terrified glance at have exaggerated deathliness of that might in way have now got used to in case seemed different again intensity of mr cochrane belief in power to heal on whom very shadow of death lay might have infected made see through medium of conviction yet seemed to that change be there faintly recognised sandie again living sandie whom knew not dead sandie whom have seen when first entered room that gaping mirthless grin have vanished lip be no longer drawn back to base of teeth surely hour ago lip have be nearly blue now blood tinge invaded again also poor hand have picked plucked at blanket be still lay there weak nerveless no longer picked clawed eye sought comfort still seemed that have begun to find be eclipse shadow of death beginning to pas away from face be power of infinite love must be so much stronger than sickness death being here now openly manifested be imagining thing in obedience to suggestion made by strong virile mind of man who sat by bedside from sandie looked back to mr cochrane soon raised eye again for through long silence have sat with face buried in hand again looked at sandie there shone from beam so tender triumphant that face be transfigured be better already dear man said be coming back so quickly retracing way along road of error untruth unreality feel know there must be mistake now sandie face have changed life feeble fluttering made impress there death flickered where have dwelt so firmly tide have turned be low water still water no longer ebbed have begun to flow after moment sandie smiled at brown childlike eye smile be not that fixed terrified grin maud have seen there before cochrane caught so to speak held look first conscious effort of man who have be dying be right went on false belief have made ill be coming out of mind must come out of ca do of ca do for divine love can door of heart be opening oh let swing wide let great sun shine in chase shadow away there wider yet sin be gone illness be gone be gone except great light if anyone have told be sick forget be mistaken did stop to think that there ca be sickness where god be be everywhere wherever be asked to be have asked to come here here be put hand in let divine love lead sin fear sickness will just roll away a mist roll away from moor a have so often seen when sun rise feel that sandie know fear have ceased for there be nothing to be afraid of sickness weakness be leaving because be born only from night mist sun have scattered be tired weak still yes yes because have be wading through slime choking mud of fear false belief be coming out of already god be setting foot on rock will not be afraid for terror by night for pestilence walk in darkness day be safe for arrow that flieth by day can not touch sickness destroys in noonday of ignorance unbelief god salvation be come to will dwell in house of defence set very high so tell with own voice be not getting well do not know be better be not false thing vanishing what be happening maud asked that with thrilled bewildered wonder have to believe evidence of own ear when heard sandie saying faintly indeed audibly in natural voice that be better have to believe evidence of own eye showed pallid mask exchanged for face of living being have be pulled back from gate of death even a door be being opened for to pas through colour be coming back to ghastly clay hued face terror suffering be being expunged from eye short panting breath whistling from between clenched teeth backdrawn lip became natural respiration from under bed clothes there came longer jumping movement limb lay still yet be impossible must not yet believe evidence of own sens must be trick illusion even a thought entered mind cochrane for first time turned to must doubt dear lady said for know that have be saying be quite true be only thing be completely true come take other thought out of mind if have be questioning truth of what see here reverse doubt tell sandie that know god be making well just because be beginning to know that illness sin fear can exist in presence of infinite love tell that maud took step forward stood at foot of bed have to believe what eye showed showed no longer that unrecognisable death mask face of sandie thin pale tired be true living face be quite true sandie said be getting well be faith in infinite love make well cochrane turned to bed again spoke in voice so tender strong that maud felt sudden lump rise in throat why sandie said faith be spreading round like calm water infinite love shine through like sun at noonday faith be streaming from same knowledge stream from lady maud stream be joining rushing in spate together over what be dry barren hillside listen to voice of shouting praise to lord by jove be being good to be again paused moment now since old cheat devil have be tiring poor body out poking pinching roasting will have good sleep sleep clock round sandie before drop off just be sure have got tight hold of god hand like jacob say wo let go before blesses let go afterwards either when wake to morrow squeeze hand again say 'divine love be going to lead now always ' will too never said 'no to anybody biggest trouble have be that wo keep on asking for what want now get to sleep dear man just say to 'thou lord art hope thou hast set thy house of defence very high there will evil happen unto thee then gently a child sandie eyelid flickered once shut down cochrane got up without word in silence maud left room at door maud looked back sandie be lying quite still drawing in long full respiration of natural sleep nurse mile have returned during last hour to billiard room where be settling patient for night a went through maud stopped to speak to sandie be ever so much better nurse said have gone to sleep think wo disturb again to night will nurse mile shook head be exhaustion be afraid said not sleep will not be disturbed till dr symes come daresay not even then poor fellow cochrane be standing by seemed to maud a if be duty to bear witness here now to what have seen to what incredulously believed there be need for dr symes to come at said have not sent for will not go look for so that may know be satisfied nurse stared at moment then went swiftly to door of room where sandie lay opened passed through in half minute came out again closing softly behind why be getting natural sleep said have closed eye last three night breathing be quiet there be more rigor yet

staircase rather heavy not very admirable feature in house have be gloriously transformed by lightness spring of feathery decoration poor mr hopkinson ignorance of what wild flower be have be capped by ignorance of how wild flower grew original order to decorate stair with only wild flower have led to placing poor dear in neat orderly row a in riband bed consequently assistant florist have about twelve thirty morning to demolish begin over again having first under lady thurso supervision made salad of fragrant hamper of flower grass then stuck properly be to say absolutely at random into tray of moist clay trough of water lined side of staircase must keep alive bright eyed till morning there be still five minute before carriage came lady thurso while bread be yet in mouth hurried out to

industrial sale be off mind thing occupied somewhat insistently there be mystery about nothing whatever to fear either in past future certain possibility interested count villars have just arrived in england having at extraordinarily early age for must be scarcely forty yet be appointed hungarian ambassador to court of st james there be quite number of people resident in parish who remembered very distinctly how desperately have fallen in love with catherine thurso twelve year ago when have first come out a mother expressed taken shine out of rest of girl of year then so world still remembered

brilliant handsome without penny of own removed by dozen life from succession to huge estate of villars life certainly made lot of difference must show mistake there be in fact many who thought that mr etheridge plan be going to be interfered with mistake have be duly demonstrated to when catherine etheridge so soon after became catherine raynham rudolf villars in long interval of twelve year between abrupt departure return to england have done everything except marry in that did fortune have declared to be parent really brilliant gift have reaped reward before be too old to care about success relation near dear have died be now next in succession to estate of villars with only decrepit old great uncle between ambassador to english court to world at large situation just now be being rather largely discussed have element of interest be known that catherine thurso husband be not romantically attached to other be conjectured that since rudolf villars have remained single be still romantically attached to be impossible to help wondering whether at last must show sign of being attached to anybody to world be in spite of beauty charm brilliance somewhat irritating enigma glory of

object to view world like child though may give distracted attention to lure for moment two soon get glassy eye again repeat what about world be doing just now felt that thurso presence gave better chance of solid distraction than bright object that must dangle before ball for instance have be object positively dazzling in brightness though differed in kind even from other function outside observer might think to be similar wanted more than though hugeness of success must not fail to gratify even one who be so accustomed to succeed other function might have london assembled in le beautiful house dancing to identical band with everybody in tiara garter be quite obvious to who knew that lady thurso have hit very top note time note be only struck once in season what top note be be impossible to say just a be impossible to say why same ingredient can make two perfectly different pudding except in case depends on cook same people probably have be to twenty other ball danced to same music said same thing inscrutably though certainly be ball of year competition be futile that new feature staircase of wild flower might have have something infinitesimal to do with glorious dining room not turned upside down smothered in flower might have helped for chic of not decorating room at letting remain a appeared when nothing be going on so apparently must have kind of entertainment without fuss preparation of kind be undeniable yet again nobody must turn staircase into country lane without thought so upshot be that lady thurso alone knew exactly how to do what to keep unadorned a if be going to dine alone what to decorate how to decorate to say how to look what to wear looked may be remarked magnificent wore jewel at nobody hitherto have thought of guest outshone outshone that perhaps be vibration in top note in case be a clear a musical glass much a ball be talked about knew that rudolf villars be talked about more wherever people met together during subsequent week just at time of year there be nowhere that did not meet ball have to be mentioned like corollary came question be still devoted to number of comment on that interpretation conjecture inference must have made of myriad woman whose ideal be to be talked about in kind of way satisfied to live die happily ever afterwards unfortunately catherine thurso did not claim kinship with such gave not smallest pleasure to know that situation want of concerned must be one thing everybody else discussed a if concerned have when met villars again at bazaar only felt can be must never have known must not have troubled head about what anybody else might be saying have not enjoyed that dispassionate attitude instead something within independent of own control have said rudolf just a have said twelve year ago twelve year ago volume of emotional chronicle have be closed with snap now that ambiguous book be reopened again on very page at have be cut short vague girlish excitement trouble joy be presented to notice again now be presented not in dim light in blaze illumination of womanhood passion have not be awake in then potential fire still smouldered under damped coal of immaturity now have passed away fire be ready to spring up fire of retarded dawn with splendour of noonday waiting on be really so already feared to ask question for fear of answer to pretence of playing at being stranger when at bazaar have called excellency have broken down with singular completeness very night at house have established footing of old friendship to in bare justice be perfectly entitled must not defend against must not resent even if have wished to do so year ago have loved have asked to marry if doe not entitle man to take attitude of old friend when next relation of sort be resumed there be nothing in world doe also be minor point have half accepted then thrown over by look word did appear to cast that up against now must not in response to generosity deny standing of friend yet though have claimed tacitly by right that must not dispute privilege of friendship knew that implied much more knew quite well that still loved there be question about in mind disquieted love of other men have not disturbed serenity of own insouciance fact that man did told that be not a others be characteristic of of worldly wisdom with always ordered life that crammed into week followed ball engagement must ordinarily have taken even ten day to get through have seen at once that question of importance must time have to be answered having made up mind what answer must be also made impossible for a far a be in power to leave leisure for reconsidering have a have be said real moral code to refer to have be born a must suppose many people be without moral sense upbringing environment have not generated did not for instance refrain from stealing owing to wickedness of so doing merely because be mean nasty like going about with dirty glove a regard other point sense of morality dictated decision now to put baldly blankly a did to herself here be man who have loved twelve year ago felt certain still loved while on side be stirred again a be stirred twelve year ago only now be thurso wife worldly wisdom however said much more than to first impulse to treat with formality be clearly mistaken if did not treat with friendliness be so undoubtedly due world must certainly say that be cold to in public only to be warm in private from point of view of world conclusion though actually false must surely be accredited obviously proper attitude since desired to be treated a friend be to do so be here that thurso presence in london be desirable whole affair be delicate if be somewhere in caithness where there might be typhoid there might not gave gossip far more excuse for raging furiously together there be doubt that must see good deal of rudolf villars during month two of london husband must therefore see good deal of too have charming place on thames just below maidenhead left by mother low rambling creeper covered house with one foot in river one in garden here often entertained from saturday till monday not with mistaken notion that be rest after bustle fatigue of london to get into tranquillity of thames side in order to bustle more than ever london be true be sufficiently busy in london one be not in evidence anyhow until eleven so in morning while in london also even if there be people in house looked after need only be given bed food at bustle began earlier since a be country everyone thought necessary to play round of golf row wildly on thames before day began at while nobody ever went to bed till nearly morning since in country nobody need get up thurso maud be going to motor down with on saturday afternoon a maud have not appeared at time appointed be to be taken for granted that be doing other thing must find way down on own account catherine on other hand like most busy people be punctual to minute well be not here said a stepped into car really ca wait thurso unless start now people will get there before do be never considered quite polite be a well to be in one house if one have asked people to stay in remarked though probably get on beautifully without one got in after stood for moment with hand on door a if wanting to give maud minute eye happened to fall on saw be trembling next moment sat down caught eye looked away again flushing little there be something aimlessly furtive about be unlike week have be little uneasy about have seemed nervous easily startled uncertain of a started though caress be not frequent between laid ungloved hand on thurso old boy said be well there be nothing matter with started at touch withdrew hand beg pardon said ring be so cold yes be perfectly well know why ask because look very well said maud told have have several very bad headache up in north have be rather ancient history be not have not occurred to to inquire about during last ten day maud only told morning said have have return of since came to town footman have got up by chauffeur big napier car bubbled whirred to moment then slid noiselessly off with rapid smooth acceleration of pace over dry street be checked for moment at corner into piccadilly poised like hovering hawk then glided into street road way be very full dancing elastically on spring flicked in out of congested traffic with precision of fish steering way between clump of waving water weed seemed indeed more like sentient animal fine mouthed horse trained setter than machine a if intelligence discernment brain thought calculated obeyed lived in long painted bonnet rather than merely piston cylinder crack named apparatus of mechanism slackened speed before one must have thought that block in traffic ahead be discernible a if scenting need from far off cut in out of moving cab omnibus a if possessed of occult knowledge with regard to pace be going what lay invisible ahead of foresaw impediment to free movement seemed a if must not be foreseen conjectured opening appeared inconjecturable down piccadilly down knightsbridge thurso seemed unaccountably nervous must hardly sit still kept shifting fidgeting in seat frowning starting grasping side of car once even calling out to chauffeur who in fact be one in thousand for combined carefulness speed bidding go more quietly through jostle of traffic again be quite unlike though like what have be for last ten day wife seeming not to watch watched narrowly without comment when came to calling warning to inimitable marcel who must sooner have flayed skin off own hand than let vehicle scrape one grain of paint off splash board of beloved car must not help protesting besides looked so silly to jump about like dear thurso said what be matter be driving perfectly carefully thurso frowned still looking anxiously at road in front spoke with unveiled irritation be driving recklessly seems to said a if mattered whether saved five minute on road woman be never content till have have smash be simply result of wanting to get in front of cab now instead of waiting two second again be quite unlike tone word distinctly lacked courtesy hamlet without prince be not le like play than be thurso when forgot manner like husband be always ready to account for failing whether of omission commission by physical cause thurso rudeness unhesitatingly put down to not feeling well in case must surely be better for if did not continue mode of progression that made jumpy if be nervous said let cross park put down at paddington can take train be absurd said shortly went on in silence for little thurso made immense effort to pull together at rate effort seemed to to be immense knew that lately effort to do anything did not feel inclined to do have be enormously increased moment of quickened consciousness be seemed to make brain in interval more lethargic le able to give order knew quite well that nerve be out of order though be true that since coming to town a have just told wife have have return of neuralgia have for last ten day always silenced threatenings sometimes even before such threatening be really perceptible by liberal use of divine drug never failed believed too if thought about that be taking larger dos than prescribed knew that be intentionally absent minded when poured out draught have taken only for anodynic purpose more than once twice must not say how many time certainly le than fifty have taken for pure pleasure of effect knew have begun to be dragged into habit a man whose clothes be caught between revolving cogwheel be dragged in unless by superhuman effort can break loose be not that did not struggle against struggled with mental reservation two day ago for instance have resolved not to touch for forty eight hour promising a reward for abstinence pleasant hour two when got down to bray after so have planned must continue to break free from by carefully graduated course next treat must be three day afterwards after that there must be abstention for four day for be rather frightened already at previous indulgence at greed with longed for during last week in scotland have taken day sometimes twice sometimes said to that suited perhaps be abnormal made feel so well so alive then again must recognise danger lay in front of vowed to set about task of breaking from habit must be done by degree already must make larger resolve than that did resolve interval between treat must become longer longer until craved more craved how craved now be that made so nervous irritable must have one full dose when got down to bray have promised that felt a if be almost duty to perform promise meantime whatever in brain be lethargic inert sense of cunning precaution be always strong knew that be most important that catherine must not think that there be anything wrong so before pause after last rather snappish reply have made impossible to refer back spoke again in different tone must forgive for speaking rudely just now said be sure that marcel be really careful have most dreadfully trying time up in scotland horrible headache did not make thing easier a matter of fact saw dr symes when be there told be on edge did not attach least importance to said best thing must do be to come down here amuse forget about typhoid again be true a far a went further dr symes have said thing with regard to neuralgia have not pronounced on cure for there be harm in seeing doctor said telling feel do then tell to avoid curried prawn pay only two guinea laughed have better us for even so small sum said while mind said to two guinea worth of laudanum two guinea worth of laudanum be so much better to be told if there be anything wrong said so nice to be told that there be be sure of without being told said house at bray be long low rambling straggling down at one point to very edge of river for most part standing in middle of flower bed short turfed lawn stiff yew hedge cut into fantastic shape screened custom of inhabitant from population in boat so that sunday afternoon crowd must not a in most of river side house see exactly who be there what have for tea who smoked slept who read who played croquet indeed have not be for impenetrable barrier of thick set foliage what have for breakfast lunch dinner must have be equally public property for lady thurso have built big open pavilion on terrace just above river where when day be hot party took meal pavilion nearer house served a drawing room card room smoking room on fine sunday nobody more than set foot in house from breakfast till bed time dozen guest so be that house must hold if a often happened people proposed when sleeping accommodation be already commanded be possible to get bed for at neighbouring hotel to day however there be to be sleeping out be doubtful indeed whether house must be full maud be certainly coming count villars alice yardly husband be also certainty a be jim raynham ruby majendie who have proposed to other lady thurso never must find out who began on night of ball couple of american cousin brought number up to ten catherine hardly knew whether be glad that have so small party for once be true must have fairly quiet sunday worried a be not only about private emotional history of own also though told be causeless about husband be not sure whether must not have be greater rest to have plenty of superficial arrangement to make plenty of people who did not touch inner life to amuse did not at believe in thinking about thing unless practical step be to be outcome of thought in case got instant dividend for investment if thought be to end in nothing dividend be composed of worry only however even with few people in house must manage to keep fairly well occupied american cousin too plain elderly millionaire very dyspeptic intensely mournful with wife who be young voluble carried about with pail a be of gross fulsome flattery with industriously daubed everybody who be in least worth daubing must certainly want especially in view of thurso irritability little careful management almost wished have not invited inherited from mother that idea of american hospitality make other hospitality appear niggardly in comparison did not consider have done duty by even most undesirable cousin if only asked to dinner cousin must be asked to stay even if crossing sweeper be line on went particular cousin acknowledged to herself be rather trying acknowledged to nobody else in spite of desirability of arriving before guest silas p morton theodosia whom husband always addressed in full a theodosia giving syllable due value have arrived before met hospitably at front door why if doe tickle to death exclaimed theodosia to receive at own house catherine how be lord thurso thurso stifled wish that something must tickle theodosia to death proceeded what beautiful motor why if be cunning silas got here just hour ago servant brought tea right away out on lawn made ever so much at home a be for ever saying to everybody 'catherine be just perfect everything have be just perfect husband servant motor car cracker must have seen silas tackle cracker tell everybody so silas when theodosia be present there be never fear of awkward silence awkward speech be only possibility covered up awkward speech so quickly with none of mattered much be usually talking when somebody else be talking always when nobody else be tell everybody what theodosia inquired husband why catherine be just perfect englishman be so perfect too that guess be right for perfect american girl to marry why ball other night thought knew something about ball catherine ahead of there though have have bright evening in new york guess be proud of wife lord thurso guess be proud of be very pleasant be not only salute explosion of geniality on part of theodosia exploded time like quick firing gun be never sick sorry tired silent be always bright contemplative mind might seriously wonder whether anything known to occur in uncertain world must make stop talking talked time that be in dentist chair even though speech be impeded by pad gag creosote have once talked without intermission through railway accident not even stopping to scream at interval voice of husband said theodosia like clock striking ticking went on same if be cunningest yew hedge ever saw said with door cut right through middle of a if be wall there be river just beyond with boat like people on side walk lord thurso can see river from where be sitting silas change place with lord thurso because want to see river through door in yew hedge look at bug what do call oh yes butterfly sitting right here on arm of chair be tame bug in america be half so tame a that hustle more think be english not to hustle so much eat tea without hustling too lord thurso call that true british tranquillity just adore silas catherine however distinctly hustled over tea got up be who have asked theodosia here did not for moment repent having done so began to foresee that must be necessary to provide theodosia with relay of companion who must take for series of walk ride in punt a theodosia must say other ride in motor if wanted to save saturday to monday from utter shipwreck thanked heaven maud be coming who handled loquacious people so serenely listened appeared to to impossible conversation with interest be quite marvellous clearly also be by direct dispensation of providence that alice yardly be to be of party for alice also asked for nothing more than to be allowed to talk without intermission theodosia talked of thing saw river road bug yew hedge eye supplied unfailing topic of conversation to tongue while alice talked with same incessantness of thing must not see faith healing false claim of mortal mind between must cover whole ground of be perfectly happy sitting opposite anybody else who might talk simultaneously a long a asked question interrupted flow of volubility clearly then providence intended that alice theodosia must be paired like blessed siren keep up perpetual flow of conversation to nobody else need listen at present maud have not arrived so took theodosia down to river punted around a lady phrase went catherine punted around so felt a have never punted before must have punted to oxford if necessary to keep appreciative lady away from house till maud alice yardly arrived of whom be capable of tackling protective instinct governed unusual physical activity be responsible for advent of theodosia be therefore responsible for keeping theodosia away from thurso so be not till seven have clanged from church tower at maidenhead that turned punt homewards found on arrival that everybody have come that everybody have gone to dress be dresser of abnormal quickness found have still nearly hour to spare after have seen theodosia safely to room so instead of wasting alone went to talk to maud latter be betwixt between with hovering maid river of hair making down back highest geniality flowed on other side dearest catherine said know be too awful of of course did wait everything have be late to day at least have be late for lunch

night jewel be so chic to be smart in country shabby in london be old established custom for to smoke cigarette while be dressing before be time for to dress there be hour yet catherine lit cigarette catching maud eye nodded in direction of maid spoke in french send away for few minute said maud gave giggle of laughter what bad language to choose said because hortense be french be hortense will go away please come back when ladyship go away then maud turned to sister in law now catherine what be asked well first do be very kind to maud take theodosia away on possible occasion so that get on thurso nerve a little a may be maud brought long plait of hair round shoulder held in mouth for moment then know what want to talk about said theodosia first be on afterwards of course know thurso nerve be fearfully jumpy way down made effort have to make effort if be well do be rather rude too be so unlike be not rude when be well told have bad attack of neuralgia up in scotland yes day after day said maud paused moment wondering whether have better say that be on tip of tongue then decided to do so after be brother wife to whom be talking matter be one clearly concerned even more than be talking to catherine to whose wisdom above of perhaps others felt natural to confide perplexity trouble have got to get through day work said to enable to do so to get relief from horrible pain took laudanum have be prescribed for rather freely allow before end be more anxious about than about neuralgia think ought to get limit laid down by doctor ca be right for anybody to take sort of drug absolutely at own discretion ah headache have ceased said catherine told there have be no return of since came to town be very glad said maud because well ca be good thing to get in habit of taking stuff though while be up in scotland neuralgia be so bad have to get relief somehow if headache have ceased suppose one need not be anxious more catherine heard certain hesitation in voice saw same in face be not telling quite said think have better be afraid of something more if fear be groundless there be harm done if have foundation be best for to know of course guess what be maud put down brush turned to sister in law yes expect guess quite correctly be have begun to take for own sake for sake of effect coming up in train thought be asleep saw yes spied on if like saw go to bag take out

dangerous have what do mean said stumbling over word caught sight of small medicine glass on washing stand took up smelled where be use of saying that asked holding out to got up quickly ashamed for moment of having lied to more ashamed of stupidity in not being more careful when came in be so uplifted vivified by drug that have be off guard shame be infinitesimal compared to anger with have spoiled smashed up happiness by interference instead of wonderful sense of well being complete physical mental contentment felt now only furiously angry with what right have to break in upon like making lie to hated making lie instantly detected where be use of interfering like cried have spoiled now have robbed of be mine must serve right if took dose now straight away did not come down know

warm windless though have dinner in open pavilion in garden mr silas p morton only sent for second thickest of black white plaid to put round venerable shoulder a precaution against chill after dinner bridge table be started for occupation of american jim ruby while others preferred for present to wander about in deepening dusk light still lingered in west beneath steely grey of river smouldered with reflected sunshine that sky still retained moth hovered over huddled fragrance of dim garden bed emerging now then from darkness into bright light cast by lamp in pavilion where little party have dined veiled odour of night began to steal onto air odour of tobacco plant night stock of dewy foliage ripe hayfield damp earth be so far more delicate suggestive than trumpet blown fragrance of day though crimson still lingered in west overhead steel blue of night be darkening fast minute star be beginning to be lit from rest of world colour have already faded be etching marvellous mezzotint of black white catherine when rose from table found villars by side in manner irresistibly implied that meant to have stroll with leaving others maud have already towed alice yardly out of thurso immediate neighbourhood be listening to fearfully interminable account of mr eddy relation to phineas p quimby went down through door cut in yew hedge have so roused theodosia enthusiasm to stroll along river front catch last of evening light opposite on other bank of river tent be pitched outside three four young men be seated having supper at tablecloth spread on grass lit by couple of chinese lantern fire for cooking burned bravely on river edge smell of aromatic wood smoke be wafted across to looked exquisitely simple uncomplicated catherine rather envied that for own life just now seemed involved ravelled did not feel confidence in future indeed be not sure whether even next ten minute must be quite easy for woman of world though be conversational engineer skilled at directing flow of talk into channel in wished to run felt vaguely nervous with companion at dinner have be polished suggestive talker have seemed to time a if be talking from surface only saying quick glib thing came so easily to now when have separated from others found impression have be correct be so good of to ask here said quietly like for mean that admit again to friendship intimacy with at least so take struck match to light cigarette holding in screen of hollowed hand so that flame illuminated face very vividly have changed extraordinarily little dark eye still have sparkle of fire youth in corner be still unseamed unwrinkled face have grown neither stout attenuated hair be still untouched by grey plume of hung a have always remembered little apart over forehead wore moustache beard very short upper lip separated large essentially masculine mouth from thin aquiline nose then a flicked match away threw back head with gesture knew so well be presumptuous of asked charge to tell not let go on being presumptuous unwittingly laughed be not in least presumptuous said ask whole world to ball big party since doe not matter who be there owing to crowd here in country ask only people want to see for reason have got to see be not among latter more one want to see of smaller be party encourage said be kind of now dear lady have not seen other for time though old history be tiresome do want to know one thing never mind history event sum up for be happy have be happy paused moment have right to know too yes immensely happy said with honestness at least life suit suppose implies happiness be what be cant phrase in harmony with environment moment have asked questioned wisdom in doing so gave if chose sort of opportunity ah well have be hard working ambitious said have got what wanted suppose one must be content with diplomacy suit london suit third thing indeed suit that asked what have just so kindly promised friendship place first think not third laughed again still little nervously conscious of determination not to let conversation get more intimate than for moment be out of hand for went on in cool quiet voice separating word from neighbour giving to individual value people who have once be friend said after interval come together again often make great mistake in wondering worrying about past please suspect of stupidity be more than content to take up present just a be fragrant with promise of friendship fragrant with knowledge that have be be happy must have given whole life a know to make that now that have come to without effort on part why let rejoice over economy of energy have come to end of path by river where ironwork gate gave onto highroad outside paused moment before retracing step big yellow moon have risen over tree to east so while western part of sky still glowed with east be flooded with cold white flame turn colour into ivory ebony strange effect be reproduced on face for warmth of west shone on one cheek while on other be white coldness of moon fantastically enough felt for moment reading word in double light seemed capable of two interpretation instantly told that be utterly unjustified in such conjecture word have be absolutely guileless have smallest cause for interpreting otherwise what have done be to read into knowledge that twelve year ago have treated shabbily now credited with impulse of revenge yet feared little beneath quiet kind word there be something white hot keen edged a have said wanted thing got what then did want of have told friendship be like too like consummate cleverness required cleverness to perceive at so subtle natural be to say strong serious thing about happiness friendship thing must know must remain in mind then round off sentence with pure triviality about economy of energy gave however a doubt meant to do since have said say opportunity for altering direction of conversation without abrupt transition really know if one ought to rejoice in economy of energy said a turned to walk back there be such enormous lot of energy in world think there must be le trouble if be scarcer know have quite a much a have use for must find more of embarrassing be admirable said believe there be never scheme to help relieve distress brought before to give real support not mere buttress of name time pain energy see economise energy in other direction what direction asked emotional never worry do never regret never allow passion of sort to master exhaust again be rather more intimate than liked yet somehow did not resent perhaps must be truer to say that must not resent for in very gentleness there be inherent strength made resentment futile might a well resent slow grinding movement of glacier in case must do good to resent catherine always set face against purposeless attitude think worry much said then be very happy have little to worry about then suddenly told that be being afraid of man to next word summoned courage asserting against announcing independence certainly often regret said people talk of destiny a if be force outside if thought that doubt must often regret dealing of destiny with for in almost important decision thing really make one life destiny be nothing more le than one own will will be weak think be sure be not said what if destiny will of come into conflict with yours oh then one have to fight said in battle

asked again be little flowery effort have done good must tell that be even little fruity still delight in phrase see observed in sincere one answered joined others after finding that millionaire cousin to infinite chagrin have lost seven sixpence not long after catherine suggested adjournment to woman of party for reason felt really rather tired though have be fresh enough at dinner went upstairs immediately to bed sleep in spite of perhaps in consequence of tiredness did not soon come to first one thing then held back from crossing drowsy borderland now must be thought of thurso pulled back into waking consciousness perplexed wonder a to what be wise step to take about must not play with drug like that be safer to play with loaded gun yet have allowed to throw bottle away will be own still then mind took swift excursion forward into event of next week be crammed from end to end must go up to town quite early on monday be glad be full must have time for thought did not want to think then turned on side proceeded to do so why have rudolf villars come back to trouble busy tranquillity of life have said that have come back amounted to to resume friendship with what if
