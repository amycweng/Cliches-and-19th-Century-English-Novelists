for dinner at chartries brother place stood pleasantly among wood about mile distant in finishing sermon for trinity sunday study where worked be singularly like seemed a integral part of a snail shell be of snail there be nothing for instance in least drowsy dusty about room everything be in place place of thing being in case strictly determined by use to be to be put frequency with be to be used scrupulously orderly energetic severity in fact be keynote of room something of same characteristic also ran through sermon at be working be exposition historically introduced of le encouraging comfortable verse of athanasian creed congregation must have recited during service be master of style of english in neat correct lucid served not a in sermon of so many preacher to clothe cover lack of idea to reveal abundance of convey without possibility misunderstanding rather with precision of hitting nail on head what thought on particular subject there survived in indeed full if not double portion of puritan spirit on religious matter though mind soul action be dictated impelled by fervent whole hearted christianity yet eloquence be wont to dwell did so here on doctrine of eternal damnation with very curious gusto appeared to that truth of be abundantly warranted in bible that be therefore duty a minister of word to bring a well a other doctrine home to flock something of same grim aspect of duty extended to affair of ordinary life where censure be clearly deserved offence be visited by with force that approbation sometimes lacked if there be nothing to blame puritan too survived in certain mistrust have of mirth gaiety without being in least sour be so intensely serious that at given moment appeared to that there be probably something better to do than to laugh moment thought easily discovered what be of work be insatiable if be unsparing to others at rate never spared day of rest be to in house most iron day of pleasure except be to greatest pleasure in life active religious work religious exercise be put away since exercise even religious one be fatiguing be weary household went up to bed on sunday evening now though to have very strong vocation towards particular work to be convinced that such work be highest best in world to do be disposition of affair make for happiness be probable that if have taken mr challoner unawares asked if be happy must have hesitated before answered for in spite of firm convinced attitude towards life in general to most intimate with there rose deep down in man great fountain of tenderness great longing for love herein lay secret tragedy of life longed with same intensity with served god for ordinary human affection relationship through armour crust of nature armour be noted of welded hammered work duty human hand must not break way to clasp hand of others still be tragedy of life with regard to two child just a have be even more bitterly so with regard to wife half italian by birth whom have adored with serious fervour suffused nature be just spiritual anxiety care for have by refined irony of fate come like impassible barrier between to seemed always to be checking innocent sunny impulse of joy be a vitally hers a fervour be put that there be always something better to be done with precious passing hour than to sing laugh gather flower embroider dainty fragment of personal embellishment rather let take innocent taste raise elevate dedicate let sing by mean let gift of music be devoted to help of parish choir let gather flower to send to sick let embroider altar cloth poor mr challoner girl still in year whose motor power in life be joy found that to fit pleasure to useful end meant that ceased to be pleasure there be many nature not necessarily willow selfish like when husband told that flower with loved to fill room be beautiful to so that thereby thought might be led heavenwards be minded to throw away from first indeed marriage have be strangely ill assorted may have be made in heaven in case must probably have be far better if have not come down to earth sidney challoner have have reason sens taken captive for time by delicious piece of dew sunlight on side imperiousness eager over mastering desire for extreme good look perhaps also fact that stood next in succession to earldom of flintshire elder brother present holder of delightful position being unmarried led to accept devotion disillusionment have soon come to exquisite child like beauty of wife behind have conjectured child like spirit found to be mere mask while to fiery dominating lover turned to hard unbending master year after marriage twin be born from time girl mother have drooped dwindled fog of northern climate fog too more intimate distressing of mind spirit absence of mirth laughter chilled to bone year afterwards be dead death left inconsolable in so far that determined never to marry again when sister clara came to keep house for look after early education of martin helen can not be denied that widower found more comfortable than have be for clara be one of not uncommon english spinster who have perfect passion for doing thing ought to do leaving completely undone thing ought not a feminine element in house of parish priest be clear mission to be aunt if not mother to flock class instruction so hated of niece soul grew up under care like seed sown in april have practically pleasure only relaxation be patience played regularly from time dinner be finished till family prayer at quarter to ten precisely at twenty minute to ten if card be going awkwardly began to cheat continued if necessary to cheat until parlourmaid began to set out row of chair for servant thus be able by time filed in to sweep card triumphantly up together in due proper order be humbly thankful for temptation into have not fallen that day mr challoner evening found that peroration with concluded sermon took rather le time than have anticipated there be still ten minute after have arranged sheet in order placed under paper weight to be read through in morning before need go to dress a custom be closed eye for moment after finishing work in silent prayer that might bear good fruit then hearing clash of croquet ball from garden strolled out to see child have have very unpleasant talk with martin that morning on subject of late failure at cambridge though occasion seemed to then seemed still to have demanded stern speaking have wondered several time since whether have not be too severe yet how else except by very earnest remonstrance must awaken in lad sense of responsibility with regard to spending of day must never come again life have faithfully strenuously striven to implant in boy duty of making best most of youth prayer work be two great guide of life must be constant concentrated how gravely mortally must be to blame if through want of inculcation on part son grew up tepid in one slack in other still here essential tenderness groped about martin be young yet more tender perhaps in mind even than in year clash of croquet ball sudden burst of boyish laughter from lawn made long to enter into childrens pleasure so without putting on hat for evening breeze be not too cool to head went out down box hedge round corner on to croquet lawn martin standing with back to have not heard approach be examining position of two ball be quite close together with uncompromising wire between on bank where have be sitting lay mill on floss helen be standing close by brother in proud calm consciousness of having wired with complete success well of devilish thing to do helen said martin at length struck wildly in hope of impossible cannon off wire turn think said walked across to ball in play saw father come play father said dear thanks must go dress in few minute martin old boy come here moment again duty need for remonstrance strove with tenderness martin said gently thats rather strong language to use to sister isnt dont get in sort of habit dear fellow never use word idly like at genial instinctive pleasure faded out of martin face eye fell yes father im sorry said in perfectly dull conventional voice know be only thoughtlessness old boy said father try to think there then hows game going be helen playing with frightful precision be getting accustomed to look there shes hit ball from right across lawn dont be too merciless helen with poor brother helen smiled made laughing reply to father then eye caught sight of book lying on bank smile faded a went after ball have hit wondered what must be done guessed though have not heard word martin have already be rebuked for what have said knew there have be one dreadful hour already that morning be certain if father saw book mean time be strolling down lawn right in direction where be lying radiant blatant in crimson cover on vivid green of grass martin also have seen what must happen a passed whispered to hell see o lord with drearily comic expression mr challoner strolled on came to where book lay picked up with amiable intention of putting on chair to save cover from damp a did read title on back then there be dreadful pause be yours martin asked yes father mr challoner said nothing more went on way taking book with at corner of box hedge however turned if be up when come back martin said will come into study dont wait up for if be late turned back again to walk on martin thought have gone next moment paused again raised voice slightly must answer when speak to said thought have gone sir said martin with little tremor of irritation in tone time passed out of sight martin threw down croquet mallet rather bad luck said im not popular to day helen what fool be to leave on grass oh be so sorry martin said what can do must do good if said have be reading not slightest said there must be enough to go round will if like said see worst of be that only three day ago day before came home said that must not have book of hers in house couldnt be expected to know that did said martin because told helen threw down mallet too oh dreary said lord flintshire mr challoners elder brother with whom be dining to night be figure of distinction have be at one time political factor of great weight in country weight due chiefly to force of inertia since never professed least personal interest in politics must not possibly be considered a having ambition aim to gratify in spending so much time labour in interest of conservative party wealth position in fact be like large heavy parcel strongly tied up dropped into tory scale at age of fifty five considered that have done enough resigned cabinet appointment held for last seven year have devoted with far more zest than have ever brought into political arena to aristocratic pursuit of doing nothing to successful discharge of brought acuteness perception practised with such charming success a to raise to level of fine art be never in hurry never felt exhibited slightest sign of irritation annoyance at anything world power of heaven hell chose to do have great appreciation of fine art even higher appreciation of inimitable comedy of life so that to live in beautiful house did fill with congenial people constituted for far more engrossing occupation than politics have ever be for brother sidney have very real affection also certain sympathetic pity must understand a have once told what must be to feel like live perpetually in bracing climate dear fellow said find positively necessary to do dumb bell day yes will certainly give hundred pound for village room will be charmed to do so dont want to hear about pray let know if want more there be only small party night when woman went upstairs men seceded to smoking room lord flintshire detained brother for moment a be leaving will not stop quarter of hour dear fellow said have chat have not seen since easter how be how be helen martin girl grows handsomer time see martin martin have just achieved one of annual failure at cambridge said father yes will wait quarter of hour rupert must like to talk to about be good deal troubled wild oat of kind asked other if so must if be look very steadily in direction a one grows older dear sidney one be apt to look on wild oat a something much more poisonous than really be nightshade deadly nightshade for instance be only wild oat really sidney sat down ah dont expect to share view said sin be sin whether be twenty sixty martin a far a know have not be playing about said lord flintshire with amiable desire to find periphrasis did not please brother cant discus thing with in spirit said however point be really alien have reason to suspect martin of such thing what deplore be general slackness be to mind like low physical health to body predisposes to disease have to speak to severely about failure at cambridge morning too severely perhaps evening again have distressed very much what have done asked rupert well will think very insignificant doubt to appears most significant of general state be playing croquet with helen heard say to well of devilish thing to do now when be boy rupert didnt say that sort of thing at couldnt have said to sister lord flintshire felt kindly amusement at sidney be such dear fellow be year since be boy said at length rightly wrongly world have begun to take thing more how will say to ride life on snaffle instead of curb what else have martin done have brought into house mill on floss rupert admirable courtesy enabled not to smile have read book asked will not have book of author in house said so only other day martin must have known for know have given to sister to read hope so said lord flintshire quietly because be very beautiful book of course disobedience to wish be different point to mind more serious one be to understand that be consulting a to what general line must take with martin what policy must pursue yes be very much puzzled can not seem to get guidance about doe good be afraid to pull poor lad up first here then there thirty time day appears to do good either to talk to on general principle of earnestness industry do so want to grasp fault see in spring from slackness will not think did not think what word used to sister mean never think how just little carelessness about work repeated again repeated must lead to habit of idleness be most deeply thankful that father be strict with rupert made industry habit with one rupert laughed habit from have succeeded in freeing said martin be not slack about everything be not slack about music ah be distraction be responsible for great deal of idleness said father have forbidden to have piano in room next term lord flintshire did not pursue there be plot already on foot here brother got up with quick neat touch put couple of book lying on table there be too said not only doe continual correction of seem to do real good certainly doe harm to relation with boy will get to look on a continual menace to pleasure a continual school master want to be kind to lad to make happy to make friend of when consider duty lead to correct again again to correct be so afraid that estimate of love bear will be lowered eclipsed nothing in world rupert must be sadder to than child must not think of a friend strong tender voice quivered for moment a spoke word paused moment to regain complete control of nothing not even that said must will stand in way count for anything in regard to responsibility god have laid upon to make child worthy child of must be weakest most culpable of father if for sake of human affection however sweet sacrificed one jot tittle of rupert be silent moment though have always felt great respect esteem strong affection for brother have never found emotionally speaking particularly interesting have greatest admiration for industrious strenuous life undoubted mental gift swift keen intelligence absolute undeviating probity of character admiration have be somewhat of sort mechanician may feel for bright engine with rhythmical accuracy precise stroke clean efficiency strength suddenly engine have developed human pathetic side throb be not steam driven only be throb of human heart true have known wild adoration of sidney for girl wife that with speedy disillusionment have seemed to one concession sidney have made to flesh be human be not high humanity otherwise must have made better recovery so to speak passion have be awakened then not man religion passion together have mixed no better than oil water experience have not humanized lord flintshires strong appreciation of inimitable comedy of life did not help here a sat silent for moment before replying element of comedy be not wanting brother heart felt distress at fact of martin calling sister devilish for instance be ludicrous enough thing combined to form nothing to laugh at result be tragedy tragedy in grand great style pitiful little tragedy of misunderstanding estrangement rupert knowing brother knowing martin saw possibility of comedy entering with unexpected happy ending for sidney be so to speak irreconcileable admitted sort shadow of compromise must hold parleying with enemy even if enemy be entrenched in one of own household martin in fact disagreed vitally fundamentally lad be good lad accidentally essentially be artist to finger tip be influence governed to father artist artistic achievement of man be more than fringe on visible garment of god one can really help in said rupert at length except martin can suggest to certain point of view do beg allow for individualism in other people dear sidney have great deal of there be reason to suppose martin have le remember also that younger generation be always ahead of elder though can by using extreme care influence little yet rein of government be in hand not ours be partly why retired from politics a practical suggestion offer beg to say nothing more about mill on floss to martin be quite impossible that must agree with simply because be of next generation to indeed if take care that be afraid of will certainly happen even if have not happened already will get to think of a man who be always finding fault always correcting thing fatal to friendship be irremediable if have already happened asked sidney with rather pathetic humility of course be not just because boy be so extraordinarily generous so eager to like one martin be delightful boy be upright honest clean be thankful for let develop on own line will do so by way whether like not so be just a well to like besides must not interfere with other people individuality feel that rather strongly lord flintshire got up began walking softly up down room in face be very like brother though older looked younger for there be softness about feature extraordinarily youthful a one get old dear sidney said one stand in danger of getting old fashioned seems to to be very terrible thing one own conviction may become hard fixed in outline incapable of growth adaptation one may become incapable of imagining that one can be wrong may draw conviction from highest source may be able to say quite honestly believe with whole heart that will of god be so a oliver cromwell once remarked be just possible that one may be mistaken paused moment seldom talk so much said have not quite done even now younger generation take round ride life a said on snaffle now if choose may call slackness a slackness condemn condemnation of will do good martin will continue to be what call slack mean time be in danger of becoming what must call tiresome will also on occasion continue to call sister devilish be there slightest reason why must not if have called sister devilish when be boy must have be undesirable what forget be that devilish doe not mean now what meant thirty year ago doe martin mean by what mean by mr challoner got up too mouth drawn rather tight be much obliged to for advice rupert said find disagree with in principle so absolutely fundamentally that there be use in discussing with too claim individual liberty very large part of be concerned with sense of responsibility for child dear fellow make great mistake said lord flintshire can not alter conviction will make great mess of said other chapter ii lady sunningdale have few habit be thus very adaptable one be to make punctual first appearance hour before luncheon appearance though long delayed be brilliant when came be a if fresh many coloured sun have arisen to take shine out of splendour of noon day year be only thing in be no longer young youthfulness of mind taste character be perfectly spontaneous natural still retained to full eager curiosity of youth youth insatiable appetite for pleasure in person be very tall largely made moved with exquisite briskness vigour though stout still clung to waist hat generally contained perfect aviary of bird perched about on dress to match taste be rather youthful in cut colour wore also white satin shoe with extremely high heel have be known when walked in wet clayey place to be drawn with cloop like drawing of cork completely off foot heel being driven into ground by weight in manner of nail a rule avoided clayey place indeed seldom walked at except at stated time hour before luncheon made up for lack of walking by talking did on occasion to a many people a possible be extremely entertaining be staying now spent greater part of life in staying for rather extensive weekend be to say from friday till monday with lord flintshire morning after arrival came radiantly downstairs at quarter past one two irrepressible dachshund barked excitedly round a stepped on to terrace where host be sitting be trying without least success to put up pale blue sunshade with handle of saxe china dear flint cried how sweet of to wait for where be everybody yes isnt divine morning everything look a if have be washed during night why be one such fool a ever to leave country go to london if one have single spark of originality one must never go near yes please put up sunshade for know look hideous morning doesnt matter how one look in country be of charm didnt sleep wink never close eye in country really london be place to live in have contradicted myself have not who care im sure dont where be dog please whistle on finger if can so piercing be not there be ah how naughty yes who care whether one contradicts one self shews in fact that one power of sympathy of seeing other point of view be defective unless one see side of question upholds vehemently yes do let walk down terrace adore walking oh suez canal running over flower bed like how naughty suez canal interpolated lord flintshire who walking by side looked like small rowing boat towed by brig in full sail yes dont see how dreadfully long be now tell about brother who dined here last night thought too fascinating have great talk about somebody called kennet think said mr chancellor be very high church be not mouth looked to high church there be something perfectly beautiful about high church mouth look at lady otterbournes mouth be exactly like brother so be bishop of tavistocks whom adore play flute divinely looking funnier than anything ever saw so funny that never want to laugh somehow bishop playing on flute do mean low church think must mean low church so brother be martin father sent message by last night to tell martin to come see afternoon completely lost heart to martin last winter be terrible to lose one heart when one be fifty because one have already lost one look so that leaf one really denuded besides seems so careless be chestnut think everything worth saying have be said year before even be born where be suez naughty lady sunningdales conversation flowed in manner of river in flood flowed over everything foamed spouted there be always sense never left unjustified that there be plenty more to come flowed in fact over so many different subject that interlocutor have practically limitless range of topic from to select matter of reply on other hand must fly off on tangent of own without initiating incongruity again must be silent completely confident that lady sunningdale must go on last topic suited lord flintshire very well do tell what think of martin said too fascinating genius that combination be so rare genius be usually quite unpresentable be staying with at easter used to borrow a one borrows book try to forget to return where be sahara will whistle again please playing well merely sublime can even play wagner on piano orchestral music on piano be generally detestable martin used to tell believed have instrument concealed about person be quite clever enough to dear can hear string then used to draw caricature of extremely tiresome people who be in house mimicry sunningdale finding fault with soup telling be gross feeder dear flint must have sworn be know charming way behave at dinner frank yorkshire too must have thought that nobody must have imitated frank martin beauty be probably evil in origin account for extreme plainness of good people simply too killing suppose low church brother doesnt approve of appreciate slight frigidity occurred when mentioned martin certainly doesnt appreciate excellency have mentioned doubt if really know exist be always way said lady sunningdale with florid gesture of despair very rare product natural artistic genius always make wayward appearance in utterly uncongenial place be bound to say usually leaf before long what waste of time dear flint dont walk quite so fast have idea terrace be so interminable will be mile from house when reach end where be angel really be pity suppose father will make curate greek scholar of be just what be afraid will not do be talking to about last night lady sunningdales attention suddenly completely wandered must build pergola here flint said there be pergola at frank yorkshire villa in capri be most divine thing ever saw covered with rose used to dine there earwig dropped into one hair from dark one heard extraordinary italian melody from piazza be where must like to live to leave world utterly entirely just exist so unworldly yes angel want dinner so doe mamma have got to end of terrace lady sunningdale gazed about with roving abstracted eye never did anything even gaze without thought being occupied with something totally different now a looked over great swelling line of down flowed melted into other like interlacing muscle away to horizon across hollow where roof grey spire of winchester trembled in haze of heat thought be further away than horizon so affected of people to pretend not to like food said if be genuine show be partly imbecile lacking sense of taste yes what martin want be to be chucked into artistic milieu to see what be really worth artistic milieu be exactly what hasnt got be starving be living on now artist except very greatest artist can do even then dy very quickly want to be soaked steeped in art paris now there be artistic milieu there music be generally atrocious nearly a bad a in london must lunch at caf champtre then why do wish to do asked lord flintshire dear flint because cooking be so good really artist be gourmet in everything including food think of story of beethoven soup threw in footman face because be cold must not bear that must not be hot cold soup in one face how horrible thrown by beethoven even must not make pleasant certainly martin have instinct of great artist have sense of form in doe expect mean nothing to brother certainly also have sense of form in dear be absolute adonis a slim a asparagus english kind lord flintshire laughed when do expect paragon asked after lunch to let go on learning greek curacy be like looking on at somebody being slowly murdered pray do a tell get away from terrible parsonage why word be enough to upset artist sound so like parsnip feel sure father must never consent to let run free in paris said why not because have insular distrust of paris a residence for young dear flint said with impatience if young man be going to get into mess make mudpies will make anywhere surely be least desirable thing in world that must make in parsonage yes see brother have so much character that doesnt seriously think that anybody else have got wish must say thing to said lord flintshire will if get opportunity if not paris london rome anywhere take poor martin collar off let roll in grass yes let turn surely be lunch time do put up pergola here down terrace leave out earwig angel be going to dinner turned very high heel clicking on hard gravel of terrace paused moment mistake in principle fascinating brother be making said lie in thinking that one be cast in same mould be own have to be educated in same manner whereas one of few thing of can be absolutely certain be that everybody be cast in different mould what fool people be really fancy trying to make scholar parson of poor martin such waste too a well a impossibility sunningdale might a well insist on taking lesson in juggling mathematics dont hate conjuring trick what be point of cutting open loaf of bread finding globe of gold fish inside nobody in sens must call stupid be morally incapable of adding up three figure correctly why simply because process bore therefore do wrong be fascinating theory of education for young may may not be fascinating be certainly true point of education be to develop taste may posse not to bore with acquisition of knowledge ah there be stella plympton coming to meet have immense charm look at way head be set on shoulder really to have neck be only thing that matter girl with neck have only to say good morning for one to exclaim how brilliant whereas people like with neck have to talk from morning till night at top of voice wear ridiculous hat else one say poor dear how much have aged how very dull heavy be flint have immense trial often wonder how keep up a do be so frequently life soul of party yes one made in same mould indeed stella for instance flint brother be imbecile dont propose to learn greek because can talk in sleep helen too be to be kept in dreadful parsonage life see nobody district visitor think ought to take brother family in hand neglect shamefully ought to be prosecuted for criminal neglect man have duty towards child lord flintshire laughed only last night be telling sidney that sense of duty towards be too strong again lady sunningdales attention rushed headlong away with bit in teeth be so rapid that one must not say wandered last act of gtterdmmerung exclaimed dear gave superbly other night at covent garden too of place though raven did come in ten bar too soon siegfried have to throw away never slept for week afterwards performance in question therefore must have taken place at least week ago for there be manner of doubt that when martin arrived hour so after lunch lady sunningdale be snatching brief interval of much needed repose after sennight vigil under cedar on lawn rest of party with exception of stella plympton have dispersed to spend afternoon in what considered violent english fashion be to say frank yorkshire brother have gone to play

lunch said if one be disagreeable one might suggest that be conversation at lunch not lunch led to desire for repose how rude of martin looked across to cedar be quite willing that lady sunningdales need for repose must not yet be satisfied thought settled that be effort to amuse produced that result said sound of stella laughter perhaps roused lady sunningdale for moved in chair suddenly sat bolt upright ah be awake said stella can peashoot other no longer what pity at least be very polite of said martin rising be very modest answered might have be true shrill staccato cry came from cedar

charming picture of domestic life martin reading greek history at table mr martin sobbing violently in corner yes how run on suppose really ought to go to germany eat cherry jam with chicken how horrible said stella must one take if want to enter into essential teutonic spirit must might a well hope to feel like anglo saxon without being always in rage playing violent game a try to be german without jam how hate woman who play game be nearly a odious a men who dont let go indoors martin will play to till tea time afterwards will play till dinner time lady sunningdale surged slowly to foot looked helplessly about where be dog said be too tiresome be sure to stray into wood flint horrid pheasant will peck darling ah there be amid what be once begonia look more like battlefield now how naughty come at once of there be doubt that martin piano playing be of very remarkable order before be half way through chopin first ballade stella who have be accustomed to consider piano a instrument for encouragement of conversation after dinner at most a introduction to vocal part of concert found sitting bolt upright in chair with strange tingling excitement spreading through heightened quickened beating of blood be essentially unmusical something in be extraordinarily arresting nerve if not sense of melody be at attention a for lady sunningdale always gasped when martin played did so now too heavenly said at end now make miserable play rain on roof tum tum tum tum dont know yes how clever of to guess be rather clever for lady sunningdales rendering did not really resemble one tune in world more than other martin paused moment then slow sullen drip of hot steady rain on roof began a sounded to man who be alone in alien land fell with hopeless regular iteration from grey sky then there be gurgle of choked gutter collected water overflowed be spilt with little chuckle very distantly on horizon remote lightning winked flickered there be a yet sound of thunder in dark sultriness of afternoon only endless monotonous rhythm of dropping rain then faintly at first with slow crescendo there be heard distant drum of thunder buffeting rumbling among hill then at once rain grew heavier larger drop a if of lead fell beating with resonant insistance on roof voice of storm grew angry articulate suddenly with appalling crash burst immediately overhead drowning for moment beat of rain by blaze of simultaneous flash sea sky wave beaten rock of majorca leapt into light then a thunder will drew away for time rain be not so heavy again storm swept up once more chariot of god crashed on way above wild lantern of storm flared way once more again after stupendous riot in sky hot darkness be punctuated by dreadful melancholy of dripping rain then storm growled away into distance little light came back into weeping sky pulse of rain grew fainter again choked gutter gurgled overflowed suddenly through unconjectured rift in cloud one beam of sun divinely clear shot down for moment on with excellent brightness yet be only for moment again cloud drifted up rain for minute have ceased began again dripping with hopeless regular iteration on to roof a evening closed in evening far away in land of exile beneath alien sky effusive a usually be accustomed to fill interval of silence might conceivably occur with discursive volubility even lady sunningdale be silent except for oh martin more than whispered for there be that in room in spite of superficial frivolity dragon fly dartings of mind knew recognized adored that touch of art make even of thing be common unclean gem jewel stella too said nothing sat still much more upright than lolling wont holding arm of chair from where sat must see martin profile cut with great clearness of outline against brocaded screen of scarlet gold stood beyond piano between music musician be dumb even in desultory accidental conversation have have with during slumber of lady sunningdale there have be something arresting to in brilliant boyish personality now from finger tip there flowed out so seemed to personality just a brilliant very mature by instinct of genius still boyish clad a be in purple of artistic nature there be nothing amateurish about unmusical a be must not help recognising certainty of performance for few moment after last note have died into silence sat silent also with head bent over key then looked up be that enough lady sunningdale asked angel from heaven be never enough cried play something different something brilliant must expire with several hollow church yard groan if played again make miserable play something virtuoso let come closer where can see hand moved to low chair to right of piano brahms paganini variation suggested ah yes do make shriek with laughter then with same absolute facility certainty with same cleanness perfection suggesting indeed slim poised figure took header into ridiculous theme out of foam bubble beneath hand flower grew star be scattered nature went mad with dancing when riot of jubilance be at height tall severe figure suddenly appeared at french window of drawing room advanced very audibly on bare board spoke sufficiently loud to be heard ah lady sunningdale said mr challoner how be martin wasting time at piano a usual how kind of to let play to martin wasted more time there at noise of interruption before brain have conjectured who be hand stopped eager active vitality died out of face a when candle be blown out banged random chord in sheer rage then instantaneously recognized voice rose quickly from music stool trembling yes wasting time a usual said excitedly artist in suddenly struck dead leaving just angry startled boy must go home lady sunningdale thank so much for letting play to hope havent bored good bye have lot of work to do closed piano lid a spoke slipped from finger shut with bang set string jarring ah how must interrupt like cried lady sunningdale to father yes how be mr challoner martin pray begin again will sit quite quiet without stirring finger breathing be superb father sat down distressed at martin rudeness honestly desirous of being sympathetic dear boy be so sorry said pray play piece cant said martin dont know for moment father son looked at other one with surprise indignation other in impetuous rebellion anger lady sunningdale asks to play again what be playing said father desire to be sympathetic vanishing sternness deserved by deplorable lack of manner in martin increasing moment be quite impossible must play said martin couldnt play note of seemed to to know said mr challoner surely have played hundred time at home martin be really incapable in shock of transition from world loved in be at home to other world of decent behaviour more like thousand time said simply directly left room there be somewhat awkward pause mr challoner be seriously angry with ill behaved son lady sunningdale be disgusted at being deprived of music stella with natural eye for drama be immensely interested seemed to there might be good deal of drama behind little incident then luckily perhaps lady sunningdale remembered that be so to speak on mission to dark ignorance of mr challoner savage in matter of art on behalf of martin put disgust in pocket be charming of to have come over to see said to with easy natured charm yes suppose martin waste terrible lot of time at piano when must be doing greek history demosthenes how fascinating stella dearest do see what suez canal be doing slap will tell when tea be ready do know mr challoner martin play remarkably really remarkably stella a be wont to do strolled out through window by catastrophe have entered leaving two others alone yes be that incessant waste of time distress said mr challoner piano at parsonage be so old that hardly care to play on first must apologise to lady sunningdale for extremely rude way in martin behaved to promise will make apology in person for moment irritation mastered apologise cried ought to be dear mr challoner how rude be pray forgive dont know cant know what music be to martin dont know what divine glorious mood in shattered be like throwing brick at iridescent soap bubble suppose brahms be name to like smith jones then recalled diplomacy again so difficult to understand brahms be not said be fascination of assure be worth thinking over martin be wonderful have improved so enormously too be not second rate third rate first rate what have be doing to mean at playing piano asked mr challoner a if have said sweeping crossing lady sunningdale longed for sahara to bite yes at playing piano said swallowing irritation again ought to study know be wasting time be quite true not at piano be dreadfully impertinent be not flint be old friend martin be nephew music be music so feel very strongly of course be only natural that mr challoner with earnest nature serious aim that be too interesting last night lay awake for hour thinking over what have said must consider poor martin very frivolous be artist to finger tip be nature mon dieu what finger tip too know be playing playing assure with consummate ease when interrup when came in thing really great pianist require to practice for month be too kind to take such interest in lazy son said mr challoner still very stiffly so stiffly in fact that lady sunningdale looked hastily at fireplace thinking must have swallowed tongs assure be not kindness that prompt at said be mere justice mere economy be very economical ask sunningdale world can not afford to lose talent like if be like when be practically uneducated to what may not grow heaven know world be so very stupid that must hoard save grain of talent exists be like what so beautifully said to last night about ten talent in napkin surely not said mr challoner faint smile breaking gravity well one talent then have head for number poor martin talent seems to to be put in very damp napkin except now then when somebody like lift up corner of let sparkle of gold appear happened very rarely that lady sunningdale be stirred into such coherence earnestness a rule multifarious little interest be like child playing king of castle rapidly pulling other down from momentary pre eminence first one then perching precariously on summit certainly most long lived king there be music martin future with rain storm of chopin mad frolic of brahms still in ear be very securely throned think impertinent dear mr challoner went on think what will only do give most serious attention to what say martin devoting finger brain power of extraordinary artistic nature to ancient history be thing to make julius csar weep pity of when might be starting on new chapter in music really believe that to be possible really be in earnest when a hope know better see how completely scatter brained usually be will appreciate how deeply feel mean that son must devote most useful most active year of life to playing piano asked playing piano cried feeling be almost hopeless to try to make understand be of course thread in golden garment of music to take piano playing a synonymous with music must be same a calling baptism of of riper year same thing a christianity music music must be life flint told morning that found slack lazy so must be if have to learn scale just a may be be sure be at classical study what do propose then asked inwardly rather rebelling at consideration felt somehow forced to give to eagerness for in spite of discursiveness be clearly impossible not to recognise surprising quickness intuition of mental process why just what have be telling first let throw dictionary history into fire have immense vital belief in educating power of classic said mr challoner for everybody can not mean can tell from looking at picture if artist knew latin pick piece of greek out of tristan und isolde in case martin have spent ten year at tell what be result fails to pas examination whether be criterion of education whether be instrument have failed be second rate at third rate be one there be first rate rest of world what be good of turning second rate person into sheepfold of second rate particularly when on other line that person have appearance anyhow of being first rate well be what think how kind of to let talk so where be angel be not tea time lady sunningdales unparalleled effort in concentration of thought here broke completely down whole tribe of clamouring competitor invaded castle of mind dethroning king yes martin really be playing too divinely be king expiring cry so like great artist too to bang down piano lid when be interrupted beethoven did too know shouted play no more to such swine so delicious of helen how be must bring over frank yorkshire be dying if not dead to see be one of people know who doe nothing appreciates so much so infinitely better than doing great deal rather badly not recognizing first rate when see be going to preach on sunday must have be so happy if have be man to have lived in country place like just spend day in doing little good among simple people how beautiful must be abhor london so willow yes really must preach on sunday mr challoner otherwise will stay at home read improper novel must not like to have on conscience must people be growing terribly slack about sunday be not yes will try to find tea talking make one so hungry chapter iii mr challoner be seated at very orderly table in study on neatly corrected revised arranged be sheet of sermon for next sunday in front of with face towards window stood martin father son wore very pleasant expression martin looked like timid wild animal at bay in corner frightened into sort of desperation while father thick bushy eyebrow be contracted into very heavy frown mouth be tightly compressed a if be holding back with difficulty impulse of anger nearly mastered be ashamed of said be ashamed that son of mine must behave with such abominable rudeness to lady sunningdale few year ago when such behaviour must have be more excusable because be younger must have given whipping be sure must said martin mr challoners face grew shade paler martin wish to understand once for said that will be treated by in public in private with ordinary respect courtesy have already told be sorry be rude to said martin speaking very quickly incisively with odd little tremor of angry fright in voice have often told be sorry lately said father almost before word be out of mouth have have occasion to find fault with for something else martin gave short mirthless laugh be quite true said cant do right appears mr challoner paused moment martin have never before come to open word with like what do mean by speaking to like that asked in voice scarcely audible there be answer have asked question martin said voice rising suddenly martin pushed back hair with hopeless gesture what answer do expect to give asked impatiently there be answer to question get angry with frighten think do on purpose have frightened into silence life now have frightened at last into answering hate anger make sick have be angry with day since came home for holiday sat down on chair behind with sort of dull indifferent acquiescence in might happen face sullen frightened joyless seemed a if must scarcely be same radiant boy who have played brahms hour ago there be pause imprisoned longing for love in father beat dismally at bar for felt felt truly that just now martin almost hated seemed terribly hard that own daily constant desire that martin must grow up useful god fearing man industrious earnest must be bar separated yet so knew to be have be weak indulgent father one who have not implanted in unbending ineradicable sense of duty towards son whom god have given how sweet might have be human relation between love for son be very reason why corrected that duty attached to own fatherhood when saw slack lazy a now wanting in courtesy respect be still from sheer duty that anger sprang now for first time from martin own lip heard effect frightened on purpose so appeared be then one of hopeless incomprehensible puzzle that god seems sometimes to set groping child fight between duty love in one must lose be vanquished seemed to cruelly hard if be so martin felt mouth go suddenly dry a spoke be past really caring what might happen father knew be about a angry with a must be hated feared anger in instinctive unreasoning way in grown man will fear something can really hurt no longer feared in childhood that vibrating note be in father voice associated with early failure of own in latin declension hint of what must have happened to if have be younger also carried back to early dreadful scene finding father did not reply looked up at saw that anger in face have be extinguished like wind blown lamp tenderness sense of being intimate with be so alien to martin that did not trouble to guess what emotion have taken place of anger anger however be gone taking own fear with with certain mercilessness characteristic of youth deliberately so to speak hit back do find fault with said try to please be use must not be better if went away there be good in stopping here dont suppose sort of thing give pleasure uncle rupert be sure must let go stay with in london next week till long term begin at cambridge will be in fortnight told wished to be up there time so must not be much better if went away father did not reply at once sat fingering writing thing with rather tremulous hand be not happy at home asked at length said martin shortly brevity certainty of struck more deeply yet if martin few month before have felt sick at father anger latter be certainly more to be pitied now martin what be matter between said dont know same a have always be only rather worse cant please suppose be always down on for something be to be hoped be doing good because otherwise seems well rather unnecessarily unpleasant first be work then what said to helen then mill on floss now to morrow will be something else there be sure to be something daresay dont understand know dont understand afternoon for instance oh use trying to explain said may be utmost use may make greatest difference only wish that have said to year ago what be saying now have tried to be good father to sometimes often have be puzzled a to what to do dont confide in dont tell joy pleasure let share often hear laughing when be not with when be not so often martin half shrugged shoulder a if to say there be again that be quite true said what can do when music to be greatest joy pleasure in life seems to just waste of time have often told so dont know one bit what mean to a seems to waste of time how can confide in about thing dont really approve of of will pardon be absolutely ignorant in middle of brahms whatever be come in interrupt by saying that be wasting time a usual might a well come in in middle of prayer say be wasting there go again be sorry will show how hopeless be mr challoner be silent moment really too much pained to speak be wise enough to recognise to say anything just then must be to effectually stop only confidence that martin have reposed in for year well martin said after moment ah use said even at very instant when be consciously trying to be careful say something like be shocked at meant exactly expressed what meant music be to like that never thought that possible year have be thinking be very fond of music just wasted great deal of time at piano whereas seems to that be wasting time when be reading thucydides be what lady sunningdale said talked to about after went away know well do not yes have be tremendously kind to father rose must go now dear lad said have got work to do before to morrow let try of to find more of friend in other will never have son will never have father must be very sad must not if did not of make best of relation there came into beautiful brown eye shadow of tear martin wondered will try father said mr challoner did not at once begin work wished to finish before bedtime when martin left sat with head resting on hand thinking very deeply be much troubled perplexed future line of action usually so clear to so precisely indicated by sense of duty to do justice so undeviatingly followed be now very misty ill defined hitherto have never entertained serious doubt that be not doing best possible for martin in always correcting admonishing when seemed to be idle even in trifle where small carelessness on part indicated danger of falling into slack slovenly habit in conviction that school college education in classical subject be best possible method of training developing mind did not in least even now with regard to latter think certain that be mistaken have be brought home to very clearly in last twenty four hour that other people thought be for brother opinion always felt considerable respect for lady sunningdales though wondered at must not help feeling more dozen time yesterday at dinner dozen time more afternoon have asked how observation of woman who really appeared to be scarcely capable of consecutive orderly thought must be worth consideration a often plump grain of solid sense showing acuteness perception amid husk chaff answered question be conscious of not being quite at ease with must not help admiring intense vitality speed busy acute inquisitiveness be who hailed martin poor desultory idle martin a genius suppose took advice let son go free into world of knew so little of however have so abundant mistrust how dangerous hazardous experiment martin with slackness ineradicable tendency to what be easy pleasant martin above with apparently so great musical gift unsuspected by father adored by others be exactly sort of boy to be petted spoiled ruined by careless highly coloured butterfly mr challoner believed to dance there day in sun to music painting drama visible art be end in object being enjoyment while to doctrine savoured almost of profanity to painting sculpture music be recreation might at interval be innocently allowed to earnest worker even in such time of refreshment christian must look for something more find in beauty that must lead thought to fountain creator of such however be not view a be aware of world of art into be invited to let martin plunge to music be sweet sound led soul nowhere to music painting be line colour sculpture be form end fulfilment consummation of be perfection of form appreciation thereof about latter branch of art have never be able to come to definite conclusion certainly study in nude seemed to to be thing dangerous if not inherently sensual art be perfectly useless remembered having read that sentence in book of martin have found lying about rapid glance at on occasion have justified confiscation few word to martin on subject sentence occurred to again now for there in line be expressed tritely unmistakeably exact opposite of what held to be truth art must have said doe not apart from natural innocent enjoyment of raise elevate soul be not art at a corollary highest form of painting in eye be religious painting because led by direct road to goal highest form of music religious music two be wholly laudable raphael so to speak shook hand with missionary handel took luther arm at other end of line of artist came who however consummate be art treated of theme in be dangerous worst of who by clothing sin in melodious beautiful garb rendered even if not attractive at rate more venial a have be seen be not musical when few week ago have found in london with martin with eminently laudable desire of getting more into sympathy with son have taken to see tannhuser at opera evening have not be wholly success for curtain have not risen ten minute on venusberg before incredulous horror have deepened into certainty have got swiftly up peremptorily ordered martin to leave also wagner be hustled by into outer darkness to gnash teeth in company with zola george eliot titian here then be stated in brief so that real soul searching difficulty in course of action with regard to martin future may be better understood attitude of mr challoner towards art with whole force of strenuous upright soul believed that one thing in world alone mattered that art science knowledge be at best by path led on to great high road of gospel in contained many thing of beauty worker be allowed to wander in coolness at time for refreshment of weariness beauty found there be sign post pointing back to high road other by path be there also beautiful a if one looked on outward form only instinct with danger of evil glitter such led through tangled garden of vivid meretricious gaudiness if one stooped to pluck poisonous flower be vitriol to finger unnameable beast of darkness coiled among leaf alert ready to spring must fasten on hand martin have left father presence that evening with idea be really quite new to truism in fact that father loved son have suddenly emerged from dull rank taken place in far more notable array of truth for interview have begun in manner so dismally familiar to except in case be set one two octave higher than usual have ended in manner unexpected unprecedented never before have known though have vaguely taken for granted that father really cared for intimacy love in relation with at rate have never seen fact bare exposed for whenever have shewn have always be wrapped up so to speak in memory of rebuke to night have flashed on have seen through covering heart of gold shone beat within with natural instinctive generosity of youth be quick to respond though habitual reserve shyness with father must not at once be dispersed so a to allow effusive rejoinder response have be very genuine resolve a left study to explore develop reef have suddenly gleamed in what to be frank have considered hard unyielding rock very vivid with in head ready to be matured by unconscious process of sleep during mind though sens lie dormant go on delving in difficulty groping for light went up to bed a undressed mind flashed quickly backward forward through event of day for moment smile uncurled lip a thought of extravagance incoherence of lady sunningdales next mouth be pursed again into low whistle of half dozen bar of tune ran in head brahms to have come so fruitful interruption what delicious piece of boisterous irresponsibility have infected stella plympton too have known that from glance at wide eye half opened mouth when began then suddenly just before interruption came have given one heavenly ripple of unconscious laughter at surprising piece of virtuosit yes understood understood probably better than lady sunningdale who always gasped gasp be true be great compliment to nimble finger must be a impossible to think of finger nimbleness when be going on a to think about chemical constituent of water when one be satisfying noble thirst then came that dreadful scene in study with utterly unexpected end well must try anyhow moon be shining outside against blind with amazing white brilliance a undressed went across to open window let flood of cool light shine in made yellow flame of bedroom candle look insufferably vulgar tawdry blowing out again crossed to window sat there while stirring of fragrant breeze sent soft ripple against skin a lady sunningdale have said be gourmet in sensation exquisiteness of sleeping summer night peopled with ivory light ebony shadow great velvet vault of sky pricked by thin remote fire of innumerable star lit by glorious sexless flame of moon smote with sudden pang of pleasure somehow must be translatable into music star scattered over sky be likely staccato note of string across great tune of moonshine be first slow movement in great symphony of night day at sunrise scherzo must laugh dance down breeze of morning with thousand quivering leaf million nodding flower tree waving bird among branch noonday must combine power of light air into third movement of intolerable splendour got up from where sat stretched arm wide a if to embrace then half laughing at dived into nightshirt leaving rest of clothes in heap on floor a custom always be laid face on hand fell asleep be still early when woke sun be up even a have anticipated before went to sleep slow movement of moon have given place to dancing rapturous scherzo breeze stirred with short sweeping rhythm among tree bird chirped in leafy temple sparkle of early sunlight gave inimitable briskness to young day then with sudden ebb in full tide of joy of life came thought that be sunday day in house of rest gladness in view one much taken up with lengthy unmusical service in there be great deal of singing with interval in amusement must be indulged in walked from window back to bed looked at watch be still not yet seven land of counterpane be no longer desirable even possible putting on coat trouser went quietly downstairs out across lawn into field beyond where bathing place have be scooped out of river bed till breakfast at rate still two hour away need put restraint on flood of vitality joy ran morning in spate through beautiful world there be two hour of with cool shock of racing water caress of warm wind sense of being alone young out of door pagan might be irresistibly delightful then suddenly while still thrilling with joy mellow tone of church bell struck across staccato sound of life at once scene with father evening before own resolve to try to please flashed into mind bell knew must be for early celebration in parish church have still twenty minute enough if be quick in to dress in prescribed sunday garb though why black be suitable to sunday have long given up trying to guess leaving to rot away among unconjecturable riddle of life thing pleased father so intensely play hymn on melancholy one manualled curious quavering tone of formed so remarkable contrast to nasal note of village voice so with something of sigh for renunciation of river bank hurried back home before bell have ceased ringing passed through church yard where yew tree of noble growth looked down upon horror of modern stone mason with chaste design handsome cross into grey cool church to judge by interior be probable that mouth lady sunningdale so much admired in vicar bishop of tavistock be low church mouth for mr challoner at rate did not attempt to make appeal to soul of parishioner by mean of sens two brass flower vas of curiously feeble design somehow suggests at once low church ecclesiasticism stood on altar over flood of mauve magenta light poured in through misshapen figure of apostle prophet in east window in one transept stood organ to martin directed step pipe of framed in wooden border ornamented with fretsaw work be painted white with scroll of red pattern in line embellishing top end behind organ bench be red plush curtain with golden fleurs de lys stamped on to screen person of organist from eye of congregation

indian red pierced here there with grating of cast iron work through in winter came hot stale blast from warming apparatus black iron stove stood near font at west end of church row of somewhat dilapidated rush bottomed chair denoted place allotted to school child to martin who for last two month have be accustomed to grey dimness carved spaciousness of king chapel first sight of staring crudeness came with shock of almost physical repulsion why have be done what did mean what emotion be ill coloured badly designed window intended to arouse be affinity between pitch pine worship impressionable impatient a always be nearly turned back after have opened door be confronted by half forgotten tawdry brilliance then motive have made forsake cool riverside desire to please father prevailed organ be blown by small boy with highly polished face who stood directly by player left hand since bellow be not powerful enough to supply lung of organ unless plied by energetic arm be often blown too breathed heavily into organist ear be still few minute to eight when martin came in found village school master preparing to begin that series of somewhat elementary harmony to be given vague title of voluntary slid quickly off seat with smile of welcome to other in searching whisper told what hymn be going to be what kyrie must be sung between commandment later information be given with self depreciatory blush for mr milton be not at mute inglorious composed chant hymn tune with so many accidental that choir quailed before garnished with accident martin glanced at organ stop there be bourdon sounded a if be playing pedal when be not be much in request open diapason flute cor anglais few others of more doubtful import added tremolo to certain other soft stop in curiosity a to what meant began first bar of prelude to lohengrin a tremolo seemed to convert other sound into distant bleating of sheep hastily put in five minute later vestry door in transept opposite opened curate followed by father came out mr challoner looked up a entered saw martin head above curtain of organ sudden warm tide of thankfulness love glowed in heart surely dear lad must not go very far wrong if sought strength here worshipper be few be not long before martin be out in sunshine again with joy exhilaration of earlier hour by river driven out of like most very emotional people religion be a essential to a breathing in be natural child like religion that spring primarily from huge enjoyment of beautiful thing in world for have to thank somebody though must be impossible to say that be not real to yet london fog so to speak must make pagan of for time being now though did believe in truth reality of service in have taken part deadly ugliness of church

hardly worth while doing ah do tell said helen think have influence with what on earth make think that quote be sure mean mimic doe to face too so why not behind back be quite admirable ah see have shown specimen dont talk wonderfully like influence one might a well sit down think how to influence flash of lightning helen considered moment well there be such thing a lightning conductor said besides there be time when martin isnt least like flash of lightning be often like stagnant pool dont recognise said frank probably have never seen have passed out of narrow path from church yard during way lying across open field lady sunningdale a habit be annexed frank a well a martin dear helen be too bad said a manuvred will have to go back immediately after lunch what be sunday school

marked type of face said frank in later life mutton chop whisker be why one always engages butler with mutton chop whisker be sure to be reliable truth telling be quite incurable so have certain claim to distinction martin listened to with something of air of parrot taking notice then turned to lady sunningdale do really mean that asked eagerly yes of course do seemed news to that playing piano must be taken seriously took seriously there be treasure come to meet be so hungry dont jump up suez canal darling chapter iv helen a lady sunningdale have mentioned have to start back again for sunday school soon after lunch have moved out under cedar on lawn when arose lord yorkshire also got up offered a escort be perfectly agreeable to girl though wondered exactly how high aunt claras eyebrow must rise if knew that niece might have be found walking on sunday afternoon with young man who must not possibly be brought under elastic bond of cousinship eyebrow of lady sunningdale who must be supposed be chaperone remained low level two started frank have be admirably entertaining in own way during lunch capping extravagancy of lady sunningdale with incongruity rivalled own giving wing of epigram paradox to speech helen have received very distinct impression that under flippancy martin imitated so faithfully there lay something of sterling very human solidity unknown factor interested quite apart from much more than conversational firework be a obviously superficial to essential a eyebrow moustache perhaps also knew unimportance of leading for certainly a soon a be alone such coruscation died slowly down seemed to helen that very pleasant mellow light restful after firework took place think be unkind of not to admit into school be saying why be to be debarred from knowledge of ur of chaldee geography have enormous fascination for can pore for hour over map of country have never seen almost certainly will never see just reading name of unheard of place with gusto ah feel that too said martin always tell be gypsy certainly want to wander to go on just for sake of going on exploration be point think be playing at exploration be so fascinating in map dictionary too new word best of new book with new idea there be one thing better said cap new book with new people new idea personal note entered however slightly into helen be silent moment ah new book implies new people said nothing can be more real than people in book quite true nothing can be le real than people in real life do know what mean one wonder with people if there be anybody there impression be that there often isnt have aunt helen began stopped feeling that be not quite kind to lay aunt clara on dissecting table frank guessed ah have three said perhaps mine will do helen laughed after moment went on believe that curiosity be convenient expression to sum up passion for new said be quite modern dont think at least that generation to aunt belong have with certain adorable exception like lady sunningdale anything like to extent have be good enough for grandfather be nearly good enough for father what be good enough for father be not nearly good enough for turned quick luminous glance at be talking about thing very much concerned ah be interesting said eagerly give more news of have struck too asked saying reminds that knew time know what mean yes think be case at rate take martin expect quite normal people well want to wander to experience everything be probably not really afraid of experience must conceivably happen to claim right to experience claim right to own individuality too seems to quite certainly ours only possession have be inalienable may lose everything else from character to teeth not individuality do remember how magda throw arm wide cry son io be that somewhat important point have never struck father mother poor thing thought be sort of be that bad grammar way lay at point through one of game cover sudden piteous cry dreadfully human arose from bush near path helen stopped with fright horror in face child be child asked nearly a bad though hare said pushed way through tangled bracken bramble in direction of sound in moment called to will come here miss challoner said come round to right be clearer path followed direction found kneeling few yard off holding in hand hare be caught by hind leg in horrible jagged toothed pull two side of trap apart said a quickly a can be quick poor brute be struggling so can hardly hold voice be so changed that must hardly have recognised be no longer low courteous sharp angry knelt down by exerting full strength did a bade leg be caught only by skin holding animal in one hand gently disimpaled where iron teeth have clutched just a be free sudden tremor of nerve passed through helen at humane surgery trap slipped from hand caught frank finger just at base of nail took breath quickly with pain let go of hare none worse ran off up winding path down have come must trouble to open trap once more said blood streaming from finger now voice be quite normal again oh im absolute fool cried helen oh im so sorry again wrenched trap open frank be rather pale laughed quite naturally thank so much said a released finger what strong hand have must dearly like to clap that thing on nose of brute who set what infernal contrivance how can men be such butcher will take show to uncle shook blood off finger bound tightly round with handkerchief oh lord yorkshire im so sorry said helen again be absolute born idiot how must be such fool laughed again dear miss challoner said nothing have happened can justify violent language besides must have be worth while to set poor jolly beast free at cost of real pain not just finger scratch well weve vindicated liberty of one individual anyhow did see eye said be like magda held bush back for to regain path youll have finger attended to said yes at once please ill ask to tie rather tighter if dont mind sight of blood always think blood be such beautiful colour chattered on to prevent apologising further one talk of blood red sunset admires dragon blood china when come to real article so many people shrink from thats better thanks thats excellent assure be nothing at manner be so entirely natural that there be nothing left for except to be natural too walked on out of cool green shadowed path flecked here there with sunshine filtered through tree met above into blaze brightness of field bordered church yard yes cry of magda for right to own individuality said at last generation have said will lead own life not life dictated to by other people wonder what will make of helen looked at again eagerly do mean that assertion of one own individuality be duty asked ah be difficult question certainly think there be be indication that one be supposed to play one hand for worth duty probably mean different thing by mean will of god for said simply paused at gate into church yard eye met seemed to frank that waited for answer with eagerness shook head dont mean that said held out hand to im sorry said so be very sorry indeed cant help eye wandered over wood behind then came back to face recognise that said good bye lord yorkshire thank so much for coming with please have finger attended to smiled at went up church yard path towards shining corrugated iron room a passed walk leading to vicarage met father be nearly ten minute late helen said know dear be sorry know be late too did not smile be detained by other parish work said be not amusing pray delay longer evening meal on sunday at vicarage be of strictly sabbatical order consisted of cold thing to eat waiting on part of servant took place late after evening church have to martin mind dreariness of own individuality to frank must have said undoubtedly have right marked off from other meal one be fatigued with exercise of day though be religious exercise have produced that fatigue brought with tendency made cheeriness difficult however cheeriness be not quality exactly encouraged by mr challoner on sunday so perhaps be for good evening martin who have spent whole afternoon at uncle coming back only just before supper be conscious of sunday easily got through be chattering on with good deal of rather thoughtless enjoyment about lady sunningdale now then mimicking with extreme fidelity more than usually incoherent speech of hers in wagner dog south italy husband egg shell china scandal be about equal ingredient without noticing somewhat ominous gravity be deepening on father face at length mr challoner spoke interrupting there dear martin be not that enough be sunday evening remember can not find something rather more suitable to day to talk about must scarcely like lady sunningdale who be so good to to know that imitate oh be always insisting must do to face said martin often do shriek be enough think martin said father again mindful of compact of evening before determining to be gentle have only just come back hour ago said martin gleam in eye suddenly quenched for knew what next question must be then did not go to church evening asked father have be twice now mr challoner have be from church to sunday school from sunday school to church practically since eight that morning not in least unreasonable that must be tired with so many busy hour in ill ventilated place on so hot day effect of tiredness on a on most of be shewn in tendency to when occurs in child elder label crossness answered in tone in very common emotion be apparent be not asking to justify absence said meal proceeded in rather dreary silence then two small incident happened martin dropped plate with hideous clatter moment afterwards upset wineglass have just filled with claret over table apologised wiped up unfortunately looking up saw father face wearing extraordinary expression of true christian patience for life of must not help giving sudden giggle of laughter must not possibly have helped if be going to be hung for must have laughed now laughter of other people when see anything in situation to provoke mirth be one of authentic trial of life especially if one half suspect a mr challoner did now that one be in manner inexplicable to one cause of be therefore highly to credit that remembering interview have have with night before must manage to keep inside lip word tingled on tongue of more than that be incapable must not just then be genial start subject of conversation must only just be silent martin must easily manage that last observation have not found favour held tongue ate large quantity of cold beef helen sitting opposite father in absence of aunt clara who be spending sunday away have also nothing apparently considered a suitable meal proceeded in silence then after long pause raised eye so happened to catch martin who be still struggling with unseemly mirth at moment also father looked up saw glance interpreted into glance of meaning pas between thing irritating to most placid temperament saw too corner of martin mouth twitching be too much will not have sort of thing child said voice rising sharply be extremely rude vulgar thing to exchange glance like martin merriment be struck a dead a beech leaf in frost be doing nothing of kind said temper flashing out helen looked up at same moment a looked up three looked up in fact be purely accidental helen be vexed that martin must speak so felt bound to endorse indeed father be so said again silence descended martin seeing that father sister have finished meat changed plate arranged second course after very long pause father spoke again must have thought child might have have something to say to in evening when have left alone day enjoying elsewhere have nothing happened to since breakfast be worthy of hearing martin intolerance of injustice again stung into ill advised speech tried to tell have be doing said stopped said be unsuitable handsome face flushed angrily then thing unprecedented happened beg pardon dear martin said father helen be engaged next morning in fragrant labour of picking sweet pea when maid came out of house to say that lord yorkshire be there father martin knew be out went in to see concealing from quite perceptible thrill of pleasure that announcement have given be a usual hatless hair be in golden disarray from breeze a went towards house took off gardening glove trying by sundry pat poke to give semblance of order be not very successful in need have be for looked to like beautiful wild flower when entered ought to apologise for coming at unearthly hour said for only excuse be that martin left book of music at chartries having idle morning thought must bring over helen be delighted to see since must have be ungracious to convey impression that morning visit be bore especially since be not took straightforward line how good of said finger held up bandaged hand be only reminded of by that said be so glad isnt extraordinary that one must be so awkward a be be always dropping spilling thing martin used to say be lovely day let go spill something be much worse than be really do come look at garden be really pretty be gardening asked glancing at glove mildly be really only picking sweet pea be so nice of more pick more flower picked up basket a walked out held up to how energetic of said ah what delicious smell that reminds of lot of nice

cambridge first must make everything so much easier so much happier for asked with marked intonation yes for of looked at gravely that sound worth while said let that string vibrate a be for moment two then passed on what becomes of liberty of individual talked of yesterday said to influence anybody always seems to slight infringement of right one imposes one personality such a be on ah in good cause to show stupidity of not passing examination surely be rule absolutely without exception that be always wise not to be stupid laughed helen with direct vivid personality seemed to unlike anybody else have ever seen with exception perhaps of twin extraordinary rather rare charm also of perfect naturalness not assumption of be hers also well be certainly hard to think of exception to rule said though one always distrust rule without exception seems so very unlikely that must exist considering how utterly different one person be from other on face of seems impossible have aroused train of thought in girl oh nothing must be impossible if one be wise said oh hate fool be one snipped viciously among sweet pea followed with success be sunday school very stupid asked sympathetically

nothing till be over strolled out on to lawn again sat down in warm shade of box hedge to read lady sunningdales ecstatic desultory rapture scene evening before followed by very restless night full of half conscious sleep wide eyed awakening have so tired that weariness have brought sort of healing of own dulling keenest edge of capacity for suffering breakfast have be meal of ghastly silence broken only by noise of knife fork loud in stillness father have only addressed directly once that to say that wished to see lord yorkshire when arrived breakfast over have written to martin to tell have happened then frank have come sort of awful impossible situation flapped like horrible bat about a waited pictured father insulting lover pictured frank stung by intolerable taunt striking

bleeding from thorn breathing inimitable odour of rose maid servant with message from vicar roused must please to come into study for moment got up with vague dreadful sense that have happened before must not remember outcome a walked across lawn terrible impossible picture again flashed through head like scene of magic lantern staring out of blackness aroma of tobacco a opened study door gave sudden willow thrill of comfort be scarcely endorsed by next impression mr challoner always courteous have doubt suggested one of excellent cigar frank have accepted good fellowship tacitly implied by act be here omitted vicar stood with back to fireplace flinty faced frank sat in big chair drawn close to writing table chair in time without number helen martin have sat together looking at bible picture after tea on sunday furniture of study aromatic smell of leather binding that hung there uncompromising tidiness of orderly severity picture of roman forum glass paper weight on table brought sudden rush of association into girl mind now that saw frank there too be so closely knit into fabric of life so intimately suggestive of stern tall figure by fireplace somewhere far away back in brain own voice in little childish pipe whispered to martin papa cross about something be took seat in silence silence lengthened ominously frank be looking at with quiet level gaze full of love full of pity turned eye away fearing that must scream with tear laughter if allowed to look at voice broke silence be quiet level also whole thing be deplorably well bred insult violence that have pictured

departure be shirking situation what made yield be suggestion that situation if not shirked might make really ill hurried interchange of telegram led to arrival at cambridge next evening expedition to day have started rather silently martin decided that a helen did not at present want to talk about affair best thing to do be to be completely futile foolish garrulous for year helen have adopted method of treating others depression be sufficient for one to say hump play fool for other to understand until further notice have to talk rot be device by way have ever employed when mr challoner be in similar mood must probably not have understood martin stood up in boat have stuck peered into water great thing remarked a white knight said be to guide against bite of shark have steel anklet ow why do take sharpest stone in world place where want to step im bleeding like pig stood precariously on other foot examined injury pig remarked fatuously have not yet have throat cut helen how fat

martin said father hardly speaks at have be very gentle since scene with frank yet even be hardly so bad a silence quietness now be suffering horribly too be sure of sometimes see looking at with sort of appeal in eye like dumb animal be worst of feel such brute suffer too said martin quickly know though uncle rupert lady sunningdale think be right that doesnt make feel le of brute besides there be right about cant give up father cant bear evening us prayer for jew turk infidel martin frowned be not good manner said with there oh martin manner dont come into truth of father belief be so overwhelmingly real to that cant think of anything else that light be so strong that can see nothing be soberly whole world to isnt a if frank be immoral said martin believe must mind that le said martin canoe round half submerged tree trunk where water sucked gurgled how unreasonable cried frank cant help want of belief can in degree help making brute of helen sat up suddenly causing boat to

restful mind be like cushion be quite soft if lean on make great dent in martin remained quite serious staring at water with vacant black eye poor father said at length just think helen must find awfully trying know continues to love so be that make so dreadful oh martin do get through stupid examination do turn out satisfactory a ive be so eminently reverse martin transferred gaze to sister really dont think there much chance of said of getting through might manage there be other thing career propose for instance he reconciled to said helen thats nothing new martin paddled on without answering helen looked at rather closely there be something more said what be be there not something more brought boat up to bank in byron pool where be to disembark yes there be said at least there may be there be use in telling now if happens if be sure be going to happen will tell beforehand promise that now think wont talk more about sudden uneasiness seized girl promise one thing said promise be nothing disgraceful martin looked rather injured have not be stealing hen said be compatible with highest character helen looked at moment in silence then im not afraid said will try not to guess at until tell afternoon be intensely hot having arrived here settled that boat under tree be far more to point than walking under blaze of sun helen merely reclined more recumbently on pile of cushion think will go for walk to morrow martin said instead of to day may be by way met last week that nice girl who be down at chartries on sunday when got into so many row what be name havent

question implied perception with helen have not credited aunt ah what difference there be between said quickly one action may so frightfully belie one one doe be so often parody of one best one worst part act while one best doe nothing turn face to wall like hezekiah be still kindly trying to explain to dear little dresden shepherdess one action be often like unsympathetic repetition of something one have really said give quite different meaning to do understand asked eagerly yes dear quite said lady susan surely everybody understands that same be business if be kind good at not to be harsh hard in what do suddenly helen eye be opened in flash saw that have be doing what deprecated hitherto have judged aunt susan merely by action with impatience be so very characteristic of have observed ordering dinner taking walk playing picquet otherwise having great deal of rather fragrant leisure with did nothing from have drawn conclusion that there be so to speak one really there only punctual little domestic automaton have be so taken up with fact that others did not understand did not allow for individuality that have a yet never taken trouble to consider whether others also have not own individuality equally to be respected aunt susan must have said offhand have none yet be referring to a mere commonplace what be still to helen blinding discovery went on talking with freedom certainty of being understood that associated only with beloved twin well be just that said one uncle david one may say be merely heartless merely selfish of to go own way to pay attention to wish ah be much stronger than of father may think that dont really know how strong objection to marriage be do know fully know knowing that knowing also that be father that owe nearly everything to that love love be going to do may say a choose throwing away love care have spent on repudiating debt to dont oh aunt susan dont throw away love repudiate debt be not fair to say that simply cant help must

wife mother know half of what woman longs to know half know dear helen be so very fine that be worth making little sacrifice for sacrifice asked girl yes can not tell in great language what mean because be not great in way so will give advice in one short word wait love be so good that will not spoil by being kept will only get more mature more exquisite in mean time will have proved good daughter too why why asked girl nothing will ever change what father feel about what feel only mean that for six month more for year more however long wait will go through dreadful day be awful at home aunt susan have idea how awful if must get better with waiting must do a suggest older woman be still smiling in habitual way helen have so often thought so meaningless so objectless now a looked saw there be very cheerful patience about smile somehow have not noticed before be true may not get better with waiting said for be possible may not will have done best not only thought best will have made action not a say parody of faithful expression of very best self will have put speech into unsympathetic mouth into mouth of fine actor current seized girl sweeping impetuously away laid hand on aunt knee be unhappy aunt susan asked oh hope not always thought be so contented so so occupied with duty do so well lady susan with only movement of impatience that have made perhaps for year swept hand away ah be because be young said because think that one who feel impulse must act on if want to realise life be not so know what have always called martin volcano dear volcano when feel pressure burst scatter burning ash anywhere everywhere say with great good humour be if want to burst must when see old woman like just getting through day work day after day week after week with little dinner party here little walk there little ordering of household through think be that be that life answer yes be life helen be silent moment suddenly aware that for time be perhaps wiser to listen attend than talk about own individuality tell tell said dear there be very little to tell said in heyday allow seems to for fact of other quiet people living feeling perhaps just a much a do because feel thing scream will learn to feel thing hope without screaming think young people tend to scream rather more than used call living own life that possibly may be mistaken anyhow misleading name for again helen have reply did not seem to at like want of individuality there be screaming be true assertion just a certainly there be something there to do justice respected that aunt paused also waiting for answer after minute spoke live own life then in talk with said let understand be quite true aunt susan have judged a if there be other view than mine while whole time complaint not that exactly understand have be that other people behave a if there be other view than about for instance didnt know didnt guess thought be be what appeared lady susan seemed to repent of hasty movement recaptured helen soft brown skinned hand yes dear be said quietly at least choose to let that be outward expression of expression by martin anybody may judge that certainly be affair nobody el ceased stroking helen hand moment looked up at dear must like to come inside moment there be only one thing there fill house oh helen if have have child at girl nature rose ah dear aunt dear aunt said lady susans pretty patient smile did not leave lip did tear come to eye sorrow be too old too eternally alive for to weep over now went on quite quietly if only have be given chance even to be made a unhappy a be making father dear must have loved so be denied by fault of mine so be learning hope not to grumble ah be hard sometimes think miss joy of love a must count joy helen le than miss what must count sorrow be opportunity dear possibility in self denial self abandonment be love triumphant not crowned with rose crowned with sharp beloved thorn tragedy of love be when there be none for whom can sacrifice stroked helen hand again gently make complete dear said there be entirely at one with remember soul be like rose tree think cut prune if be wise gardener for know that by cutting renunciation check hinder development encourage will be more fragrant fuller of blossom by might hastily say be piece of cruelty stunting of growth kind eye looked away from helen out over sun baked lawn bordered with flower bed in clearly to comply with preconceived notion of garden on part of gardener lobelia be set in formal row in front behind terrible speckled calceolaria hard crude geranium garden have often seemed to helen very typical of aunt be orderly completely conventional beyond dr arnes study window looked from red brick house across grass from where sat must see at table littered with book manuscript with head bent over work rising now then to consult book of reference took from volume lined wall sight also have often seemed to very typical cambridge professor be at work a indeed be most right proper that must be to be little life be bounded with book on side stretched limitless desert of particle chorus metre now for first time helen knew how erroneous judgment with regard to aunt susan have be for real heart beat there be somebody somebody very distinct individual who ordered dinner played picquet life be not negative emotionless be only own obtuseness of perception have so labelled instead be sad in spite of quiet cheerfulness be a sad a level ray of sun striking hazily across lawn a sad a grey spire of king rose against clear hot blue of sky pathos of suddenly moved be that that good fairy have brought to aunt cradle just to grow quietly gently old who might have be so fine missing joy riot of life missing too crown of womanhood to live to live demand be battering at door with buffet made panel start yet here be dear aunt who have heard often same insistent visitor old sweet unembittered though have never be given to to let in knowing have missed yet not soured at having missed oh aunt susan cried forgetting forgetting else in young creature somewhat insolent pity for old be not too sad be not too terribly sad be that everybodys fate just to get older older then with strong unconscious egotism of year said will happen to too what sadness yes dear helen hope so woman be worth very much until have be through good deal of sadness great deal of wanting what can not get hope will go through dear if turn bitter under have almost better not have lived certainly have better die for death be better than bitterness if take love sadness be inseparable from life without bitterness strengthens clean will certainly emerge from far finer creature than if have never be through emerge ah may last to day of death what then what doe matter there be long silence shadow grew lengthened on grass a helen sat unseeing absorbed gazing wide eyed in front of felt ashamed humiliated at own blindness have thought of aunt a dweller in valley while be climbing snowfield far above with eager untiring foot now at summit near saw sitting quiet patient figure so high up that have not seen before then in gentle voice aunt susan broke in on reverie there dear said sun have set let go in do tell helen before go home what decide to do about very difficult choice be before of course will not give lord yorkshire up think must be very wrong be hasty judge quickly do confide in again if can be great privilege know for old people to be confided in by young come be time to dress there be few people to dinner ah martin come too have quite forgotten dear how careless must go see if there be enough to eat helen rose gave great tempestuous hug dear dear said then aunt susan after excursion into reality hurried to kitchen excellent housekeeper again there must have be something in conjunctivity of twin except indeed at vicarage at chartries disposed beholder to indefensible levity london have felt spell even cambridge appeared that home of sweet sober seriousness went little off head about spell whatever be lay in combination helen alone be true must rouse that impulse of social gaiety be evoked so easily by girl beauty high spirit martin must make other people enjoy by sight of own enormous power that way be when be together that resistance be clearly hopeless be worthy of record to night after dinner dr arne professor of poetry with respective wife twin played ghost in garden why elderly people did must not have told martin proposed ghost helen explained in three sentence studious shade be awakened appalled by wild shriek for night be dark moonless while five out of six foolish people hid in asparagus bed behind tree trunk in wood shed in other black dreadful place professor of poetry selected by lot be in honour bound to make complete circuit of garden conscious that at moment ghost with curdling yell might spring out on even worse scuttle quickly up behind perhaps worst of might suddenly be conscious of small crouching figure by side accompanied in awful silence ready to break forth into who knew what hideous babbling speech thus one eye have to be kept on dreadful object while simultaneously whole attention have to be on alert in case of new reverent from bush professor be man on whom a far a be known imputation of cowardice have never yet be laid at first attempt to make black circuit of garden found must not possibly face corner by wood shed nerve being already utterly unstrung by vague form groaned among gooseberry bush paused while still few yard distant from dreadful being then fled with flying coat tail back to house where in safety of lit drawing room wiped dew of strangling anguish from forehead called lamentably on courage not glimmer from worm in darkness thick hot half moaned to oh will never do be aware be probably only dr arne be not really frightened of come come with heart in mouth set out again on fascinating abhorred errand murmuring again in darkness thick hot in darkness thick hot in dark oh dear what be that poor professor suffered for momentary panic for helen have in hour of weakness in drawing room changed place to behind large flower tub have concealed nobody before consequently approached inattentively without caution misgiving to be confronted shuddering by flapping form gasped panted made fruitless appeal dear miss helen said cant go on really think must be right work will suffer be dr arne among gooseberry bush be martin think must run a fast a dr arne if hoot of unearthly laughter assailed on other side afterwards played dumb crambo lady susan in college cap dust coat of martin be alfred letting cake burn at time dr arne found to be cleopatra with helen a mark antony chose dress from helen wardrobe be much too large for with immense care subsequently applied paper weight in form of snake to bosom professor of poetry became prize fighter wife godly virtuous woman hitherto unexpectedly turned out to be peace murderer did deed of blood with immense gusto paper knife yet time nobody asked why did silly thing twin have said be to be so be enough at order too seemed a if golden gate of youth have swung open tired patient elderly wise be bidden to enter once more be child again helen visit to cambridge have be restricted by statute of limitation in regard to time day passed on vague few night growing to week week to magnified fortnight for quiet uneventful hour in except when twin be with even ticking of clock seemed muffled have extraordinary growing charm for since have learned that behind outward placidity in aunt there lay very real inward life in longed without possibility of satisfaction suffered without bitterness somehow to girl seemed to lift up consecrate aunt susans homely little employment so sweetly patiently performed became symbol sign of very beautiful character that helen have thought dull unperceptive unemotional be now lit from within a be by uncomplaining cheerfulness gave such gentle unquestioning welcome to limitation set about for lady susan so niece have now learned have not from own defective eyesight set horizon so close about circumstance childlessness have imposed that being so have taken up place in narrowed circle with resignation so cheerful that must scarcely be called by rather depressing name in fact gentle old lady be put on pedestal in girl mind offering of incense be made position now then found slightly embarrassing for helen in first moment of understanding in reaction from previous hasty mistaken judgment be one torrent of warm hearted sympathy be disposed to magnify into heroism performance of common task just because have before labelled trivial from home must begin taking up own little burden at once there came word for wrote regularly to father morning after morning passed bringing post still answer came to once saw among letter laid out for aunt susan one addressed in brisk scholarly handwriting must not help glancing at aunt face a read said nothing to helen replaced letter in envelope with troubled little sigh martin also knew have heard from there have be no message for mention even of omission intentional disregard of though hurt made sorry also not for herself for be inhuman knew that be depth earnestness of feeling about engagement that made inhuman on other hand heard constantly from frank who hinted that if not day at rate season might be ever so vaguely indicated to must look forward term be drawing to close martin must go home in few day time be understood that helen must go with a day of departure got near knew that decision must be made so far a concerned a to whether must put off marriage for definite time do daughter part to father living at home obeying performing parish duty a before making amende a far a must for great act of disobedience be going to commit practically did not see use of good a far a must judge must come of yet in way aunt susan be right meaning of sentiment of be sound must not be easy must be full of sustained effort of sustained self repression intercourse must be crammed with misunderstanding atmosphere must be full of frictional disturbance saw there must be certain moral gain to set against also too have very sensible weight with there must be gain to in completeness of aunt have spoken ever since have consciously woke to own individuality eagerness for own improvement enlargement have be of very vivid sort perhaps most excellent way of have be here set before to compass that not by working for by apparently limiting maiming discouraging be very simple very elementary suggestion yet have never occurred to in connection be well le crude than other method evening before departure took opportunity provided by dr arnes going to chorus metre after tea to talk to aunt again have be chilly day touched with autumnal sadness of early falling leaf early falling dusk window pane streamed though be still august fire burned in grate sat down on floor by aunt chair father have not written to once since came here said have written to to martin know there have never be message to dont say in complaint aunt susan what be one to do when happens lady susan shut book be reading have be expecting helen to mention be unwilling to open subject know have not dear said think very wrong of have told so dont let hurt helen if other people yes misbehave there be never anything to be done except to go on behaving one self never let what other people do hurt for nothing can really hurt except what do ah in way have done said girl at least be in consequence of what have done father be wrong think said lady susan with gentle decision now dear a be going away to morrow want to ask something go home with martin do not then have made up mind yes said will not give up frank will put off till next may of course if wish be absolutely free ah said aunt susan gently be likely must wish that suppose helen laughed well no not very till then will live at home if father will let try in way to please voice trembled little hope will accept that said hope will be good to forgive lady susan stroked hair in silence moment have chosen right dear said chapter ix helen be sitting again at deal table in room trying to balance account of quarter money box cheap not strong probably made in germany with florid ornament of tin tacked on round maw stood open by left hand on table be heap of money consisting chiefly of penny small silver coin subscription to room being threepence quarter while by right hand be pile of equally mean bill chiefly ending with halfpenny for brown holland cotton slate pencil needle gum there be discrepancy somewhere of ninepence add subtract a must ninepence held ground like remnant of old guard have be only deficit remedy from own pocket must have be easy unfortunately there be ninepence too much though conscience must not have made protest at supplying did not permit to pocket to forge non existent bill time natural impatience mixed luckily with certain sense of humour said to be possible to conceive le profitable way of wasting time than in trying to make ninepence vanish father however with attention to detail be so marked characteristic of always looked over account afterwards whether there be discrepancy of thousand pound penny made difference principle of admitting discrepancy be equally dangerous in case twin have be at home in state of total eclipse for two day of ominous parental silence mr challoner a usual be busy helen be busy also for after absence there be more than enough at present to occupy day have not yet broached subject be at root of silence until sky cleared little felt absolutely unable to do so father also have said nothing about ate drank weather be mentioned danger of trouble in east mr challoner except when read prayer have hardly said dozen word in helen presence be good night good morning be bad martin also be so to speak in prison though not like sister in condemned cell read demosthenes in father study while latter be writing sermon fell asleep be detected awoke wrote futile supererogatory set of greek iambic containing several false quantity form of aorist previously unknown very interesting morning helen have received letter from frank troubled for pressed where have only hinted before for definite sort of date reasonably enough saw cause for delay knew that in spite of father feeling have accepted devotion be hers waiting for to reward tone be not querulous if have be letter must write must have be le difficult be simply sincerely trustful before wrote must talk to father must be put off longer for moment however sad mechanic exercise of account occupied attention though superficial brain be employed on addition have work before be round wall floor aspect of room neat new brown holland cover of library took that part of brain that really felt lived back to day when sat there last map of geological stratum be there too with auriferous belt remembered very well frank word about there be gold bearing vein in be set to do trouble be to find yes indeed be trouble did not rebel against superfluous ninepence except indeed humorously what seemed to such hard barren rock be living in hopeless silence conscience whole sense of moral obligation have accepted principle indicated to by dear aunt sofa cushion no longer of wider self completion to be attained by behaving rightly in relation of life at present have be throwing good money after bad dutiful daughter have come home more notice be taken of than of mended window pane mr challoner always opened door smartly thus when outer door of room gave on to small lobby where wet coat be hung gave quick rattle of latch knew with same certainty a have known crisp foot on gravel who came have finished account said cant get quite right father said think have bill receipt have not said where be helen resented silently shadow of appeared in face voice be here said have ninepence more than must mr challoner sat down counted up silver penny arranging in neat shilling heap with care must have given to total of million then rejecting addition added up receipted bill mistake one of pure carelessness be patent that balance said perhaps have better do account for future if have to do in long run may a well do at once instead of wasting time over helen stood up resentment shewing little certainly if prefer said did not answer ran metal clip neatly through receipted bill swept coin back into money box then turned to quickly what do intend to do helen asked a father think have right to ask since have shewn sign of wishing to tell gulf between seemed to at moment immeasurably wide tone be harsh cruel cut cut like blunt knife with sawing tearing father dont speak to like said cant bear doe good be trying be going to continue trying to do duty to for one moment sternness vanished from face be going to give up asked be going to live quietly here if will have for next six month said doing work in parish just a usual during time will not see frank if wish will not even write to except just once sat down again opposite want to do something for be hard for said want to make believe that be trying to be good daughter to know disagree vitally essentially be that reason why dearness of human relation must be diminished voice sank looking at face must see that momentary brightness a asked last question have vanished again sat looking not at out of window without replying father said gently have spoken to shook head then looked at be useless said then suddenly chilling reserve silence of last day gave way like ice before south wind god said speaking more to than to what have done have done have come for dreadful fault of mine of be ignorant life helen have tried to train teach in knowledge fear of god a see have done best according to light never once to knowledge have not prayed day that blessing must guide illuminate step take can not believe that be difficulty that try to follow will in be impossible that broke off with sudden helpless raising of hand indescribably pathetic god help said there be long silence finger clenched unclenched a sat staring dismally out of window life a have said with absolute honesty have tried to bring helen up in knowledge fear of god decision of hers from now realised be powerless to move be like overwhelming blow struck at from dark must not understand must not even conjecture in vaguest way what meant how be meant to take in sorrow renunciation bereavement be at rate possible to acquiesce in there being design that child must do be inexplicable must not be will of god something of helen read in face saw for first time fully how blow have staggered strength have given way under vehemence anger be dead dead too be hope that must come round to be helpless strangeness of in one so certain so accustomed to go without hinderance obstacle along straight road of god fearing life touched with profound pity so that for moment have known decision flickered wavered like candle flame blown about in draught questioned whether such suffering must be right whether caused must be justifiable whether at cost to herself must permit to be be like suffering of animal blind uncomprehending thing intolerable animal suffered be strong man wise father sat down on edge of table beside oh poor father poor father said looked at with wretched semblance of smile ah be not point helen said what feel pain be nothing nothing why feel be everything dear oh poor girl blind blind then at last that tie between father daughter mother son one of immutable indestructible thing of world stirred vibrated made music for moment across infinite gulf between spirit hand met dear girl said will be delightful to have at home be afraid that happy day of work side by side in home be over thank for helen father blesses for stop with a long a can how

be good to long for day be going to be so awfully dreary without helen walked through wood to day where set hare free will walk there day looked at geological map with auriferous reef in martin be here letter be not difficult to write though final determination to write be so hard that when came to paper ink sat long with pen undipped unable to begin memory of bewildered misery in father face morning a sat looking out of window in room have given real sense of responsibility towards be business to find anodyne for perhaps proof before eye kept there day after day week after week that wanted to do best might serve anyhow at moment have awakened humanity fatherhood hand have reached to across gulf two puzzled blind folk have clasped hand in darkness be waiting for frank answer difficult knew so well be not disappointed here very brevity of reply be honey to dearest must do a must do magda say so so do be rather low though tell not to be frank be then when have made difficult determination frank have so ungrudgingly consented that helen difficulty began day be endless series of infinitesimal knot not to be cut to be patiently cheerfully unravelled singly must tackle have to avert eye from future for series of knot stretched into dim distance day too there be with desire to see frank just once to see perhaps cry little on shoulder day too there be face of father always sunless always grave have never be true be other than austere in domestic life then helen have always known how deep be love for now seemed to sometimes a if be trying to stifle extinguish knowing a did there be soon to be irrevocable rupture between rupture must divide further than death divide be schooling to get used to a man may school when see one love in pang of mortal illness to adjust beforehand to loss be coming mark of suffering too be pathetically plain again again asked whether have not only increased by doing cost so much be only impulse of barren sentimentality that have followed be like surgeon who give ineffective ansthetic must not deaden mitigate wrench shock be coming encouragement must find be small be that in case have done what be most difficult what seemed not only to to aunt susan to be right a such be fully accepted by lover yet what if after be mere senseless mutilation of objectless asceticism be doubt that day after day most troubled her have seen least sign of bud on barren stem must have be much more than content day became week there be still none not even return of moment tenderness father have shewn at first talk must not see that practical good be coming of renunciation like wrecked sailor on raft watched a for sail for horizon distant sign that father accepted marriage gave credit though did not want credit herself only longed for evidence of for doing best there be such sign continued to use prayer for turk infidel heretic what made thing worse be that martin beloved twin with whom disagreement be thing unthinkable radically disapproved of what be doing disapproval be afraid be terribly practical namely that be quite certainly no use two thing however after three week of what seemed fruitless endeavour kept to one be letter from aunt susan to whom have sent despairing sheet containing memorable sentence god doe not always pay on saturday helen have said other be innate pride that forbade to accept defeat here feared also to lose respect not only of father of frank yes darling tried imagined saying found be doing good that must say be somehow intolerable to might be must not be feeble lame blind be hated of david soul seemed to very legitimate object of detestation must not give thing up because mistrusted power of doing thus apparent failure consumed with divine confidence of youth le successful seemed to be more spurred on to strive sense of right have told when made decision that must thus be doing best judgment be arrived at coolly sanely present practical ill success of argued nothing against principle then came crowning despondency agitation in something martin told after returned from visit to lady short history of visit however claim episodic precedence lady sunningdale have sent motor over from fareham to fetch martin when arrived about tea time rushed straight out on to lawn to find only encountered chilling look of several total stranger who be talking about fiscal problem seemed surprised if not pained to see be discouraging be wondering what place there be to flee unto when footman came out after to say that ladyship be in bedroom wished to see there immediately martin must not help giving little giggle of amusement at footman preceding upstairs threw open door announced room be large very rose coloured on principle of lady sunningdales famous maxim bedroom must be optimistic be reclining on optimistic silk coverlet of bed with shoe off blind down be that monster asked be absolute wreck yes pull up one blind sit down at respectful distance martin must promise to play absolutely time be here like barrel organ will die will send footman to after time with twopence on tray order that be not to move on house be crammed with perfectly dreadful people can not imagine why asked hope have not brought gun because shant let go shooting will have to talk to day except when be playing dont tread on suez canal youll be drowned frank be here stella otherwise dear why be politician so impossible why be helen behaving like mad woman really thought have more brain martin have pulled up one blind during revealed room there be pink silk wall on be several picture of lady sunningdale of not very recent date pink carpet white furniture particularly large pink bed lady sunningdale fenced like egypt on one side by suez canal on other by sahara be lying propped up by quantity of huge pillow cushion french book with yellow cover bestrewed bed fragment of chewed page suggested that dog have eaten one like jezebel leaving only few very indigestible piece french maid hovered uneasily about toilet table appeared to be putting thing in drawer considered a wreck finally lady sunningdale looked particularly large sea worthy miss plympton asked martin in extremely disengaged voice with face suddenly infected by prevailing optimism lady sunningdale drew conclusion before most people must have arrived at data yes ever since played to at chartries have be trying to learn merry peasant said be not getting on very well art be long be not so be life too long think sometimes dear rest of talk about fiscal problem what theyve shot even frank appears to be vaguely interested in free trade free food free drink something be deplorable of expect here immediately bedroom be only place where one can be free from intolerable bore there be three three cabinet minister in house really politics ought to be considered dangerous habit like morphia in fact there be very great resemblance between be drug send to sleep habit grows on one have to take more more result be death of intellect be quite a lamentable a death of body render far more tiresome to other people for after when one body be dead one be put away people whose intellect be dead be not put away at pervade society there be one in world so lost a intellectually lost how big hell must be talking of how be father what bear martin have settled in rose coloured chair gave great shout of laughter suddenly checked quite well said always be yes be so like said really have strain of insanity in very extraordinary family darling did kick oh sahara naughty book hadnt read commandez du th hortense so convenient doesnt know word of english did ever see such murderish looking woman can make hat out of tooth brush waste paper day will kill for diamond find out afterwards that be paste then will be sorry so will do attend monster can tell why helen head over ear in love with be why brought together must behave like shutting up with bear dreadful aunt of yours who play patience frank think in confused way that be so beautiful look so funny when helen name be mentioned rather like widower who hears hymn tune in four sharp on sunday evening so frightfully old fashioned that sort of thing two find sort of spiritual thrill in standing hundred mile apart shouting caro mio o carissima to other at top of voice cant bear sort of platonic love yes challoners be mad if becky sharp lived with savonarola in grand piano must find little challoner cry on drawing room carpet one morning why becky sharp inquired parenthetically only to add little joie de vivre imputation on moral lady sunningdale struggled to sitting attitude on bed several french book flopped to ground be instantly worried by dog zhr rebours flew in gnawed fragment about room martin agreed with lady sunningdale in view took of helen conduct felt bound to defend sister against so wild attack anyhow shes doing difficult thing because think right said give credit for difficulty difficult cried lady sunningdale there be merit in doing difficult thing just because difficult might just a well try to stand on head in drawing room say to wondering guest admire please though foolish be difficult be only accomplished by prayer fasting be that profane think must be because father be nonconformist whenever say anything without thinking be nearly sure to be reminiscence of unhappy childish day come out of bible doesnt prove that thing be least worth doing because be difficult be standing on head then in parsonage too yes amount to said martin with moral purpose there be discreet tap at door hortense entered with tea ah muffin said lady sunningdale in mollified tone under piece please martin how delicious though be not cynical always little distrust moral purpose if do thing with moral purpose usually mean that do because if didnt must be uncomfortable inside good people be such coward be afraid of little pain in conscience to avoid that go act in foolish antiquated manner one say what saint then out of nebulousness like gathering cloud of thunder storm there leaped sudden flash like lightning rather like genius be doing sacrifice to ideal doesnt fully believe in said helen doesnt believe in certain thing a father doe else must never marry frank at must have screamed loudly for help when asked instead of saying yes sacrifice therefore isnt quite sincere then sort of confusing roar of thunder followed marring sharp conclusiveness of lightning can not bear seeing people making mess of life said be such pleasure to see make really clean job of yes why continue poking round in parsonage when have made up mind to go away be like ordering carriage to go to station then for reason saying that will go by next train have shattered happy parsonage life be feebly trying to pick up bit instead of ringing bell leaving room be silly ah helen be not silly said brother did not say that yes slap sahara twice hard said be doing silly thing now be silly hardly ever do silly thing yes come in must be frank sunningdale never knock nobody else ever come in frank appeared at door be sent for said apologetically ah martin that rang true be brother be behind romantic touch did not escape though rather irritated lady sunningdale personally disliked romance on general ground that in real life be old fashioned to two completely satisfactory method of expression be melodrama farce frank greeting to martin hand on shoulder linked arm be romantic just little tiresome frank what have be doing with day cried have not set eye on of course if do prefer golf chinese labour to inspiring conversation yes help to tea muffin there be frank still lingered by martin how be said be well message for of course there cant be meant that

to groaning suppose mind hurt a say he quite well did say must deceive people to make comfortable asked martin yes at least hope must challoners be slightly cracked think owe vividness to that helen father see thing out of real proportion have ever seen aunt susan asked martin be dreadful not at not vivid be who really made helen go home live there then aunt susan be very stupid person said lady sunningdale dear there be only two sort of people in world clever stupid nobody be good nobody be bad at least may be for that matter goodness badness in have result there be nothing more colourless than moral quality be only brain that give colour to do choose friend because be good be sorry for of course dont want to choose because be bad one be a idiotic a other brain there be nothing else in world very little of moral quality be like corset if be tight hinder free development if be loose might a well not wear at lady sunningdale have taken foot off bed during remarkable speech looked more closely at martin forehead be bulging martin said hair be dipping like plume into left eye that happens notice when play mean be thinking so be thinking now what be martin did not deny soft impeachment yes be thinking said dont imagine that what be thinking about must interest in least lady sunningdale made gesture of despair havent grasped elementary fact said that anything anybody think about be deeply interesting event of world who said take place in brain sahara darling be not mutton bone be ring good to eat suez how tiresome hadnt read page of yes what be thinking about martin martin lit cigarette from smoked down stump before replied be thinking whether be going to join roman church said lady sunningdale gave deep contented sigh thats sort of thing really like remarked poor bear now why why why do want to do yes turn sahara out frank be so restless suez canal always follows shut door now close eye think martin for minute if like then tell why frank said under breath thought so returned to chair almost on tiptoe martin did not close eye at looked at frank know why expect said though havent hinted to till moment why be frank well in one word beauty said lady sunningdale be completely bewildered incense virgin mary suggested vaguely martin frowned for moment looked exactly like father ah what be use of telling if say that sort of thing asked really havent idea said did say anything dreadful frank speak know said never know what be talking about when begin to talk be only guess have guessed right believe be always right well get on somebody said lady sunningdale with show of impatience be beauty said frank knowing be love love be duty smiled across to martin quoted that know to helen said on day father found mill on floss what did find mill on asked lady sunningdale oh see george eliot isnt how dull read book of hers once scene from something thought so like father house martin be beauty be must have said almost everything be ugly anyhow what have got to do with pope lady sunningdales discursiveness reader will have noticed be liable to put in appearance at time even when be really interested explained by fact that never thought about le than three thing at once consequently when opened mouth of three be liable to make escape yes be said martin answering frank last remark be christian can not longer be of church leaf out beauty from worship why if love thing if believe in thing must approach through beauty seems to paused moment then word came a have never come before sudden clearness of vision be saw own thought with precision must at moment of self revelation delineate very accurately why when one friend come to see one said one make room tidy if came to see at cambridge lady sunningdale must take down pipe rack put in bedroom must sweep hearth must give clean tablecloth for lunch must get flower for table must practise something thought must like to hear play must in small way put beauty at disposal at yours put ugliness away take chartries church how beastly martin paused moment frank be observing quietly from underneath hand for afternoon sun be pouring light from window where martin have pulled up blind full into eye boy seemed to at moment suddenly to have grown up become vivider to have thought for crude elementary unconvincing might be be original martin next word endorsed opinion certainly be not child longer how dare how dare cried wheezy organ awful wood work terrible window be there anything more hideous in england than chartries church unless be county jail for confinement of prisoner because be for god will anything do there certainly be crudity here frank felt that though lady sunningdale did not for indifference on religious matter be perhaps profoundest thing about have enquired rejected have never even looked in direction martin have enquired too found awful presence be ashamed to call in old clothes so to speak what be at service of god be best be not best be insult face flushed suddenly why if church be room came to see must cover up stained glass said must make decent must must paused for moment then found word must have form said must give politeness must not say know will understand sit with in back bedroom slop about brush anything because god understands be to say anything will do why when queen came to chartries have four course for lunch red carpet broke off suddenly do understand what mean demanded of frank frank understood perfectly for have known long time what martin have only just learned that form governed life for did always have done everything believed in a well a must do lavishing thereon pain trouble at command with instinctive open handed generosity of love pain did not bestow grudgingly count expenditure be worth doing be more than worth pain must possibly bestow on that impulse lie at root of artistic temperament endless trouble for ever so minute perfection ever so infinitesimal finish frank like equitable judge have to state other side of case to martin what will father say to asked using most commonplace phrase martin looked at quickly same a said about helen remarked lady sunningdale must not help little spurt of laughter repartee be so exquisitely simple checked at once too awful for said first helen then martin do think ought dont know must said martin doesnt hurt to play creaky organ stained glass window dont hurt frank have seen further than how necessary do feel asked that be whole point be a necessary a a chopin door opened hortense entered sept heures et demi madame said lady sunningdale started to foot monster must go at once cried yes dear martin be too interesting will play to evening wont so glad must come did ever see such mess a dog have made thing dont hurt more than brushing one teeth hurt though can not help being terribly inartistic performance ought to consider helen a well not that matter what church one belongs to a far a can see sunningdale might become parsee to morrow if must make happier only there really be sun in england so dont see what must worship how nice always to sit in sun say one be worshipping yes extraordinary boy fancy being religious in little inside must never have guessed got quite pink when talked about chartries church most religious people be so dull be that dreadful thing to say too dinner at eight take shew room frank lady sunningdale certainly have knack of bringing quite unique combination of people together of making behave quite characteristically of respective self may partly account for behaved with such child like naturalness that be quite impossible for with to be self conscious a hostess be quite incomparable for rejecting known convention be supposed to be binding on very responsible class instead of behaving to of guest a if be mere unit in colourless mass known a society talked direct unmitigated shop appropriate to to night there be present among guest traveller in central thibet to

violently when word pig chicago be mentioned german princess who when directly questioned seemed doubtful a to where husband principality lay be corrected on subject by astronomer owing perhaps to advent of twin name by lady sunningdale referred to martin though have previously confessed that found guest dreadful to night went bravely ahead steering triumphant course over shoal where grounded

problem in cabinet minister laid down incontrovertible opinion then golf let into circle again story of golfer being carried off first tee after futile drive expiring hour later from operation for appendicitis while wife be being confined be charmingly to point in fact desultory rapidity of conversation left nothing to be desired be due to lady sunningdales inimitable plan of talking shop to shop keeper later martin played there be bridge lord sunningdale a usual went to sleep on awaking revoked subsequently explaining revoke to satisfaction of everybody partner who remained dissatisfied to last woman took bed candle men gravitated to smoking room though since one have previously smoked in drawing room seemed unnecessary fact be one without exception men left alone leave drawing room soon again after long day shoot smoking room yawned to bed cabinet minister traveller astronomer being gone frank be left alone with martin there be design in matter hated going to bed a much a detested getting up be of sorry to have opportunity of more talk frank have got up from chair on last exit took whiskey soda moved to fireplace lady sunningdale be extraordinarily clever remarked can no more discus anything with than must with dragon fly be always darting martin laughed go on then said frank sat down be determined martin asked think so dont see what else can do asked question before dinner didnt have time to answer be a much to a chopin why do repeat asked martin doe not seem to apt how can make such comparison easily must have thought again martin likeness to father started to face say easily said take then what must do if in order to get helen have to tell real mortal mean lie sort of lie must make blush in dark like be yes just like must cant tell why dont know whether know except a regard what said in lady sunningdales room that if in anything in worship above be beauty necessary be true be only sort of symbol of what feel other people feel differently be le materialistic than ugliness doesnt get in way if happen to be gifted cursed with artistic temperament lord how priggish sound dont see how can help demanding beauty in service of what be sublime never knew thought about thing said frank rather lamely martin snapped finger impatiently more fool old chap said same dont see why must have so ill apologise probably thought that because one have high spirit really fine capacity for playing fool also certain leaning towards piano never took anything seriously did till lately in case be really so much more concern than anybodys ive got to lead own life not to be dragged about like sheep must paused moment have only given external instance of what seems to underlying principle said difference in form between two church be illustration of desire of roman church to enlist beauty in service of god that desire be spirit of romanism now english people take round be extremely deficient in sense of beauty utterly blind to importance in church think really seems to slightly inappropriate roman church be mystical romantic poetical english be puritan ugly literal do know a soon a began to think found must not stand puritanism heaven how have jawed martin got up briskly from chair with unmistakable air of closing that particular topic in youthful boyish manner there lurked great deal of masterfulness who came in contact with might be disposed to call obstinacy though never adopted attitude so ungraceful a of donkey with leg planted outwards towards four quarter of compass effect on such a pulled be about same if chose must smilingly refuse to go in direction certainly until effort to move be relaxed a knew a frank suspected there be just one person in world with whom hitherto have never adopted attitude be father never yet in life have set will calmly in opposition to mr challoners a have once told father be frightened at feared anger there be certainly no one else in world whom must radically disagree with yet obey

where feeling be concerned expression of have to be made with excellence obtainable be not able to do badly what appealed to neither must watch take part in thing be badly done growth that have made

reverie active mind pursue activity without challenge annoyance from visible object pre eminently also be room instinct with form nothing there must have be otherwise karl stood in front of fireplace for minute opening shutting hand be little cramped little tired with long practise have just finished mind too be little tired with monotony of work for three hour at piano have be no glorious excursion into sun lit land of melody repetition of about twelve bar told from couple of passage out of waldstein sonata be to play next week at last of four concert in st james hall though perhaps not dozen people in crowded hall must be able to tell difference between execution of dozen bar a played yesterday a must play now must not have be pianist be if have be possible for not to attempt to make perfect whether took week month need of perfection never say will do until achievement can not be bettered be ruling instinct to besides to just now presence of one out of possible six auditor who might be able to tell difference be more to than rest of ringing hall sometimes almost wished have never seen martin never at rate consented to give lesson for in strange way pupil be becoming master rusoff be conscious that lad personality never so vivid a when be at music be beginning to cast sort of spell over own brilliant incisive full of fire a own style be be conscious when martin played certain thing that own rendering far more correct far more finished though might be be elderly even frigid compared to other glorious quality of exuberant youth thing in most artist be beginning to pale little before have attained to level of technical skill be necessary to pianist of claim to high excellence be in martin at height noonday while really seemed sometimes to master that have be perhaps in cradle perhaps a bent unwilling head over crabbed intricacy of demosthenes somehow mysteriously initiated into secret of technique anyhow facility that art of first mastering then concealing difficulty to most pianist only come a have come to through month year of unremitting toil seemed to be natural to pupil martin have only got to be told what to do if be in obliging humour did difficulty of execution simply did not seem to exist for immensely struck a karl rusoff have be with performance last summer at lord yorkshire felt now that have not then half fathomed depth of power lay pellucid like great ocean cave full of changing light shadow suffused to depth with sunlight by very clearness brightness baffling eye sought to estimate depth temperament that one thing can never be taught karl rusoff knew have never come across temperament artistically speaking approached be indeed not le than perfect from point of view sensitive impressionable divinely susceptible to beauty hating here largely be personal charm of to master hating second rate especially skilful second rate with glorious intensity at thought karls rather grim face relaxed into smile a remembered how martin have sat down to piano other day in sudden burst of handel hatred with ten finger sounded like twenty strangely unmelodious voice sounded like crow ranged from high falsetto treble to note of kettledrum have given rendering of hail stone chorus so ludicrous yet catching so unerringly cheap tumult of toy storm in teacup that have sat laughed till eye be dim why asked martin dramatically in conclusion did that german spend long abandoned life in england because knew sir knew that in other country must have be kindly firmly put over border now will sing hallelujah chorus besides facility in technique power of perception of beauty in many of finest mind requires year of delicate cultivation before becomes at mature certain be already present in martin in apparent fulness of growth be already instinct exerting asserting not through habit through intuition be so much dominating ingredient in composition known a martin challoner that almost everything else might be considered a mere by product whole will whole energy be at service when once called to a have called to in adoption of roman faith seemed have to obey must not question be to law that must not transgress charm of karl rusoff felt almost too keenly for peace of mind knew to be extremely dangerous to exultant beautiful mind be entrusted with responsibility that entailed to fashion to train to prune with true honest modesty recognised how menial so to speak work in regard to martin be did not lessen responsibility be to rate at highest gardener who have to bring exquisite plant into fulness of flower to feed to water to cut above to let air sun great natural influence have way with did not believe in forced growth in sheltered cultivation a have told martin in summer emotion pain joy so long a be not sensual be proper food richer experience be richer must music be karl have already seen first clear endorsement of view in circumstance attending martin secession to roman church did not know with exactitude of detail what have passed between father though painfulness of have knocked martin completely up for time what have foreseen have come true must hardly help inwardly rejoicing at even cruelty of mr challoners attitude to son so great have be gain to martin artistically have suffered horribly be better for afterwards thing have taken place now more than two month ago elastic fibre of youth have reasserted exuberant health of body mind have returned to former vigour pain have passed gain remained then to karls reverie there came interruption have be expecting quick step sounded outside then noise a of large quantity of book being dropped in passage loud hollow groan after short pause martin with dozen volume of music entered flushed vivid in face muddy in boot be late said also be sorry there be not cab to be found so ran ran quicker than cab oh how hot be karls face lighted up a saw be unmarried rather lonely in world till child of old age have come to who must be so told crown of life work illuminate dull world long after be dead with melodious torch that have helped to light be late said have only just finished practising dear child how hot be let have tea first be dining out to night if not have chop with here can work little afterwards a well have not be to for week yes thanks must like said martin have be down at chartries a know for couple of day paused moment frowning at fire be no good said father must not see even opposed helen coming to uncle rupert while be there came how be asked karl very well what be so odd extraordinarily happy happy in steadily shining way deep broad bright happiness like sunlight now how do account for away from frank doesnt even write to hear from continuing to do that found so intolerable under hugely aggravated condition not there yet awfully happy not that father have changed to at be very silent very sad very well sometimes very cross feel sadness too feel a if be own ah have said karl be why be happy be what have always told fact of sympathy whether be with joy pain be what enriches perfect fact of sympathy be what make happy be a happy with broad sunshine of happiness even though bitter wind whistle when isolde sink lifeless by body of tristran a when siegfried hears singing of bird paused moment looking at fire then turned to martin ah dear lad said pray that drink to dreg cup of sorrow of joy may be given never shrink from pain will not become best self without by through in selfish egoistic manner will fulfil rose from chair turned on switch after switch of electric light be like said feeling in sudden desire for light instinctive connection with what be saying open door open window of soul let sun in wind be music lesson added laughing well have given good many in life must be pleased to know never gave worse one now what have done since saw last martin walked quickly over to piano with laugh listen said played few bar of very intricate phrase after manner of opening of fugue then in bass phrase be repeated finished with something perfectly different third fourth fifth joined in before whole kennel be yelp original subject have passed through rapid gradation until have become something totally different to what began with though still incessant jabber of cognate phrase never quite coherent be somehow strung together worked against other by miracle of ingenuity then original subject be repeated with emphatic insistence a if to call renewed attention to be answered time by phrase have nothing whatever to do with third short melody totally different from anything have gone before be to come after ran brief ridiculous course then perfect hodge podge of reminiscence of have previously occurred handled with extraordinary dexterity made brain positively reel swim finally huge bravura passage a much decked out with riband lace a fashionable woman at party brought insane composition taxed even martin finger to totally unexpected close karl rusoff have listened at first with sheer uncomprehending bewilderment unable since indeed there be head tail body to to make anything out of for moment wondered if martin be merely playing fool a looked at face bent over piano saw even finger nearly in difficulty sudden light struck began to smile before end be reached sat shaking in chair with hopeless laughter ah wicked boy said why even dear lady sunningdale must recognise martin pushed plume out of left eye laughed thats joy of said did recognise about half way through said why thats know told to do to take anything east wind london fog friend make music of play once more if will said karl then to work not that be work there be great deal of work in also perceive with secret satisfaction that find easy to play bravura be rather unkind be never quite like ah bravura be only clothes said martin preparing to begin again even told hat have on be one describes a covey of bird of paradise have be out night in thunderstorm sitting on tomato salad again karl sat listened to torrent of fragment current of interrupted thought heard for second time seemed to even more brilliantly constructed absence of construction than before anomalous farrago must only have be attained by really scholarly studious disregard of rule one who have not rule at finger tip must have broken so accurately be gorgeous parody of musical grammar in exactly mode in lady sunningdales conversation be brilliant parody of speech full of disconnected wit lit from end to end with humour a jerky a antic of monkey a incapable of sustained flight in one direction a broken winged bird glorious extravagance karl have left seat stood near piano a bravura passage began time seemed to present difficulty to martin though unerring hand be hardly more than brown mist over key karl felt sudden spasm of jealousy of pupil a huge cascade of tenth octave streamed out of martin finger yes indeed bravura be not easy remarked when martin have finished think played without mistake did not be quite easy to play tenth like martin laughed find ive got not to think of anything else said will do for composition for week karl laughed yes very well indeed said have lot of humour humour in music be rather rare dont cultivate day will find in position of man who cant help making pun dismal fate now let leave be admirable get to work think told to study last of noveletten play please time however there be laughter approbation karl looked rather formidable do wont do at said have note be absolutely be perfectly empty dead pianola must do a well whats matter cant read anything into martin shrugged shoulder know wrong said cant make anything of stodgy karls eye glared rather dangerously from behind glass oh stodgy be said slowly schumann be stodgy be news to must try to remember that martin looked sideways at master karls face did not relax stodgy repeated know where stodginess come in ah be idiotic have taken trouble about because have found that mere execution be not difficult to have not troubled to get at music gave music to learn have brought back note bring piece to like again if give thing to learn do so for reason get up please karl paused moment summoning to aid that knew all have ever learned to give cunning to finger perception to brain never perhaps in life have played with more fire with more eagerness to put into music be to put there that in order to charm crowded hall packed from floor to ceiling to show just one pupil difference between playing music playing note martin have left music stool in what may be called dignified silence be standing by fire before long karl saw out of corner of eye must spare neither thought look steal back towards piano though must not look directly at face knew what be there wide open black eye finely chiselled nostril swelling sinking with quickened breath mouth little open whole vivid brain informed face lost absorbed came to end sat silent be that there asked martin in half breathless whisper be that really there karl looked up martin face be exactly a have known must be first mood of artist be of humility played wrong note said dozen at least oh more than said martin what doe matter played god what fool have be there sat day after day never saw music karl rusoff got up have be very good music lesson isnt stodgy said isnt really do now see one thing out of hundred perhaps that mean have got to be critic of music play have to interpret out of way of playing out of can be seen in saw nothing rendering be absolutely without meaning colour to play need be gave that finger only if want to practise finger only will tell so give finger exercise diabelli otherwise may take for granted that when finger be perfect work begin to play ah have to burn before play martin still hung over piano thought stodgy repeated looking shy sideways at karls great grey head well wont again said will try again now how can said martin ive got to begin over again then there be piece of bach play now read nothing into except simplicity of child just note more simply better wait moment martin want to enjoy let sit down martin waited then began one of suite anglaises like breath of fresh air in stuffy room like cloudless dawn with singing of bird after night of storm thunder exquisite melody flowed from finger precise youthful joyous there be introspection here mood of troubled soul doubt questioning sang a thrush sings changed returned on danced in gavotte moved slowly in minuet romped through bourre like child at end martin laughed suddenly oh how good cried did know that bach wrote that for asked turning to karl yes thought must have said karl with command that be to play to played very well finger be of one weight how did learn that martin raised eyebrow why must spoil must not to play other way asked certainly must then got up quickly oh martin child said did speak to roughly about schumann did rather said deserved to have ear boxed two dined alone held heated argument not like master pupil like two student who worked side by side karl a often a not deferring to other martin a often a not blandly disagreeing with karl how can pronounce for instance asked that novelette be to be played with sweating groanings mere note being of use whereas bach be to be played with note only karl gazed at in silence impertinent infant said what else do propose to play schumann a played bach a played schumann must sound extremely funny remarked martin dont say be not right how do know be right because bach wrote for spinet said karl have ever tried to play schumann on spinet sound exactly a made sound just now deplorable performance poor boy have told that dont rub in so will play very well to morrow next year said karl still grim inwardly full of laughter by way there be dog motive in lady sunningdale composition cant have be attending said martin suez canal came in twice sahara three time with shrill bark yes please cutlet karl watched eat process took about five second didnt taste that remarked be needed elsewhere said martin im sure be very good karl lingered over bouquet of burgundy be strange thing said that mankind be so gross a to confuse sense of taste with greediness dear boy be not at moment attacking there be organ even that of ear in wonderful body of ours so fine a of taste yet to most people sight of man deeply appreciating dinner conveys feeling of greediness always respect such man have sense more than most people isnt greedy asked martin karl became deeply impressive be more greedy said to catch flavour of olive oyster than to catch tone of cello ah must be like encoring song in opera most detestable habit hearing over over again artist desire that fancy hearing wotan abschied twice must be greedy art of dining like most art be frightfully neglected in england martin laughed have be here suppose dozen time said time give surprise have idea gave two thought a to what ate be hasty of true of sens put ear first be personal predilection sens really be equal there be shadow of reason for supposing one be more elevated than true can be more easily misused than others taste more particularly be subtle gateway to soul have finished dinner karl pushed back chair take instance said take incense doe not smell excite inspire devotional sense doe not smell of frangipanni unendurable odour suggest sort of hot house sensualism doe not smell of frosty november morning bring sense of cleanness into very marrow of bone martin sniffed experimentally ah know that said leaf on beech tree be red grass underfoot little crisp with frost oh how good what then karl be watching closely be conscious object now always to make martin think to excite anything in must touch sense for beauty have found that serious half flippant method be easiest mean of approach for martin be boy discussion in earnest conscious german spirit bored alarmed fact have father grasped might in year past have helped matter why everything replied sense can be expressed in term of take magenta in colour be frangipanni in smell in sound be what will say anglican chant of sort in taste be vague brown sauce in bad cook hide horror martin laughed again with keen pleasure of youth in thing experimental yes be true said how do go on take fine colour vermilion blind man said must be like sound of trumpet said karl blind man at moment saw brandy also for taste be red so be ammonia pistol to nostril martin dabbed cigarette on to dessert plate yes yes cried c major be red f sharp be blue electric blue like grotto at capri stopped suddenly be talking nonsense asked if so be fault encourage meant to what do mean to get from karl turned directly towards mean to think said to frame life wholly for beauty in form see be everywhere be assured of if eye see store up like honey bee bring home if mouth feel bring home if smell autumn morning bring home too make music pushed plate aside leaned forward towards martin be food for said be only in way by harvesting grain of corn see that can be great lot of harvesting be done unconsciously supplement that by conscious harvesting may learn perfectly harmony counterpoint can be learned may learn to play thing impossible be good by can already play be not flattering reverse if practise little printed music ever written a far a note go be good either if have not seen when first heard play must never have wasted ten minute of time on can do more than that can if be very alert quite untiring very critical always ready to catch beauty in form may present can do more than at least believe so got up from seat leaned hand on boy shoulder a sat by table ah martin dont disappoint said being old will die of drink from spring one drink deep martin turned in chair faced do know what spring mean asked love karl looked at with sort of wonder did not mean that said drew long breath god if have be granted to said too might have be great never fell in love oh be successful know understand be only person perhaps who doe know what be missing in be that missing that never not once parodied what did not know parody parody repeated martin looked at with direct lucid gaze karl knew so well level beneath straight line of eyebrow smooth brown cheek be little flushed with emotion must not have put name to slight injury be there that karl must possibly have supposed bestial rest be clean modesty be not beastly said if mean that did mean that said beg pardon martin stood up think have right to suppose that said have none did not suppose warned though tenderness such a have never known rose like blush into old bone tenderness for supreme talent have be placed in hand only warned said looked for burglar under bed just because because be boy like that stupid world try to spoil aye will try to spoil woman will make love to will fall in love with too again paused thing will be made poisonously pleasant for said can without effort capture brilliant success remember that get without effort be not from point of view of art conceivably worth anything remember also that nothing fine ever grew out of what be horrible more than what be horrible sterilizes soil that soil be will never get more if spoil let get sour rancid horror get rooted there devours might have be good might have be of best there be long silence then karl stepped back rang bell to martin silvery tinkle sounded remote certainly be thinking now well have done said karl excuse nonconformist conscience martin got up dont see how one can care really care for music live grossly said yet people appear to manage mawkishness make feel sick added with apparent irrelevance karl understood somebody have be trying to pet thought to went upstairs to music room martin stood before fire few moment smoking in silence like room said make feel clean like november morning say how be that so many people men woman alike only think about one subject surely be extraordinarily stupid of when there be so many jolly thing in world ah if world be not full of extraordinarily stupid people remarked karl must be enchanting place oh enchanting a be cried martin

happened to be giving menagerie party determined to have few word with for be looked upon a sort of book of reference with regard to twin menagerie party be so called because for week beforehand lady sunningdale drove about london good deal screamed invitation to everybody saw in street lion only be fed meaner animal lion only observed too late to ask to dinner came in afterwards lady monica stella belonged to second category lady sunningdale hailed with effusion dearest monica so glad to see cried sort of people be here whom im sure dont know by sight ive just revoked at bridge double trump too isnt too dreadful suez canal tried to bite prime minister wasnt naughty see suez be radical though shouldnt bring politics into private life stella havent seen for year yes martin going to play of course have heard tune imitates talking in very large hat simply heavenly exactly like even sunningdale awoke other evening when played asked what be saying how be frank sign of relenting on

ambassador killed own father know shot dead on staircase thinking be burglar came into immense property at age of nineteen how picturesque be not such very spanish thing to do good shot too how be seor yes be playing bridge in next room say there be sure to be dissolution in autumn lady sunningdale poured out spate of useful information in usual manner addressing remark indiscriminately to one who happened to be near lady monica waited till flood showed sign of abating have vague contempt for lady sunningdales method considering that diffused too much never caught hold of anything held tight till everybody else who wanted let go from sheer fatigue be favourite method of own on other hand lady sunningdale certainly managed to pick up great many bright object a went along even though did drop again almost immediately do come away talk to violet said lady monica when for moment there be silence came here entirely to have confabulation with yes dear by mean have heard nothing interesting for week except thing ive made up told in confidence to somebody have eventually come round to again also in confidence whats about a soon a have found corner lady monica a custom be went quite straight to point about stella said violet be afraid stella be being silly how dear stella always seems to so sensible such lovely neck too quite like yours look there be poor harry bentham lion bit arm off be south africa lady sunningdale cast roving eye in direction kissed tip of finger motioned not to come to lady monica waited without least impatience till have quite finished then went on exactly where have left off well dreadfully fascinating martin challoner said im sure dont wonder dear really such terribly attractive people ought to be shut up not allowed to run about loose do too much damage well dear stella be only like rest of said lady sunningdale remember how ran after twin last summer know got quite out of breath stella be running still now do think know so well that give two thought to be great friend be often together if be to come to nothing will stop at once stella have time to waste lady sunningdale considered moment knew about monicas little flirtation with martin so also did have imitated for lady sunningdales benefit with deadly accuracy be too good natured to spoil sport just because stella mother have be shade too sprightly for year besides meant to say word two about later on word must rankle afterwards dear cant really tell whether martin ever think about not said be so extraordinary be simply boy yet in many way play at life a boy play at absurd game absorbed in still considering game then suddenly go doe something deadly serious like joining roman church practically also must remember that think almost entirely about one thing music that child sits down play with experience feeling finger a karl rusoff say have never yet be known to exist in boy be like radium something quite new weve got to learn about before can say what will do in given circumstance burn be unconsumed so like martin karl say be changing growing up cant help feeling rather pity yes of course cant be bachelor life be impermissible karl always say implore to leave alone dont force dont even suggest thing to will find way so long a nobody shews karl be devoted to just like beautiful old hen in spectacle with one chicken lady monica have not smallest intention of talking about karl led conversation firmly back well violet will try to find out asked lady sunningdales eye attention wandered ah there be sunningdale said doe not look lost always look like at menagerie yes will try to sound martin if like must make confide in somehow be rather tender will probably tell though will certainly imitate tendency afterwards imitates people who take interest in be phrase too beautifully roared lady sunningdale cast quick sideways glance at friend simply roared at imitation gave other day of somewhat elderly woman who took interest in yes poor suez canal love party one cant let bite everybody indiscriminately let come back dear monica make twin play there be sitting with stella asked particularly if be coming be probably talking about golf something dreadful stella be devoted to be not yes thats game where make run be not will have to sound martin very carefully be so quick sunningdale please take martin firmly by arm if try to bite by scruff of neck put down at piano dear monica can tell nothing by face always look absorbed excited like if be talking to must look just same that also be premeditated vicious just in case poor monicas little love making martin have imitated so divinely have not be wholly vicarious if have remark must pas unnoticed if have not there be need to consider whether have not for poor monica have turned quite red at mention of martin imitation of elderly woman who took interest in chapter xi martin have be among lion who be fed to night at lady sunningdales have eaten of rich slightly indeterminate food for hostess vagueness volubility like karls love of form found expression in dinner afterwards have taken up strategic position near head of stair when meaner animal belated lion began to arrive in order to watch wait for stella entrance then a soon a mother lady sunningdale have retired into corner have annexed with complete assent plunged into discussion about affair not in least private have mother overheard must with strong practical common sense have ordered conversation to cease at once so wanting in right sort of intimacy must have found in so doing must have made one of mistake be so often so inevitably committed by people of great common sense imagination who can not allow for possible presence of romance in pursuit consider prosaic have martin be talking to daughter about music must have considered sufficiently promising to allow development for be thing very real to heart spoke a be must have considered that conversation held not germ of disease of longed that martin must sicken lady sunningdale far le superficial really than other not knowing that almost everything under sun be rich with childish romance in martin eye have hazarded suggestion that be talking about golf be practically correct because be talking about skating two to be indistinguishable supposed got run at being objectless exercise for body moment hunted shot played game entered that bracket thing be of same genre quite unintelligible cant get shoulder round said stella be earthly use telling that must wont go can understand meaning of three simple word will try to express differently if try to make get round down martin frowned stella be really stupid about said have long ago fallen into christian name for hundredth time have to consider foot a fixed then pivot round head first then stella nodded yes understand that said be always head first with on ice youre not being serious said martin if cant be serious about game cant be serious about anything be universal truth discovered what do suppose matter to most in life music not at get along with silly thing oh if one must teach to do back bracket not rather clean quite clean dreamed did one once awoke sobbing loudly from sheer happiness must sign pledge never to touch tobacco piano again if must do thats real state of mind now will skate to morrow at prince can be there at ten for hour considering be always there at half past nine remarked stella dont think need ask yet say be not serious oh martin why be that one really only want to do thing one cant do can if want enough said deuce be that one cant always want enough dont believe that said promptly lady monica must have stayed devastating hand if have heard want lot of thing a much a possibly can perhaps even that isnt enough what for instance stella must not help momentary lifting of eye to why to skate silly said yes ill be there by ten so be punctual will consider foot wish ill fall down a often a think necessary dont be unkind at once when pick up tell be too much on heel anything of sort wait till first agony be over attend best when pain be beginning to pas off well only tell to save trouble in future said know give moment do care about future much by way dont give immediate present to think much about future be sign of age one begin to care about future until be too old to have besides implies that present have ceased to be absorbing martin pondered oh dont think be so at stella laughed never by chance agree with word say remarked well havent agreed with since august said made note of be why have stupid pause conversation run dry in two minute if one agrees with other person what say about age really isnt so look at karl rusoff lady sunningdale live intensely in present ah be willow said year have got nothing to do with age be most superficial view people of ninety die young people of twenty die of senile decay martin stretched trouser over crossed knee be hundred eleven said while dont hate scotch while be about twelve in eton collar yes loathe laddie hoot be what be so maddening about time think be talking to great uncle rest of to little nephew up from country be nice boy asked martin do like great uncle best dont like at thank be always being far too wise far too young a man of hundred how can play silly game with such enthusiasm a boy of twelve how can play piano a do be because be so extremely gifted said martin so gravely naturally that for appreciable moment stared ah dont find awful bore asked dreadful cant really take pleasure in anything owing to sense of responsibility talent bring to stella broke down laughed at gravity always beat completely at period in conversation lord sunningdale did a be ordered taking firmly by arm led to piano karl be always most assiduous in attendance at house where martin played be here to night object be certainly not to flatter encourage pupil for often often when martin have played in presence night before found growling reception waiting for at next lesson played well enough for karl must say grant that bungling must do for to play well enough for be damnation did martin must argue did not want to play at one cant say at least cant be not playing for then must not have played at if play often enough in second rate manner will soon become second rate to night martin never suggested second rate even to exacting master in sort of boyish protestation at stricture have undergone last night concerning last of noveletten played again now certainly to night there be note of stodginess there varied crisp masterful mood of music rang extraordinarily true half way through karl turned to lady sunningdale who be sitting next how have spent day asked suddenly skating think skated morning be late for lunch went back to prince afterwards be terribly idle be not pray dont interrupt monsieur rusoff never can feel a if hear note at unless hear who said that think so true have heard piece on must play delicious be isnt learned when be child tum tum there be tune again with whom did skate dear lady asked karl there have be good many note missed by now lady sunningdale gasped oh monsieur rusoff how clever of said be really clairvoyant so be maid one like murderess do know how must martin be skating with stella plympton be important be dont tell mother be such fool also have be trying to pump see be who brought together so suitable feel dreadfully responsible at point novelette ended lady sunningdale clapped hand in perfunctory manner too heavenly monster said now play tum te tum yes that one be really going to marry continued to karl love being pumped if know dear monica pump like fire engine there be possibility of mistake now while be playing do tell know dear lady be building on foundation said karl know be that played that to last night played abominably to night have played well have heard psychologically must like to know what have occurred in interval be playing of just now very wonderful asked yes one might venture to say a have be skating day presumably have not thought much about thinking perhaps have be done for who be stella plympton wife maid lady sunningdale gave little shriek of laughter really people who lived out of world be much more amusing than who lived in who lived in be true always believed worst in absence of definite knowledge others however made far more startling suggestion next two on right whispered dear monica will have fit if stella turn out to be already married karls eye wandered slowly to right looking pointedly at many thing first at cornice of ceiling at martin profile at slumber of lord sunningdale then swept quickly by stella sat there absorbed radiant face flushed with secret delicate joy a watched listened hardly knowing whether eye ear demanded attention most certainly music musician between held in spell be looking quite best whispered lady sunningdale how interesting have million know oil cake be oil cloth oil something anyhow sound so rich be only child father be quite impossible not h though one crowd there one always doe if there be million so vulgar of one dear monica be almost brought up together karl turned round to dear lady sunningdale said be really quite premature if build anything on what have said played admirably to night what played abominably last night be absolutely know must be so sorry if have suggested anything to proved to be without sort of foundation there certainly seemed to be new power in martin playing to night new power have constantly shewn there during last month two for a karl said have be growing to night however be conscious of even a played knew that fresh light of kind fresh spring of inspiration be hand brain be too busy a played to let be more than conscious of where came from what be must not guess moment a struck last chord tension relaxed knew then looking up saw stella sitting near leaning forward beautiful mouth little open that glorious white column of neck supported head like stem of flower garden flower something wonderful wild there be row of face behind to side of be one in crowd only a eye caught gaze crowd fell away became misty to vanished a breath vanishes in frosty air only that one face bending little towards remained for long moment eye dwelt on other smiled for occasion be too grave for two for knew be alone in paradise in desert be one gay crowd applause merged into crescendo of renewed conversation light glitter men woman be for one moment obliterated for in soul love have leaped to birth puny weakling prematurely warped disfigured by evil practice parody of clean full grown sprang towards knowing seeing that welcome be already assured then real world so strangely unreal in comparison to world in for moment soul have mingled embraced reeled into existence again martin rose from piano for have risen too have turned to phantom on right appeared to speak to lady sunningdale beckoned screamed to martin cried be too deevey monsieur rusoff be really almost didnt say almost satisfied with way played learned that exquisite thing used to play year ago while be skating to day because say played too abominably last night really if thought must play like to morrow evening must go skate day now dont waste time play something more instantly oh please lady sunningdale must rather not said really dont think must play more to night really be dont know what tired lady sunningdale looked at brilliant vigorous face martin dont believe will ever learn to tell decent passable lie said why not tell have got cancer oh there suez canal come back naughty monsieur rusoff wont tell that must just scale two adore scale so satisfactory be not so expected a if be music lesson how tiresome of karl laid hand on martin arm dear lady said he never to play except when want to if really want little more music ah how enchanting of monsieur rusoff be going to play surely dear monica will wait be not going yet desolated violet stella say feel little faint hot room suppose be waiting for outside how deliciously play mr challoner suppose practise great deal wont come day broke off for martin have simply turned back on be firmly edging way through crowd to door then lady monicas maternal instinct positively leaped to conclusion martin rudeness be completely forgiven cant resist waiting to hear monsieur rusoff said thought never played at private house how clever of dear violet wonder if must get to play for stella will sit down wait for doubt before karl struck first chord martin have won not to say pushed way through hushed crowd found stella sitting outside in other drawing room one have flocked in to hear music be alone foot be noiseless on thick carpet be yard two from when raised eye saw then with little choking cry only half articulate came close to excitement fire in life be passed be cold ash compared to moment heart thumped riotously against chest twice tried to speak trembling lip must not form word waited eye still fixed on then suddenly threw arm out be good trying said love love oh clumsy bald statement life death meant le than word oh martin said have waited dont know what be saying waited asked eye glowed like hot coal then laughed never told said if be not must never forgive if be not must not care isnt that nonsense asked yes probably who care stella oh star flung arm round star star cried again for one moment must not yield to yes yes whispered martin martin mouth wreathed into laughter be evening party must not must not paused like man dying of drought from whose lip cup of water have be taken away party cried what party be be be unknown to have loved boy with extraordinary eye boy who played so magnificently who laughed so much now there be roused something more than piano player be gone did not laugh eye have never quite glowed like there be in face something have never seen yet woman have awakened man be first full moment of consciousness like woman for first time face to face with lover beloved be afraid have not till now seen full fire be frightened cried what have done answer came back like echo to what have not said what be behind word frightened said oh stella not of not of real gave little laugh still mysteriously nervous be stranger said never saw before martin gave great happy sigh be quite right said authentic fire leaped to fro between eye be never before be not frightened now time eye did not waver from martin said there be more privacy possible here stella have be quite right there be party going on at moment great burst of applause signified end of karl rusoffs performance stella started there told so said now take to mother will be waiting for martin frowned can not wait asked too have never seen real before dear must go there be to morrow to morrow to think that have only be yesterday until evening said there be lady monica looking for lady monica have practised eye kept everything have in excellent practise there

too business like ah dear mr martin said how nice how very very nice stella dearest how secret have be come darling must go cant talk to of in crowd how nice will see to morrow come to lunch quite quite quietly stella looked at yes do martin said will take back after skate ah have forgotten said laughed divinely have not will be kind to a asked added dwelt on answer kind to said chapter xii be march day of glorious windy brightness day that atones amends with prodigal open handed generosity for fog chilly darkness of autumn winter heavy rain have fallen during night before cold chilly rain hour before morning have ceased great warm boisterous wind came humming up from southwest like celestial house clearer swept cloud from face of sky hour of ivory starlight setting moon ushered in day same wind have awakened helen with sound of tapping struggling blind drawn over open window with eye suffused with sleep have got out of bed to quiet rattling calico by simple process of rolling up having rolled up stood for moment at window hair stirred by wind drinking in soft cool breath of huge night blew night dress close to skin clean smell of rain be in air sky be clear to east behind tower of chartries church nameless dove coloured hue of coming dawn be beginning to make dim star then went back to bed with vague certain sense that change have come winter be over in very bone felt that gloriously did morning fulfil expectation white fleecy cloud high in heaven bowled along blue shadow racing beneath across brown grass of down wind warm pregnant with spring drove boisterously out of west sun flooded lived in bath of light round elm in church yard there have be wrought that yearly miracle that mist of green leaf hovering round tree paler more delicate hung round slim purple twigged birch in wood climbed up hillside beyond to chartries here after breakfast path lay for have parish errand to outlying hamlet beyond with eye ear nostril open mouth breathed be bathed in revivification of spring that morning so seemed to bird in world sang together thrush bubbled with noise of chuckling water delicious repeated phrase of melody a if to show brave musician that first fine careless rapture be perfectly easy to recapture if happen to know way of thing blackbird with liquid throat tawny bill scudded through bush above swift chided in swooping company finch sparrow poured out staccato note one bird alone be silent for nightingale waited till summer must come love filled ear for eye there be blue distance blue shadow of racing cloud sun more near budding tree in dingle below wood of chartries million daffodil helen have forgotten that be there waiting for came on suddenly stood quite still moment with long pause of pure complete delight place be carpeted with danced shone sang together like morning star a looked eye grew dim with happy tear dear god said thank so much yes indeed be spring a walked on repeated word over over again to herself finding magic in be everywhere sky sun be full of burst in myriad blossom from dark wholesome soil be spring that set good wind blowing bubbled chuckled in chalk stream with waving weed bright glimmering bed of pebble above be in own heart on glorious morning till thought must almost burst too so overflowing be with sheer unreasoning happiness indeed martin have be quite right when have told karl how happy be though did not reason to herself about cause be abundantly clear for last six month have lived at home through day week of ever recurring difficulty with a presented have dealt smilingly patiently have made up mind on visit to cambridge that duty be clear obvious nothing striking picturesque be in least required be neither going to renounce future happiness on other hand to throw else aside grasp at heroic knot cutting measure of kind be indicated except quiet unobtrusive heroism of taking up again quite simply quietly naturally straightforward familiar little duty of home life again again have found so tedious have be in le tedious only here be difference have ceased to look upon from point of view except one namely that be quite distinctly business to do that have found to be sufficient be enough day by day to get through with without expenditure of thought a to whether be distasteful not work daily bread have somehow be sweet wholesome nourishing truly if a karl have said martin have be growing out of knowledge twin also must be scarcely recognisable bread bread of soul have come to table have be laid in wilderness happiness royal inward happiness of very fine unselfish sort in midst of thousand thing made for unhappiness have blossomed in thousand time have be tempted to say be doing good why must put off what be waiting for when renunciation doe not help father in way thousand time have just not said now at end of difficult month must without egoism look back see what infinite good have be done that father must in way alter own conviction about marriage have never expected what have be gained be that saw now consciously saw that be in very simplest language being good have be difficult enough for concerned except perhaps for aunt clara who be scarcely capable of emotion often helen heart have bled for father have be most terrible of when martin have joined roman church letter to father helen winced when thought of now have arrived on sunday morning have found on breakfast table when have come back from early celebration be manly straightforward letter enough stating that have not yet gone over have practically determined to if father wished must come down to chartries talk over with give to advice counsel very fullest possible consideration at end expressed very bluntly sincerely a be way sorrow pain that knew news must cause father sheet fell from hand helen who be making tea looked up saw colour rise in father face artery in neck temple swelled into cord eye with pupil contracted to pin prick looked for moment like eye of madman then spoke voice vibrating with suppressed furious anger martin be going to join roman church said from day doe so helen never speak to of again be dead to remember be week before christmas for more than month after martin name have literally hardly crossed father lip boy have come down to stay with uncle once mr challoner have absolutely refused to see have even wished helen not to on occasion for only time during long winter have quietly quite firmly disobeyed be then first too a one looking down from barren rock of mountain range that saw though still far off harvest be ripening in long patient month of living here with father before going to chartries have thought best to go into study tell that be doing so be going to see martin said wondering very nervous a to how father must take wanted to tell father before went that be going mr challoner be writing sermon on word pen paused then looked up at very well dear said know feeling about be thing in must do a think right helen again paused eye wandered away from be bent on paper tell when come back how lad look if seems well came closer to be first sign have shown that recognised martin existence ah come with said shook head dear dear said went on with work on march morning of windy brightness gave comble to happiness be talk first intimate one for week have have with father night before have gone to room a usual after prayer finding there parish work concerning outdoor relief ought to have done taken to day before sat up for nearly couple of hour until have finished then with paper in hand went down to study be so sorry father said told wanted yesterday absolutely forgot to do be finished now looked up in surprise why helen said be after twelve ought to have be in bed long ago have be sitting up to do smiled at why yes said took from have be very good daughter to dear said paused helen said nothing for tone shewed unfinished sentence pause be long be not at easy for to say what followed have be often often very difficult very hard month said will do best to forget will try to forgive went close to very much moved laid hand on shoulder ah dont cut to heart said promise if can said yes be true have often be difficult hard answered yes dear father said promise that with whole heart in turn when may come will try not to think too hardly of have tried to be good sat down by side looking rather wistfully at have be wanting to talk to often before about that said so let say once for what be in mind disagree with a know vitally essentially believe that god tell to disagree now believe also dear goodness sweet patience month have taught that god tell to do a be going to how be understand perhaps that doesnt matter so much a used to think fulfils in many way there too have very often thought that have to fulfil in way be who have made see that think helen raised shining eye to have made very happy said what have done for there be certain day dear during winter see how must have got through without here be opportunity for helen have often sought martin asked oh father wonder if want martin a much a do strength tenderness died out of face leaving helpless hard cant see said quickly dare not day perhaps if saw now must say must not know help saying what feel if must do good must say must do none must only must only frighten said with accent infinitely pathetic left then without more word for winter have be learning day day long divine human gospel of patience in dealing with people patience teach not to pull bud open however desirable may be that flower must unfold be content to do best with wait for result without desire even that must come quickly till evening a have be said martin name have scarcely be mentioned by father be something after bitterness of long silence that must be able to say not yet not now pity also pity with hand of healing have entered at last into stern upright god fearing soul filtering way like water through dry stony soil very exiguous trickle might be cool liquid refreshing how hardly have won way there helen guessed dimly alone knew for day have succeeded day week week day week have wrestled blindly hopelessly with misery that martin have brought on unable for effort to find possible justifying cause for what have done seemed to a wanton a wicked a violent crime to puritan mind martin reason namely craving for necessity of beauty poetry in religion be a unintelligible a page in unknown language not knowing at what that craving meant more than knew what homicidal mania meant to maniac must not in degree feel appreciate force for sake of son have left mother church embraced heresy abomination idolatry of rome such be sober literal view roman church be idolatrous for idolater be doom appointed revealed by god believed by there stood martin for week nothing have come to sweeten bitterness of dark water suffering be a unintelligible to a be pain to dumb animal must not guess what must possibly mean that fierce anguish like flame have burned up for time in withering breath human affection have hated martin for what have done shocking a be knew to be true hate seemed somehow justified there be thing there be action passion be bound to hate so filled be with conviction that human affection human love must find at first place in mind be turned out evicted now like dog beaten driven from house be beginning so helen thought to creep noiselessly stealthily homeward again so be content did not even want to hurry morning spring be here too daffodil danced from dance of daffodil slope rose steeply upward through hanging wood of chartries path lay by bush in last summer frank have found trapped hare here a always went slowly telling over in mind like bead of rosary history of hour then raising eye saw frank standing little way up path looking at involuntarily heart leaped to holding out hand quickened step a if running to that first movement must no more help than must help fresh blood springing to cheek at once almost recollected paused ah frank cried shouldnt have come here know shouldnt came nearer darling said couldnt help be not fault have not broken promise only have to see just see think be spring made do be with uncle for just one night see there be for from martin held out note for standing little aside so that path be clear for to pas on way a finger met lingered hung on step still not looking at tried tried best to pas on must not eyelid swept upward looked at then of moved first knew next moment arm be round kissed ala struggle to get free be very faint tongue protested not very earnestly ah let go let go said cant helen be here that know said come here day knew must meet here day of day first of spring oh frank let go love be not that enough be not for long now darling be not long now have be so long have wanted so much disengaged quietly from arm in way that made impossible for to hold good bye said ought never to have come oh darling thank so for coming for one infinitesimal moment looked at again then with quick light step went on up path with martin letter in hand never looked back did not pause till reached top of wood a walked listened for longed for yet dreaded to hear footstep behind none came have made meaning too clear for how wished have be explicit having arrived at top slackened pace opened martin letter be very short couple of line only announcing engagement to stella asking to tell father with spring be complete upward again lay path more among tree sheltered place high over broad swell of short turfed down where shadow of cloud ran glorious race something in huge view large sky chimed in wonderful harmony to girl mood be so big so untainted so full of light beneath foot dead autumn turf still stretched in brown tuft patch springing up in between be myriad shoot of young grass even since yesterday thought tone of colour be changed till to day have be grey brown still pointed backward winterwards morning be different million sprouting life shouted look forward look forward for lo winter be past time of singing bird have come ah song of song thought indeed be so martin there be word into must put what felt more than pervading sunlight must be put into word be there great huge exultant presence flooded everything ah beloved twin why be only few year ago that be in eton jacket broad white collar sang treble well yes be in short frock about same time yet have not hour ago down in wood below where young leaf hung like green mist around purple branch of birch felt loving arm round kiss on face oh be very wrong of frank not wrong of must have stood aside did stand aside to let pas be very wrong of at moment must not pas by be a if power of movement have be paralysed yet be not in least degree ashamed of herself looked forward with certain secret glee to telling father for have to be done for so by speaking of must live over again be not said to herself rehearsing question answer kissed sunlight lark invisible shadow of cloud coursed over down distance off tall figure moving towards rapidly figure easily recognised came nearer met hat be in hand hair tossed over forehead there be spring sure promise of summer in face in father too there be something of infused joy hand held little bunch of primrose have plucked a walked met without word with smile unconscious smile that morning have made well helen said look indeed look like morning came close to with neat precision put primrose into hat ought to pin said will fall out laughed ah nothing can fall out to day said dont feel father spring spring oh daffodil have news then face sobered suddenly two piece of news said smiling again unable not to be first be of martin be engaged to be married asked to tell stella plympton whom met here wrote just line asking to tell instinct be right to repeat sharp a knife father jealousy have pierced must have be told first whatever disagreement with martin father ought to have be told first passed in moment martin said gently boy yes thought of like be really oh ever so old a old a be mr challoners face relaxed have forgotten said immense age what next helen looked up at be that have to say asked feeling suddenly chilly disappointed think be hard helen said try to be what next yes be chilly on upland down put hat on just said met frank hour ago gave martin note did not expect to see a far a be concerned be quite accidental have idea be here have promised not to see must not help stopped drew long breath went on suppose must have helped rest said suppose be that did not choose to help stood aside for to pas did not pas went to let kiss stood there with thought must not help indeed thought that for moment mr challoners hardness involuntary condemnation of weakness of sort of failure to keep promise returned to mixed with very ugly thing suspicion be first time have seen spoken to have communication with asked helen raised eye to in quiet surprise trace of resentment sense of injustice be in voice yes of course said must have told otherwise looked at sweet patient face struggling for moment with worse self of yet be so upright so devoted know must said at last dont know why asked that helen laughed do said have be very patient helen said yes till morning think have said to day perhaps spring be too strong for be not in blood morning father be in mine smiled at gravely very suitable thing said summer come next for for martin yes martin too said with appeal in eye oh father cant be happy together again used to be mr challoner stood silent moment sort of aching longing for have always missed in martin dim bitter regret for own missed opportunity of making most of human relation between son rising suddenly within spoke with terrible quiet sincerity dont think martin used ever to be happy with said once told be not happy at home dont think that ever be be perhaps fault of of be certainly mine must have done somehow differently think never understood other can understand now be sad can not reconcile what have done broke off again there dear must be getting on way said must be getting home detained moment more wont give little hope said thought last night that perhaps perhaps soon news morning father disengaged hand will of course write to said congratulate be very charming girl think martin be most fortunate martin be very charming too remember said mr challoner walked swiftly homewards after helen have left feeling strangely deeply moved by news felt somehow that child be child no longer responsibility for have passed into other hand light heartedly eagerly be now taking on responsibility for others have thought of always a boy girl bound to obedience to will dependent on without real individual existence of own within last year first one now other be passing out of reach helen first then martin have acted for in direct defiance not only of wish of be mainspring motive of life be true by month of quiet

there be sense in such thing surely one can be simple about love just because be so big know love be enough for told that know nothing else be sober truth can not weigh thing in balance what be more

ask one to pick out martin better know of by so much more will pick out mr challoner last of martin got up ah dont let talk about said be not agreeable wish must laugh about like cant then with quick intuition turned to stella one cant do good by talking about can one asked something still jarred on girl due partly to talk before lady sunningdale came in have admirable common sense said lady sunningdale caught on to with usual quickness knew for certain from stella tone that something have gone just shade wrong between find rather trying do not dearest stella said of course martin be most trying person in world if wasnt for ten finger must be absolutely intolerable be boy of about twelve with dreadful streak of common sense worthy of man of fifty who have left illusion behind yes monster be martin raised eyebrow excellent temper slightly ruffled for moment indeed didnt recognise said dear martin dont be pompous didnt recognise because wasnt flattering say woman be vain compared to men woman be vain of appearance be true usually without sufficient cause men be vain of attribute that god have have not endowed with remember that stella if want to lead quiet life lay on flattery with spade be insatiable personally dont flatter sunningdale because dont in least want quiet life tranquility be so frightfully aging make one like oyster martin have recovered serenity when be dead remarked will be sorry for what have said why sudden attack on when be dead will see how right be attack well chiefly because havent provoked be so tiresome of must see wanted to quarrel wouldnt say anything must lay hold of if want to sit down politeness ordains that must give chair if see want to quarrel politeness ordains that must give pretext be worst possible manner not to nerve be on edge when be case only thing to do be to quiet by being rude to other people dearest stella look too lovely afternoon why want to throw away on martin cant think said just now be idea said stella know be very foolish one never imagined must take seriously besides know perfectly well that whenever thing happens that plea always say be own idea darling did tread on how foolish of to lie there when be happily settled for what be to do next clock struck martin looked up gracious be late said karl be to give lesson at six must say good bye to next lady sunningdale stella got up too ill

horrid to dearest give can of want so much just because be martin eye kindled glowed be yours said know that wish there be more of there be more since since week ago then be content said mean great deal think be rather jealous of piano generally forgive yes lady sunningdale though often irrelevant from sheer irrelevancy be also sometimes irrelevant on purpose using preposterous conversation a bismarck used truth a valuable instrument to secure definite end just now for instance attack on martin have purpose at back for have seen quite distinctly that something have gone wrong between stella have made diversion in order to prevent topic of friction whatever be being subjected to further rubbing providence have lent aid to benevolent scheme sending martin off to music lesson leaving stella alone with in fact request to be told what must do next needed answer at for knew quite well that what must do next be to get stella to confide in tell have happened be great believer in talking thing out important point however be not that principal must talk thing out be indeed worse than useless that must severally talk out with somebody else wondered indeed rather hoped that martin might simultaneously talk out with karl for a have have occasion to observe before martin music lesson consisted chiefly of discussion on character stella returned in moment lady sunningdale be irrelevant no longer only took preliminary circuit two in manner of homing pigeon before take straight unswerving line martin be simply absorbed in thought of concert said be going to play just thing make laugh cry personally will go with five handkerchief copy of english comic paper handkerchief be for tear will shed comic paper be to check laughter when play paganini variation dear stella how very wise of to marry genius will never be dull be rather bold too oh please take suez canal out of grate be trying to commit suicide think because sahara be not here yes genius be so unexpected violent must be like marrying somebody who keep several full sized flash of lightning about also large lump of damp clay never know will put hand on be so dreadfully disconcerting stella picked suez canal out of grate apparently be putting ash on head a sign of mourning dusted carefully before replying be disconcerted said lady sunningdale never pressed for confidence to show that want thing once said usually mean that be grudgingly given half of if firmly turn back on be hurled at turned back now using irrelevance again be nearly three year since be disconcerted said terrible thing be that quite forget what disconcerted think must have be sunningdale do know spoke in house of lord other day on one side then voted on other reason be that felt own remark to be so feeble that be sure there be more to be said on other side believe merely forgot yes that marble fireplace be so good surely must be adams be completely efficacious will bore if talk to asked stella dearest stella love being talked to what be be martin said back view have done part lady sunningdale turned completely round again dearest stella said pray put out electric light be rather strong in eye yes martin now stella felt a turned out light that be exactly what wished in dim flickering firelight thought drawn to surface became articulate more easily be just what say said touch never know whether be going to be lightning clay lightning doe not disconcert dear lady sunningdale clay doe lady sunningdale be really immensely interested have own method of getting girl to rummage in dark corner of mind bring out be there pursued now clay be not really disconcerting said be only possibility of clay when expect lightning own darling sunningdale be entirely clay of course there be clay in martin there be in everybody how have managed to come across because have singularly little music be lightning said stella do mean that rest be clay asked lady sunningdale there be pause stella turned out extremely dark corner in mind something really quite below stair what if be asked then dearest stella have only to thank did not think clay anyhow week ago else why must have asked to marry do mean martin have changed since then again stella paused must say more simply said look at in way what if martin be music if everything else to be secondary to then must have asked complete work of chopin to marry remarked lady sunningdale a far a know didnt occurs to that asked know can feel that be devoted to really in love with only dont for heaven sake let mind dwell for moment on relative position that music hold to have done worse than said stella have asked what relative position hold did so to day dear how insane what did say told not to talk nonsense be nonsense lady sunningdale drew little nearer to fire kindliness good nature what be perhaps even more important tact finesse be enlisted on behalf of two recognised to herself that there be here in probability only one of tiny misunderstanding must occur between man woman who be now for first time really learning other at same time seemed to quite important if possible to thoroughly dust clean out disinfect dark little mental corner in stella for might easily contain germ of misunderstanding must be by mean trivial yes be nonsense said decidedly be poisonous suicidal nonsense be exactly like bear dont seem to grasp more than bear doe what music mean to martin mean in one word god be religion good gracious supposing be bishop be going to marry must not hope be jealous of religion in music martin be very big bishop indeed in other respect forget too be simply child cant imagine what martin will be like when be middle aged be impossible to think of a middle aged martin middle age be not compatible term true karl say have be having good many birthday lately too think have have so to speak made saint day of dedicated to religion one be to say one asked stella have birthday when fell in love with be yours have given that dear adores when come into room face be lit only for heaven sake dont worry question about soul depth exact way in love if insist will try to answer answer will be dreadfully disappointing to because doesnt know anything about to question be like be like looking at light through prism spectroscope splitting up into ray when instead might be sitting in sun dear how very precise definite be becoming mean exactly that hope be not going to be ill stella laughed dear lady sunningdale hope not said in case tell more first dear cant talk sense to order must collect extremely valuable grain of gold in conversation for out of extraordinary mass of quite valueless material be disconcerting began stella again ah yes so quite certainly be to heaven how dull must be if other people never disconcerted one dont think martin though be sure must often find disconcerting must ever say so stella flushed slightly be that reproof asked gently certainly be if occurs to that may be so pray pray dont deserve again where be suez oh there dont allow ever allow to think what pity there be occasional lump of clay for indeed there be so much lightning if there wasnt little clay really think martin must explode go off in spontaneous combustion dear hour hour of day pas for martin at pressure of stupid people like have conception recuperates by restful interval by being mere boy with huge animal spirit may thank star doe not recuperate by being vicious sulky most genius be morose very few be quite sane martin be quite sane even bear who take gloomiest possible view of couldnt call morose go down on knee dear be thankful stella be silent moment then corner be turned out there be doubt about genius asked at length what be matter with asked lady sunningdale will ask next if be quite sure hasnt got false teeth dearest stella do drop exacting questioning attitude once for know almost everybody have occasional attack of be sure will pardon be just that make people odious turn sour for heaven sake dont turn sour suez canal be in grate again oh naughty thank dearest yes sour take thing on broad indulgent line love that on whole believe to be true statement of case well then surely that be good enough dont say doe love measure six foot in height be only five foot eleven three quarter in fact open window stella took very attentively very gravely dear lady sunningdale said be very grateful think have done good have little attack of indigestion in mind do know never thought that never thought must think said im sure dont wonder can think when choose just now object of thought be to stop thinking leave psychological question alone when be dealing with martin just open mouth shut eye see what martin will give a used to say when child be most fortunate girl heaven fancy having martin in love with one there be ring of absolute sincerity about so true distinct that stella wondered wondered still more when on looking at others face saw that lady sunningdales eye be full of tear openly mopped up with square two inch of lace yes real tear said tear of extreme middle age dear what be made of water suppose with just little jealousy little youth still left in adoration for genius love of beauty in fact be most complicated tear ever heard of one two like from eye then be over dearest stella be such fool one be always fool till one be middle aged then one be young no longer be tragedy of growing old be almost impossible to be mature young simultaneously be fool because dont know what priceless perfect gift have be given martin love envy intolerably gnash teeth with rage dont misunderstand dont want in least to fall in love with to reassure may say that even to amorous eye there doe not appear to be very slightest chance of gnash teeth because be not young like so that might fall in love with at same time wise like so that must know what to do with ah tell do tell how to manage how to behave said stella cant be just there be tragedy in mismanaged world that nobody can teach one else anything be worth knowing cant teach how to look young cant teach how to be wise how to appreciate how not to worry martin mind be like cut diamond absorbs light blue green red be thrown into turn by own magic into inapproachable colour that colour be seen in music oh have watched often last week worry puzzle im sure dont wonder if ask relative place of music in mind do not see how stupid be answer stella smiled oh dont rub in said yes be idiotic dear be so gentle that feel brute please be brute then just five minute more said stella very good take up absurd position say be goddess what incense have got to burn before morning ah be second quality incense thought so how must be much bigger than suez recollect who be who have paid incomparable compliment of saying wish to see face opposite at breakfast for rest of life day day go to karl rusoff ask where place martin if believe about genius when have told hire albert hall fill with people tell karl say then wait couple of year hire albert hall again repeat again what karl told single person in hall will say why of course knew that stella be silent moment then must burn incense before asked very best incense must love to do lady sunningdale restrained movement of impatience dear be one person in world who must not burn incense said incense burning wife be like dram drinking to man be to be wife mean good deal be to be comrade that mean much more helen why did not get helen to come live with well not marry at dont know perhaps frank must object men be so selfish do mean have chosen badly asked stella dear be silly to say that what meant be that wonder why wanted to marry at why nature like have need of anybody else if be like martin must never see soul contemplate own wonderfulness however did want somebody else chose fortunate girl ought to be very happy then asked ah dont say that perhaps will be divinely ecstatically discontented happiness be rather bovine quality always think implies not wanting one with imagination must always want yes dear came here to say something forget what have said good deal not dearest stella do forgive at least for own creature comfort want to forgive essentially dont care a know be right dont forgive said girl thank lady sunningdale struggled to foot out of very low chair be sweet of yes suez darling be going home to din din sahara ah remember want mother to join at cannes for fortnight at easter sunningdales villa be really quite comfortable can look at mediterranean meditate ask to send line about come in case southern sun always melt brain liquid wisdom flow from lip in practically unlimited quantity why dont live at cannes among palm sort of thing if cant come will ask martin dont mean to have together will be quite enough together afterwards dear how screaming martin will be a master of house good bye darling stella yes pray turn up light otherwise will crash way through priceless furniture tread on suez canal chapter xiv karl rusoff have experienced good deal of inward anxiety be very careful to keep entirely to for several day before martin concert for thought of a day got near have agitated excited latter to point of making lose sleep appetite though karl knew quite well that artist doe best a rule under spell of excitement more that notable achievement can hardly be compassed without yet in present case martin be naturally so highly strung excitement have become acute so many hour before be to make appearance that master must not help silently wondering whether must stand strain of till day came at other time again karl knowing martin serene splendid health found consolation in telling that tighter more tense nerve got more wonderful must playing be even during last week two have made enormous advance in general grasp that karl knew that must be bitterly disappointed if extraordinary youth did not on very first appearance legitimately justifiably take musical london by storm at same time knew that must give very deep sigh of relief when martin have got through say first three minute of recital that safely past be sure that mere feel of familiar note must occupy to exclusion of agitation only quarter of hour before be to come on to platform karl be with in artist room trying to occupy mind in talk watching with ever increasing nervousness a walked up down like caged animal between door window once martin took out cigarette bit end off a if be cigar threw away then asked question paid not slightest attention to answer finally sat down on edge of table face be flushed eye very bright have not be that karl knew how excited be must have thought be ill will break down said look at hand look how tremble cant keep still must no more play series of octave than must fly must be like tremolo stop on chartries organ dear boy have told that doe not matter in slightest degree said moment touch note will cease absolutely why even now hand always tremble before begin martin apparently be not listening have not remotest notion how tudes symphoniques begin said karl tried to laugh be not very successful a matter of fact be quite a nervous a martin thats great pity said a open with dont know either martin did not smile what will do if break down said if cant begin be more than possible will hiss will boo will demand return of money said martin still remained perfectly grave ah dont said others may boo if like shant mind much couldnt stand if did did drink good stiff glass of whiskey soda for lunch a told to demanded karl tried to must have be dead drunk if have gone on so what will do if break down asked again told have forgotten karl rose from chair will break heart martin said then spoke to quickly peremptorily seeing be really on verge of hysteric weve have quite enough of nonsense dear boy said if give more of will lose temper with be not going to break down forbid be to do a tell be going to play very best better than have ever played before now must get to place give five minute law before appear a soon a see top of black head coming up stair will have door closed till end of tudes well have interruption be frightfully distracting know where will be sitting dont bow twice right left walk straight to piano begin instantly without playing fluffy arpeggio be going to be great day for for martin looked despairingly round dont leave dont leave said cant sit by hold hand ah be altogether childish for first time shadow of smile crossed martin face know be said can just just see that think have better try to be little man for change hall be crammed to overflowing a if pianist of world wide fame be to make appearance not young man who have never performed in public before several cause have contributed to first most important being that mr martin challoner be actually pupil of karl rusoffs who for year have never consented to teach furthermore karl rusoff have very highest opinion of exaggeratedly high perhaps since be pupil have not only allowed wished to give concert surely then must run risk martin challoner must have merit in addition english pianist of more than mediocre power have appeared for year patriotism called finally for last fortnight lady sunningdale have worn coachman to shadow horse to skin bone so incessantly unintermittently have driven about first of to house of intimate then of ordinary friend lastly of merest acquaintance practically insisting that must appear karl rusoff have done what must to discourage effort be totally void of effect for lady sunningdale have told that be duty to do best for martin seldom used word duty when did might be defined a anything be irrevocably determined to do from argument must move so for first time martin found in unspeakable position of being alone on shore of sea of face owner of have paid money in anticipation of pleasure have undertaken to provide for opposite few yard off only looking misty unreal be steinway grand found wondering what on earth be for when remembered felt towards a condemned man may feel when see execution shed at few minute before eight then bowed in answer to very fair reception walked straight to piano glanced at programme saw have to begin with schumann tudes symphoniques sat down waited moment for silence began played one bar only then stopped have not very faintest idea of how went on in sort of mild despair felt a if power of feeling be packed in cotton wool looked down to where karl be sitting in third row great grey eye be fixed on with expression of supreme appeal must see master hand clutching convulsively at back of seat in front of at sight at sight of agony karl be in martin be able for one moment to forget bewildering crowd of face so fighting against paralysis be on no longer for own sake for karls again turned to piano still must think of nothing nothing must not even remember first bar that have played just now bit lip with teeth till blood came saying to will break heart will break heart numb dulled sense be gone in half minute endured agony of year then quite suddenly like passage of sun from behind black cloud came back to sat still moment longer in sheer happiness at concentrated thought of what karl be suffering nervousness paralysis of mind went entirely from with complete certainty with assured knowledge too that be going to play very best began again at end of slow thema paused looked up at karl smiled nearly to laughing point at pushed back plume of hair drooped over forehead played at smile at gesture be frequent with karl gave one immense sigh of relief that martin must hear now meant nothing to be busy martin face during few horrible moment have grown absolutely colourless so karl have thought almost wished for so public shame must be lessened people must be compassionate that be going to faint for when for second time martin have turned to piano still must not begin believed for moment that boy must not pull together that unless fainted must simply have to walk off platform again now colour came back slowly at first then with sudden flush dead apathy of face changed began to live again soon mouth parted slightly a if wondering at magic of music blossomed like rose underneath flying finger once twice between variation brushed back hair again once looked up at karl with brilliant glance master knew loved asking with eye will do will do for before went on interpreting to breathless crowd noble joy must have filled composer a wrote full of artistic triumph a karls life have be never before have mounted soared so high a now when not pupil held hall enchained in moment own ambition have so splendidly realised for so long dropped dead martin knew now be master pupil no longer be master turn with what solemn joy did to sit learn to hear longed for myriad ear what be possible for even martin have never played like before even admiration be dead there be room for anything except listening admiration wonder delight laughter of joy might come when last note have sounded at present to listen be enough martin held last chord long then took hand off a if key be hot rose facing hall for too just then personal ambition be dead have played a david played before saul in order to drive from master face demon of agony that have seen there looked not at stella not at lady sunningdale not at frank helen did eye wander over crowded row straight at karl while hall grew louder louder till air be thick with sound still asking did play well when karl nodded to be content bowed in front of to right left thinking how kind be caught stella eye smiled frank helen lady sunningdales then sat down at piano again be quite impossible to begin for own amusement for now must be confessed be enjoying quite enormously struck octave rather sharply heard not faintest vibration from string above uproar so rose again bowed again still bowed bowed still till felt like chinese mandarin knew everybody must think so too then sat down waited till phlegmatic english public have said thank enough ten minute interval have be put down on programme tea be waiting for in room below forgot about went straight through recital be carefully chosen not to be too long in ordinary course of event audience must have be streaming out into street again after hour half refused to stream martin gave one encore after pause second be still wildly recalled once before in summer helen have sent london mad about afternoon did alone at last in despair be wholly delightful a hush fell on house again when sat down for fourth time played god save king solemnly through audience laughed departed lady sunningdale found that have left hand glove lost right foot shoe when came to take stock of what have happened a martin finally retired after god save king karl be sitting next dont speak to anybody said because there be nothing whatever to say be martin knew along yes shoe so tiresome dont know how happens thank monsieur rusoff stella dear start from victoria to morrow morning not charing cross what did tell when talked last do not see be martin if one speaks to will slap
