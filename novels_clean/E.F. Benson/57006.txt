accomplishment to be acquainted better still connected with who have done so best of to be identified with constitutes joy of life sir louis have profound admiration for wife son son wife perhaps reserve level of highest complacency for with busy loving glance at dazzling object round never really diverts gaze from own career be for own success in life that reserve most sincere respect while wife be thus in sense perfect snob a far a perfection can be attained in tentative world like other professor in great branch of knowledge specialize in one particular department be birth be of course great joy to lady mary marigold to see wife of cabinet minister of african explorer of ambassador pas out of dining room at conclusion of dinner while stand by door shaking admonitory finger at husband till bracelet rattle say now sir baronet dont be too long be joy also to to move to other end of table between ambassador cabinet minister say lady wont grudge excellency time to drink glass of port have small cigar most of love hour when manuvres be enacted with member of aristocracy a have happened several time in last year two for be really among tree top with for whom to exclusion of other guest finger bowl be provided on occasion be when royalty be present sort of seizure be liable to come upon for minute two one other sink back in chair in dazed condition consequent upon so much happiness foretaste of bliss of nirvana be theirs sir louis eye have be known to fill with happy happy tear on seeing prince show lady how to eat cherry backwards stalk first in early day of marriage when a mr marigold came back tired with day work to modest dwelling in oakley street birth be hobby instead of relaxing tired brain over perusal of trashy novel playing of fruitless game of patience like so many who have sense of value of time must sit tranquilly one on side of fireplace with reading lamp conveniently placed between dive into sunlit water of peerage one happy christmas day found that present of to other be copy of beautiful book after delicious coincidence kept pleasant custom up always presented other with peerage at christmas so now have of complete set for last twenty three year son oswald owen vivian lancelot be true to parental tradition tendency rapturous be day when at age of fourteen after hour of careful work gave mother on birthday gift have be secretly preparing for namely roll of own ancestry neatly illuminated be somewhat lop sided for very few marigold have be discoverable away away back went other line of descent through earl coronet innumerable till reached original unique king arrahmedear of donegal above whose glorious name have illuminated royal crown be entirely oswald owen vivian lancelot own idea when became engaged to daughter of marquis mother felt that have known must happen for year owing probably to large number of jew journalist brewer pawnbroker who have be ennobled during long liberal tenure of office particular brand of snobbishness have rather fallen into neglect many of brightest snob of mayfair consider cult of mere peerage somewhat victorian pursuit more earnest practitioner like lady mary sir louis marigold remain unaffected by such willowness argue that conferring of peerage be still symbol of success loyalist to core consider that who be good enough for king be good enough for besides have found by experience that actually do feel greater rapture in presence of royalty than in of subject of realm among subject of realm like duke better than marquis marquis than earl earl than viscount be not implied that pleasurableness of internal sensation must indicate to rank of total stranger whose name be ignorant of knowing name rank find that delight in converse with increase according to precedence many pleasure be wholly matter of imagination may be one hallucination be in case a in of other nervous disorder quite complete when year two ago lady mary be dangerously ill with appendicitis husband sensibly assuaged deep genuine anxiety felt for by going through day after day card of eminent people who have called to make enquiry prince very eminent one be so condescending a to call twice once on monday once on following thursday to day sir louis can not believe that better news doctor gave about lady on happy afternoon be somehow connected with magic of repeated visit have be mentioned that sir louis be in habit of calling wife princess have also be hinted that alludes to a sir baronet there be touch of badinage of playfulness in title below playfulness be substratum of seriousness for be descended from king so ancient that nobody know anything about be real baronet since title in ordinary use be that of mere knight others of intimate be accustomed to call sir baronet in order to mark difference between such people a provincial mayor eminent actor musician must be supposed too that be far from discouraging since have printed on card sir louis marigold bart mp in full may be unusual then there be unfortunately not many baronet who take proper pride in honour with sovereign have decorated ancestor marquis earl put degree of nobility on card instead of just calling lord surely baronet can not go wrong in following so august example there be custom of to perhaps exception may be taken for be habit when entertaining luncheon party at mere commoner be present be not frequent occurrence to step jauntily along in proper precedence to dining room leaving le exalted person to follow doe in careless unconscious manner manner be by mean put on walk in front of lowlier commoner instinctively doe not think about leg just take be perhaps scarcely necessary to add instinct be not so strong with a to go in before lady even if be own washerwoman for obligation of chivalry outweigh with even of nobility have always be so with true aristocrat be so with perhaps if suffragette be present might go on ahead for considers that woman who hold view on subject have unsexed in more indulgent moment alludes to a deluded wretch politics be of course tory tory prime minister honoured by recommending king to honour sir louis much time good deal of money spent in tory cause make quite likely that further honour will time conferred upon when if party ever get back into power be significant anyhow that have made several visit lately to herald college where shape of viscount coronet seemed to interest good deal for since motto of business life have proved so successful be prepare well in advance be likely that will apply in such matter a a well may safely be assumed that on happy day spoon fork will be found to be already engraved with honour conferred on to be sure must happen before lady mary brother finally succumbs to insidious bottle will find step lower than previous rank have be by becoming viscountess instead of remaining earl daughter on other hand will be temporary eclipse for can not be so very long before come from under cloud again on demise of dipsomaniac shine forth a independent countess whole affair have be talked out so constantly by that be sure to have come to wise decision based on true principle of snobbishness snobbishness be superficial thing with indeed with anybody spring from fountain a deep a of character religion now that between have got peerage practically by heart study though often read over favourite passage together no longer take much time conscious thought merely permeates like christianity moral quality tinge do do great many very kind considerate generous thing sir baronet be most liberal giver appeal made for deserving charitable object ever came to in vain deep in heart time that be signing munificent cheque thankful cry of poor folk have succoured sound in ear a murmur thank sir baronet bless sir baronet lady mary be equally open handed especially when child dumb animal be concerned declares can almost hear thumping of dog tail a strive to say thank lady bless ladyship kind heart occasionally out of mere exuberance sir baronet sound insincere note wrote once to oswald bidding bring wife to dinner in term bring lady along to dinner on tuesday week boy party just think princess told french ambassador duchess of middlesex be to take cutlet with time pen be so trembling with gratification for moment oswald thought father must have fit of shivering till truer explanation dawned on realized that usually neat careful handwriting be blurred with joy perhaps little insincerity be mark of most complete snob of who affect to make light of attainment towards holiest highest aspiration have be ever directed anyhow one must be sorry to think that sir baronet be sincere over for must imply that be getting used to ambassador duke that be becoming blas with surfeit of aristocracy must be too tragic fate for so thoroughly amiable as there be nothing more stimulating in drab world than to look at who intensely enjoy prosperity surround to see sir baronet stepping along piccadilly with springy walk ruddy face ready to be wreathed in smile a take off hat to social star be sufficient to reconcile cynic disappointed if have touch of humanity left in to world where people have wonderfully pleasant time perhaps if cynic be little simpler little more alive to possible joy of existence must share of rapture princely fortune be necessity to snob be possible to taste joy on modest competence character thoroughness be needful must read peerage till glamour grows about page must value aright little paragraph in newspaper record doings of mighty unless men be born with gift be true will not enter highest circle of paradiso must at least be able to leave inferno far below a matter of fact most people have touch just touch of snob innate in if will only take pain to look for may not have peerage mind probably there be sort of worldly success before be willing to truckle be worth little trouble in view of spiritual reward for snob always have aim in life never drift along purposeless existence chronicler be tempted to linger little over happy prosperous person forecast further glory inevitably await at present certain number of vere de veres turn up patrician nose when marigold be mentioned be exceedingly foolish of considering that be out of marigold that very best vere de veres have be made marigold will win eminence renown by industry rich colossal respectability be how vere de veres became cream of country instead of calling marigold tradesman must be wiser to hail a cousin who will buttress up of own tottering line if son daughter can only manage to marry into marigold by reinforcing with own vigorous blood wealth not least respectability in next generation oswald owen vivian lancelot will be earl of ballamuck viscount marigold child of whom have only eleven at present will be member of parliament hard working soldier diplomatist with peeress for sister when few more year have rolled vere de veres will have to respect for will be vere de veres good strong honest vere de veres pick of bunch for with healthy body active brain above untarnished respectability be precisely folk on whom honour

hungry looking visitor used to arrive at queer hour talk to enthralled pupil in excited manner about arterio sclerosis chromagens produce out of pocket little packet of tough food tasting of travelling bag masticated very thoroughly in space of square inch contained nutritive value of eight mutton chop two large helping of apple tart fortified by launched into function derangement of principal organ of body with almost obscene wealth of detail while mr weston used to sit in rapt attention to sybils long for dinner time to come in order that might thwart uric acid again pursued meatless course for several week with fanatic enthusiasm having be perfectly well before found that apart from slight falling away of flesh iron constitution stood strain remarkably well then while nut be yet in mouth so to speak struck that ought to go in for breathing exercise more thoroughly found that led straight into lap of wisdom of yogi philosophy instantly claimed whole attention steeped in manual advertised in morning post for guru individual in turban answered in person a after second visit found that illustration quack quack valuable ring be missing at bidding have taken

recommended by new ideal in life so also did practice in deep breathing for pranayama be entirely concerned with when have mastered posture pranayama must live in perfect health vigour a long a chose again superb physical health stood in good stead neither dislocated limb from posture have single stroke of apoplexy from holding breath during yogi attack husband ceased to take meal at carlton grill room for be allowed meat again in moderation always used to go out for walk when great breathing began in middle of morning since hated idea in next room jane be sitting cross legged on floor exhaling long held breath through one nostril while closed other with finger muttering om om long period of absolute silence alternated with muttering gave uncomfortable feeling to know jane be holding breath time away from chesterfield street image of be le vivid when returned for lunch posture be over too though rather stiff tired must declare that never have known before what real health meant be always pleasant hearing must congratulate on convalescence instantly repent of cordiality because urged just to do couple of posture day see how felt then misfortune within couple of day temporarily called turning point of life befell mr weston for caught chill manifestly from posturing on cold damp day in front of open window indicated presence by simultaneous attack of lumbago streaming cold in head latter made inhalation of breath through nostril quite impossible former posture so shut out from practice of pranayama posture came winging back from east happening to come across copy of christian science journal flew to bosom of mr eddy only regret be that have not left heathen fold in time to frustrate false claim of indisposition have taken firm painful hold of have scarcely learned by heart true statement of being when severity of symptom began sensibly to diminish in point of fact within three day be perfectly well again a might have be along if have only known in time that there be such thing a lumbago be there such thing a uric acid chromagens in consequence since there be nothing to fear from disorder have existence ordered excellent dinner that evening over ox tail soup fish roast pheasant of of ate heartily discoursed to husband on new truth have risen like dawn over previously benighted horizon such be ingratitude of man felt that must sooner have eaten dinner in silence at grill room than at home to accompaniment of such preposterous harangue when after dinner just a be settling down to game of patience jane asked to join with in recital of true statement of being replied with asperity that true statement of balderdash be fitter name for such nonsense christian science made mr weston brighter younger more robust than ever being quite convinced that there be such thing a discomfort evil disease death recognised with increased vividness that world be exceedingly pleasant place went about day with brilliant smile smile became rather hard fixed when small false claim put in appearance a for instance when fish bone seemingly stuck in throat when reciting true statement of being a went upstairs forgot last step tumbled rather heavily on to knee thus in semblance of choking of agonising pain in knee cap be necessary to tie smile on so to speak lest false claim must get foothold what made house more uncomfortable for husband be that false claim be ignored also so that if study fire be found not to be lit room in consequence like ice house instead of sympathising with over carelessness of housemaid jane continued to assure that there be such thing a cold though teeth be chattering in head got into touch with other sufferer from cheerful delusion who seemed to to resemble gargoyle with fixed inflexible smile attitude of determined hilarity house became perfect bedlam of invincible cheerfulness be depressing to last degree have moment of reviving hope when jane woke one morning with very plausible claim in wisdom tooth uninitiated must have called raging toothache hoped might convince learning by telephone from healer though pain must certainly vanish with absent treatment be permissible to go to dentist in order to save time for mere manipulation in other word having tooth out hope faded again mr eddy appeared have consulted dentist in such circumstance mr weston did same came home brighter than ever having have tooth extracted quite painlessly under laughing gas last thing have said to herself so triumphantly announced before went off be that extraction wouldnt hurt at didnt true statement of being have scored one triumph more in completely annihilating not only sense of pain commonsense also now insidiousness of fad be that be invariably based on something be true reasonable thus have appeal to reasonable person in be unlike superstition for superstition be in essence unreasonable mr weston must no more have bowed to new moon seen not through glass turned money than must have be made miserable by breaking looking glass knew perfectly well that fact of seeing new moon must not affect prosperity of investment while if amiable satellite have power over money must certainly exercise whether curtsied not embrace of vegetarian christian science faith be undoubtedly based on reason be true that fleshless food contained le uric acid than sirloin of beef be true also that if anybody else have slight headache that headache must in probability efface quicker if occupied in other matter instead of sitting down to think about headache denied in principle by disregarding be easily possible to stretch reasonable proposition too far make applicable to thing to doe not apply be exactly here that faddist begin to differ from reasonable people sufficiently excruciating pain can not be banished from consciousness be not slightest use asserting that doe not exist at point with regard to wisdom tooth became momentarily reasonable again have out with laughing gas like sensible person then mind rushed back again like air into exhausted receiver into vacuum of faddishness became happier more ridiculous than ever effect must never be denied faddist while convinced of fad be extremely cheerful a be natural to one who have found out be putting in practice secret of ideal existence made poor mr weston very uncomfortable since one of strongest characteristic of christian scientist be inhuman disregard of other people did not take notice of little thing like proceeded to make home unhappy with utter callousness be not way to attach for very long to one creed flew like bee gathering honey from flower to suck sweetness out of fad presently turned volatile mind to study of unseen world that suddenly felt to be surrounding christian science doubt have basis in unseen in application be chiefly concerned with bodily ailment discomfort true statement of being harnessed so to speak to congested liver sore throat now went deeper yet took final plunge of faddist credulous into sea of
