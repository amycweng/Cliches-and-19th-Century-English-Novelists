away say anything about be bad failure remember being very much vexed at time jack spoke dreamily a if be thinking of something else be way not to blaze abroad anything affected deeply like dodo must often dissect in superficial manner act a kind of showman to emotion did not care to turn inside out with thoroughness above a have just said hated knowledge of failure tried to conceal even from loved to show brighter side to world when be in society always put on best mental moral clothes be newest fitted most becomingly rag tatter be thrown deep into darkest cupboard key sternly turned on now then however a on occasion friend brought key with somewhat embarrassing openness manner prevented from putting back to door when be unlocked adopted tone of yes there be old thing in there believe may see oh certainly please shut after let anyone else in quite forget what be in there be so long since looked bertie be silent be on term of intimacy with other need ordinary word of condolence congratulation besides from own point of view inwardly congratulated jack be not sort of occasion on to tell congratulation rather than sympathy be what event demanded then jack went on still with air of spectator than of principal character dodo talked to good deal about marriage be sorry about for think that chesterford will be terribly disillusioned know doe take thing lightly be much too hopelessly fond of dodo ever to be content with what will grant a wife can not do anything told what thought not because hoped to make change in matter because wished to know for once in life have made failure bad hopeless mistake have be revenge come be after one must go home will go there evening will see chapter two jack went home meditating rather bitterly on thing in general have sense fate be not behaving very prettily to have dealt rather severe blow in april last have knocked down having knocked down now proceeded in most unsportsmanlike way to kick jack have great idea of fair play fate certainly be not playing fair must have liked to have few word with on subject world have be very kind on whole to have always be popular life though perhaps rather aimless be at least enjoyable since world have be kind to be generous to world in general to friend in particular have always held high opinion of a thoroughly healthy minded pleasant companion be disposed to hold similar opinion of consequently when dodo have refused that spring have not thought badly of did not blame get bitter about though have flattered that be used to dodo way have always recognised capability in way of surprising friend have not be quite prepared for news of engagement in fact be surprised also rather resentful chiefly against general management of mundane affair partly also against dodo dodo have not told of engagement have be left to find out for then again be engaged to man who be hopelessly entirely in love with for whom apart from quiet unemotional liking did not care two straw except in so far a be immensely rich have title two golden key unlocked most secret door of well furnished apartment known a society constituted dodo world hitherto position have be precarious have felt that be on trial personality great attractiveness talent have secured for certain footing on very dais of room have always known that unless married brilliantly must not be sure of position if married man who must not be always certain of commanding money position for must never have married wealthy brewer must command worst of if in unwillingness to accept anything best must get did not marry at dodo knew that never must have unquestioned position that felt be indispensable to jack knew perfectly well in fact dodo have referred to that morning accepted philosophically a being inevitable what did not like be being told that must not have done on general ground that be too fond of own way that must not have given dodo rein enough have known dodo too long too well when proposed to to have of lover traditional blindness to fault of love knew that be above thing strongly dramatic that moved with view to effect that be unscrupulous in what did that behaviour be sometimes in questionable taste swallowed whole so to speak be genuinely attached to felt that possessed quality that must most like to have in wife bertie have said to that morning that be stimulating must not wear well stimulating certainly be what lovable woman be not personally have known long did wear well hidden depth unsuspected willow be exactly what loved for one ever fell in love with canal though willow be commoner than depth presence be sometimes indicated by rather harsh jarring of keel yet believed fully sincerely in dark mysterious depth for love to lose in besides wife whose action thought be a perfectly calculable a accurately calculated a train in bradshaw be possessed of sterling quality however estimable be more suited to housekeeper than mistress reflection be outcome of intimate knowledge of dodo in mind of man who be in habit of being honest with object of love quality rare enough whether lover be rejected accepted have have time to think over matter quietly to knew have known for many week that dodo be out of reach sat down thought about inaccessible fruit not with keen feeling of one who still hoped to get with resignation recognised that fruit be desirable that must be regarded from purely speculative point of view to do justice though be very sorry for be much more sorry for chesterford chesterford be cousin have be brought up together at eton oxford knew with intimacy be result of year alone chesterford old friend have great respect liking for a dodo have said be honest man if like slight acquaintance called slow rather stupid be true on purely intellectual ground be very loyal very much devoted to what considered duty consisted in being excellent landlord jp of county in voting steadily for conservative party in house of lord in giving largely anonymously to good object in going to church on sunday morning where sang hymn with fervour read lesson with respect in managing hunt in liberal satisfactory manner in avoiding introspection speculation about problem of life being walked through world with upright gait without turning eye step to right hand left without ever concerning with what be not business directing undoubtedly sterling quality to that have perfect genius for doing duty nobody have ever called willow foolish nobody on other hand have ever called either deep clever have probably only made one real mistake in life be when asked dodo to marry have seen that jack who knew dodo well whose opinion might be considered to be based on good ground thought that dodo have committed first grand error in accepting worst of business certainly be that be in love with dodo if have be different sort of man if have proposed to dodo with same idea that dodo have when accepted if have wanted brilliant fascinating woman to walk through life with who must not fail to be popular end who must do duty of mistress of great house in regal fashion must not have chosen better what wanted in wife be someone to love loved dodo apparently have not entered calculation that in accepting might be doing from different standpoint from own in proposing to dodo have smiled on with air of benignant goddess who marries mortal when offered hand heart have taken that smile a fulfilment of own thought decidedly jack might have justification for feeling apprehensive jack only hope lay in vein did exist in dodo have manifested in outburst of tear night before put down to dramatic instinct to large extent knew there be something besides for dodo did not care to play to empty house presence of future husband alone constituted anything satisfactory audience jack have always have considerable belief in dodo attractiveness cleverness be of course beyond dispute required proof no more than fact that sun rose in morning believed in something deeper than prompted such action a felt that there be emotion that experienced at moment of tear be legitimate outcome a thought of there occurred to remark dodo have made that morning when expressed regret at never having felt sort of love that knew chesterford felt for mr vane be perhaps perfectly happy that night be not daughter engaged to marquis millionaire be not house going to be filled with brightest best of land have often felt rather resentful against dodo who alternately liked despised people whom mr vane must have given right hand to be in position to like hand to be in position to despise dodo be excellent friend with london only london did not come seek her at own house preferred asking to theirs consequently on mr vane maud devolved comparatively menial duty of leaving card of dodo attending in capacity of necessary adjunct must be asked to same house a dodo be when got there have privilege of seeing dodo performing brilliant evolution somehow none of dodo glory got reflected on to to be mirror of dodo be one of mr vane most cherished idea did not recollect that there be many substance whose nature forbids acting a such to most brilliant of illumination mr vane be kept still more in background be generally supposed that be looking after affair in country whilst rest of family be amusing in london be well known that be proprietor of flourishing iron foundry somewhere in lancashire apparently iron needed special care during month of may june july in case be shadow in background rather than skeleton at banquet whom be not necessary to ignore because never appeared in position in must be ignored mr vane have two principal object in life first of be to live up to dodo second to obtain in course of time suitable brilliant son in law latter of object have be practically obtained by dodo herself first of be in measure realised by large brilliant company who assembled in room night mr vane be large high coloured woman of about middle age whose dress seemed to indicate that must rather not that of course may only have be fault of dressmaker have effusive manner sometimes made guest wonder what must have done to have made so particularly glad to see constantly lamented mr vane absence from london remarked with brilliant smile that felt quite deserted mr vane smile always suggested reformed vampire who have permanently renounced bloodthirsty habit have not quite got out of way of gloating on must have be victim in unregenerate day be only fair to say that impression be due to immensity of smile must hardly be honestly accounted for by uncharitable world be busily employed in receiving guest when jack came be perhaps more stupendously cordial than ever so kind of to come be just saying to previous arrival when jack came in know dodo be dying to see be congratulated darling said turning to maud run tell dodo that lord burwell have arrived so good of to come how do do dear mr broxton of course dodo have told of happiness thanks yes be charmed with engagement marquis be cousin be not how nice may tell maud may call cousin jack such pleasure to have dodo be simply expiring to see did see morning really never told of sweet child usually tell everything dodo be playing amiable white elephant to purpose be standing under large chandelier in centre of room with chesterford beside receiving congratulation with utmost grace talking nonsense at highest possible speed jack thought to that have never seen anyone so thoroughly charming brilliant almost wondered whether have not be doing injustice day saw be impossible to get near for present so wandered off among other group exchanging greeting salutation have made circuit of room be standing about near door feeling little lonely when dodo came quickly towards be looking rather white impatient come away out of jack said be horrible have done duty now want to talk have be smiling grinning till cheek be nearly cracked everyone say exactly same thing come to room come turned round beckoning to found face to face with chesterford dear old boy said to be not going to bore more to night will bore enough after

spirit have accepted dodo rejection of a quite final never intended to open closed book again be too horrible felt genuine impulse of pure compassion for chesterford irritated disgust for dodo dodo be admirable comrade for thought admirable wife idea of in comradeship with chesterford be too absurd if must never be comrade by what perversity of fate be that be going to become wife jack serenity be quite gone wondered what have become of be conscious of be chafing refusal to acquiesce just yet anticipation of somewhat intimate talk with dodo felt half inclined to run away from house not see again a followed up to room began to think that wisdom have followed serenity after if asked again about resolution to marry chesterford what be doing continuing conversation have in park that morning in dodo have taken initiative thing be on knee of god thought jack to piously a door of dodo room closed behind dodo threw down in low arm chair with air of weariness go on talking to jack said

smiled on whole think be sheer nonsense said yes will come dodo swept prettiest little curtsey how good of said good night jack be cross really be worth while can behave so prettily if like oh such nice gentleman expect be worth while said jack chapter three there be particular beauty about thames valley for may search for year elsewhere not find splendid lavishness in way that wood be cast down broadcast along river princely extravagance of thick lush hayfield seem determined not to leave spare inch of land between water whole scene have be constructed with noble disregard of expense in way of water land warm wood land air tall clean limbed beech tree have room to stretch great lazy arm without being prosecuted for clumsy trespass squirrel that chatter at from green house seem to have quite unusual sleekness about insolent criticism to other about walk general personal unattractiveness be inspired by larger share of animal spirit than of other squirrel a row gently up in middle of stream may see heron standing in willow too lazy to fish too supremely confident to mind approach of anything so inferior a from cool shadow of wood may hear old cock pheasant talking to not troubling to practise new original method of rocketing in june for know that time be not yet at time of year too need not trouble to look round to see if there be large boat full of noisy people bearing down on like pheasant time be not yet now then long string of creamy bubble appearing on deep quiet water sound rich in association of cool plunge into frothy stream warns that lock be near above may see small village clustering down to river edge to drink of sweet coolness couple of shaggy footed cart horse looking with mild wonder at unexpected method of locomotion lifting dripping nose from bright gravelly willow to stare at before proceed to finish evening watering dodo be very fond of thames valley really enjoyed giving up day of june in london to wood water be to start quite early in morning dodo explained everyone be to wear very oldest clothes for be going to play duck drake drink milk in dairy pick buttercup get entirely covered with freckle dodo never freckled be conscious of looking rather better for slight touch of sun must be very dear of mr vivian if must come too if did mind being silly day if so must call for a be on way chesterford of course be going jack maud mother be quite small party be jack dear mr vane have got hold of certain idea about mr vivian distinctly founded on fact be one of woman who can not help making impression how be done exactly what be one must be puzzled to define everyone noticed when came info room be aware when went out be not personal appearance for be short rather than tall stout rather than graceful certainly middle aged rather than young dodo have mentioned effect produced on many people felt in same way that mr vivian be somehow on higher plane than that mind be cast in larger mould happily for peace of mind such people be not very common most of fellow men be luckily much on same level be not more than unit among unit mr vivian be much more than unit dodo have said of that be two three at least evidently nothing be further from mr vivian wish than trying to make impression in fact very impressive element be rather due to extreme naturalness be most of so accustomed to see people behave to behave ourselves in manner not quite natural that to see anyone who never doe so be in calculated to make one rather nervous mr vivian evidently intended to take life up again at point where have left off so to speak in other word at period before marriage of husband perhaps le said better died owing to accident after ten year of married unhappiness left mr vivian poorer than have be before after death have travelled abroad for two year then returned to england to live with sister who have married rich judge kept house rather magnificently in prince gate lady fuller have always disapproved of sister marriage be heartily glad to see well quit of husband on return to england received with open arm begged on behalf of husband to make home hers mr vivian accordingly settled down in extremely commodious house in prince gate a said took up life where have left off standing grievance that husband have have with be that interested in poor in east end slum that went to cabman shelter espoused cause of overdriven factory girl have told that be meddling with other people business that nothing be so objectionable a assumption of charitable air that woman who went to ball dinner party be hypocrite if pretended to care about state of poor that only did because wished to appear unlike other people altogether failed to perceive that action be entirely uninfluenced by impression be to make mistook extreme naturalness for subtlest affectation however mr vivian resolutely banished from mind remembrance of ten year being unable to think of husband with tenderness affection preferred to forget married life altogether vane have be neighbour in country for many year have known dodo since be child dodo have once asked to accompany in visit to east end have be immensely struck by what saw determined to be charitable too sort of thing seemed extremely chic to dodo observant mind so took up factory of miserable match girl asked to tea got mr vivian to promise help when afternoon came dodo particularly wished to go to morning concert on mr vivian arrival found indeed plenty of match girl dodo dodo came back later made extremely fascinating kissed cleanest of girl patted rest on shoulder sang several delightful little french song to to own accompaniment on banjo thanked mr vivian for being such dear about slum on next occasion when have nothing to do called on mr vivian to ask to be taken to of darling little slum mr vivian hinted that though must be charmed to take thought that dodo have perhaps forgotten that four in hand club met day in hyde park dodo have forgotten a have bespoken box seat on one of friend coach hurried home again feeling freshly borne in upon mr vivian thought be very contemptible indeed altogether mr vivian knew dodo well when went home that evening thought good deal about approaching marriage be glad to have have occasion of speaking to jack seemed to to be worth doing for knew that ran risk of being told in chillingly polite english that be stepping outside province that jack did not belong to east end class who welcomed charitable hand have remarkably keen eye intuitive perception told at once jack sense of justice of remark must stifle feeling might have be officious meddlesome event have justified decision in course of next few day met jack several time went to water party dodo spoke of took opportunity to cultivate acquaintance be sitting on bank of river below clivedon wood little apart from others felt that a have behaved so well owed apology be very nice of mr broxton said to be so polite to last night to tell truth did know though did

much prefer striking out altogether seemed to have quite unreasonable preponderance chesterford did not usually make joke in fact have never heard make one before remark about standing on head seemed to be only accounted for by perplexing factor dodo have read about love in poem novel have seen something of too remained puzzle to hoped calculation might not prove distressingly incorrect owing to inconvenient factor laughed with habitual sincerity replied what good idea let do to morrow morning will ten suit can let window in house round be sure there must be crowd to see really must be

be expected home on th of december marriage took place late in august have gone off on yacht directly afterwards in order to spend few warm month in mediterranean dodo have written home occasionally to mr vane now then to jack to jack letter have never be more than word two simply saying that be enjoying enormously that jack have be hopelessly wrong mr vane also have much reason to be satisfied have spent autumn in variety of fashionable watering place where dress have always be awe wonder of town have met many acquaintance to whom have poured out rapture over dodo marriage have declared that chesterford be most charming that dodo be quite adam eve in paradise that be really quite jealous of dodo when left england have intended to spend winter abroad not come back till february early in december telegram have arrived at winston lord chesterford country house saying that must be back in ten day about same time jack received letter saying that change of plan be solely owing to fact that dodo be rather tired of sea weather be bad that have never be so happy in life dodo eagerness to assure jack of struck a being in rather bad taste ought to have entirely ignored warning happiness of newly married woman ought to be so absorbing a to make be unaware of existence of other people consciousness in dodo of triumphant superiority of knowledge led to suppose be right rather than wrong be unfeignedly sorry not to be sure that have be right when told dodo that wished to be jealous of chesterford be quite sincere since must not have dodo at rate let make someone happy dodo also informed that be going to have house party that christmas that must come have asked mr vivian to show that be afraid of longer maud be coming wished jack must marry then followed dozen other name

proposed to remained secret maud on other hand be philistine be one of dodo merit that did not drop who originally have claim on when became fashion be constantly trying to bring maud into notice maud resisted most well meant shove have none of dodo vivacity talent in fact talent lay chiefly in direction of arranging place at dinner party in doing great deal of unnecessary worsted work what happened to worsted work nobody ever knew be chiefly remarkable for predominance of irregularity suggestion of damaged good about in consequence of much handling to dodo seemed incredible stupidity that anyone must do worsted work if did do not do well used to tell maud that be done much more cheaply in shop much better then maud must drop for time take to playing piano be even more oppressively stupid to dodo mind than worsted work maud have perfect genius for not letting right hand know what left hand be doing principle be abhorrent to dodo in application consequence of be that dodo be apt to regard sister a failure though still a in present instance liked giving maud what considered helping hand must be confessed that dodo effort be not altogether unselfish liked environment to be a great success a a thus added to own completeness just a picture look better in good frame than in shabby one maud however have desire to be success be perfectly happy to sit in background do worsted work longed to be let alone at time must make escape to iron work try to cultivate domestic virtue in attending to father thought with kind of envy of daughter of country clergyman whose mediocre piano playing be invaluable to penny reading village concert for whose worsted work there be constant demand in view of old woman almshouses have hoped that dodo slumming experience must bring into connection with side of life have dispensed tea bun with kind of rapture on occasion of dodo tea party sister have dropped slum a have seen at point maud be too shy uninitiative to take up alone have

london when be first engaged told to go on smoking must have cigarette too sat on talking till saw be tired then went away though must hardly let communication have only effect of making jack rather uncomfortable knowing what did knew that be not genuine on dodo part be obviously effort to keep up to use vulgar term since be not genuine doubt occurred a to whether of be jack have profound belief in dodo dramatic talent that need for keeping up have appeared already be alarming symptom real tragedy must begin on day when dodo first failed to do so from moment jack regarded prophecy a certain to be fulfilled overture have begun in course of time curtain must rise on grim performance drove up to door entered large oak panelled hall hung round with portrait of family night be cold there be fire sparkling in wide open grate a entered old collie who be enjoying fruit of well spent life on hearthrug stretched great tawny limb shoved welcoming nose into chesterford hand produced heartburning of keenest order in mind of small fox terrier pup who consisted mainly of head leg latter evidently considered at present more a preventive towards walking than aid being unable to reach hand puppy contented with sprawling over boot making vague snap at collie be characteristic of chesterford that animal liked have tender regard for feeling of anything be dependent on dodo thought almost inexplicable disliked to see animal in pain because usually howled dumb anguish of dog who considers neglected conveyed nothing to from within door to right came sound of talking laughter there be something pathetic in sight of beautiful home owner standing with back to fire a jack divested of coat chesterford be so completely happy so terribly unconscious of what jack felt sure be going on looked model of typical english gentleman with tall stature well bred face jack remembered passing on road labourer who be turning into cottage firelight have thrown bright ray across snow covered road inside have caught momentary glimpse of wife with baby in arm couple of girl laying table cloth remembered afresh dodo remark about waiting until chimney smoked devoutly hoped that chimney of well appointed house be in good order chesterford led way to drawing room door pushed open for jack to enter dodo be sitting at tea table talking to half dozen people who be grouped round a jack

than elsewhere discoverer be sitting in chair next talking to with something of air of showman exhibiting trick of performing bear manner seemed to say see what intelligent animal full sublimity of lord ledger remark have not struck till moment miss grantham be delivering herself of variety of opinion in high penetrating voice oh did never hear sing last year be saying to lord ledger mr broxton must have heard have most lovely voice simply sings into inside feel a if someone have got hold of heart be stroking know how sound produce that effect went with dodo once simply wept flood be too far gone for that have put little stopper on tear bottle though be dying to cry must always wonder how sorry be when cry said lord ledger in smooth low voice always strike that people who cry probably feel most oh be horrid unfeeling monster remarked miss grantham be what come of being man just because be not in habit of cry think that have emotion stoically repress now cultivate emotion must walk ten mile day in order to have emotion must mr broxton obviously depends on what sort of emotion must find when walked there said jack there be emotion must walk further to avoid oh of course common emotion litany thing a dodo call said miss grantham dismissing lightly with wave of hand what like be nice little sad emotion make feel so melancholy know what to do with mean death sort of thing seeing someone love being dreadfully unhappy extremely prosperous at same time be rather expensive for people love said jack oh must make sacrifice said miss grantham be quite worth while if gratify friend must not mind being acutely unhappy if must dissect own emotion have photographed sent round to friend what charming album might make said lord ledger page miss grantham heart in acute stage page mortification setting in page lachrymatory gland permanently closed by tenor voice poor old chesterford thought jack be rather hard on chesterford be not to be pitied just now for dodo be devoting exclusive conversation to in defiance of duty a hostess be recounting to how have spent moment of absence at station certainly be keeping up magnificently at present mr vivian come to morrow be saying like chesterford must be awfully good to take to see drunken idler in village will be dear of be just what like have sort of passion for drunken cabman who stamp on wife if stamped on little evening must cultivate to extent will lie down on floor for to begin chesterford leant back in chair in kind of ecstasy ah dodo said be wonderfully good to must go write two note before dinner must amuse guest be very glad jack have come be very good chap make apostle dodo laughed will make little golden hoop for like apostle in arundels for when nobody else be there can take off play hoop with expect apostle did that when went for walk must wear round hat must miss grantham instantly annexed dodo dodo said come take part gentleman say must cultivate emotion not that quite corrected jack said be expensive for friend if have to make miserable in order to afford food for emotion now be that selfish said miss grantham with air of martyr at stake here be ready to be drawn quartered for anyone amusement tell be sorry for part that cost too much maud come off sofa take up dagger for too unselfish woman expect know much about thing said maud maud must not go further than wrapping in winding sheet of blue worsted remarked dodo incisively maud flushed little oh dodo exclaimed deprecatingly be use hitting maud said dodo pensively might a well hit feather bed now if hit jack will hit

use except at meal time expect will play afterwards must make bertie sing too there be dressing bell be going to be gorgeous to night in honour of jack jack found making quantity of reflection when retired to room night became aware that have enjoyed more that evening than have done for very long time questioned a to when have enjoyed so much be distinctly perturbed to find that answer be when have last spent evening with dodo have formed excellent habit of being exactly honest with concluded that dodo presence have be cause of be very unpleasant blow to have accepted refusal with honest determination to get over have not moped pined striven cried have intention of dying of broken heart stubborn fact remained that dodo exercised unpleasantly strong influence over must have repeated without effort have said that night have not said anything particularly remarkable somehow felt that most striking utterance of other men woman must not have produced such effect on really be very inconvenient dodo have married man who adored for whom did not care two pin head man be one of oldest friend decidedly there be something left handed about particular disposition of destiny worst of be that chesterford be being hopelessly duped about that felt doubt dodo acting be so remarkably life like that mistook at present for reality play must end time sequel be too dark involved to be lightly followed out must not conceive why elaborate drama on dodo part did not disgust more wished have be deceived by having be behind scene have seen dodo a be in green room putting on rouge powder failing that wished that wholesome impulse of disgust contempt have superseded previous feeling with regard to believed with under circumstance be best thing to do marriage be grand mistake true given be not simply so many week of unhappiness saved then have immense pity for dodo original mistake have told once that be more responsible for philosophy than for fact that happened to be five foot eight in height have black eye black hair be nature doing have said go quarrel with blame if have made must have given high ideal must have have something to live up to now have ideal whole system of thing seems to immense puzzle have given up trying to find solution know what like what dislike can blame for choosing one avoiding other like wealth success society admiration in degree have secured more secure more reason have to be satisfied to do otherwise must be like putting on boot be too large for be excellent for other people not for can not accept ideal that feel can understand can sympathise with can do wish be mine a nature have denied must make best of what have jack felt hopeless against kind of reasoning angry with for letting woman have such dominion over in measure felt capable of view bounded by horizon not so selfishly fatalistic idea of smoking chimney in cottage did not seem to matter provided that dodo be sitting on other side of hearthrug must willingly have sacrificed anything else to allow to give full rein to thought on point grand barrier stood between dodo be not so much refusal of existence of husband at jack pulled up sharp there be certain feeling of loyalty still rank above other emotion miss grantham must certainly have classed such among litany thing there be nothing heroic about simply consisted in sturdy refusal to transgress even in vaguest thought code deal with most ordinary commonplace virtue vice there be nothing heroic in street boy passing by baker cart without grab at loaf sound almost puritanical to forbid to cast glance at inhale sniff of warm fragrance certainly side of morality be remarkably dull thought jack worst of be that be not only dull difficult with practice most of must become simeon stylite provided be gifted with steady head constitution defies shower be commonplace act of loyalty ordinary rational demand of friendship society be so dreadfully taxing to most of who have misfortune not to be born saint then jack began to feel ill used why deuce must chesterford be born marquis not what have done to have title fortune dodo have be given chance to do struck that reflection be deplorably commonplace that position ought to be made much more of wondered whether sort of situation be always so flat in novel there be always touch of heroic in faithful friend who be loyal to cousin steadily avoids cousin wife here be in identically same situation feeling not at heroic only discontented quarrelsome with ill managed world decidedly must go to bed owing to certain habit that have formed early in life slept soundly morning found not only alive remarkably well hearty with certain eagerness to follow up what have thought out on previous night be in excellently managed household imposed rule on inhabitant except that must do what felt most inclined to do be in congenial company digestion be good be distressing how important material matter be to deeper emotion do form kind of

uncomfortable have satisfaction of believing that what dodo said about be true have come to same conclusion two night ago believed that must stop short of act of disloyalty did not care about hearing dodo give so gratuitous testimonial before miss grantham gentleman whom mentally referred to a as of showman front door opened blast of cold wind came blustering round into inner hall where be sitting making thick tapestry portiere belly fill like ship sail when wind first catch collie pricked ear thumped tail on floor with vague welcome mr vivian entered followed by lord chesterford looked

joined triumph overhead moved away strong to end there be dead silence dodo be standing by door with lip slightly parted feeling that there be something in world better bigger perhaps than own little hair splittings small emotion with in mind looked across to where chesterford be standing movement be purely instinctive must neither have accounted for be conscious of in eye there be suggestion of unshed tear look of questioning shame though few bar of music can not change nature of weakest of dodo be far from weak be intensely impressionable moment have for germ of possibility might who must

have be up quite long time perhaps 'd like to see baby before go oh said good night to baby said dodo think will go to bed wish 'd send wilkins here bent over kissed forehead softly ah darling darling whispered dodo lay with half shut eye good night dear said languidly chapter eight question about man be apt to say that alone can judge be usually exactly question in judgment be most likely to be at fault for concern very intimately truth express by saying that alone can judge about for very reason emotion be apt to colour what considers sober decision jack be exactly in position when left chesterfords door that afternoon be only six o'clock when went away wished to be alone to think about house seemed stuffy unsuggestive ordered horse sat fuming frowning till came round fidgeted edged away from pavement when tried to mount said get out brute with remarkable emphasis asked groom whether have yet learned to hold horse quiet be sufficient to show that be in perturbed frame of mind row be rather empty for great race meeting be going on jack cantered quickly up to end cursed stupidity for not having gone to sandown then put horse to quiet pace determined to think matter out have left chesterfords in january with full realisation of position be in love with dodo perhaps more deeply than ever dodo be hopelessly irrevocably out of reach only thing left to be done be to get over ordinary circle leisurely duty be quite impossible just at present adopted traditional english method of travelling shooting unoffending animal whether absence of faith be responsible be open question at rate remedy did not result in cure be intensely bored with foreign country be quite a distasteful a england on whole have le to offer came back to london again a suddenly a have left only remembered one incident in four month abroad gave pleasure be when received letter from dodo at berlin said nothing particular wound up with little mild chaff on absurdity of going abroad at hope be really better wrote dodo though did know that be in immediate danger of breaking down when left anyhow come back london be particularly wholesome to tell truth be just wee bit dull be conceited of course came back be good remaining abroad yawning in front of sistine madonna who in impossible serene mildness have message whatever for wanted to see dodo why on earth must be only thing really cared about be quite out of reach where be harm for two day after arrival in london be still undecided made effort to see on third day note came london be a bad a dresden again where be harm wrote note saying must come then tore that up sent refusal offering excuse after have gone parted from with word that must come again next day ah how sweet be to see again such be fact upon jack wished to form conclusion indecision be really too annoying what be use of conscience took sugar out of tea yet must not prevent from drinking be not strong enough to prevent going to see dodo took malicious line of making visit a little enjoyable a possible well must be settled one way other problem obviously depended on one question did desire for dodo grow stronger with seeing decided that did not make much difference to quality degree of longing on other hand society gave inestimable pleasure when have refused year ago have gone on seeing day after day without horrible unsatisfied emptiness have felt abroad that absorbing craving for remembered began when be on wedding tour then why not see freely frequently harm must possibly come out of dodo thought cared for only a cared for dozen other friend why must then who cared so deeply for cut off from again deep rooted affection respect for husband be immense safeguard quixotism be doubtful virtue at best decidedly out of date besides what must dodo think if suddenly found that one of best friend invariably declined to meet under circumstance must certainly guess reason if there be one possible solution of stupid problem more undesirable than be that jack made up mind well be settled here be bertie riding down upon felt a if wished to record deliberate sober conclusion joined force rode up together then jack said suddenly bertie have be making fool of be better now that good said bertie placidly there be something indefinably soothing about bertie manner jack determined to be more explicit be often relief to tell friend one own resolution especially if one doe not expect unseasonable objection be about dodo said see be dreadfully in love with awkward be devilish said bertie without shade of emotion passing over face le see of said jack worse get so have determined that more see of in ordinary way better sound unusual treatment know must acknowledge gave other method fair chance went killed pig in austria climbed matterhorn must do rode on little time in silence then bertie said do want advice well yes said jack rather dubiously then be dashed if like jack said be too dangerous just think jack broke in see friendship for chesterford be absolute safeguard dodo give more pleasure than anyone know when ca see life becomes unbearable chesterford be one of men to whom one must do mean thing furthermore dodo doe love if two fact ensure safety know what must besides bertie be not rascal ca like said bertie if one have propensity for falling into fire be a well to keep off hearthrug know be not rascal be thing one ca argue about be matter of feeling know said jack have felt too think be outweighed by other consideration if thought mischief must come of must deserve to be horse whipped like repeated bertie stolidly jack went to see dodo next afternoon for many afternoon during next fortnight might have be seen on chesterford doorstep coming going husband seemed almost a glad a dodo that jack must come often visit be obviously very pleasant to have begun to talk nonsense again a fluently a ever with jack however have rather serious talk future appeared to be exercising mind somewhat jack life at time be absolutely aimless before have gone abroad have be at bar have be called chamber now knew no more have home duty being a dodo expressed poor little orphan of six foot two have enough money for idle bachelor life dodo took very real interest in career of friend be part of completeness a have said before to be centre of set of successful people jack must do very well

indeed said to be far from wishing not to dangle if be to be profession must do more systematically lady wrayston be here yesterday said one ever saw now be lazy be neglecting work jack be silent few minute truth of matter be that be becoming so preoccupied with dodo that be acquiring real distaste for other society day seemed to have dwindled down to hour two hour according to time passed with dodo interval between leaving house one day returning to next have got to be merely tedious period of waiting must gladly have dispensed with in such interval society appeared to not distraction laborious substitute for inaction labour at time be not congenial to life in fact be series of conscious pulse with long drawn pause in between be dimly aware that sort of thing must not go on for ever machine must stop get quicker slower there be endless complication imminent in case know really care for dangling said jack discontentedly at same time be least objectionable form of amusement well ca dangle for ever in case said dodo ought to marry settle down chesterford be sort of apotheosis of dangler by performing with scrupulous care quantity of little thing that matter much like being jp handing offertory plate be in way quite busy man to at least though nothing must happen if ceased doing of thing dangler who think busy be happiest of men because get advantage of dangling none of disadvantage conscience have got conscience jack so far from pricking tell be doing whole duty of man then again be married to too be profession in ah ca be married to too remarked jack be absurd said dodo really jack wish 'd marry someone else sha' think unfaithful flatter that must said jack with touch of irritation dodo looked up rather surprised at hard ring in voice thought wiser to ignore last remark never can quite make out whether be ambitious not said now then make feel a if must rather like to go live in small cathedral town shock canon suggested jack not necessarily cultivate sheer domesticity be very domestic in way bertie must do admirably in cathedral town 'd be dreadfully happy among dull people must think so brilliant charming bishop must ask over to dine at palace whenever anyone came down from london be not ambitious in way of wanting to score small success said jack anyone can score mind flying at high game missing if miss of course have to load again

for time at rate much more interested in jack prospect a concerned than a bore on what be upshot of observation asked jack hardly knew whether to feel relieved slighted be dodo apparent unconsciousness of tenor of what have said genuine affected on that felt great deal depended whether be genuine not matter be closed for present dodo repeated question observation on on world in

be middle class view of love marriage more think of more feel that love be illusion think of people who marry for love get eternally tired of other afterwards ca keep up lover grow into friend friend into enemy be enviable one who remain friend be better to marry a friend than a lover because in latter case there be reaction disappointment may perhaps ruin friendship be wise woman jack think will

ear whether imagined that must be happy for ever ever if must once settle there know be saying most frightfully unconventional thing to other said dodo be very sorry for jack will administer consolation when said 'no to did with real regret with different sort of feeling to must have have if have said 'no to chesterford be quite unreasonable feeling must define think must have be because then jack recovered self respect in moment by one of strange contradiction in nature urged to stop ear to what week before have be almost tempting to say ah stop stop said know what be saying dodo wo do think of chesterford chesterford baby said dodo softly believe be right jack be unprofitable jack since renounce let still be friend let have made difference to try realise that be illusion dodo half turned towards with long glance in brown eye little smile playing about mouth yes yes said jack laughing nervously told bertie so other day have be madman for hour be over will turn wheeled horse

worst part of for duty lie with must comfort must make feel that have got left be terribly broken will be brave for sake be brave for dodo sighed wearily suppose be right said will come turned looked round on to gay scene row be full of rider bright with flooding sunlight oh be cruel said only wanted to be happy may even be that what be good of if may enjoy why be baby ever born wish never have be what good doe do anyone must suffer mr vivian felt horribly helpless baffled how must appeal to woman who looked at everything from only own standpoint come dodo said drove back in silence chesterford be standing in hall a entered waiting for came forward to meet dodo poor poor darling said be very hard on can bear together dodo dodo turned from passionately left standing there dodo be sitting in

baby death have felt immense pride in having provided heir be use be over might a well never have be born a day wore on felt overwhelming disgust of day be to follow darkened house quieted movement enforced idleness if only one knew dodo felt that must fling at once very minute into outside world again what be use of retirement only made bad job worse surely when misfortune come on one be best to forget a soon a possible dodo eminently practical way of forgetting anything be to absorb in something else what sensible man david be thought went oiled suppose be equivalent of putting on one very best evening dress felt inward laughter more than half hysterical a to what must happen if went oiled chesterford got up went languidly across to window lord chesterford room be on story below be built on wing by window looked out on side of house looking down saw kneeling at table with face buried in hand dodo be conscious of lump rising in throat went back to chair sat down again be such

not a meek a moses be capable of sense of injustice know that did consult much said mean to go in case very well said dodo do mean to go good night old boy sha' be very late mean to quarrel with lord chesterford turned into room must not keep dodo a wished to go even if must have done so ledger be waiting in carriage oh devil said dodo a stepped in lady bretton ball be still talked about believe in certain circle though ought to have be consigned with other event of last year to oblivion be very brilliant several prince shed light of presence on a lord ledger be heard to remark afterwards there be many prince there be only one dodo felt a if be adapting quotation from koran be somehow suitable to positive solemnity of occasion dodo can only be described a having be indescribable lucas lady bretton eldest son in honour of whose coming of age ball be given can hardly allude to even now emotion expressed feebly in dressing with even more care than usual in hanging round eaton square in leaving card on chesterfords a often a be decent dodo be conscious of frenzied desire to make most of to drown remembrance for in background of mind be picture that did not care to look at there be man knew leaning over small dead child door of room be half open woman brilliantly dressed be turning to go out looking back over shoulder with smile half of impatience half of pity at kneeling figure in room through half open door came sound of music rhythmical step blaze of light picture have started unbidden into dodo mind a ledger drove up to lady bretton door with such sudden clearness that half wondered whether have ever actually seen reminded of one of orchardson silent well appointed tragedy in case gave rather unpleasant twinge determined to shut out for rest of evening to do justice one must have guessed that dodo brilliance be due to anything pure spontaneity that even in deepest shade of inmost mind there be remembrance that needed effort to stifle many woman though few men be surprised to see there there be one who be not glad question arose more than once in mind of two three people must society stand if did happen to be dodo have treated select party of friend to private exhibition of skirt dancing during supper time music from band be quite loud enough to be heard distinctly in small rather unfrequented sitting out room there dodo have displayed incomparable grace of movement limb to highest advantage dodo danced that night with unusual perfection who have not felt exquisite beauty of such motion figure clad in long clinging fold of diaphanous almost luminous texture stood out like radiant statue of dawn against dark panelling of room graceful figure bending way that wonderful white arm now holding aside long skirt clasped above head above supreme distinction conscious modesty of posture seemed to little circle who saw to be almost new revelation of perfection of form colour grace jack knew dodo pretty well stood wondered be devil be tiger be after woman dodo have told what have happened that evening yet did not condemn utterly knew how prison like life must have be to during last month be thousand pity that dodo meat be chesterford poison no more blamed dodo for eating meat than blamed chesterford for avoiding poison to advance conventional argument against dodo that behaviour be not usual be equivalent to saying why do behave like rather than why behave like other people dodo estimate of a purely normal be only instance of very abnormalness on whole be not devil other question be harder to settle jack remembered tigress have seen that day with at zoo brute have small perfectly fascinating tiger cub in took certain maternal pride when feeding time came near cub continued to be importunate gave cuff with big velvety paw sent staggering to corner dodo tiger cub be mixture between chesterford dead child dodo feeding time have come round here be feeding with enviable appetite where be cub tigress element be not wholly absent yet withal be woman be that certain attribute of pure womanliness run through female of animal woman have touch of tigress about jack felt incompetent to decide dodo dance came to end accepted prince waldenech arm went down to supper a advanced to dodo dropped curtsey stooped kissed hand brute thought jack a strolled out into ballroom where people be beginning to collect again many turned looked at dodo a passed out with handsome partner glow of exercise excitement success burned brightly in cheek one accused dodo of using rouge supper be spread on number of small table laid for four six prince led to empty one sat down by side have seen many beautiful thing said in french permit man to say more than may in english none so beautiful a what have seen to night dodo be far too accomplished coquette to pretend not to know what meant made charming little obeisance politeness required that of highness said be only due know can never give due said due in case be knowledge have pleased dodo felt suddenly little uncomfortable forgotten picture flashed for moment across inward eye spoke of other thing praised prettiness of ballroom excellence of band lady bretton have given fine setting to diamond said prince diamond be not hers dodo laughed be little ponderous deserved to be told so austrian have beautiful manner said be too serious english be always accused of sharing that fault anyhow when pay compliment have at least air of not meaning what say be fault of english of compliment one mean what say when pay compliment said dodo be only kind of formula to avoid unpleasantness of saying nothing austrian seldom pay compliment said when do mean ouf said dodo that sound homelike to doe austrian say 'ouf ' in book do really say 'ouf by way what bald way of saying need expect more to night really prince be rather unflattering to excuse understand perfectly be not fishing for more come there be pa de quatre beginning be 'old kent road ' tune be much best what do suppose 'knocked in old kent road ' mean foreigner have ever be able to translate to yet be dance be o dear night gone feel a if have begun yet people be in bed now what waste of time know ball went on on dodo seemed to gather fresh strength brilliance with hour extra dance be added still added many who be tired with dancing stayed watched prince went away nobody noticed departure if cleopatra have suddenly entered ballroom must have found at discount be culmination of dodo success seemed different in kind a well a in degree from crowd around pretty woman seemed suddenly plain middle aged well dressed woman looked dowdy beside when at length a electric light began to pale perceptibly before breaking day dodo asked partner to take to lady bretton dancer stopped followed dodo prince waldenech for be dancing with to where lady bretton be standing have be heavenly said dodo be dreadful bore to have people come say how much have enjoyed have done now tell lucas wish must come of age year really be public benefactor took prince waldenech arm stood waiting with while carriage detached from others lined square drove up to door a stood there crowd followed slowly out of ballroom still silent still watching lined stair a passed down to front door then when have got into carriage have driven off looked at other a if have be walking in sleep one knew exactly why be there quarter of hour later room be completely empty meanwhile a dodo drove back through still cool morning air threw down window of carriage drew in deep satisfied breath of freshness thought of crowd who have followed down to door laughed for pleasure be life be life thought followed like sheep ah how love be nearly six when reached home decidedly must be too absurd to go to bed thought will go for glorious gallop come back to breakfast with chesterford tell to saddle starlight at once said to footman sha' want groom tell lord chesterford when wake that will be back to breakfast chapter twelve chesterford did not let dodo see how strongly have felt on subject of ball argued to that must do good dodo must not understand understanding must misunderstand strength of feeling did not care that must know that thought heartless be quite conscious that matter be little strained between though dodo apparently be sublimely unaware of have momentary nervousness when met at breakfast on morning after ball that chesterford be going to make fuss must not quite see what must end in if subject be broached came in looking a usual told how matter have gone with on previous day have recounted with certain humour few sharp word old lady in railway carriage have addressed to because did help to hand out two large cage of canary be taking home dodo welcomed a sign of grace be only too happy to meet husband half way have be trifle melodramatic on previous evening be liable to make mountain out of molehill at time thought personally inclination be to make molehill out of mountain be only difference in temperament implied judgment at fault be quite willing to forgive forget in word be particularly nice to when breakfast be over took arm led away to room sit down in very big chair old boy said twiddle thumb while write note be going to see mr vivian morning lordship may come in ladyship carriage if like be lordship masculine feminine neuter chesterford anyhow be wrong to say lordship may come in carriage because lordship be nominative to sentence be in third person what be saying oh yes may come if like drop there then go away for about hour then come back then will have lunch together at home have got to go to stupid committee at club said chesterford be not till twelve will send carriage back for sha' be able to be in at lunch oh very good remarked dodo be sorry married might be lone lorn widdy for care prefers lunching at club went on dramatically addressing black virgin to having chop at home with wife of bosom how sharper than serpent tooth to have thankless chesterford dodo proceeded to write note threw one by one at husband a sat contentedly by window in very big chair that dodo have indicated dodo correspondence be a varied a collection of photograph on mantelpiece first note be to groom at winston telling to have riding horse sent up at once a own particular mare have gone lame missed chesterford head fell with ominous clatter among bric brac china will be bill for to pay darling said dodo sweetly why did put silly old head in light next be slightly better shot fell right side upwards on to chesterford knee with address upside down to looked at vaguely serene highness who asked spelling out be not grammar said dodo be only to prince waldenech be serene be look anyhow be at brettons last night austrian amiable chesterford be fingering envelope be unmitigated blackguard said after little consideration wish 'd let tear up dodo what on earth have got to say to will have to write again dear if do said conscious of bridling rising irritation really be awful brute repeated oh dear chesterford what doe matter asked dodo impatiently tapping floor with toe of shoe be business to go raking up character of people be introduced to mean mind what man character be a long a be agreeable be business to be court inquisitor said half of what one hears about people be true other half well can say be that be exactly false dodo must lose temper very quickly on occasion especially when be in hurry a be now dear dodo do happen to know story of said vehemently will seem rude if say want to really think might find something better to do than tell scandalous story about people know know want to know about prince waldenech said chesterford rising will know more about soon remarked dodo because have asked to stay at winston suppose think wanted to make secret about have such intention assure be note to ask to come inquired certainly be said dodo defiantly may a well tear up said mean to be asked dodo wish to have in house dodo have lost temper thoroughly being asked to winston be immaterial said with scorn in voice certainly have power to prevent coming to house power must regard wish will not can see in london with perfect ease mean attach weight to wish in matter said chesterford none will knowledge of what man be really like stop holding further intercourse with asked none now wish to be known that wife associate with such people said wife doe not regard in light replied dodo have intention of proclaiming fact from housetop to do chesterford justice be getting angry too be perfectly intolerable that there must be sort of dispute between dodo said that be first point on have not differed entirely decline to listen to reason to reason mean said dodo to mine honest man dodo burst out into harsh mirthless laugh ah be beginning to be jealous said be very bourgeois to be jealous chesterford coloured angrily that be insult dodo said remember that there be courtesy due even from wife to husband besides that know contrary really know nothing of sort remarked whole conduct last night morning have be so melodramatic that begin to suspect sort of latent virtue in be wandering from point said do mean that nothing will deter from seeing austrian be received in society said dodo be presentable be even amusing be to tell that husband be afraid will corrupt moral if people in general cut say must continue to cultivate acquaintance be absurd to run amuck of such convention if have approached in proper manner say might have seen way to meeting wish feel be to blame in respect said show know how far be apart replied be suddenly frightened came closer to far apart dodo seems to that interview have revealed astonishing difference of opinion between said wish to multiply word have told what think on subject have told what think have claimed power husband certainly posse claim liberty that husband can not deprive of perhaps wish to lock up quite understand one let agree to differ give that note please suppose can trust not to send must like to keep be interesting to count milestone dodo spoke with recklessness of woman anger be always much more unwanton than of man man doe not say cruel thing when be angry because be cruel because be angry dodo be cruel because wished to be cruel gave note turned to leave room dodo last speech made impossible for to say more only thing must not sacrifice to love be honour hers dodo suddenly saw horrible impossibility of situation have not smallest intention of living on bad term with husband have quarrelled be pity be over storm may only clear air be not always precursor of bad weather air wanted clearing dodo determined that must not be prelude of rain wind to of course knowledge that did not love husband have long be commonplace to truth be coming in fierce blinding flash by light must see that great flood have come down into happy valley carrying desolation before between dodo stretched tawny waste of water dodo have intention of quarrelling with maintaining dignified reserve in daily intercourse must be quite unbearable wished there to be misunderstanding on point chesterford said have quarrelled be pity hardly ever quarrel be stupid of

must know that love left england last autumn to cure of did answer bit ask more than what have just told that be something be dodo if love be something for let degrade let be strength to not weakness must feel so there be long silence in silence great drama of love life good evil have be played day of year since beginning of world will never cease till mankind be saint sexless filled stage dodo thought at rate that loved that knowledge made feel le abased before love love for child for parent for husband for wife for lover for mistress have something divine about else be not love love jack felt for be divine enough not to seek own to sacrifice on altar of duty loyalty pure cold god in tumultuous happiness must think of others dodo love be touched though ever so faintly with same divine spark something so human that touched heaven now have so happened that exactly three minute before maud have found that have left particularly precious skein of wool in room about ten second

ask husband advice chesterford study opened into drawing room during time maud have be upstairs have gone in to fetch dodo seeing be not there went back did not close door behind moment afterwards maud rushed into drawing room from hall carefully shutting door behind lest anyone must hear exclaimed algy have seen something awful went into smoking room to fetch wool saw jack kissing dodo hand what be to do be suitably horrified remarked with much reason that be use telling dodo jack because knew already at moment door of lord chesterford study be closed quietly did not wish to hear more just yet of noticed have overheard something be not meant for ear related by person who have overseen what be not meant to see hated learning anything be not own affair have learned turned out to be unpleasantly closely connected with first impulse be to think that jack have behaved in treacherous blackguardly manner conclusion surprised so much that set to ponder over more thought of more unlikely appeared to jack making love to wife under cover of own roof be too preposterous idea to be entertained held very high opinion of jack did not at seem to fit in with be there other possibility came upon with sense of sickening probability that there be remembered long loveless month remembered dodo indifference to then neglect then dislike have jack be hideously tempted not be able to resist chesterford almost felt friendly feeling for not being able to resist dodo what did imply how long have be going on how did begin where must stop felt have right to ask question meant to ask of proper person not yet must wait must see what happened be afraid of judging too harshly maud account might have be incorrect anyhow be not meant for thought wandered on dismally vaguely outcome be that said to poor dodo god forgive have be so long used to altered state of thing that blow seemed to only natural sequence have be used to feed starved heart with promise dodo must care for again that month when be first married be only bud of flower must day blossom be feeble hope that what have heard destroyed if thing have gone a far a that be hopeless yes repeated be gone if anything must have killed love for dodo felt that must have be a sat there said to will never know know of be final determination dodo have wronged cruelly only revenge be to continue a if have be

with not sorry at wonder if match be made in heaven oh be miserable jack be really to be pitied more than dodo knelt by with hand in feeling that must have given life without question to make happy knowing that have better give life than do so struggle be over felt like chain being pulled in opposite direction did not wrestle longer two force thought be simply fighting out over rigid body wondered vaguely whether something must break if so what did not dream for moment of ever reconsidering answer to dodo question did not even present so knelt by still holding hand waiting for to speak

passionate gesture tore in half then across again threw piece into grate chapter nineteen dodo slept long dreamlessly that night deep dreamless sleep evenly balanced fatigue of body mind so often produce though get into bed feeling that brain be too deep in tangle of unsolved thought to be able to extricate fall into dim immensity of sleep waking from sleep be not so pleasant first moment of

drop left at bottom of jug made neat little pool on head of of dog be name asked ought to be tweedledum tweedledee huz buz ananias sapphira darby joan harris ainsworth ought to be harris ainsworth be sure one man must have written that rot little spencer be very fond of harrison ainsworth said be instructive a well a palatable want to be instructed be palatable hate having little bit of information wrapped up given to to swallow like powder in jam did have to take powder when be little lady grantham dodo question be purely rhetorical required answer did not expect one be much nicer being completely ignorant foolish like said nobody ever expects to know anything to be instructive on subject under sun jack be going to be simple little couple who be very nice not at wise nobody dislike one if one never pretend to be wise like people to have large number of theory on subject everyone be bound to form conclusion what dislike be people who have got good ground for conclusion who knock slap down with statistic if try to argue with be impossible to argue with anyone who have reason for what say because get to know sooner later then argument be over argument ought to be like poem leave off come to end dodo delivered herself of surprising statement with great rapidity left room to get cigarette left door wide open in minute two voice be heard from drawing room screaming to edith edith here be 'dodo symphony come play to moment there be not much wrong with morning thought edith a went to drawing room where dodo be playing snatch of dance music play scherzo edith

too if remember right lady grantham have followed edith sat down with atmosphere of impenetrable leisure near piano dodo made feel uncomfortably old felt dodo extravagantly high spirit be sort of milestone to show how far have travelled from youth be impossible to conceive of dodo ever getting middle aged elderly have racked brain in vain to try to think of woman of own age who must possibly ever have be a insolently young a dodo have habit a have mentioned before of making strangely direct remark turned to dodo said must so like to see ten year hence wonder if people like ever grow old will never grow old declared dodo confidently something feel sure will happen to prevent that will stop young till go out like candle be carried off in whirlwind something must be old be in will go on talking nonsense till end of life ca talk nonsense if have to sit by fire keep shawl over mouth will have to do if get old wherefore never will be great relief to be certain of used to bother head about at one time suddenly flashed upon about ten day ago need bother about more a never must be old must dislike having to be serious very much asked edith be must dislike said dodo simply be incapable of be serious last night for at least hour feverish reaction have set in must be serious for week together if be going to be beheaded next moment time daresay must be very nice to be serious just a be sure must be very nice to live at bottom of sea pull fish tail be possible dodo have quite forgotten that have intended to go for ride went into garden with nora played duck drake on pond punted about gathered water lily then be seized with irresistible desire to fish caught large pike refused to be killed dodo have to fetch gardener to slay then talked astonishing amount of perfect nonsense thought that must be lunch time accordingly went back to house be found by edith quarter of hour later playing hide seek with coachman child whom have lured in from stable yard a went by rule be that searcher be to catch hiders dodo have entrenched behind piano erected impregnable barricade consisting of revolving bookcase music stool two seeker entirely declined to consider that have won dodo with show of reason be telling that have caught yet at rate situation seemed to admit of compromise solution unless a dodo suggested got pound two of blasting powder destroyed defence however deus ex machina appeared in person of coachman who have come in for order hinted darkly that maternal vengeance be brewing if certain person did not wash hand in time for dinner be imminent there be telegram for somewhere said edith to dodo a emerged hot victorious sent man out into garden with messenger be waiting for answer dodo became suddenly grave suppose be gone to pond said be where be seen last will go get met man walking back to house having looked for in vain took telegram opened have be forwarded from london house be very short arrive in london to day may call waldenech dodo experienced in epitome at moment have gone through night before went to garden seat remained there in silence so long that footman asked will there be answer lady messenger be waiting dodo held out hand for telegraph form addressed to caretaker at london house also be very short address uncertain leave here to day forward nothing handed to man gave order that must go at once dodo did not move sat still with hand clasped in front of unconscious of active thought only knowing that stream of picture seemed to pas before eye saw prince standing on doorstep learning with surprise lady chesterford be not at home that address be not known saw turn away baffled not beaten saw remaining in london day after day waiting for house in eaton square to show sign of life saw ah dismissed that picture quickly have one sudden impulse to call back footman ask for telegraph form felt if must only keep firm hand on herself for few moment worst must be passed be with sense of overwhelming relief that saw telegraph boy walk off down drive with reply in hand then suddenly struck that prince be waiting for answer at dover station how savage will be thought dodo there will be murder at telegraph office if wait for answer there well somebody must suffer will be telegraph boy idea of prince waiting at dover be distinctly amusing dodo found broad smile to bestow on thought before continued examining state of feeling position prince influence over felt be local personal so to speak now have made decision be surprised at ease with have be made have be there in person with courtly presence serene remoteness from anything ordinary have said in smooth well modulated voice may hope to find in to morrow dodo felt that must have said come pride be in frantic rebellion at admission even telegram have sent be confession of weakness must not see because be afraid be there other reason asked yes must not see because longed to see have come to thought a crumpled up telegram have fluttered down from lap on to grass dodo felt be quite unnecessarily honest with herself in making admission what followed nothing followed be going to marry jack be remarkably happy prince waldenech must come stay with because liked very much must be delightfully kind to jack must like too dear old jack must write line minute saying when must be back in london dodo felt sudden spasm of anger against prince what right have to behave like be making very hard for must get nothing by decision be irrevocable must not see again for time at rate must get over ridiculous fear of be that other men be not what be position after have wanted to marry have refused because be engaged to jack if there have be no jack well there be jack so be unnecessary to pursue that further have given photograph have said several thing that must not have said dodo thought of scene with regret have have opportunity have missed might easily have made plain to that murmured speech went beyond mere courtesy instead of that have said must always regard a great friend hoped must see often tapped ground impatiently a thought of missed opportunity be stupid inconceivably stupid of then have followed to england sent telegram did not feel safe longed dreaded to see again be too absurd that must have to play gigantic game of hide seek will have to put on blue veil green goggles when go back to london thought dodo well seeker have to catch hiders have caught yet meanwhile prince be smoking cigar at dover station telegram have not come though have waited hour have settled to give half hour then go on to london be not at angry be a good a game of chess prince be very fond of chess enjoyed exercising calculating long sightedness felt that marchioness of chesterford elect be problem enabled to exercise faculty of have plenty to full have sublime sense of certainty a to what be going to do fully intended to marry dodo admitted obstacle be engaged to jack be so much worse for jack wished to marry jack did so much worse for none worse possibly better for a be quite certain that be going to marry dodo little hitch be entertaining than otherwise be more fun to catch salmon after quarter of hour rather exciting fight with than to net joy of possession lie in act of acquisition pleasure of acquisition consists at least in half of excitement attendant on to say that prince ever regarded anyone feeling must be understating truth fact that will worked way in opposition to at expense of others afforded distinct appreciable pleasure if wanted anything went straight for regarded man devil angel wanted dodo mind then be thoroughly made up seemed to immensely original very complete read thought like book book be very interesting reading sending of telegram with reply paid be positive stroke of genius dodo have told that be going straight to london a have seen did not stop night there went straight on to edith home in berkshire there be two course open to to reply yes to telegram to leave unanswered if left unanswered must delight above measure seemed that wish be to be realised not answering telegram must imply that did not think good to see judged that decision be probably prompted by something deeper than mere indifference to company must be dictated by strong motive calculation be little at fault because dodo have not stopped in london made difference a event have turned out to correctness of deduction very much wished dodo to be influenced by strong motif in dealing with must not have accepted even a gift real quiet liking have for jack real quiet liking seemed to to be a dull a total indifference must not have objected to regarding with violent loathing must be something to correct experience in such affair be that strong sympathy antipathy be more akin to other than quiet affection apathetic indifference be to walked up down platform with smile of man who be waiting for interesting situation in theatrical representation to develop have wish to hurry by play seemed to to be very suitable bought morning paper glanced through leader turned to small society paragraph first that struck eye be marchioness of chesterford arrived in london yesterday afternoon from continent felt be most orthodox way of bringing scene to climax enter newsboy who hand paper to prince exit prince unfolds paper read news of well of what be expecting snipped paragraph neatly out from paper put in card case valet be standing by telegraph office waiting for message prince beckoned to there will be telegram said leave by next train prince have carriage reserved for stepped in with sense of great satisfaction even went so far a to touch hat in response to obeisance of obsequious guard told valet to see that man got something soon determined on next

horse be model of sturdy strength hop harvest promised to be very fine be surprised when drew near london journey have be shorter than expected gave few direction to valet about luggage drove off to eaton square door be opened by impenetrable caretaker be lady chesterford in asked prince ladyship be not in london sir replied man prince smiled dodo be evidently acting up to refusal to answer telegram ah just so remarked please take to say be waiting drew from pocket card cutting from morning post ladyship be not in man repeated perhaps must let have address said prince feeling in pocket

negligently turning away lighting cigar send telegram from wokingham 'left yesterday ' betill here ' prince be sitting over late breakfast on following morning when telegram be brought in read eye twinkled with genuine amusement think said to think be rather neat chapter twenty if dodo have felt excusable pride in having torn up prince photograph refusal to let know where be gave still more vivid sense of something approaching heroism did not blame anyone for position into have drifted during week in switzerland be quite conscious that might have stopped intimacy of sort arising consequently establishment of power over felt be regaining lost position sensible refusal to admit influence over be sensible tearing asunder of fibre enveloped be hard work admitted be quite surprised to find how comfortable be becoming jack really made very satisfactory background to thought be very fond of looked forward to marriage with eager expectancy be partly however result of fear

a bark remarked dodo be sign of bad temper now dear prince if talk more about will get intolerably conceited wo do at ca bear conceited men always seem to to be like people on stilt be probably not

hold of stilt sawing through then when get up again come down 'bang say 'oh hope have hurt did know went about on stilt be very unsafe be ' dodo be conscious of talking rather wildly incoherently felt like swimmer being dragged down by deep undercurrent must do be to make splash on surface must not swim quietly strongly out of reach stood by window playing with blind cord wishing that prince must not look at have sort of deep lazy strength about that made dodo distrust indolent consciousness of power that tiger have when play contemptuously with prey before hitting with one deadly blow of soft cushioned paw why ca treat like anyone else said to herself impatiently surely be not afraid of be only afraid of being afraid be handsome clever charming amiable here be watching movement listening to word say be nonsense here go dodo plunged back into room sat down in chair next what charming time have at zermatt said that sort of place be so nice if simply go there in order to amuse without bore of entertaining people people who go there treat a great social effort of year a if one did make enough social effort at home ah zermatt said prince meditatively be most delightful month ever spent did like said dodo negligently must have thought that sort of place must have bored there be nothing to do expected must rush off a soon a got there go to shoot something like lord chesterford partridge suggested edith oh be different said dodo jack think be duty of english landlord to shoot partridge be got great idea of duty even when interferes with what must have be pleasure apparently said prince oh jack will see plenty of other in course of time be not afraid will go play about without be too merciful said prince oh sha' be hard on jack will make allowance for shortcoming will expect that will make allowance for mine will have best of bargain said prince mean that wo have to make much allowance for asked dodo dear prince show how little really know about can be abominable

excuse leaving said have got letter to write before midday post ought to make angry be stopping to lunch au revoir then will meet again sometime soon suppose one be always running up against people dodo shook hand with elaborate carelessness went towards door prince opened for have made angry murmured a passed out will pacify again know dodo went upstairs into bedroom be half frightened at own resolution effort of appearing quite unconcerned have given queer tired feeling heard door shut in drawing room below step in hall faint flush came over face got up quickly from chair rah downstairs prince be in hall did not look least surprised to see dodo again ah be just off asked then stopped dead waited a if expecting more dodo eye wandered round wall came back to face again come see in time said in low voice will go back at end of week prince bowed knew must pacify again said chapter twenty one dodo be up again in london at end of week a have told prince jack be also staying in town often spent most of day together riding occasionally in deserted row sitting a be now in dodo room in eaton square house be leaving for country in few day time where have arranged to come across one at various house dodo at least be finding few day rather trying jack have arranged to have together quite alone while be in switzerland dodo have overlooked fact that might be rather hard to fill up not that be disappointed in jack be exactly what have always supposed to be never thought that be very stimulating though never dull be quite conscious of enough stimulus in herself for for rest be quite satisfactory be distinctly disappointed in felt a if taste have be vitiated by drinking brandy mild flavour very good bouquet of vintage have pleased before sent message from palate to brain be like effect produced by touch of hot iron on skin form hard numb surface be curiously insensitive to touch dodo felt a if power of sensation have be seared in way perception no longer answered quickly to cause excited layer of dull unresponsive material lay between world thought that nerve tissue be sound enough below numbness be only superficial burn must heal skin must become pliant soft again if be conscious of corresponding cause must hardly be expected that jack must be unconscious of corresponding effect on particular morning dodo be particularly aware of be raining dismally outside sky be heavy grey road be being repaired traction engine be performing dismal office in little aimless run backwards forward official with red flag have found there be vehicle for to warn have sat down on heap of stone be smoking there be general air of stagnation sense of futility of doing anything one be more conscious of than dodo felt that there be only one event be likely to interest yet in way shrank from that be searing process over again wondered whether must do good to tell jack of fact that prince be down at wokingham found burden of unshared secret exceptionally trying dodo have be so accustomed to be before footlights life that anything of nature of secret be oppressive conduct to first husband did not regard a such be only admirable piece of by play audience fully appreciated did dodo then never think of late husband with tenderness well not often thought seldom remained long in dodo mind without finding expression turned round suddenly jack prince waldenech be at wokingham what be there for asked jack quickly think came to see remarked dodo serenely hope did see replied dodo felt slight stimulus in subject saw said because came to see a say in french exercise book must hide head under hearthrug like ostrich hot that hide head under hearth rug principle be same walked in a cool a cucumber said 'howdy ' so talked said 'd be glad to call out 'd be glad to call out generally chattered then made angry why did propose to call out asked jack coldly oh said must call out remarked dodo said nothing must induce to never said proposed to call out be stupid morning jack that man be unutterable cad dodo opened eye oh be nothing of kind said besides be great friend of mine so even if be cad must matter how did make angry demanded jack told be going away to write letter be rather damping be have got letter to write knew knew knew so on jack be silent have be puzzled by dodo comparative reserve during last few day felt a if have missed scene in play there be certain thing unexplained have even gone so far a to ask dodo if anything be matter inquiry detested profoundly laid down universal rule on occasion nothing be ever matter have said if be not telling must show did wish for sympathy help anything else tell want to know mean something be matter want to know said jack rather unwisely have be riding together when occurred at point dodo have struck horse savagely with whip put end to conversation by galloping furiously off when jack caught up be again described how selection of edith dog have kept postman at bay one morning until unusual absence of barking howling have led mistress to further investigation be rewarded by finding postman sitting in boat house defending with punt pole jack be singularly easy going very trustful did not bother head more about at time have to attain almost unattainable dominion over mind to prevent thought suddenly starting up in front of when thought have occurred to one be matter of training practice to encourage dismiss other be beyond reach of general a dodo finished last word jack found suddenly face to face with new thought be so new that startled looked at again at moment like two people have almost supernatural power of intuition towards other dodo be standing in window jack be sitting in very low chair looking straight towards with light from window full on face at moment read thought a clearly a if have spoken for be familiar already to felt sudden impulse of anger how dare think that said jack needed explanation behaved well dodo said gently have right to say that have said now if there be not anything have better know just tell so for own sake for mine can only plead for forgiveness be by will of mine that thought crossed mind can afford to be generous dodo something in speech made dodo even angrier be simply forcing confidence said if be something have better know do suppose that stopped abruptly jack rose from chair stood by in window be not very generous to said be old friend though be lover take care lose friendship then said dodo fiercely be use saying 'auld lang syne ' when 'auld lang syne ' be in danger must be like singing 'god save queen when be dying must never recall old memory when be strained jack be getting little impatient though be not frightened yet dodo really be rather unreasonable said to begin with quarrel with unspoken thought have even given definite accusation be because be unnecessary know said dodo however a like think have cause to be jealous foolish melodramatic about prince waldenech dear be quite like old time jack turned on angrily if propose to treat a treated that poor man who be best man ever knew said sooner learn mistake better for must have be in better taste not to have referred to at present be beside point said dodo be that unspoken thought be not if must not insult by speaking thought whether be right not said jack will not insult by answering that question answer will take form listen dodo prince be in love with proposed to at zermatt that passionless inhuman piece of mechanism sister told how much be in love with meant a compliment be dangerous bad man force on went down to wokingham to see told so be dangerous strong for god sake keep away from distrust be afraid may get to distrust will make afraid of crossing will dodo will do for be quite unreasonable probably be unreasonable when think of oh dear jack said dodo impatiently really make angry be dreadfully bad form to be angry be absurd that must quarrel have got low opinion of though suppose be a much fault a yours opinion be fiction be fact on be founded what do take for prince telegraphed from dover to ask if must see deliberately sent answer how found out where be know suppose got hold of telegram sent here to say address be uncertain doe look a if wanted to see so dreadfully never said did want to see said jack said very much wanted to see what say prof well what then said dodo wanted to see very much when be married must have thought reasonable if chesterford have entreated never to see to keep away for god sake a said just now be not prince said jack be going to be treated a treated husband let refer to again be desecration mean that in light of subsequent event must have be reasonable in to ask to keep away from yes said jack looked dodo full in face in noble shame of confessed sin in moment be greater perhaps have risen higher above vague self satisfied indifference than ever before dodo felt irritated seemed positively unpardonable perhaps see that involve in confession said with cold scorn decline to be judged by standard thanks jack felt sudden immense pity anger for must not must not accept existence of other point of view than own apparently decline to consider fact of other standard at accept view seem to unreasonable said only ask to consider particular view story have just told show that be anxious to see be point that be dangerous strong ask to accept what if asked said when man of sort desire anything a evidently desire there be danger if be alive to a strong a be be safe that be not alive to show by present position that be a strong a doubt assume far too much said dodo what mean by present position care to know be perfectly alive to whole state of case wait will speak entirely decline to be dictated to will do a choose in matter do quite realise what mean said jack rising dodo have risen too be standing before with great anger burning in eye face be very pale moved towards bell when boat be in rapid cataract be inevitable mean said will be here in minute two told must be in at twelve be going to ring bell tell man to show up will stay here treat a one man must treat if be insolent to understand that include will imply that distrust perhaps must ring bell for a be closer to sat down by writing table waited jack paused with hand on bell will be perfectly explicit with said if see see alone wish to hear what have to say to a enters door leave be may choose rang bell there be reason for to wait till then said dodo be going to see a soon a come tell prince waldenech be in said to footman show up a soon a come jack leant against chimney piece well said dodo be making up mind there be dead silence what on earth be quarrelling about thought jack to be simply whether stop here talk to cad wonder if woman be a obstinate a did seem little ridiculous felt that dignity forbade to yield have told did not distrust be enough no must go away when came back to morrow dodo must be more reasonable think be going remarked sha' see again till to morrow afternoon be away to night dodo be turning over page of magazine did not answer jack became little impatient really be extraordinarily childish said sha' stop to see prince because be detestable cad think over dodo at mention of prince if jack have be watching dodo more closely might have seen sudden colour rush to face faint perceptible be devoting attention to keeping temper stifling vague dread distrust be too loyal to admit at door paused moment ah dodo said with entreaty in voice dodo did not move look at left room without more word on stair met prince bowed silently to greeting stood aside for to pas prince glanced back at with amusement lordship doe honour to be jealous of said to next day jack called at dodo house door be opened by servant whose face thought ought to know that be not one of dodo men felt certain in moment have flashed across that man have be with prince at zermatt be lady chesterford in asked man looked at moment then like well bred servant dropped eye
