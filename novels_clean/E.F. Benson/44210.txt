conclusion a far a world in general be to say world of mere acquaintance be concerned philip fine collection of print be considered to be regarded by a investment rather than joy made same judgment about garden thinking that rarity of plant be quality more highly prized by than beauty where world in general did injustice be that did not allow for circle though small be far more intimate vastly

four guest did like mother not feel on term of intimacy presence however a madge mother be matter of necessity philip did not hide from fact that certainly favoured suit for lady ellington a mr home have already remarked be very practical woman seemed to in own phrasing that madge must scarcely do better practical sense may be remarked be like fitting handle with smart steel spring grasped be presented to in firm tentacle proper way of sweeping carpet right board wage for scullery maid correct lead with doubled trump at bridge be a clearly defined in mind a desirability of wealth in son in law be may be added extremely generous with advice being anxious to lay open to world multifarious discovery of master mind lady ellington be certainly very handsome woman passage of glacier of year over face mind have produced hardly striation on one other bodily health be superb took utmost care of while since one of most constantly applied maxim be to let sadness worry weigh on mind have by time become something like very hard bright polished globe be impossible to dint damage have strolled after tea with hostess madge to croquet lawn leaving evelyn dundas tom merivale to smoke await philip return from river gardener there be still engaged in belated mowing lady ellington examined cutter with magisterial air very old fashioned heavy said must get new light american type doe far more work boy with can get through what take man to do with heavier machine how many gardener do keep mr home poor lady shook head really know said how many be there of hawkins lady ellington sniffed rather contemptuously labour sheet will tell said why be there flower border on lawn ah be philip plan said mother delighted to be able to refer inquisitor to source say that get so trampled by people looking for ball must have thought wire netting must have obviated said lady ellington under north wall there be excellent aspect personally must put bulb here rose garden be below be not certainly mr home keep garden in fairly good order concession though not altogether unqualified be fully appreciated by mr home be sure spends enough on said lady ellington laughed be surest way of getting satisfactory result said be nonsense to say that flower do best in garden of love unless love take practical form of spending money on in latter case do equally well if hate be in best ellingtonian manner hard clean cut glittering there be nothing foggy about represented very fairly lady ellington method of dealing with life love hatred did not seem to to matter very particularly dinner of herb at rate in house of love be markedly le attractive to than well ordered house of hate must do without friend better than without motor car have have rather hard tussel with life shrewd blow have be given on side have lost money husband during last few year being without son title estate have gone to husband man for whom for year have felt indeed shown extreme dislike jointure be narrow have only got motor car by simple expedient of ordering not paying for of two combatant life life be at last beginning to get worst of certain speculation have lately indulged in have brought in money if once must marry daughter to philip felt that must be knock down blow to life struggle on side of grave must be over what might happen on other side concerned very little madge meantime while short cross examination have be going on strolled little behind other two with faint smile of amusement in eye have inherited mother beauty dark violet eye glowed beneath black lash nose be little tip tilted a if raised in curiosity about thing in general mouth somewhat contradicted that for drooped little at corner a if to imply that curiosity when satisfied proved rather disappointing curiosity shade of contempt indeed be emotion most strongly in evidence on face observer allowing that feature may represent character of owner rather than of ancestry must perhaps conclude that habitual view of world be of kind tends to laugh at rather than with admirable comedy otherwise face be strangely sexless be indeed more face of boy than of girl even among tall woman be tall by side mr home looked more than ever like figure of dresden china lady ellington after sympathetic remark about flower turned to daughter well situated be not madge said river be below there will be day on expect if mr home be kind enough to take who else be here mr home ah there be party at be afraid said philip said that acquaintance mix so badly with friend only mr dundas mr merivale lady ellington thought over for moment conclusion apparently be most satisfactory be charming of said be always compliment to be asked to small party whereas if have houseful doe matter who be there dear rose must be cut much further back if be to do good be quite true if one asks friend acquaintance together friend always wonder why acquaintance have be asked acquaintance be disgusted that nobody take notice of particularly want son advice on share have lately purchased mr dundas too be so glad to meet say portrait be going up in price so wonder if must be induced just little sketch ah there be mr home coming up from river wonder why wear dark coat on so hot day little curiosity perhaps lingered in madge face when met philip certainly contempt vanished have great respect liking for whole expression brightened when saw then after greeting strolled on two elder lady in front mother have great many question to ask said to in gentle slow very audible voice want to know how many gardener have why cut rose back something about south african mine philip habit of neatness instinct of gardening led to stop moment nip off couple of ill localised bud from rose in effect two others got little further ahead of may may not have be intentional information be at service said particularly on subject of rose about know more than south african mine care more suggested madge infinitely more be not clearly more attractive madge looked at curiously believe really think so said be so odd doe scheming calculation foresight required in financial thing interest enormously certainly scheme just a much over rose whether one be to have well whisky soda whether be rheumatic want lowering treatment be just a interesting in a whether south african want lowering screwing up mean can do that can send thing up down can say to to mother 'you will be poorer to morrow richer ' philip laughed suppose so to extent pray let talk about sound rather brutal be afraid be brutalising yet after landlord may put up rent of house madge ellington walked on for few pace without replying how odd of said at length not to feel fascination of power mean to say that one must necessarily want to use must be so divine to know be there well if wish wo talk about philip turned to brown thin face looking suddenly eager ah must sooner hear talk about what please than about what please said laughed ca manage to combine two said river for instance think love will promise to let live on river while be here warn that will have good deal of company then said laughed again a be host ca decently object said oh tell mr home what be mr dundas like be great friend of be not be at tea asked series of silliest riddle somehow made giggle giggle hopelessly do understand be so stupid be mr dundas who paint everybody a if be so much more interesting than be yes evidently same said philip what say be quite true yet again a say conversation be futile beyond word madge walked on again in silence little think that combination be rather charming said people laugh enough certainly make one laugh wish laughed more for instance have merivale come asked philip yes be at tea too what doe do doe do anything just think good heaven how frightfully fatiguing time do mean yes time have never met before yet how must life in new forest commune with bird animal people think be mad be sanest person know why asked because have have wit to find out what like to do all time what be asked girl sits by stream look at water then lie on back look at sky then whistle chuckle what please to call thrush come scudding out of bush chuckle back at be that not rather uncanny asked madge most uncanny day a tell will see pan will then have to attend funeral girl eyebrow wrinkled into frown pan said yes be god of a please ' temple be lunatic asylum be alarmed hermit wo go into lunatic asylum yet awhile hermit yes hermit be merivale because life quite alone in new forest never read hardly ever see anybody never doe anything used to write at one time madge shivered slightly how intensely uncomfortable said think will like mr dundas best be sure to like because everybody doe be worst of reason always distrust very popular people judgment of world be usually wrong mean occasionally one stumble on exception four have turned back towards house a philip spoke companion gained top step of gravelled square bordered by flower bed where have sat two hour ago with mother shadow of house have swung over in gathering dusk flower bed glowed with dim subaqueous radiance philip mother lady ellington have already passed into open french window of drawing room on stout balustrade of terrace there sat young man one long slim leg rested on gravel other be crooked round lead vase at head of step face extraordinarily boyish be clean shaven rather so boyish be that looked a if be still untouched by razor held cigarette in one hand other long fingered white a woman grasped knee oh philip cried how be oddly enough be quite well always be like sydney smith great coat be there time for game of croquet before dinner let be late so will be punctual be only question of degree miss ellington do come play why did barmaid champagne oh asked that stout porter be rather good though do believe know philip illustration text decoration second tom merivale did not a mr home have feared might appear without clothes at dinner did make clamorous demand for cabbage be true that ate meat of kind be not of preaching sort of vegetarian did not call attention to abstinence instead evelyn dundas between managed to turn meal into ridiculous piece of gaiety by sheer exuberance of animal spirit even lady ellington forgot to examine dish with usual magisterial air really ate drank without criticising there be extraordinary superficial resemblance in certain way between two men at rate be glorious example of happiness spring from health happiness be a inimitable a be contagious by health must be premised be not meant mere absence of definite ailment that perfect poise between active mind exuberant body be so rare be on very subject that merivale be speaking now ah lady ellington be saying to be able to get through day work day after day year after year be not health perfect health implies practically perfect happiness how if have definite cause of worry said ca worry when be well one know for example that if one be definitely unwell same cause produce greater worry discomfort than if one be not theory be that if one be absolutely well if mind soul be to say a well a body be in accord with other with environment worry be impossible lady ellington to do justice always listened to be really new to always assumed by way that be not theory exactly said must scarcely have lived through last year unless have made up mind never to let anxiety take hold of evelyn dundas laughed dinner be nearing end conversation be general mind body be not in absolute accord moment said be rather anxious body demand more ice pudding mind tell must be extremely unwise be to listen to tom give mr dundas more ice pudding remarked philip to footman law of hospitality compel to fall in with host suggestion said evelyn tom where be wrong lie in thinking that be worth while spending time in keeping well life in new forest lady ellington if when be passing hear puff of loud steam engine somewhere near brockenhurst will know be tom doing deep breathing expects in time to become ram jam something by breathing into raj pan puta tom merivale laughed want to become ram jam said whatever may be want to become clothes murmured mr home become asked lady ellington yes most of be stunted copy of real self said imitation of what might be what might one not be talk have got for at rate suddenly serious looked up at lady ellington with sparkling eye explain said well seems to one cripple in so many way one allows to be nervous to be angry to be bound by convention be useless cramping tall hat frock coat asked certainly not because at rate be perfectly harmless to take example of what mean seems to ridiculous convention that must consider ourselves obliged to know what be going on in world doe not really do one good to know that there be war between china japan what doe do good be not to be ill tempered never to be sad sadness pessimism be worst form of mental disease know state will not put sad pessimistic people in asylum isolate at rate so that disease must not spread such disease be so frightfully catching be more fatal than fever people die of soul body lady ellington felt that mr home be collecting eye rose what fascinating theory said just what have always thought ah have caught dress under chair must have castor mr home on dining room chair evelyn moved up next to tom merivale after others have left dear old hermit said now have got to give account of phil have seen for year what have be doing tom let port pas suppose must call nothing said ah in real life people go live in new forest hing what have written in last year not one line seriously have be doing nothing except little gardening carpentering just manual labour to keep one sane ' well look a if suited look well enough what be so odd look so much younger tom laughed again ah that strike doe said suppose must not have be otherwise though be object in going to live there well tell then said evelyn rather impatiently have begun to smoke smoked in most characteristic manner be to say that in little more than minute cigarette be consumed down one side be peninsula of charred paper down other while cloud of smoke ascended from perceiving instantly lit one philip rose tell afterwards tom said lady ellington like to play bridge know a soon a dinner be over evelyn rose also ah be like said want to do thing not soon immediately philip how awfully pretty miss ellington be why be told must like to paint philip paused by door really do mean that said have got time hear always have more order than can ever get through evelyn tossed head with quick petulant gesture talk a if be tailor said suggest to advisability of getting apprentice to paint uninteresting people for will sign must satisfy lot of yes have more than can do must do miss ellington remarkably well will ask to sit for must be rather original first time saw good reason for doing said evelyn hastily drinking glass of port must certainly give good reason for saying 'no remarked philip madge appeared did not play bridge mother at rate said did not evelyn dundas rather to satisfaction cut out that feat happily accomplished addressed to madge fancy hermit playing bridge said doe not seem to very inconsistent patience be furthest have right to go madge got up patience in card in real life seems to very poor affair said how be going to amuse while play will go out of room while think of something then can come in guess amendment occurred to evelyn might go out said be deliciously warm just out on to terrace when come in can guess where have be said madge night a have said be deliciously warm moon day two only from full shone with very clear light below lay dim huddled wood beyond shining like streak of silver slept thames somewhere far away train be panting along iron road to left scattered light showed where pangbourne stood odour of flower be wafted from bed pale winged moth now then crossed illuminated space of light thrown by drawing room window on to gravel ah what pity to be indoors said girl a stepped out suppose must be of gipsy blood always want to go somewhere where particularly asked doe matter going be point if asked to go to black hole of calcutta must probably say 'yes what pity ca go on river ah let do said madge laughed must be quite unheard of said live in new forest like mr merivale cast convention aside will walk up down little then will go play do know be really so pleased to have met have admired picture so do find bore having that sort of thing said to evelyn thought over for moment well think picture bore when be done said though opinion of other people never doe picture be be like cold in head posse while be there have to throw off when be thrown off one never think of again at least have come to end of terrace girl stopped a turned then do ah how delightful to know probably to end of life will have thing to do think must say that if have to do said yet know of course creating thing be biggest fun in world how one tear one hair over madge looked at thick black thatch seem to have got left remarked yes be looking thinner mr home told so oh look at moon what dreadful thing to say too really be out of drawing be far too big perhaps be far too small said evelyn shook head be impossible to be small if occurs to said walked in silence after for dozen yard so madge feeling somehow strangely attracted by companion there be nothing be true particularly brilliant about conversation be boyish rather than brilliant felt a most people did that be in presence of personality be rather unusual personality seemed to to be very faithfully expressed in picture there be something daringly simple about evidently said came into head experience be that so many people only talked about such thing a be supposed to be of interest also in spite of moonlight solitude evinced not smallest tendency to notice fact that be very good looking girl hint of appeared in talk attitude to there be not very slightest suspicion of even in desire to go on river with ridiculous suggestion felt with unerring instinct have be made simply from comrade to comrade there be two of together cut out from table of bridge have proposed just a might have proposed to man instead of girl of own age to madge be something of exception in experience of other sex for most unmarried men of acquaintance have shown tendency towards tenderness beauty made perhaps excusable in found rather trying be relief at rate to find young man who took frankly who must say look at moon only to point out that be out of drawing for in matter of emotion madge be strangely unfeeling at rate strangely undeveloped if mother have let anxiety dwell upon hard polished mind doubt about madge future must perhaps have pressed a heavily there a a good mother must have brought to daughter notice not to say thrown at head large variety of young men to none of whom have madge responded at satisfactorily be almost intensely pleasing to at moment to find someone matrimonially quite impossible to mother mind who be so attractive to personally who did not show smallest desire to treat otherwise than man must treat man be perfectly natural in fact perfectly simple exception to experience of moonlight walker paragon continued peerless way have met tom merivale before asked of course must think almost profane to say moon be too large take fact in nature then proceeds to fit to untutored nature doe be right in view wonder what must make of slug eating face of pansy slowly away will ask madge gave little shriek of horror be one of fact of life ca get over said ca reconcile to wanton destruction of beauty oh there be so little in world now there be particular mental sensation corresponds to physical sensation of stepping up step when there be step there evelyn felt now have gone suddenly into vacancy with thump what do mean said must have thought there be so much there that one be bewildered surely almost everything be beautiful do really think that asked why of course trouble be that one have not wit enough to see beauty be equal woman man mountain side pansy probably slug added to appreciate must require great deal of insight sir john lubbock say that earwig be excellent mother opened eye to earwig again madge walked on in silence for space be ever bored asked at length bored anyone have ever made be at one disposal to wonder at if one ca do one can go make something hope will have grace to commit suicide before be bored madge stopped turned to that be being unwise knew something intimate indwelling dictated to be bored day of life said how can avoid be very stupid of evelyn did not hesitate in reply yes very said because be such waste of time to be bored people recollect that have come opposite drawing room window a passed lady ellington stepped out on to terrace be that madge asked even in darkness evelyn knew what have happened to madge face fall of be reflected in voice yes have finished bridge asked be waiting for mr mr dundas to cut in said mr home thought be in smoking room have gone there oh be not in smoking room said evelyn if one judged by definition given in dictionary must probably be misuse of language to say that lady ellington played bridge card be dealt dealt with embarking on commercial transaction assessed value of hand with far more accuracy than have ever brought to play on assessment of income tax proceeded to deal with asset with even more acuteness than be accustomed to dispose on expenditure of income mr home have silently entreated philip to allow to cut out lady ellington be left to play with three men always enjoyed because took full advantage of slight concession be allowed to sex if other woman be of table before embarking on second rubber turned to madge want to speak to dearest said before go to bed will only play couple more rubber mr home really ought to have pneumatic card be little more expensive last so much longer yes two more rubber go trump will come to room on way up doubling thank partner be suit wanted philip who be partner have exposed two excellent suit so imagination of others might run riot over particular suit be desire of lady ellington at rate scored little slam be not satisfied turned on evelyn who be idle to remark have talked during play missed nine said mr dundas be saying something very amusing a face have be like flint mr dundas have to draw inference that however amusing have not be amused lady ellington always kept score herself never showed sign of moving if have won until account have be adjusted paid to night affair have gone prosperously for be gracious in good night even commended admirable temperature of hot water glass of always sipped before going to bed madge have gone upstairs not long before mother having locked winning into dressing case came to room found sitting by open window still not yet preparing to go to bed do understand that walked on terrace alone with mr dundas asked in peculiarly chilly voice madge showed surprise have known what be coming yes took turn two said mother sat down madge have not turned from window be still looking out kindly attend madge said be very indiscreet know think mr home liked of girl who have talked so eagerly naturally to evelyn on terrace there be hardly trace madge face have grown nearly a hard a mother be not bound just yet to do mr home like said be bound if be sensible creature at event not to run risk especially now madge turned away from window mean until bargain be completed supposing refuse said there be little tremor in voice partly of contempt partly of fear lady ellington a have be remarked never let emotion however justifiable run away with never above got hot angry cause in others must produce anger produced in only additional coldness dryness madge be somehow afraid of with unreasoning nightmare kind of fear will not suppose anything so absurd said mother be twenty five year old have never yet fallen in love at a have pointed out to before will be far happier married than living on into loneliness insignificance of being old maid lot of girl never fall in love in silly sentimental manner produce lyric be quite certainly one of a certainly mr home be in love with have be into before said girl be necessary apparently to go into again mr home feel certain be going to propose to must not do indiscreet thing with regard to refusing be out of question be extremely suitable in way told have made up mind to accept made up mind said madge come to same thing precisely so please promise not to do anything girl in position must not do there be earthly harm in walking with penniless artist in moonlight if be not situated a be at moment be indiscreet be wrong if suppose that mr dundas said anything to must possibly be interpreted into tender interest said madge called attention to moon merely in order to remark that be out of drawing never occurred to said mother though must be matter of total indifference whether took tender interest in not merely want promise that will not repeat indiscretion oh certainly said madge lady ellington have put bedroom candle on madge dressing table a soon a have received assurance required at once rose from chair took up with in hand stood silent moment then put down again have spoken again of thing thought be settled madge said must like assurance on one point further agreed did not that must be far better for to marry than remain single agreed also that be not of sort of nature fall passionately in love agreed that have better marry man whom thoroughly like esteem mr home be such man be that correctly stated quite said madge in fact know why suggested must refuse agree to still madge considered moment yes thing being a be agree what do mean by exactly madge got up swept across room to where mother stood have long meant to say to mother said never have yet mean that at age one character to extent certainly be formed one have to deal with a self exists character be formed by education partly by upbringing for be responsible think have taught not to feel to be hard lady ellington did not resent in slightest indeed be part of plan of life never to resent what anybody did said for going back to first principle resentment be generally so useless hope have taught to be sensible remarked seems to be being very sensible now said madge may certainly take credit of if wish fully intend to do at rate exactly what suggest to accept be to say man whom esteem respect who be thoroughly suitable for suitable let say wealthy because be what mean lady ellington qualified must not wish to marry cad however wealthy said madge moved softly up down room dress whispering on carpet before replied doe not strike that be rather cold blooded proceeding asked must if be in love with somebody else in case must not recommend to marry mr home a be be most sensible thing can do must go further than must say be duty again madge walked up down without replying at once ah be cold blooded said be doing because be cold blooded then stopped opposite mother mother when other girl

silent for year ah interrupt said other again there be silence except for bubbling of nightingale four note sang four note of white sound a pure a flame then broke into liquid bubble of melodious water transparent translucent apotheosis of song then thrill of ecstasy possessed cadence followed indescribable cadence a if unheard voice of nature be incarnated then quite suddenly song ceased altogether there be long pause evelyn philip sat in absolute silence waiting tom merivale have always be so sober literal fellow that took suggestion with same faith that took statement of almanack be sure to be day that almanack said be for what waited what day be knew guessed then air be divided by fluttering wing tom held hand out on forefinger there perched little brown bird sing dear said bird threw head back for nightingale sing with open throat from close at hand three heard authentic love song of nightingale unpremeditated rapture poured from wing quivering throat throbbing whole little brown body be alert with melody instinctive untaught melody of happiness of love made audible then tired stopped thank dear brother said tom go home again flutter of wing whispered in air forefinger be untenanted be have done said be only beginning evelyn gave long sigh be mad be asked be there bird there be hypnotist got up quickly phil swear saw bird heard sing said excitedly be sitting there

business generally doe much more curious thing than personally find so interesting philip silent a be wont when puzzled instead of rushing into speech have said nothing now asked question of course be not conjuring trick said must be futility used to have extraordinary hypnotic power tom only ask be that real nightingale quite real evelyn put down glass untasted be frightened said will go to bed without more word bolted into house philip called good night after there be response be left alone with hermit be not frightened said what on earth doe mean have drink tom merivale laughed quietly mean exactly what have said answered come down to home sometime will see be quite simple quite true be all a old a love a new a love be also perfectly commonplace must be so have only taken trouble to verify be cool business quality came to aid undoing mean can convey message to bird beast asked oh yes why not idea be somehow upsetting to pray let upset nothing that happens can ever be upsetting be only thing happen be such anxiety for fear may when have happened be never alarming pushed chair back got up ah have learned one thing in last year said be to be frightened at nothing fear be one indefensible emotion can hing at if be afraid know in business whether embark on business on what will call nature lore one thing indispensable be to go ahead to take stand firmly on what know deduce from then to test deduction a soon a one will bear weight to stand on deduce again being quite sure time that be true be right perhaps sometime world in general may see not degradation in origin of man from animal extraordinary nobility of then perhaps will go further back back to pagan thing to pan god of nature to see whom meant death remarked philip yes life death be merely incident in life seems to now to be rather unimportant one one ca help whereas important event be be within one control one power of thought for instance philip rose also love said be that in one control tom took long breath love said be not exactly in one control because be there dear bird have got home again from tree below bubble of liquid melody sounded third evelyn dundas be sitting next morning after breakfast on terrace where what alluded to a nightingale trick have be performed evening before in company with conjurer who have performed philip madge ellington have just gone down to river lady ellington who be to have accompanied having excused at last moment since mother be in closer more intimate connection with girl than mere chaperone have seen not smallest objection to two going alone indeed have firmly detained evelyn by series of question required answer from joining though deep in discussion about art have dropped in most critical state when judged that other two have be given time to get under way have required indeed maternal solicitude to continue so long for cared le for art evelyn theory about than for week old paper like most artist evelyn have somewhat egoistic nature since personality be so graceful interesting followed that many people found talk equally so especially when talked about for egoism have admirably probable explanation be at moment explaining to tom merivale who have made soft impeachment with regard to undoubted existence ah yes be saying artist business be not to put thing down a be to put down a strike actual truth have nothing to do with value of landscape point be that picture must be beautiful same with portrait only beauty there be unnecessary have to put down what think see what choose to see must lead to egoism remarked tom must lead to study of other people evelyn shook head no said lead to devote entirely almost to cultivation of own faculty of seeing fine portrait show great deal of artist perhaps comparatively little of sitter why be rembrandt so unmistakable not because type of sitter be almost identical because there be lot of rembrandt in ca have style unless be egoistic in fact for artist style mean egoism have heap say pretend be good there be take leave tom merivale laughed be perfectly inimitable said love serious vivid nonsense that be egoist be quite quite true how much better artist must be if be what want be deepening like deep know have got like what understand very simple little affair last night for instance frightened egoist be invariably truthful according to light about evelyn be truthful now yes be so said pretend to wish to seek out secret of star know what like like anything lead into heart of thing like interior symbolism there be quite enough symbol for on surface what mean be that eyebrow curve of mouth will tell quite a much a one have use for about brain make eyebrow frown mouth smile beauty may be skin deep only be quite deep enough skin deep why be a deep a sea tom merivale be silent little do know be interesting survival of pagan spirit said at length evelyn laughed erect altar then at once crown with rose remarked what have said just now that make think that nothing particular moment answered though remarking that beauty be enough for be thoroughly greek in way what struck be that never have seen in smallest rudiment embryo of conscience of moral sense evelyn looked up with real interest at criticism oh be perfectly true said certainly never have remorse must be awful sort of moral toothache same steal lie know merely because lying stealing be very inartistic performance said tom idea of morality stand in way evelyn got up looking out over heat hazed green of wood below with brilliant glance be very shocking asked with perfectly unassumed naivete suppose be personally be never shocked at anything seems to very dangerous ought to wear semaphore with red lamp burning at end of evelyn half shut eye put head on one side think must compose well said be most consistently spoken said tom really if be ever in earnest about anything beside art must be public danger evelyn turned round on call pagan said well what be pray with communings with nature conjuring trick with nightingale belong to quite a early form of man know be primeval at least hope to be before die what be object in order to see pan be getting on come down to new forest sometime will see very odd thing promise really evelyn wish must come must do end of good got up taking arm of other man walked with down terrace be brilliant grant said be like mirror only reflecting thing what want be to be lit from within who be who talk of royalty of inward happiness be such true phrase happiness from without be not happiness at be only pleasure pleasure be always imperfect flicker go out have scratching nail evelyn shook free ah let be said want anything else besides a have told before yourself dislike detest suffering pain how can hope to understand nature at if leave aside why man whole of nature be one groan one continuous preying of creature on creature in life in new forest leave out tom merivale paused know do said because want to grasp first once for huge joy pervades nature seems to much more vital in than pain seems to that pain may be much more rightly called absence of joy than joy be called absence of pain what whole thing start from essential spring of world be not pain death joy life ah there be with there be so much joy life on surface of thing wish to probe down ah tom day like now woven web of blue heat hot scent from flower bed face of friend be that not enough be for talking of face miss ellington have most perfectly modelled face ever saw more look at more amazes stared at breakfast charm of be consistent irregularity not feature be anything like perfect what whole wish must do portrait tom laughed there must not be slightest difficulty about must say remarked if promise to present to mother why of course must how funny must feel to be hard like be very bruising feel that be being hit in eye when talk to know how many shilling go to sovereign twenty remarked tom ah be where be wrong get twenty one for of sovereign thirteen penny for of shilling portrait of daughter for nothing at oh tom think of with background of something blue cornflower forget nots lilac to show how really golden hair be there be mr home evelyn whistled with peculiar shrillness on finger to neat little figure on croquet lawn below started not violently for nothing did be violent very completely ah be only said thought might be express train loose be not going on river dear evelyn be prevented said jumping down step in one flying leap dear philippina what next what next murmured mr home oh do behave evelyn well philip be son so be philippina why have prize fighter in house prize fighter yes lady ellington have head in chancery for ten minute just now delivered series of quick firing question know why too be to prevent going on river be perfectly successful must think always be successful mowed down now will tell truth not dear evelyn said mr home rather hastily guessing what be coming then be very wicked woman a now know be going to tell untruth will do just a well for purpose now be philip engaged to miss ellington dear indeed be not said mr home oh why not lie better than said evelyn mr home clasped white delicate little hand together ah be true said really be literally true a far a know evelyn shook head at have be gone hour said mean tell mean that may be now for know mr home turned pretty china blue eye on to with sort of diminutive air of dignity of course be at liberty to put construction please on anything say remarked be said put now be pleased at be charming said mr home hopelessly off guard be wanted to know said evelyn what tangled web weave without deceiving in least old darling tom merivale have not joined evelyn strolled along upper walk through herbaceous border have not stayed away from home now for past year delighted though be to see two old friend of again confessed to that found call on sociability visit tacitly implied rather trying more than that found even presence of other people in house with whom be not on term of intimacy thing little upsetting for year of solitude have given justification to nickname for solitude be habit of extraordinary fascination very quick to grow on anyone who have sufficient interest in thing not to be bored by absence of people with tom merivale nature unfolding of flower lighting of star in sky white splendour of moon hiss of rain on to cowering shrub thirsty grass be much more than interest be passion absorbed devoured for nature to true devotee be mistress far more exacting far more infinite in variety reward than be ever human mistress to adorer tom merivale at rate be faithful wholly constant to now after year spent in solitude in man have ever felt le alone human tie affection weighed at compared to patient devotion with worshipped ever young mistress of to indeed a to mr home cutting of off from other human tie might seem to verge on insanity to others a to philip might equally well be construed into example of perfect sanity for have left world cast mooring loose from society in embittered disappointed mood severance of connection with thing of human interest have be deliberate sanely made believed in fact that what inner essential self demanded be not to be found among men a have put once to philip be to be found there in such small quantity compared to mass of alloy undesirable material from have to be extracted that be false economy to quarry in world of city more than too have renounced though second renunciation have not be deliberate have followed so found a sequel to other for have be writer of fiction who though never widely read have be prized pored over by circle of reader whose appreciation be probably far more worth having than of wider circle must have be then suddenly a far a even most intimate friend knew have left london establishing instead in cottage of more comfortable sort of cottage mile outside brockenhurst in tea cup way have made quite storm in set knew well in fact by whom be valued a interpreter living example of thing of wrote writing have always be impersonal in note slightly mystical always with refrain of nature running through none when disappeared a completely a waring suspected how vital to disappearance have be anything out of way be labelled rightly by majority to be insane by such verdict tom merivale certainly merited bedlam have gone away in fact to think while majority of who crowd into city do so not to think to be within reach of distraction leave time for thought for action be always le difficult than thought man can act for more hour day than can think in week action being productive function of brain be thus rightly also from social point of view considered more respectable employment subject of difficult doctrine however be more than content a have said be happy state far on sunward side of other seemed to indeed to be sitting very much awake alert on great sunlit slope of world untenanted by man peopled with million natural marvel unconjectured a yet by world slowly coming into ken of wondering patient eye for year now have consciously solely devoted to study contemplation of life that eternal ever renewed life of nature joy manifested therein have turned back with same careful deliberation on be painful in nature suffering that hinders mar fulness of life on everything in fact be evidence of imperfection in to large extent be identically minded with christian scientist having faced central idea of christianity namely suffering be necessary a atonement for sin have confessed unable to accept at present at rate possibility of suffering being ever necessary must no longer call christian happiness be gospel book in studied be nature omitting always such chapter a dealt with man for man so seemed to have by century of evolution built into something so widely different from nature original design that very contemplation of association with man be thing to be avoided absence of serenity absence of happiness seemed two leading characteristic of human race whereas happiness serenity be chief of thing for sought for lived year solitude quest for joy have already produced in remarkable result have be originally of very high strung nervous irritable temperament now however must not imagine event must disturb equanimity for a far a went alone be perfectly willing to accept possible explanation that year life in open air have wrought simple miracle of healing on nerve a have said to lady ellington perfection of health have eliminated possibility of discontent other phenomenon did not admit of quite so obvious interpretation be on that based belief that though occurred must necessarily be natural following be to say law of nature be experiencing effect of law be to rest of world occult unknown for in word youth with vivid vigour capacity for growth expansion have returned to in way unprecedented face a evelyn have noticed have grown younger in hundred merely corporeal way have stepped back into early manhood again be more inexplicable have somehow established without meaning to certain communion with bird beast of nightingale trick have be small instance seemed to must be direct hitherto unknown effect of conscious absorption of in nature how far along unexplored path must be able to go have idea guessed however that have at present taken only few halting step along road be lost in golden haze of wonder strolled along out through garden into solitary upland of bush besprinkled turf wild flower of downland rock rose harebell orchid meadow sweet carpeted short grass midsummer held festival morning thought be distracted from nature world in lived found dwelling on human being among whom for few day must pas time be natural from attitude of last year that evelyn dundas mr home must be of party in house most congenial to simplicity of seemed to far more interesting than greater complexity of others must be true be hard to find two example of simplicity so utterly unlike other serene absence of calculation scheming brought under one head be in way child of nature mr home on one hand having arrived at inheritance by cheerful unswerving patience serenity with event external to herself while in case of other huge vitality coupled with extreme impressionableness to beauty brought so seemed to tom merivale into very close connection with essential of life a have told friend evelyn attitude to life be instinctively pagan immoral be not for fastidiousness labelled thing ugly have apparently no rudiment even of conscience sense of moral obligation somehow with curious sixth sense of prescience so common in animal so rare among civilized human being who by mean of continued calculation reasoned surmise of future have caused to wither atrophize tom felt just a must feel approaching storm vague sense of coming disaster sensation be very undefined distinctly unpleasant following invariable rule to divert mind from unpleasantness lay down on short turf buried face in great bed of thyme grew there summer be in smell hot redolent very breath of life with eye half closed nostril expanded breathed deeply in place have come to be very remote solitary big clearing in middle of tree well known to in earlier year road crossed house lay near air be resonant with labouring bee bird called fluted to other in tree suddenly a lay there half lost in stupor of happiness heard very faintly noise to at first paid little attention be sound apparently of flute being played at great distance off what soon arrested attention be extremely piercing character of note remote a sound be surrounded a be by hundred noise of summer noon yet seemed to perfectly clear distinct through then something further struck for phrase after phrase of delicious melody be poured out yet same phrase be never repeated did melody come to end on top of climax came be tune unending eternal whether came from earth heaven from above below must not determine for seemed to come from everywhere equally be a universal a humming of bee then suddenly thought flashed into mind sprang up strange look of fear crossed face at same instant tune ceased illustration text decoration illustration text decoration fourth be not in lady ellington nature to be enthusiastic since considered enthusiasm to be a great waste of emotional fibre a anger be at least thoroughly satisfied when two evening after madge came to room before dinner after punting expedition with philip gave news be quite charming said mother have shown great good sense dear child must kiss where be mr home philip must call now be outside said madge said must go down again for few minute before dinner lady ellington got up kissed daughter conscientiously first on one cheek then on other will come down with said just to tell how very much delighted be will have to have long talk to to morrow morning there be reason why engagement must not be announced at once in consequence congratulation descended within half hour mr home be little tearful with tear of loving happiness on behalf of son seemed something of weakness to lady ellington tom merivale be delighted in sort of faraway manner that other people must be happy evelyn dundas alone in spite of previous preparation for news felt somehow slightly pulled up for with complete instinctive surrender to mood of moment have permitted to take great pleasure in contemplation be really hardly more than of madge beauty felt secretly for shadow obscured genuineness of congratulation certain surprise sense of being ill used be not least in love with madge even in so short time have fallen into way of comradeship engagement felt curtailed liberty of delightful relationship again evening having cut out of bridge table wandered with in perfect dusk lady ellington time observed exit cheerfully permitted harm must be done now received in fact direct conscious sanction since philip have suggested to madge that evelyn must paint portrait knew that evelyn be more than willing to do so left arrangement of sitting to sitter artist in point of fact be subject occupied two a went out will be in london for next month mr dundas madge be saying of course will try to suit convenience be so good of to say will begin at once evelyn habitual frankness did not desert ah must confess then said be at good of see want to paint believe can will write to morrow to terrible railway director to say that in consequence of subsequent engagement can not begin delineation of disgusting feature for month madge laughed a be way of country house party advance in intimacy have be very rapid oh must be foolish said delineate disgusting feature if have promised disgusting feature will wait ah be just what wo do said evelyn do mean will go bad like meat in hot weather thank so much impression will go bad said must paint at once besides still be perfectly frank besides philip be suppose oldest friend have asked to do friendship come before cheque walked in silence little while be rather nervous said madge watched painting afternoon for bit oh silly sketch said flower terrace wood behind be only study for background well seemed to affect frowned growled stared bit end of brush be going to be stuck up on platform to be growled at stared at think must stand must laugh evelyn nodded head in strong approval will be what want said will growl to extent if will make laugh will paint laughing laughing at ups down of world promise will laugh with sad eye too added did know have sad eye madge slightly entrenched at really have studied own expression said woman be supposed to use mirror good deal use assure to see if hair be tidy never be quite said suit admirably again gravel sounded crisply below foot without overscore of human voice then spoke again please accept portrait of a wedding present to philip said with boyish abruptness madge for moment be too utterly surprised to speak mr dundas said at length ca how can laughed well must send to philip then said if wo receive why must not be going to marry oldest friend ca send ivory toothbrush reassured be too kind of said have forgotten that so send to certainly help to make then a good a can tell how asked feeling inexplicably uneasy why laugh said be how see laugh so seldom might laugh so often why laugh oftener then impulse of simple honesty came to because be usually bored said ah really must be bored while be painting said must hing with if be bored besides must be so uncharacteristic how be that when be bored so often asked oh be thing do often be characteristic of said be thing do eagerly with intention laughed at then be right said be never eagerly bored to tell truth think will be bored when sit to ah there be philip doe not see wonder whether will philip white fronted figure have appeared at moment at french window leading out of drawing room eye fresh from bright light inside be not yet focussed to obscurity of dusk at moment madge found suddenly wishing that must go back again a soon a be conscious wished that resolutely stifled wish called to evelyn there too asked have got to go in take place will take mine said with just shade of discontent in voice dear fellow said philip will take own laughed congratulate again said left philip stood for moment in silence by girl looking at with sort of shy longing wonder ah what luck said at length what stupendous perfect luck what be luck philip asked why think of chance against meeting in big world think of chance against saying 'yes now now that have happened must have be otherwise vague nameless trouble took possession of girl shivered slightly be cold darling said quickly have be leaning against stone balustrade of terrace stood upright close to not in least said what be then asked be nothing only suppose feel be strange that in moment whole future course of one life be changed like took hand in authentic fire of love burned in eye strange said be not most wonderful of miracle never knew anything so wonderful must happen make rest of life seem dim there be just one huge beacon of light rest be in shadow raised face to imploringly oh philip be to asked be afraid because have made happiest man alive sudden inevitable impulse of honesty prompted madge to speak out because have perhaps meddled with great force about know nothing like immensely have never liked anyone so much esteem respect be quite willing to lead rest of life with want nothing different will do be that enough have never loved a believe love think be possible to there have told philip raised hand to lip kissed ah dearest give have be yet say 'be that enough ' whispered what more be possible looked at moment trouble not yet quite gone from face then raised to then take said night be very warm windless for time longer walked up down stood resting against terrace wall looking down over hushed wood nightingale same perhaps that have be charmed to tom finger two evening ago poured out liquid melody moon began to rise in east gradually talk veered to other subject madge mentioned that evelyn be willing to do portrait will begin at once said because appears impression of be thing will keep be putting off order for be dreadfully immoral said philip be delighted to hear thing give to think said a wedding present ah ca have said philip quickly be evelyn over there never be such unthinking generous fellow be quite impossible why must mean sixth part of year income know felt philip laughed rather perplexedly really know what be to be done with said last year gave mother beautiful pearl brooch that sort of thing be so embarrassing if have not accepted must have be quite capable of throwing into thames indeed threatened to do so will be equally capable of throwing cheque into fire same like enormously said impulse mean know offends instinct a man of business might just a well refuse to charge interest on loan however will see what can do went in again soon after for be growing late found lady ellington preparing to leave table of very complete conquest have fallen to evelyn to provide with trump hand containing four ace be disposed to be gracious news furthermore that must begin daughter portrait at once be gratifying to be anxious that sitting must begin at once a must be in town for next month matter be easily settled be arranged that thing must be put in hand immediately philip followed evelyn to billiard room a soon a woman went upstairs found alone there hermit have gone to commune with nature said will die of natural cause if doe look out called pagan morning philip be rude fact that be true seems to to make ruder philip lit cigarette be going to be rude too old chap said evelyn really must make present of portrait to madge be awfully good of just like simply must accept evelyn shrugged shoulder then there will be portrait at said shortly tell wo paint a order philip held out hand appreciate tremendously said be most awfully good of be profession hullo here be hermit back tom merivale entered at moment be going to sit out to night said evelyn rose yes let go out said well philip not line will draw unless take will give to miss ellington not really mu said philip see want to paint said so to only other day hang tell do for pleasure will also be vast gainer artistically have got idea about in fact if let paint will do from memory in case will not be so good idea struck philip well paint a well said let pay for evelyn followed tom out oh ca haggle said yes will paint if like will paint miss ellington first in fact will be painted when have nothing else to do well hermit seen pan to day scoffer said tom call when do must like to see too let see be man with goat leg sort of thing see in barnum tom shifted in chair day perhaps may think serious said daresay man with goat leg be not to be taken lightly said evelyn sits by roadside doe so browning say playing pipe what pipe wonder bagpipe do suppose tom laughed equanimity be quite undisturbed even by chaff upon what be to most serious subject in world ah who be frightened at nightingale coming to sit on finger few night ago evelyn if be not serious will frighten again well be bagpipe asked tom suddenly got grave sounded more like glass flute very far off said explanation be forthcoming because have got evelyn be silent moment when did hear glass flute very far off asked two morning ago up above house in big clearing in wood answered know nothing more about frightened rather then stopped what did play asked philip world without end tune said catechising be now over will go to bed think must leave to morrow philip hoped must stop day two longer must really go must find appointment with pan in new forest remarked evelyn dodging cushion be thrown at philip have to spend inside of next day in london left with tom merivale by early train leaving evelyn alone with mother lady ellington madge came about very naturally that lady ellington gravitated to mr home evelyn finishing background sketch in front of great clump of purple clematis found madge on terrace when went out with unopened book on lap book have lain there indeed in same state for hour before came for madge have be very fully occupied with own thought have have talk to mother night before morning seemed to to be more revealing of herself than even own confession to philip in stroll on terrace have be have told just what have told namely that gave very willingly that knew of liking esteem respect adding out of philip mouth that more than contented then lady ellington for first time perhaps for many year have made strategical error allowing emotion not reason to dictate to have said ah madge how clever of have seen mistake moment afterwards just moment too late for madge have asked very simple question why unsatisfactory nature of mother reply have given food for thought for lady ellington have applauded a clever what be to very rudiment of honour have supposed that mother must say how very stupid of clearly then while extremely uncalculating to herself madge have succeeded in giving impression of calculation to one who well knew calculated what then asked be secret of love of be ignorant that rendered confession of ignorance so satisfactory reply effusive pleasure on mother part at termination of recital have not consoled somehow according to lady ellington view almost quixotic honesty appeared clever be over riddle that be puzzling when evelyn appeared with brilliance so to speak streaming from brilliance certainly streamed from half finished sketch brilliance marked exposition of oh lead dog life said a planted easel down on gravel do know lady taverner for whom be to be background congratulate be pink simply pink like phlox with butter coloured hair probably acquired well put pat of butter phlox on purple plate will see that phlox be pinker than ever butter more buttery therefore since really be very thorough make sketch of clematis to see how flower really grow will plaster with mass behind sapphire round neck pink jewess in middle added in tone of extraordinary irritation madge let book slide to ground do want to be talked to not asked if say so will go away evelyn looked up from purple clematis lead dog life said sometimes somebody throw bone so throw one seem to growl over said know do be because though lead dog life nobody will take bone from bit end of brush filthy thing cast purple shadow upwards said at least sun shine on purple reflects purple on leaf overhang wish have be born without sense of colour must have made such ripping etching madge have immediate reply to painted for ten minute in silence have picked up book again read word of reading must not be called have given many bone said at length madge looked up know have said seriously considered if have got anything to say found have so decided to say nothing evelyn dabbed in purple star surely one have always something in one mind said ca help so why not say penny for thought now madge laughed be worth far more in fact be not in market said evelyn grew portentously grave mr gummidge said oh what do mean asked have be thinking of old one said evelyn philip quite true be said be such dear so glad like muttered evelyn again frowning biting brush lord love what blue world be morning there ca paint more just now be rather sudden be oh always stop like said evelyn go on painting painting then suddenly somebody turn tap off in head have finished ca see more must paint if did suppose day will come when tap will be turned permanently off shortly afterwards will be seen to jump off westminster bridge only hope nobody will succeed in rescuing will try to remember if happen to be there said evelyn put sketch to dry in shadow of terrace wall law be so ridiculous said punish if succeed in committing suicide when try to say be temporarily insane if do whereas bungler be probably far more deranged than man who doe job properly will never commit suicide said madge with conviction ah wait till care about anything a much a care about painting said evelyn then contemplate living without why must cease without world must be no longer possible must so to speak hold water ah do really feel about like said tell what be like feeling evelyn laughed ought to know said because imagine be like being permanently in love here be a random arrow a be ever let fly have be unconscious of even drawing bow to unutterable surprise went full straight to mark girl face went suddenly expressionless a if lamp within have be turned out rose quickly with half stifled exclamation ah what nonsense be talking said quickly evelyn looked at in genuine distress at having unwittingly caused pain why of course be said how people can talk sense day beat must live at such high pressure personally preserve precious grain of sense may have put into picture of picture simply bristle with sense startled pain have not died out of madge eye laughed evelyn looking at gave little staccato exclamation what be now asked why laughed with sad eye be extraordinarily like what picture will be at moment girl glanced away that sudden unexplained little stab of pain have experienced have left nervous whole nature have winced under like man who feel sudden moment of internal agony for first time be frightened did not know what meant expect be nonsense too said at least be nonsense very obvious for suppose when anyone laugh however fully laugh there be always something tragic behind ah how nice to laugh entirely just once from hair to heel ca do ever asked evelyn sympathetically never can most people think be haunted house there be always ghost of kind tapping at door lurking in dusk only few people have ghost must think be infinitesimal be much to be envied evelyn listened with ear to partly because madge be already such good friend anything new about be interesting partly because though a have said surface be enough for bore so very directly on coming portrait of yes expect be true said most people certainly have ghost be wise to wall up one haunted room be not madge shook head yes be still there said got up from low chair in be sitting with air of dismissing subject of talk come ask more of very silly riddle said think be admirable in laying ghost so too be mr dundas be sure will not resent when say be because be so frightfully silly ghost can not stand silliness evelyn laughed be so recuperative to be silly said because requires effort to person of silly disposition be to say one have to be how easy opened eye at mean find easy to be natural said why must have thought be almost most difficult thing in world to be now pose be easy be like acting have got to be somebody else to be have to know what one be first of one have to know what one like evelyn laughed again not at just have to shut eye take long breath begin talking whatever say be girl shook head ah understand said everybody be really sort of people put into one envelope be to say what one piece of be prompting to say what be thinking about be just same with one action one hardly ever doe thing part of one want to do one action just like one word be sort of compromise between desire of one different component paused moment with woman quickness of intuition provided against might possibly be in mind of course when big choice come said one whole being have to consent one only have dozen of in one life expect have guessed quite rightly for idea of marriage have inevitably suggested to evelyn when said one hardly ever doe thing part of one want to do in addition have made to speech there be even more direct allusion to necessarily cancelled from mind first impression be bound in fact to accept last word fenced little longer see that one choice can really be considered bigger than said smallest choice may have hugest consequence one must never have foretold because be completely outside one own control may for instance settle to go up to london to morrow by morning train later one well seems small enough choice supposing one train have frightful

one place still more seldom with only one person madge madge house have now enjoyed full share of time ah be very bad at riddle said besides none of know 'why ' about anything on whole reason motif matter very little thing that happen be so numerous so interesting that one have literally not time to probe into ask how why after dear when anything so very nice have happened a engagement too have brought gain to in be more than content so must be to accept that a be now must simply fly be dining out going to opera to dance afterwards what pity there be not forty eight hour in day regret be subsequently shared by madge herself who found that life of young woman who be going to be married in six week time for wedding have be fixed for end of july implies full engagement book in addition to ordinary call on time hour be further claimed from by evelyn dundas who apparently have insisted to sitter on prior right of subsequent engagement announced free to begin portrait at once to give sitting whenever must sit finish a quickly a power of brush must permit impetuousness a usual swept away difficulty before fortnight have elapsed madge have already given four sitting picture be beginning to live breathe on canvas sitting rather artist manner mood during be strangely various sometimes for hour a madge complained must hing stare at grunting to biting end of brush then in moment must be changed instead of staring grunting with idle hand must glance at record record glance again absorbed in passion of creation whistling sometimes gently to at other time silent with smiling mouth then that wind of inspiration that bloweth where listeth must leave again must declare roundly that did not know what be like what picture be like that only thing quite certain be that picture be not like then even while gloomy announcement be on lip even in middle of sentence must murmur to oh see swish of happy brush must alone break silence at other time there be silence to break from time stepped up on to platform till when left must pour out perfect flood of inconsequent nonsense again hour passed in unbroken conversation between two talk sometimes flitting like butterfly over open flower of life at other time a have done once twice at philip house dropping suddenly into heart of thing finding sometimes honey there sometimes shadow only sitting of latter kind have just come to end evelyn after seeing sitter into carriage have returned to studio still palette in hand meaning to work for hour at background certainly in short space of time have made admirable progress knew within that be to be landmark of work up to present at rate high water mark have drawn girl standing very upright a be wont with head little thrown back face eye mouth alike laughed be daring conception happiness of execution be worthy of fore shortening of face owing to throw back of head drawing too of open mouth of half closed eye be triumph figure be shown in white evening dress with hand locked together carrying feather fan arm at full length in front of over shoulder half thrown back be scarlet opera cloak one note of high colour in scheme behind on wall have introduced by one of daring feat be labelled by detractor a cheeky by who estimated fairly excellence of execution round gilt framed mirror with convex glass in on be distortedly reflected room back of girl figure be at that have returned to work now evelyn studio like room much used by anyone who have at vivid personality have caught much of character of owner have made out of top floor in house in king road by throwing attic into one big room often for whole day must not stir from till be too dark to paint having tray of lunch brought sometimes must savagely devour at other time leave untouched till be literally faint with hunger be easy to see too how room have grown so to speak how have picked up characteristic big divan for instance in window piled with brightly coloured cushion have evidently be of early furniture remnant of imperishable childhood so too doubt be open dutch tiled fireplace chippendale table few big chair stood about japanese screen by door after however sort of various taste showed heap of dry modelling clay in one corner recorded fit of despair when have asserted that only real form of art be form not colour violin with two string missing denoted that after hearing sarasate be convinced for several hour at least that music of string be alone flower worth plucking showed also delightful conviction that be never too late to learn though broken string might imply that be now too late to mend set of punch complete from beginning lay like heap of morraine stone round sofa bag of rusty golf club stood in corner behind japanese screen leaned bicycle on dust have collected evidence of being for time at rate out of date far a owner be concerned three month before three month afterwards visitor might scarcely have recognised room again portrait might have be finished with disengaged eye evelyn must survey what must certainly call pigsty bicycle must be sent to cellar with golf club slung on to heap of modelling clay be dumped on dustheap japanese screen banished to kitchen because for moment japanese art be parody profanation violin perhaps have string mended again instead of japanese screen being banished japan might have flooded whole studio a army flood manchuria equally certain uncompromising gospel pronounce that alone be good be then to temple of contradiction evelyn returned three step to stride after seeing madge off figure be right felt sure of tone of background somehow be not yet quite attuned to above mirror must be bright burnished gold not dull for flame of cloak if be only note of high colour in picture consumed burned away ineffectually be with heart beat fast not only from gallop upstairs from excitement in creation be that again stood before picture yes be high light be necessary for moment looked at laughing face on canvas almost laughing then on sudden laughter died need of picture for high light died too for though eye be looking on own presentment of madge be madge that soul saw even a eye loved work of hand so knew in burning flash of self revelation that soul loved up till now up till very moment have not known that be so that be possible have long since recognised that possibility be reaching tentacle out into region of probable have recognised so to speak out of corner of eye have recognised cut now came knowledge evelyn gave great sigh raising hand one with palette on thumb other with brush held to full stretch let fall again stood still in front of own inimitable portrait drinking in longer with artist eye only with eye of lover incomparable beauty of beloved that rush of sudden knowledge so impetuous so overwhelming for moment drowned else did not enter head to consider what next present moment be so blindingly bright that everything that lay outside be in impenetrable shadow intimate relation into be thrown with girl by reason of portrait fact that be engaged that to best friend did not at first have existence in mind looked at one fact that loved to exclusion of else then a must always happen came reaction from ecstatic moment in train of reaction like grey ghost thought even thought for time be gilded by light of central sun be long before must frame situation in bounding line of life conduct for love be force be impatient of opposition against opposition will hurl like wild bird against wire of cage careless of whether be dashed to piece knowing only overwhelming instinct need of liberty to gain death be snap of careless finger then almost with laugh at came that most important factor that have overlooked for couple of minute egoism have run away with taking bit in teeth thought that loved that needed have not only be uppermost alone in mind what of be engaged to philip shortly to be married to be merely to be relegated to somewhat populous class of odd man out ebb from full flood of passion be swift came in moment a swiftly a other have come so that be be left of be possible that must just stand aside while other two went on way not daring even to touch hem of garment for must most surely draw away from that clearly be logical outcome logical a be not single fibre of inmost self accepted that one thing to reasonable mind must assuredly happen be to one thing must not possibly happen very strength of newly awakened love be insuperable bar to must not be for what question seemed to at moment perfectly unanswerable what on earth be to happen to in case here be pagan interesting survival a tom merivale have called most unmistakably surviving shouting a be that own happiness own need be one thing rest of world must accept respect since only way in due acceptation must be secured for be conditional on madge loving have to happen also yes nothing else must do have to love reasoning if one can call by so deliberate word leaping conclusion be not act of reflecting egoism emotion whole being have be suddenly stirred there necessarily rose to surface sediment so to speak of dwelt in depth whole course habit of past life doubt be responsible for what be there be more responsible at particular moment for thought conclusion leaped in fire into mind than be man who be suddenly startled responsible for starting nerve have acted without dictation of brain with evelyn a minute passed still sat there with heightened colour flashing eye looking at unfinished picture ceased to be comparable to suddenly startled man thought have sprung unbidden to mind be not put away remained there grew in brightness conscious reflection endorsed first instinctive impulse so happened that have arranged to go down afternoon to spend couple of night in new forest with hermit when engagement be again remembered by seemed to at first impossible to go what have learned in last hour be thing so staggering that felt a if affair of life social intercourse discussion of subject of a if subject one contained even germ protoplasm of importance have become impossible go stay everything be impossible except to win madge love then impossibility bigger perhaps than made appearance for most impossible thing of be to be alone anything be more endurable than side by side with rose namely impossibility of keeping knowledge to must felt tell somebody of people in world hermit be person whom must be most easy to tell then sort of pale image of philip came into mind be conscious of disloyalty to because be incapable of thinking of at except a of somebody vague somebody who dwelt among shadow outside light mr home be more nobody be anything more than dweller in shadow indeed have be able to think of philip directly concentratedly must have accused of disloyalty madge must never love in case harm be done to anyone must do so in case marriage with philip be impossibility impossibility too existence of have better be found out before be legally confirmed yet quivered through mind be gone again caught a passing glimpse of world of life conduct a caught of station that train thundered through in westerly course brushed by inward eye have passed before have ever be focussed seen with anything like clearness hermit have once told may be remembered that wanted deepening evelyn on occasion have enunciated general principle that have use for deep surface being sufficient for need even now though egotism be so all embracing be in sense profound did not probe be of glittering surface alone on shone sun of love that be conscious deep perhaps might lie beneath be unexplored life like pleasure boat with willow dipping oar went gaily across indeed be probable that before depth if depth be there must be sounded sun so to speak must have to go in for with dazzle on water be impossible to see what lay below tom merivale cottage have begun life a two cottage stood very solitary mile two outside brockenhurst though high road passed within few hundred yard of be impossible to conceive place that more partook of essential nature of hermitage between high road lay field with only rough track across beyond nearer to house orchard while huge box hedge compact homogeneous with growth careful clipping of many year be to who wished to be shut off from outer world bar a impenetrable a ring of fire immediately beyond stood cottage looking away from road in front strip of garden led down to little river fawn across river lay great open expanse of heath through like wedge came down big triangular wood of beech tree be way over garden open forest that cottage looked not house of kind be in sight one might watch like ship wrecked mariner for sail for sign of human life yet in long summer day perhaps watcher must see nothing to tell that be not alone a far a humankind went in woodland world tom have built out long deep verandah ran whole length of cottage on garden front brick pillar at two corner supported wooden roof couple of step led down into garden down centre of ran pergola over climbed in tangled luxuriance long limbed tribe of climbing rose rambler spilt crimson cluster over lay in streak ball of white yellow foam while carmine pillar seemed to struggle in embrace honeysuckle cast loving tendril round kissed promiscuously though gardener might have deplored untended riot of vegetation yet even most orderly of fraternity must not have failed to admire nature fruitful soil warm soft air to frost be stranger have taken matter into own hand result though a fortuitous apparently a splashed glory of sunset have yet sunset lavishness generosity of colour on side of pergola lay small lawn of well tended turf shrubbery on one side of lilac syringa on other tall brick wall with deep garden bed below gave fragrant frame to whole hermit avowal indeed that for last year have done nothing except carpentering gardening implied good deal of latter for turf a have be stated be beautifully rolled cut bed showed evidence of seed time weeding have that indefinable unmistakable air of being zealously cared for since such operation be concerned with plant principle be broken evelyn arrived here soon after six found in undisturbed possession mr merivale so said servant have gone off soon after breakfast that morning have not yet returned guest however have be expected must be sure to be in before long indeed in few minute cry of welcome to evelyn sounded from lower end of garden left long chair in verandah went down through pergola to meet ah dear fellow said tom be delightful to see have come from london have not where there be so many people so few thing have be thinking about london have idea how remote seems how be picture getting on miss ellington mean evelyn looked at with direct luminous gaze though have come down here with object of telling friend what have happened found that at first moment of meeting be incapable of making tongue go on errand ah portrait said really be getting on well up to morning at rate have put there what have meant to put there be rarer with have not put there anything did not mean do see how vastly more important be hermit have passed day in open merely in shirt trouser coat be lying in hammock slung between two pillar of pergola put on why of course said thing ought not to be there poison rest anything put in must be left out set whole thing jarring be exactly why left world live in there be so much that must have be there from point of view at least evelyn laughed if left out that of think must be there there must be precious little left in world said for instance must leave out lady ellington without slightest question paused moment when portrait be finished doubt must leave out added with charming candour quite so said merivale since not being uncontrolled despot must not 'leave out people suppose be soft way of saying terminate existence went away instead to place where be naturally left out where for existence be terminated be part of simplifying process have established in verandah again where silent footed man be laying table for dinner struck evelyn for moment a inconsistency that tablecloth must be so fine silver so resplendent in simplification said evelyn indicating table leave out that sort of thing no because if once opened question of whether must live on bare necessity of life allow so to speak little dripping on bread rest of life must be spent in settling infinitesimal point really think much matter must no doubt sell silver realize few hundred pound give away think matter much same be inconsistent in detail doe not seem to to matter said merivale for instance eat meat partly because think that be better not to take life if can avoid when midge settle on hand bite if possible kill well anyhow inconsistency make up very charming whole said other looking round be charming be glad think can pas day two here without missing complication live among wish philip must have come down too be buried in work appears know how leisure be occupied just now evelyn moved suddenly in chair ah do know be rather glad philip be here said think broke off again a soon a have finished portrait be going to do added be silent moment feeling somehow that never must do philip portrait must not be able to see must not be able to paint something shadow something so bright must stand between canvas that must be unable to see beyond through merivale did not seem to notice check eye be looking out over glowing garden where colour be turned to flame in almost level ray of sun a drew near to setting wall behind deep garden bed glowed a if brick be luminous light seemed to exude from grass flower be bell cup of fire ah be best moment of day said when sunset come like whole of sunshine of hour seem distilled into be very essence of light rose from chair went to edge of verandah stretching arm wide breathing deeply of warm fragrant air then turned again to companion that too hope be what death will be like said sunlight of life will be concentrated into moment until one mere body can hold more of glow impregnates be shattered look at cluster of rambler little more must burst with colour evelyn got up too be so uncomfortable tom cried in sort of boyish petulance must go mad when think of death be horrible frightening want to die want to get old want to be young always to feel a feel to day never jot le keenly be what must tell while be here how be to remain young seem to have solved be much younger than when knew first tom laughed proof of youth be feel a do about death said more be conscious of own life more absurd notion that one can die becomes why even one body wo die will make life will be grass on one grave just a dead leaf that fall from tree make leaf mould feed that tree tree grass doe in least matter be one be life evelyn shivered slightly yes quite true not least consoling said for what be use of being alive if one loses one individuality doe make death least le terrible to even if know that be going to become piece of groundsel be pecked at by canary want to be groundsel want to be pecked at want to become canary great heaven fancy being bit of canary ah only body said other evelyn got up yes what happens to rest tell that piece of for body be piece of becomes canary know about rest indeed be not cheerful prospect if bird peck eye out be consolation to who becomes blind to learn that bird have have dinner merivale looked at even a gladys have seen that change have come in madge so saw that something have happened to evelyn registered that impression in mind change whatever be be not permanent be phase mood only for next moment evelyn have broken out into perfectly natural laugh sha make think of melancholy subject more cried indeed may try wo be able to do have never be more full of joy of life than to day be why be so glad to come down here a be sort of apostle of joy be true that also want to talk to time about something quite serious not now though after dinner also will have to show bag of conjuring trick mechanical nightingale disappearing omelette must do by way pan pipe now be going upstairs to change have got london thing on artistic eye be offended where will find will go down to bathe wo come said merivale evelyn wrinkled up nose have not be hot enough besides one be inferior to frog in water be humiliating frog swim so much better illustration text decoration illustration text decoration sixth merivale have scooped out long bathing pool at bottom of garden when evelyn left took towel walked down to little higher up be weir from plunged into soda water of vivifying bubble floated down a woven rope of water willed to take till grounded on bed of yellow shining gravel at tail of pool laughing with joy at cool touch of stream day have be very hot since breakfast have be on move now under shadow of tree a often a not grilled by great blaze of sun on open heath be with extraordinary sense of renewed life of kinship with beautiful creature be poured from weir in never ending volume that gave up to clean sensuous thrill of moment seemed to that strong flood that bore with wave eddy just tipped with gold crimson of sun entirely interpenetrated possessed be not more than be stream stream be not more than be blue vault overhead with fleece of cloud beginning to flush rosily be part of same thing beech tree with leaf quiver in evening breeze be hand eyebrow of then with briskness of renewed vigour set to swim against piece of a if right hand must wrestle with left breasting river with vigorous stroke yet scarcely moving against press of running stream while like frill water stood up bubbling round neck then again with limb deliciously tired with struggle turned on back floated down again with arm widespread to increase surface of contact though sense of unity with life of nature be never absent from so that be last waking thought at night stood by while slept ready to awake again water somehow live running water with sun on surface rain beating on to with lucent depth waving water weed that current combed gave more than anything else nothing else have quite that certainty of everlasting life about be continually outpoured yet not diminished mingled with sea sprang to heaven in form iridescent colour of mist cloud to return again to earth in rain made grass to grow fed spring envelopment of in be sort of outward symbol of own absorption in nature outward visible sign of day mystery wonder of increased cleansing renewal be contained here for even a water cleansed renewed so through countless age cleansed renewed here alone intermediary step death out of came new life be omitted to water there be death be eternally young age brought abatement of vigour then in bright twilight of sun just set dressed walked back to house to find that have be nearly hour gone that be close on dinner time during earlier part anyhow of meal evelyn showed return of disquietude a be wont poured out flood of surprising stuff talked shop quite unashamed evening drawback of artist life supplied text yes everyone be for ever insisting said that artist life be own reward because work be creative there be time when must sooner be man who put bristle in toothbrush folk allow for day when sit in front of blank canvas canvas half finished look at in absolute stupor of helplessness suppose must say on put down what see ' be so wooden headed a not to realise on such occasion unfortunately numerous one doe see anything one must put down if one did there be blank wall in front of one be then say with mr micawber one be without friend who be possessed of shaving material yet kill hang here be talking about death again give more fish merivale performed hospitable duty ah what do expect asked surely ca think be possible that man can live time in full blaze of imaginative vision might a well expect to run at full speed from day be born to day of well time a dislike word evelyn drummed table with finger be just want cried whose fault be that ca do what feel be inside time if have what call imaginative vision at who have got business to put cap like cap of camera lens over so that can see nothing oh pity of sitter too sitter can be so antipathetic that feel when look at that imaginative vision be oozing out of like sawdust when clip doll leg that in moment will be just heap of collapsed rag on floor with silly waxen head shoulder on top if only people must come to to paint caricature must do ripper next woman have got to paint when two be finished be pink young thing of sixty with face have exactly expression of pansy lord lord be so completely normal evelyn dundas merivale if not reassured for there be need for at rate thought that have be mistaken in idea that change have come to be just same vivid eager boy that have always be blessed with one supreme talent vampire like seemed to suck blood out of other possibility dormant energy of nature suck too sense of responsibility from refuse then said say ' wo paint sap faculty evelyn burst out into great shout of laughter dundas present compliment to lady what be hername ' said 'and regret on inspection that be unable to paint portrait owing to fact that prolonged contemplation of charm must sap artistic power feel unwilling to part with ' what must be rising young painter position in year time eh studio must be a empty a new forest might then come live there tom evelyn finished wine lit cigarette in one breath now strange though may seem to said feel that have talked enough about for moment though propose to go on afterwards so by way of transition will talk about a dressed number of frightful poser came into head about want categorical answer now have be here how long more than year be what can show for number two what be about number three how can call student of nature when deliberately shut eye to suffering death sacrifice go on eternally in nature might a well call artist refuse to use blue red in picture remember asking something of sort before answer be eminently unsatisfactory besides have forgotten merivale moved sideways to table crossed one leg over other doe really at interest said doe must not ask thing too have be looking at dinner must swear look much younger than did five year ago indeed if saw now for first time must say be not much more than twenty also used to be touchy irritable sort of devil look now a if nothing in world have power to make cease smiling did know by way that be always smiling little tom laughed not consciously said now mention seems impossible must not well begin said evelyn with usual impatience tell about attempt to answer very pertinent question smoke too listen better to person who be smoking because feel that be more comfortable sudden wind stirred in garden blowing towards in verandah sleeping fragrance of bed wandering noise of night together make up what call silence of night even a mixture of primary colour make white smoke smoke now said merivale if really want to know will tell can tell conjuring trick a call suppose will take for granted evelyn comfortable with coffee liqueur assented yes leave out said here beginneth gospel tried in word to be slightly offensive offensiveness however went wide of mark be sorry for hermit a have known in world be singularly liable to take offence to be irritable impatient to be stamping speechifying on extremely human platform vibration of such impatience be in merivale voice in word there be backhander to answer so gospel began be so simple said yet suppose that to complicated people simplicity be a difficult to understand a be complexity to simple people here be anyhow make best worst of be entirely concern there be god said there be also nature take to be visible tangible audible expression of there be also man of be specimen whether be above below average doe matter in least man by dreadful process called civilisation have worked back into correspondingly dreadful condition if be either fish flesh fowl one must know where to put be none of seems at rate to to be peculiar product of own making instead of being creature compounded of life joy must be ingredient also study have become creature who be mated with sorrow at end with death have become rotten without ever being ripe flower to must have attained have be cankered in bud now have be deliberate aim to leave behind to forget to go straight back to huge expression of joy of god man have be unable to spoil render sorrowful to great hymn of nature listen to for moment for more moment listen to more unmistakable will tenour be will hear that whole impression be one of life of joy there be be true throughout nature sound of death of cruelty of one creature preying on net result be not death be ever increasing life so when went to nature shut ear eye to minor undercurrent of sound of result be sure day after day there be more life in world in spite of death that day after day go on death go to form fresh life in same way with joy sorrow of nature for animal that suffers there be two be glad for tree that dy there be two in full vigour of joy of life that joy life be constant study soak in will so do until be utterly impregnated with when day come when there be tiny obscure fibre in being doe not completely realise then with flash of revelation so take will 'grasp scheme of thing entire ' whether by life by death will truly realise that moth flitting by odour of garden river be indivisibly one just expression of spirit of life be god paused moment there be two other question asked said what have got to show for year have spent here shrug shoulder at that be who be being shown second concern personal appearance for say look younger be probably quite true quite inevitable for contemplation of eternal youth of world suppose must make one younger body soul alike be think evelyn be listening with extreme attention did not look in least uninterested word have got perfectly sober plan at bottom of said thought half of be moonshine other half imagination there be one more question two more what if whole of suffering cruelty death in nature be made clear to in flash if be that will come to make grasp scheme of thing entire merivale smiled still rocking forward in chair with hand clasped round knee be possible said recognise think be frightened at if be to be so be to be so though suppose one wo live after well second question think then be duty to seek happiness joy forget sorrow of world think be so for said though do think that there be many people most suppose that realise through sorrow suffering can only say that believe be not one of way doe not lie for there evelyn got up stood leaning on balustrade of verandah be beginning to touch more closely now own thread be beginning to interweave in scheme merivale drew for said what be diagnosis of be one of who will find through sorrow through joy merivale turned to with almost same eagerness in face a evelyn showed ah how can tell that said beyond telling at least that in opinion after be only opinion be in joy that almost above everyone know will ripen bear fruit sorrow asceticism be road by approach happiness see on road renunciation for evelyn got up came step closer yes yes cried merivale answered by question something have happened to said what be have fallen in love said other only knew to day yes madge ellington good god man love be painting see nearly daily alone be business to study face get to know voice dropped suddenly what be to do said after moment philip whole thing ah ca go on said merivale quickly must see that wherever path lie there be honour honour cried evelyn almost savagely have not a good right to love a philip have ca tie one down like besides how can help loving night day be not le in control besides have reason to suppose that love so what harm be done if doe must again stopped for there be need to go on conclusion of sentence be not le clear because be unspoken after moment continued what be view just now about renunciation for asked merivale got up know what to say to said what do propose propose to tell what know love said there be long pause merivale be looking out over dusky garden lip moved a if be trying to frame sentence yet word came in east moon be soon to rise behind wedge of beech wood came diagonally across heath though be not yet visible sky be changing from dark velvet blue have succeeded sunset to mysterious dove colour herald moon night breeze stirred among shrub scent of stock be wafted into verandah twined a be with swooning fragrance of syringa for once merivale be unconscious of witchery of hour in spite of interest problem suffering renunciation of human life from have thought have weaned claimed again have tried in great measure succeeded in detaching from have not completely broken away from yet have enlisted under banner of joy now from opposing host there came cry to must not shut ear to here be necessity for suffering must not be that of two friend of suffering poignant cruel lay before one of though that one must be did not know necessity be dragged before notice then from garden eye rested on evelyn again a stood close to with keen beautiful face eye in burned wonder of love long slim limb hand trembled so astonishingly alive so instinct with rapture reward of living must not say duty lie here even have be certain that be so so grey toneless so utterly at variance with whole gospel of own life must advice have be yet for detachment from human affair be not must be complete must say to yes joy can lay hand on be yours for on other side stood philip sympathy be not there spread out hand with sort of hopeless gesture know what to say even know what think said be one of thing be without solution rather there be two solution of be inevitably right utterly opposed have a yet reason to think that love go to show otherwise yes said evelyn softly somehow believe ca help that then suddenly took hold of merivale shoulder with hand ah understand said be saying just now that river be indivisibly one be mere figure of speech though understand what mean by with be sober truth be madge have existence apart from door have be opened have passed through into half someone say man alone be only half what nonsense till love be complete in then cease to be at wild a be word so utterly be in grip of newly awakened passion possessed there be something convincing to merivale about might a well have tied piece of string across line to stop runaway locomotive a hope to influence evelyn by word advice especially since at heart pulled in opposite way to advice might thus give matter be beyond control must work out to inevitable end when will tell asked know moment see love if moment come if doe not again passion shook like great wave combing weed of sea must said that clearly be last word on subject even a spoke rim of moon week from full topped beech wood flooded garden with silver watched in silence till three quarter circle swung clear of tree just month ago evelyn have watched rising with madge on terrace of philip house sight of now made last month pas in review before like scene moved behind actor a in first act in light shed to day seemed to flash back illumine whole of week showed how in darkness plant have grown to day have flowered rose coloured perfect day since then when seed have first be planted in soul have shot up towards light there have be day so felt now on growth have stood still have be uninterrupted from first germination to full flower last word have be spoken when moon have cleared tree top merivale turned to seldom sleep in house said certainly will not to night where then asked other oh anywhere often in several place in fact seldom wake in morning where go to bed in evening sleep walking suggested evelyn oh dear know animal wake in night turn over get up for few moment take mouthful of grass well same thing happens to always wake about three in morning walk about little a say usually go to sleep again somewhere else suppose dignity of man asserts often go further than animal for instance will probably go to sleep in hammock in garden walk up into beech wood when wake for first time ah doe sound rather nice said evelyn appreciatively well come sleep out too will do good in world can have hammock will lie on grass always have rug evelyn appreciation be not of practical sort heaven forbid said bedroom be good enough for be already late took candle went upstairs merivale following to see have wanted servant however have arranged utmost requirement in most convenient way sight suddenly suggested new criticism to evelyn keeping servant too said be not that frightfully inconsistent merivale laughed suppose keep servant when be alone asked find be so bad at looking after requirement of guest that hire one if anyone happens to be here be man from hotel at brockenhurst apologise said other do dismiss to morrow for did want to come to hotel wanted to see how hermit really lived stop over to morrow then will see said merivale keep woman in house who cook that also be inconsistent no think so take longer than must imagine to do housework tried last winter found not worth while besides dusting cleaning be so absorbing must think of nothing else doe find absorbing merivale laughed feel sure doe said must do better when dusted for nothing short of perfection must content be dusting day long evelyn looked doubtfully at bed will have to make beaking ' mean asked if sleep in if so really think must be worth while besides know sha sleep if sleep be wreck merivale raised eyebrow surely sleep when want sleep just a eat when be hungry said be that exploded superstition quite exploded sha sleep wink said evelyn beginning to undress oh how can cried really want to why of course be a cross a two stick if merivale shook head will make sleep if wish said get into bed must go turn out light will be back in two minute left room evelyn undressed quickly have happened to day ran like mill race in head arguing from previous experience knew perhaps tithe of what awaited when light be out for often before when picture not a now original of occupied misshapen parody of rest have be till cock crow first of must come sense of satisfaction at being alone at being able to let thought take natural course uninterrupted must feast eye on untenanted blackness letting imagination paint there that have be so intensely occupied with during day then a brain wearied in place of ideal have be striving for must come distorted reflection of seen a if in bloated mirror still awake must see thought translated into horrible grotesque must startle into sitting up in bed just for grasping of bed post feeling of wall to bring back into realm of concrete thing otherwise grotesque must grow into dancing shapeless horror in moment must have to wrench free from clutch of nightmare start up with dripping brow quivering throat must not scream into reality again to night feared nightmare knew simply that sleep must not come to excitement have invaded conquered drowsy land though felt now that must be content to think think love till morning morning knew must like obsequious waiter present bill for sleepless night consequently when merivale again entered welcomed demand conjuring trick said know sha sleep at unless have charm for good god how can sleep after why must want to be waking good enough merivale paused waking sleeping seemed to more matter for concern than seem to animal sleep when be sleepy wake when sleepiness have gone be entirely for to settle said if want to sleep can make if will go to sleep will do in case added evelyn be already overwrought with event of day spoke petulantly oh make sleep then said there be to morrow coming can hing to night so let get over lie down then said hermit look at look at eye mean sat down on edge of evelyn bed spoke low slow wind be asleep said sleep among tree of forest for time of sleep have come everything sleep love sleep too lie still said a evelyn moved tree of forest sleep leaf sleep high in branch bird sleep everything sleep tired even weary sleep who be strong sleep who be weak evelyn eyelid quivered moment then half opened again flower sleep said merivale eyelid of petal be closed a eyelid be closing sleep black soft wing have shut over a wing of bird shut over head earth sleep very stone of sleep will not stir till morning if stir will be to sleep again sad happy sleep very sea sleep be hushed tide of sea be asleep sleep too said slightly raising voice sleep till wake sleep till wake waited moment evelyn eyelid did not even quiver again then blew out light left room merivale stepped softly down stair went out on to verandah where have dined few hour before at touch of soft night air trouble that during evening have be be evaporated vanished sum of consciousness be contained in bracket that be alive that be part of life be like stepping into ocean received bore on surface took to depth mattered not at thing embraced encompassed

illustration text decoration illustration text decoration seventh gladys ellington a have be remarked be not in least ill natured never even hinted ill natured thing against anybody unless be certain to be undiscovered so a world knew since be not quite devoted phrase of to mother in law merest element of wisdom demanded of that must be unreserved in commendation of madge engagement unreserved in consequence be even to own husband also be quite unreserved unreserve be whiskered red faced like bore not slightest resemblance to wife voluble rapture seems to said that madge have married for money believe love cold blooded fish like tell hate girl marrying for money american so on good love match like gladys have sou have penny same sort of thing eh lord ellington usually ended sentence with eh if did not end with eh ended with what effect in case be same for like pilate did not wait for answer eh what in fact meant that have not finished if have finished ended up period with tell a consequence perhaps nobody told anything worked together for good here because must not have understood if have be fond of wife slightly fonder of dinner why have married be mystery there be so many mystery of kind that be best to leave alone gladys on occasion speech have given rise to in so far a speech connected thought must account for what lord ellington must say next have merely remarked that engagement be very very nice seem to object to said because be rich be very feeble never knew rich to be bar to anything except kingdom of heaven with ellington be not immediately concerned be much more immediately concerned with south african mine now be dining here to night so be madge if ca get something out of between time leave room join really will despair of heavy jocular look came into lord ellington face despair of yet gladys said not quite very nearly not quite oh ellington do wake up for once to night philip home move finger in dreadful office of in city somewhere ec be beggar even worse than now comparatively opulent ask finger move if only be must do in two minute so will allow ten not more than because have got reef box at opera melba be singing lot of squawking said why not sit at home who want to hear squawking in italian too understand word do know one note from do tell gladys required tact be polite word for evasion sometimes in getting way with husband diplomacy be polite word for lying if got notion into head required something like lisbon earthquake to get out if on other hand thing commoner with have not notion in head required flash of lightning followed by steady application of steam hammer to get in also in talking to be almost a difficult to concentrate one own attention a be to command for fact that be being talked to produced in unless be dining irresistible tendency to make quarter deck of room be in up down shuffled when became intolerable gladys told not to quarter deck only did a last resort because attended rather more when be quarter decking than when not never mind about opera then said need go unless like what be important be that since madge be going to marry philip home must reap advantage can perhaps there be only one apart from having very comfortable house to stay in be big one can make money for be only second time have mentioned in consequence be rather agreeably surprised to find that husband grasped even appeared to think about suggested amendment though process required seemed to gladys mile of quarter decking eh what said something south african put in twopence get out fourpence with dividend in interim by gad yes 'd better get out of gladys not lovely woman know man tell everything to lovely woman tell have never occurred to gladys always respected anyone to whom thing occurred before occurred to how very simple said much better than suggestion suppose be so simple that never occurred to ellington chuckled a conversation be over sat down again to read evening paper have just come in read morning paper morning talked of at lunch evening paper evening talked of at dinner two supplied with mental daily bread same never seemed well informed even about current event managed somehow to miss point of news read must never distinguish between kuroki kuropatkin three day have passed since madge have have her last sitting for portrait three day have passed for in sort of dream of disquietude be not wholly pain have not seen evelyn since scarcely philip for have be harder worked than usual last night when be to have dined with have sent word that must not possibly get there in time be to go to theatre afterwards said must join there have upbraided laughingly for desertion of telling that put pleasure of business higher than pleasure of society for retort have fact that when be not at work be never anywhere else in society whereas two day ago when be free one morning refused to ride with because be to give sitting to evelyn moment have said be sorry for for madge have flushed turned from biting lip though be sorry for undesigned pain have apparently given heart must not sing to must not bear such word from even in jest have not be cause of madge disquietude philip remark indeed have so far a alone be concerned gone in at one ear to come out at other in passage through have touched something made wince with sudden pain pain passed warmth glow of secret kind remained disquieting be not painful except at interval sort of pity remorse must stab at other time heart like philip must not sing to for splendour of love be beginning to dawn must not help that dawn coming must not help glorying in light of what must be practical issue did not at once think be three week ago that have promised to marry philip then honesty have made tell that gave liking esteem affection that be conscious that be in power to give now when knew that be possessed of more than that new possession be not hers to give long day of indecision day on in evening be to dine together with gladys ellington have be hers gradually slowly with painful gropings after light have made up mind have choice choice be already made duty obedience honour called to fulfil promise have made to fulfil too in niggardly lip service sense of word to fulfil loyally must turn back to dawn have come too late must never look there must for ever avert eye from above must do lay in power to prevent that brightness growing must in fact not see evelyn again of own free will then difficulty to be met overcome began to swarm thick about first foremost there be portrait for be engaged to give sitting to morrow at rate a far a particular sitting be concerned be easily managed note of three line expressing regret did that however be only temporary measure put off for one occasion necessity of meeting what lay before for knew must not sit to again dared not risk that must not give strange new rapture in heart food must make grow yet again must not act like mad woman what reasonable cause must give for so strange freak perhaps if went there with philip if took mother with did not dispose of question evelyn be one of future husband warmest friend in ordinary course of thing must often meet till have conquered made sure of herself such meeting be impossible how must ever be sure of herself to whom have come utterly unlooked for thing thing so unlooked for only few week before have consented to being dismissed a practical impossibility then came thought for very shame of be bracing not by word look sign have evelyn ever showed that regarded with faintest feeling answered hers remembered well rise of full moon on terrace of philip house above pangbourne how have called attention to merely to point out that be not in drawing how herself on occasion have noticed how different be to ordinary moonlight walker hint of sentiment sign of vaguest desire towards most harmless flirtation have appeared in then have appeared since while be sitting to time scowled at other half bubbled with boyish nonsense for very shame must turn back on dawn dinner be to be early to night a objective be melba opera maid came in to tell that dressing time be already overstepped got up paused for moment at window looking out from buckingham gate over blue haze that overhung st james park driving resolution home half pitied half spurned telling at one moment that be hard that have to suffer thus at that be despicable for thinking of suffering when road be so clearly marked for if what have happened be not fault still le must there be fault of hers in what must happen clearly future be in own control of future must make what must mother be not coming with to night indeed seldom wasted golden evening hour at opera when there be rubber of bridge so certainly at command madge went into drawing room to wish good night before set off prosperity last three week seemed to lady ellington to be most prosperous have always softening effect on be particularly gracious to daughter since madge be responsible for so large part of auspicious event so be just off dear said dear be rather late must keep give love to philip let see home if be in can ask at door bring in for few minute forget sitting with mr dundas to morrow ah have put that off said madge be rather busy pity surely well have sent note be afraid good night mother in case be in first philip have already arrived when got to cousin house went down to dinner lord ellington have got news of evening feverishly mixed up in head be disposed to mingle fragment of stock exchange with forgetful apparently that have be relegated to wife natural incoherence redeemed situation when dinner be over be already time to start for opera while gladys got cloak however two lover have few private minute a master of house remained in dining room when went out philip have sent day diamond pendant be wearing now be too good of philip said ca tell how value be most beautiful why must always be sending thing philip be usually serious always sincere because ca help said must give sign of what feel even clumsy material sign be something that sincerity touched girl know what feel said want to have never absent from mind want to think of nothing else that be sincere too outcome of long day of thought philip came little closer to voice vibrated a spoke that content utterly said that gift of that made gave long sigh oh philip began voice of gladys called to from passage outside drawing room come madge come mr home cried be already so late ca bear to miss note of boheme apparently to be present in opera house when boheme be going on be sufficient for gladys constituted not missing note for spent that small portion of first act still remained to be performed after arrival in absorbed examination of occupant of other box whispered communication a to result of investigation to madge fall of curtain have effect of rendering more audible yes absolutely everybody be here so good of dear mr home to ask to night of course be last night melba sings be not how wonderful be not that long last note quite thrilled so sad too last act always make cry oh there be madame odintseff dearest madge did ever see such rope of pearl cable might call who be that be talking to know face quite well that be daughter yes sandy coloured thing rather like rabbit say be engaged to lord hitchin believe dear madge be not brilliant look so well dear to night if only mr dundas must paint a be looking now by way how be portrait getting on philip also have risen when act ended be looking out over house here joined in evelyn be absolutely jubilant when saw few day ago said though be usually jubilant over last thing saw thought there be something extra special about by way madge be sitting to to morrow afternoon be not will try to look in spate of work be over hope oh be afraid have have to put off said must manage to morrow fingered fan nervously for moment in fact philip said be so dreadfully full of engagement for next week two see how can squeeze in sitting be so ashamed of myself ca help wish must go down to mr dundas studio to morrow tell so philip looked at moment in blank surprise ah ca do that said painter be like tailor to whom say ' be not coming to try on send home a be ' madge lost head little burden of hour of day pressed heavily on ah be what want to do cried be wonderful portrait said so there be little background must be put in need be there for gladys ellington have turned attention again to house with opera glass glued to eye be spying observing in direction philip cast one glance at rightly considered alone with madge for other be blind deaf to madge be anything wrong asked gently nothing be wrong said recovering little ask to do a say ca bear sitting for portrait more mr dundas bore that got said also managed to smile at naturally be dear philip added pray let talk of more wish to tell evelyn what say asked yes anything anything said want to sit to again make natural if can look at portrait tell want touched more believe be best paused moment be excited rather overwrought to night somehow said must indeed think that there be anything matter indeed there be nothing tell believe that why dear of course if tell so said do tell so a have be mentioned before there be two philip one known only to four people who knew best other philip who showed sterner harder face to world though since be with madge philip of inner sanctum where only intimate be admitted be in possession yet door of sanctum a be opened for moment other philip quick a lizard glanced in appearance be of most momentary duration did look in laid hand on arm a said last word then left back of box where have be standing took chair next lady ellington how full be said look at stall too be like ant heap covered with brilliant crawling ant how hard be to recognise people if one be above be sure there be hundred people know top of head be like nothing except top of head how many bald head too what blessing go bald like men who be that walking up gangway now be sure know ah be mr dundas sudden stream of talk stopped a if tap have be turned on eye left stall gazed vacantly over box opposite be conscious of wondering what must happen next whether must speak companion whether philip must say something then seemed to nobody must say anything more there be to be dreadful silence for ever possibility at rate be soon averted for gladys signalled violently to evelyn spoke yes see said mr home do put door of box open be so stuffy mr dundas be sure be coming up be such darling be greater part of speech be justified by reality evelyn have seen heat be undeniable also in answer to violent signalling have received mere politeness to say nothing of inclination must have made come have seen too who sat in profile by lady ellington took two three step in stride a mounted staircase before madge have time to put into execution very unwise idea of asking philip not to let in be at door of box lordly box holder said to just let in how be lady ellington yes be just back from hermitage to night only from three day in forest with merivale how be miss ellington have to come up to night must have be able to keep appointment to morrow sense of utter helplessness seized madge must not even respond by word to greeting for presence merely be only thing mattered only thing loved dreaded continued half past two be said must have come up to morrow of course be necessary for to have morning work at background before troubled again then gladys broke in too wonderful be said portrait mean mr dundas who be just opposite with ruby be sure have painted that great pink thing there who must have come from west coast of asia minor how naughty of evelyn apparently condoned naughtiness mentioned name of great pink thing turned to madge again by half past two will be ready said please if be not impossible request please be punctual art take so long know not that life be short nobody ever died too soon turned to diamond pendant philip have sent day glittering on smooth whiteness of bosom be so sorry said know ought to have let know before mr dundas ca come to morrow wrote evening only did not know be out of town explaining at least saying must not come philip real intimate philip heard be only lover of girl who spoke in reply have settled that will come instead said so time wo be wasted evelyn have to paint too know if want to be characteristic make study of telephone tape machine half past two think said there came sudden hush over crowded house a light went down philip laid hand on evelyn shoulder a sat in front of box between two lady past two then to morrow repeated hint be plain enough evelyn took stumbled way out of box to regain seat in stall what have happened what meant did not must not know knew only what be left with namely that madge for reason must not sit to to morrow in eager way searched for hundred motif yet none satisfied be forced to fall back on obvious simple one that be busy nothing in world must be more likely whole practical self assured of felt somehow a if someone have leaned out of window when called at house have shouted stentoriously to servant who opened door be not at home be bound to accept thing did not believe then questioned a to whether fault be yet be scarcely possible for be not till after have last seen that knowledge of love for have dawned on be impossible that must have made that betrayal of for until have gone have not known that there be anything to betray have always be on term of frankest comradeship yet to night manner have somehow be subtly yet essentially different good comradeship have gone from indefinable feeling of being friend be no longer there be that being friend be no longer sufficient for did change really lie in felt sure did not madge be different evelyn be not of analytical mind inference be based usually on instinct rather than reason reason be powerless to help here instinct drew inference whatever however philip be coming to take hour to morrow must try to find out something about indeed perhaps there be nothing to find for knew that now for ever own view of madge must be coloured by super sensitiveness of love then suspicion altogether unworthy crossed mind be possible that philip have to do justice instantly dismissed gladys like stag at eve have drunk fill of occupant of box turned attention to stage during second act mind be rather like sparrow hopped about with such extraordinary briskness apparently found something to pick up everywhere thing picked up be true be of particular consequence be thing of sort at end of act announced opera be really best way of carrying on life said always sing at crisis sing tune real tune if crisis be really frightful make end of act pull curtain down have slight refreshment in privacy put on frock mr home be that mr israel there that woman bound in green how nice to have husband who be magnate of south african affair can even afford to be bound in green doe matter how look if be rich enough philip looked where pointed certainly be mr israel yes be said have idea be a rich a appearance indicates lady ellington gave little gasp of horror good gracious forgot be magnate too cried how rude of really be so unlike mr israel then sank voice to confidential whisper dear mr home said with brilliance of unpremeditated invention do talk shop with for one minute ellington told have got little sum of money know sort of thing not big enough to be of real use ah must tell asked must be furious quite furious yes if must just casually mention investment might eventually cause to be of use philip must not see a be sitting behind with arm on back of chair must not help frowning be delighted to be of use to friend sometimes a now help be asked in sideways hole corner manner why must husband know did not like intrigue at time purposeless intrigue be even more tiresome expunged frown from voice anyhow when answered yes can certainly recommend investment two said can promise certainty can only say that hold stake in suppose a have sum of money will take up share pay for mean gave little laugh of surprise be too delicious said mean can buy without paying for like bill laughed well recommend that said can be done however be not concern a be not broker will send note in morning too good of said wo tell husband asked certainly not said though really ca imagine why not unreal philip one be to say that madge did not know have have door slammed pretty smartly in face when real philip went to evelyn studio next afternoon have not attempted to put in appearance evelyn when arrived be working at background of madge portrait yelled to other to keep eye off mu see till be done cried just turn back there be good chap till put with face to wall have idea till looked at to day how nearly be finished do wish miss ellington must have come afternoon instead of sound polite be really think might have made last sitting that sound polite too by way what as be never made appointment with last night be sufficiently frank for evelyn have managed with healthy optimism of have so much to reason out of fantastic foreboding of evening before be left therefore for philip task be not at to taste to put neatly back again really doubt if must have given appointment off hand said still fencing little be really so frightfully busy hardly set eye on apparently when be to be married have to buy a many thing a if be going to live on desert island for rest of life evelyn checked for moment at healthy optimism weakened little must write ask said go try to find in must have sitting soon thing wo be half so good if have to wait be ready just want for hour two philip be conscious of most heartfelt wish that madge have not entrusted with errand cudgelled head to think how least offensively to perform then madge own suggestion came to aid wish must let see said pray do really mean evelyn hesitated though have be so peremptory in removal before impulse knew be rather childish being desire to let finished thing be first thing seen yet on other hand so intensely believed in portrait that now felt disinclined to defer pleasure of showing well must criticise at said not one word of may begin to take criticism into consideration want to do just exactly a see not a anybody else doe do promise certainly very well stand back about three yard three yard be about focus now turned easel back into room again where stood fronting philip latter did not want to criticise at felt not smallest temptation to do so indeed be idle to do so picture be madge madge seen by unerring eye recorded by unerring brush stood altogether away from criticism man might conceivably reject whole of if happened not to care about evelyn art must not reject part a evelyn have said to merivale have put there what meant to put there nothing that did not be brilliant superb master work philip looked at long minute in silence be best said evelyn laughed be only picture said then philip saw opportunity be a welcome a be unexpected beg not to touch madge figure face again said be absolutely finished there be nothing more to be done to please evelyn gave snort of disgust be criticism said not at there be nothing to criticise mean really now philip be bad judge evelyn be well aware of that have be a painted intensely anxious that philip must like philip more than liked great pleasure that knowledge gave be sufficient for time to banish foreboding have begun to creep back be in way confirmed by philip wish that must not be touched oh philip be really good said feel that know be want so much that must think so can answer for said other with that whole subject be dismissed for time evelyn have given no promise that must not touch figure again philip on side be wise enough to dwell on point more for saw quite well that certain inkling of true state of thing have be present however dimly to other further allusion must tend to disperse dimness make thing clearer so new canvas be produced philip be put into pose after pose without satisfying artist cried if stand like look like elderly st sebastian with hand on table look like railway director look here walk out of room come in whistling sit down be not going to paint portrait be not going to be photographed just pretend be not here went better soon with inarticulate gruntings evelyn began to put in line of figure with charcoal at first laboured before long thing began to go more smoothly own knitted brow uncreased hand began to work of then came half hour in talked telling sitter of visit to hermit really charming day have spent in forest again suggested train of thought caused silence again renewal of creased brow be not at sketch that frowned eventually laid tool down ca go on more said thanks very much be all right wandered to chimney piece lit cigarette came back again mean miss ellington doe want to give more sitting said for be childish to expect to believe that ca spare one hour between now end of month childishness of struck philip too ask not to touch more except of course background said wo that content not in least be not real reason philip be cornered knew be true one said rather lamely after seeing picture must have said believe in case be not real reason repeated evelyn of course need not tell real reason ca prevent guessing ca prevent guessing right ah be necessary asked philip evelyn flashed out at be fair on cried disagree with want sitting really have right to treat like be not tradesman ca leave because chooses like without giving reason philip did not reply perhaps have given reason said evelyn with peculiarly annoying penetration indeed grown up child boy girl still except in year be wonderfully embarrassing so philip reflected people who will ask childish question who be yet sufficiently men woman to be able to detect faltering voice equivocation tact doe not seem to exist for if want to know thing ask straight out before everybody indeed be sometimes le embarrassing if there be plenty of people there one out of number may begin talking with buzz of conversation drown absence of reply alone tactlessness in tete tete be to fire at large target can not help hitting certainly have hit philip knew be useless to pretend otherwise a just reply to tactlessness be truth also tactless let have gave reason said since will have so said be bored with sitting may tell told added evelyn have put head little on one side action common with when be trying to catch effect showed symptom whatever of annoyance face expressed only slightly amused incredulity bored with sitting bored with asked philip exasperation increased people in ordinary life did not ask such question since question be asked deserved answer bored with said be sorry there be bored with thanks said evelyn now if wo be bored with do get back stand for ten minute more wo ask for longer than just want ah be right stop like philip a recommended stopped like with mixture of amusement annoyance in mind evelyn be most unaccountable fellow sometimes if just rapped on knuckle must call out that have dealt deathstroke at at other time a now might give most violent slap in face must treat like piece of thistledown floated by of one thing anyhow one must be certain must never pretend to feel emotion that did not feel must be to say never pump up indignation on other hand if felt anything keenly might be trusted to scream philip therefore a stopped like have choice of two conclusion open to one be that evelyn felt same antipathy to madge a madge apparently felt for other be that did not believe madge have said what have reported to have said conclusion be very consoling second because though men be liar like recognition of fact especially if have spoken truly yet other choice be even le satisfactory for did not believe that evelyn be bored by madge if pressed matter home did really believe that madge be bored by evelyn have said so be true have therefore accepted did not seem somehow likely down at pangbourne have be best of friend have be best of friend too since yet here door be again slammed on unreal philip yet have said be enough illustration text decoration illustration text decoration eighth wave such wave be tidal periodic after have passed leave sea quite calm again wave of interest in simplification of life swept over london towards end of season duchess gave up meat took to deep breathing instead somebody else have lunch on lentil only drank hot water said felt better already half dozen took walk in park in very early morning without hat met dozen more who wore sandal agreed that made whole difference so movement be started simplification of life be real thing to be aimed at made happy also made search for pleasure unnecessary for only sought for pleasure so ran gospel be very swiftly simply formulated because be looking for happiness mistakenly grasped at pleasure with simplification of life happiness came quite of own accord breathed deeply ate lentil wore hat especially if there be nobody about under same condition wore sandal walked in wet grass to reward for happiness came to ceased to worry indeed in few day for london fly on wing of dove to new thing gospel be so entrancing so popular that hatless folk be seen in park at far more fashionable hour gladys ellington actually refused to go to ball for fear of not getting proper supply of oxygen may be remarked be never quite among first to take up new thing be always among foremost of second other lady ellington appeared have known along be in fact so legend soon ran who have suggested simplification of life to tom merivale who now lived in new forest ate asparagus in season otherwise only cabbage have got so closely into touch with nature that sort of thing perched on finger sang devotee therefore of doctrine be intent on thing perching on finger singing wanted to go down to new forest to see how be done while wanted lady ellington went if simplification of life be to come in be always best to be first to simplify in addition must save so much money in autumn party must always have chop upstairs expedition to new forest took place couple of day after philip have given first sitting to evelyn dundas madge at time be looking rather pale tired so mother thought in consequence proposed to madge that must come with pallor lassitude a matter of fact be reasonable excuse enough though have madge looked bright fresh must not have stood in way since in latter case reason must have be that madge enjoyed country so much have country look in eye in case lady ellington meant that madge must go with if meant thing that thing usually occurred to say that be anxious about madge must be over stating condition of mind with regard to for be rule of life with excellent authority to back to be anxious about nothing to say also that thought there be reason for anxiety must be still over stating view of daughter since if there have be reason for though must still not have be anxious must have cleared matter up in way hard polished mind sort of crystal billiard ball admitted such reason merely meant to keep daughter under eye till billiard ball be to be hoped went into appointed pocket then man who held cue might do what chose defied to hurt yet lady ellington knew quite well what though not cause of anxiety on part be reason why kept madge under eye that reason be existence of artist madge have cancelled appointment have made with day after have called while daughter be having tea alone together madge have sent down word insisted indeed on doing so that be not at home have at once explained to mother saying that have headache meant to go to room immediately have have cup of tea be thus unwilling to leave guest on lady ellington hand that excuse have of course passed unchallenged for lady ellington never challenged anything till really assumed threatening attitude reserved to herself however right of drawing conclusion on subject of headache idea however of expedition to new forest madge have hailed with enthusiasm be to go down there in morning lunch with hermit on lentil have particularly begged in letter otherwise rather magisterial that might see ordinary mode of life spend afternoon in forest sleep at brockenhurst returning to london next day reply be cordial enough though a matter of fact lady ellington must not have cared however little cordial be travelled down third class because there be fewer cushion in third class in consequence far fewer bacteria avoidance of bacteria just now be of consequence hence window also be wide open there must have be acrimonious discussion between lady ellington passenger in same carriage who have severe cold in head have not refused to discus altogether simplification of life have not at present in lady ellington case gone so far a to dispense with presence of maid be sent on to inn to engage room for separate table at dinner that evening two took seat in cab merivale have ordered to meet have not be at station though lady ellington be secretly inclined to resent a somewhat wanting in respect have control enough to say nothing about indeed own polished mind excused physical exercise for morning said to herself probably detained hermit proved somehow unnaturally natural did not give lentil to eat gave cauliflower au gratin brown bread cheese to drink water somehow be not to lady ellington mind least apostolic for viand be indeed excellent what be worse made apology confession of faith over be perfectly natural a indeed have begged must be therefore leanness of desire went deep after lunch too cigarette be offered wanted one so much that took one true did waiting did so deftly that one really did not notice absence of servant then worst of when lunch be over put elbow on table be serious what did come down into wilderness for to see lady ellington asked be only reed shaken by wind there be really nothing more can not say how charming be to to see miss ellington ca tell anything wanted to see bit of life how live be how now what else can do for be sure will excuse be certain came here to see something do tell what want to see be quite sufficient ah if there happened to be bird of kind said lady ellington merivale laughed what evelyn called conjuring trick asked why certainly must sit still on lawn twenty yard off thrush be scudding about grass have found snail be looking appeared for suitable stone on to make somewhat gruesome preparation for meal performs with such vigorous gusto suddenly a merivale looked at paused even though at very moment have discovered on path below pergola anvil divinely adapted to purpose then with quick bird like motion dropped snail looked once twice from side to side then half flying half running came perched on balustrade of verandah then very gently merivale held out hand next moment bird be perched on sing then said a have said to nightingale from furry trembling throat bird poured out liquid store of repeated phrase thank dear said when paused go back to dinner eat well again there be flutter of wing scud across grass in few moment sharp tapping of shell on stone began on verandah for little while there be silence then hermit laughed there be one thing must ask lady ellington said though need not say how charmed be to be able to show that since interest be that will not be made sort of show evelyn dundas be down here few day ago told that london be going in for simplification of life of course seems to that must not do better really must refuse to pose a prophet however minor lady ellington gave direct promise indeed from hermit point of view next speech be far from reassuring be too wonderful said now can say have seen do think mr merivale that have right to shut up power like when there be so many of anxious to learn must not ah well be end of season now perhaps later in autumn when people come to london again must not give little class just once week tell about new philosophy be sure know dozen people who must love to come of course must come down here be great concession not expect to come up to london must charge of course might make quite good thing out of merivale tried to put in word swept on of course be minor point said what be think really important be that one must always try to help others who want to learn there be quite movement going on in london people deep breathe touch meat duchess of essex for instance perhaps know here got word in be so sorry said be absolutely out of question to begin with have nothing to tell ah that thrush now said how did do be want to know laughed be exactly what ca tell said more than can tell how be that when want to speak tongue frame word ask to come sit on finger hardly even that know more how get to come than know dear why come what else can do continued lady ellington abandoning for present idea of class merivale got up without least sign of impatience ruffling of good humour can show over house said walk with in forest a be so kind a to take interest in what do how live if like will talk about simple life what may call approach to nature must warn there be nothing in least startling sensational about above all a far a know be not possible to make short cut one have to tune slowly to be better than nothing for lady ellington have excellent memory must recount thing merivale told a if have suggested to have agreed also if there be to be simplification class must at least be in power to say that saw absolutely one have be too charming in allowing madge to come down spend day with indeed after little reflection be not sure whether be more distinguished role to be medium between hermit rest of aspiring london thus be with close attention that made tour of cottage afterwards walked up through beech wood on other side of stream on to open heath beyond to spend afternoon on huge breezy upland now so happened that on morning evelyn after rather sleepless tossing night have gone up to studio after breakfast to find there that when tried to paint must not somebody a have said once before have turned tap off water came through only remote empty gurgling imaginative vision be out of gear there be three four picture in studio over might have spent profitable morning must hing with of have only afternoon before thought out background for picture be doing of philip thought out too with considerable care precision have to do be to set few piece of furniture arrange light a wished over corner be to be represented put in yet must not do anything with eye be wrong colour be harsh crude merely woolly unconvincing must not see thing right seemed to that what painted be in shadow a if something have come between canvas there be still one picture at must work have not looked at yet even turned easel round from wall stood for time in front of unable apparently to make up mind a to whether must touch not then suddenly with sharp ill humoured sort of tug wheeled round yes be why must not touch philip portrait here in front of dazzling brilliant stood came between a looked eye cleared be a if film material film have be drawn away from over examined work with eager critical attention though ten minute ago must not paint now must not help painting starved for palette hand ached for slimy resistance of paint dragged over canvas on convex mirror be to be on wall behind girl reflecting back scarlet shimmering of cloak have like child saving butteriest bit of toast till end reserved for end big touch of light on gilt frame more difficult technical painting of mirror have finished putting reflection in rather more strongly than wished eventually to appear for knew with artist prescience exactly how light on gold frame must tone down be with smile of well earned satisfaction that put in now almost laughed to see how accurately have anticipated result then after half hour of ecstatic pleasure for at stage stroke told stepped back looked at yes that too be a meant that too be finished slowly eye dwelt next on figure of girl be philip right after did indeed need nothing more felt uncertain in ninety nine other case out of hundred if have really not be certain there be one judgment must have more willingly have deferred to than philip here must not help connecting insistence that nothing more must be done with subsequent revelation that madge did not wish to sit again to be impossible to disconnect two coincidence of sort did not happen then whole world of colour of drawing of own inimitable art went grey dead from ash rose so to speak thought filled universe for madge what in heaven name did mean what have done that must treat like search a might conscience must find accusation against yet must not either believe that be mere wilful freak on part then again have called two day ago at hour when be almost always in man have not given not at home direct have gone upstairs felt absolutely certain that have be in have refused to see for hour sat idle in studio lay on divan took volume from morraine of old punch found wit flat unprofitable took violin played dozen note put down again leaned out of window remarked that be extremely fine day a to painting more must a soon have swum through air over roof of sea of house below studio be intolerable thought with dismal circle ended exactly where began went on tracing same circle again again be intolerable also own company be equally so from that there be relief good bad must be with to grave then suddenly idea occurred to held out certain promise of relief at least in must communicate trouble thought of hermit merivale have always astonishingly cooling effect on be pleasure in especially to feverish excitable mind like to see anyone that friend who with great intellectual moral activity be so wonderfully capable of resting of not worrying restful too must be glade of immemorial forest sooner have idea struck than mind be made up telegram to hermit hurried glance at railway guide bag into threw requisite of night be be required have just time to eat hurried lunch then started for waterloo day have be hot sunny when left london promised exquisite summer afternoon in country where freshness must tone down heat that in town be rather oppressive pleasant probability a train threw suburb over shoulder did not seem likely to be fulfilled for air instead of getting fresher seemed to gather sultriness with mile evelyn be much of slave to climatic condition windless calm portending thunder seemed to press down on head with dreadful weight even draught made by flying train have life in be hot buffet of air a if from furnace mouth then a neared destination sky began to be overcast lump of dark coloured cloud with hard angry edge of coppery tinge began to mount in sky coming up in mysterious manner against what wind there be too when got out at brockenhurst be blowing in fitful ominous gust now raising pillar of dust along high road then dying again to absolute calm directly to south cloud be most threatening very leaf of tree looked pale milky against black mass of imminent storm yet be vague consolation though hated thunder anywhere to know how much more intolerable must be in london arrived at cottage glad that have come be about four when got there first thing saw on entering be telegram on table in hall still unopened rightly conjectured to be one have sent in case clearly hermit be out when arrived have not yet returned so leaving bag at foot of stair passed out on to verandah there looking out over garden alone sat madge turned on sound of step whether be that dreadful colour of day played trick with eye not evelyn thought went suddenly white rose came towards with miserable semblance of smile not with smile with in portrait laughed at worry of world ups down be not laughing at now smile did not rise from within voice too be little strange faltered be clear that speaking at be effort to be quite unexpected mr dundas said have idea think have mr merivale that be coming evelyn said nothing did not even hold out hand in answer to hers looked at looked with unquenchable thirst then found speech sort of manner did not know either till morning said then telegraphed fancy tom have not received not opened anyhow there be telegram for at least on table inside guess be mine did not know be here either then voice rose little indeed did not said girl passed hand wearily over brow brushing back hair be hatless hat lay on table where still platter of frugal lunch remained since have started on tour of inspection a soon a meal be over oh believe said why must assert like there be storm coming hate thunder be alone certainly dreadful tension of atmosphere have communicated to two madge be at rate frightfully aware that speech be not wise wisdom have gone to vanishing point meeting have be so unthinkably unexpected in way stunned just a approaching storm made unnormal unlike have wit enough left to laugh conventional laugh merely be like inverted comma to written speech suppose have better explain presence here said mother asked mr merivale if might come down see simplification of life on native heath so came lunched here then three went for walk be tired headachy turned back went on knew storm be coming though when set out be quite clear told so in last ten minute have come up like stroke of black wing ah shut eye for moment a violent flicker of lightning cut way down from cloud in south waited still with shut eye for thunder be still long way off said evelyn a remote growl answered know if have seen sky hour ago be one turquoise dare go back to brockenhurst must stop here wait for may take back asked evelyn what good must do may a well be terrified here a on road also can keep dry here again winced a lightning furrowed zig zag path through cloud time remoteness of thunder be le reassuring there be angry choking clap suggested that meant business by time evelyn have recovered from first stabbing surprise of finding madge alone here terror too of approaching storm have drowned dislike of also for moment at rate ordinary natural instinct of alleviating mere physical fear of girl drowned more intimate sense of what be to if only might become thoroughly frightened cling to for outrageous possibility did cross mind how must rejoice in necessity that accident must force on necessity since knew that must be unable to offer resistance of saying that have told merivale only few day before felt must not help saying to do justice dismissed possibility altogether that have passed through mind must not help conscious self rejected then at moment of angry answering thunder few big splash of rain began to star dry gravel path below hot splashing drop like bullet fell with separate distinct report on leaf of lilac on path hissed on grass whispered in yielding foliage of rose of pergola be like spirit rappings on roof of verandah madge voice rose in suppressed terror oh where be cried why come back ca make lightning just sit on finger like thrush will go to meet oh go to meet mr dundas leave alone asked madge wit have thoroughly deserted do that cried let go indoors pull down blind do something what be game suggested once that must go out of room while thought of something that then must come back try to guess anything draught chess surely there be something evelyn felt strangely master of at least knew so well what be master of that came to same thing have certainty anyhow on side yes let come indoors said know way about house there be room on other side will see le of there hate thunder too need have earthly anxiety about lady ellington may get wet be there then stop yours ear will hear le have hardly time to get word out before reverberation came again clearly business be meant immediate business too thunder followed nervously close on flash at madge fairly ran into house stumbling through darkness in little narrow hall nearly falling over bag evelyn have left there true though be that disliked thunder did not dislike to point of utterly losing head in storm just a nerve be physically upset so too whole mind being be troubled storm tossed by unexpected meeting with evelyn two disorderments reacted played upon one have there be thunderstorm must have faced evelyn appearance with greater equanimity have not appeared must have minded thunderstorm le braced with great effort determined not to lose control completely over effort demanded loan from heroism physical fear fear that weakens knee make hand cold be hard enough in to fight against to fight not only against against moral fear too demand thrice braver front too remembered in tour over house room of evelyn have spoken looked out a said in other direction must at rate not see here swift uprush of storm be very dark not only from portentous sootiness of sky because big box hedge stood scarcely dozen yard from window here evelyn followed striking match lit couple of candle also have by now got firmer hand over at sight of madge sitting there sort of vision of desolateness need for need too that at moment have for comfort almost mastered voice be not wholly steady there will be better here said candle be always reassuring be not will laugh at assure that if be alone in storm turn on electric light shut shutter ransack house for candle lamp then feel secure madge laughed rather dismally yes thanks make feel little better said be something anyhow to know one have companion in one unreasonableness know what be in thunderstorm agitates think be knowledge of proximity of frightful force entirely outside control of man may explode moment evelyn have turned to shut door a spoke at sort of convulsive jerk went through involuntarily slammed to there be something of deadly appropriateness in girl word indeed there be force in proximity to outside control must not even feel certain that be within own whether be able to stop explosion previous conduct to refusal to sit again saying that bored refusal even to see when paid ordinary call be counter explosion so to speak noise of door that have banged startled not le than beg pardon said know how did that flew out of finger a servant say when break something first slow hot drop of rain have be leaking of sluice of heaven have given place to downpour of amazing volume heaviness in windless air rain fell in perpendicular line of solid water a if from million inexhaustible squirt rattling on roof like devil tattoo hissing loud in hedge outside gurgling of house gutter have increased to roar now then splashed over pipe being unable to carry away water for last few minute there have be no return of lightning air be already little cooler fresher tenseness of oppression be little relieved in proportion to madge again rather recovered really be most grateful to mr dundas said for arrival know what must have done here alone did come down from london morning evelyn drew chair near sat down yes settled to come quite suddenly said have meant to work day did for hour so everything else looked ugly must not see either colour form properly everything else said madge unsuspectingly phrase be ambiguous did not even distantly guess what meant yes everything else except portrait of said shortly there be pause of unrivalled awkwardness longer lasted more inevitable did sequel become must ask something said evelyn at length ask only in common justice do think be treating quite fairly in refusing to sit for again for tell plainly cheat of doing best when one happens to be artist of class be rather serious thing for anybody to do mean lot to word knew be rather brutal be rather brutal too to take advantage of enforced tete tete must not pause to think of knew only that unless said thing must not trust not to say thing le brutal indeed harder for to hear must not quite tell how far have in control have put out one hand a began a if to ward off question a went on fell again sat merely receiving what said sitting under without shelter have right to treat like that continued part at door a far a know perfectly good friend one day two day afterwards be told that can not sit to again what can have done have done anything be fault in way looked at once imploringly please please go on asking said must not stop now own bare right justified question there be that behind urged more strongly than be fault in way repeated then sort of despairing courage seized girl must nerve to defence of secret whatever happened be not fault said then when told philip that be because bored did tell that asked yes told be not fault made practically must not have refused thought intently for moment unable to see where answer must lead indeed what answer to give in perplexity took simplest way out told truth yes said that said be not true then again ask why said felt that must break if went on made one more appeal ah beg of not to question cried talk of justice too be fair on that use accident of finding alone here in way ca go away know that there be one here to protect if by single other question take advantage of will leave house just a be in deluge walk back to hotel must remind that be unprotected girl must remind be gentleman rose with flashing eye have taxed bravery to get out have come out triumphant moment have come force have be gathering up be unable to contain in longer one terrific second of calm preceded explosion a if nature be following line of human drama for second downpour of blinding rain outside be stayed inside out there be moment silence know that said quietly ca help myself be not for picture doe matter be for because love madge threw arm wide then brought together in front of a if keeping off sort of cry of triumph have begun to burst from lip ended in long moan then room for moment be so suddenly illuminated by hellish glare that candle burned dim simultaneously crack of thunder so appalling shattered stillness that leaped apart oh something be struck cried be a if be in very room be be oh be frightened evelyn hardly seemed to notice be why because love said again for moment madge must neither speak move sudden double shock utter surprise of deep down in heart tumult of joy stunned then raised eye looked at must go away at once said ca sit in same room hate hate for what have said cried hate said sob for moment choked no must not think hate just then sound of footfall outside voice in hall struck in upon madge name be called in moment door opened lady ellington entered followed by merivale ah there be madge said have not be appalling tree be struck close to mr dundas said breaking off evelyn came step forward by difficult on whole merciful arrangement private crisis pas through be essential that ordinary form of life be observed solid wood may be rent shattered veneer must remain intact be merciful because thought be necessarily occupied in way with trivial thing whereas if be suffered to dwell entirely within brain must stand strain yes got here just before storm began said miss ellington have be keeping other company hate thunder madge too played at triviality ah mother be drenched soaking cried what will do really urge not to wait said merivale let show room get thing off wrap up in blanket till maid can come from brockenhurst with clothes will send boy in with note at once madge went upstairs with mother to assist merivale came down again to rejoin evelyn have only just seen telegram said be delighted have come be brave woman lady ellington tree be struck only few yard from merely remarked that be great waste of electricity be glad be wasted on tree not scribbled few line addressed to lady ellington maid went off to get somebody to take note into brockenhurst then came back to evelyn latter have not gone back to room where madge have sat during storm be out on verandah just opposite on other side of river be tree have be struck not hundred yard distant one branch a if in burst of infernal anger on part of lightning have be torn off a spider tear off wing of fly down center of trunk from top to bottom be scored white mark where wood showed through torn bark tree stood still uprooting have taken place even now in windless calm leaf be falling green vigorous leaf seemed to know that trunk sap sustained be dead fell in shower continuous rain of leaf until ground beneath be thick with pride of beech summer glory be done in hour two tree must be a leafless a when gale of december whistled through what mysterious telegraphy of murderous disaster have passed through huge trunk have sent message to uttermost foliage like message leaf knew to be terribly true so that did not wait for dismantlement of autumn even now in full vigour of green growth just fell died somehow seemed to evelyn very awful very inevitable citadel have fallen struck by bolt from above in uttermost outwork denizen laid down arm something too of sort have happened to in last hour have told madge secret of life that made artery fill throb with swift electrical pulsation of rapturous blood have passed into nothingness have said did not hate be recollection indeed of what have happened after have told be still rather dim hazy there have be terrific clap of thunder have said did not hate then mother merivale came in then a falling leaf from tree might be gathered put in heap at rate shattered fragment of afternoon began to piece together again have confessed that have said bored have confessed also that be not true what did mean have said did not hate what did mean be utter disorderment of mind that hopeless appealing agitation have be so present in manner throughout merely result of thunderous air be there something else that agitated presence knowledge that have behaved inexplicably be possible that tree must live again after rending furrow have be scored on merivale soon returned still smilingly unruffled still in soaking clothes seemed to be unconscious of sat down in verandah by evelyn since terrific clap there have be no return of thunder rain be beginning to fall again slow steady sullen from low dripping sky saw at once that something have happened to evelyn be trembling like startled animal since held that to force even suggest confidence be form of highway robbery forbore from questioning so be with miss ellington during storm said how love superb violence of element be such relief to know that there be still force in world be quite untamable that by possibility can lady ellington divert lightning into accumulator will light house evelyn turned on perfectly vacant face seemed not to have heard even what did lady ellington do asked attended when talked to said hermit with pardonable severity evelyn pulled together look here something happened said briefly be have told that love be be rope dangling in air nothing more happened just said have better go to room made direct answer at be even shocked then tiny detail began to be gathered in mind a if man swept fallen leaf from stricken tree into heap gave sort of cry said at end be moan threw arm wide then held to keep off what doe mean what doe mean got up quickly began walking up down verandah where be said must see again must say what said again tell must answer hermit for inhuman life have glimmering of sense must hing of sort said seem to realise what have done already why be engaged to philip to friend have told love good gracious be not that enough to make moan told must week ago said evelyn yes told that conditionally said must do so when saw loved instead good heaven evelyn must be unaware of what have done be left with girl during thunderstorm thing excites terrifies took advantage of excitement terror to say be ugly be beastly can say be like evelyn showed sign of resenting a far a mere criticism of what have done be concerned appeared merely to feel speculator interest in how struck spectator even lady ellington hard polished mind must not have presented surface more impervious to scratch speak a if did intentionally remarked never intended anything le have nothing to do with what must control have more power over than have over thunderstorm after blame thrush for eating worm if one act instinctively nobody have right to blame besides want moral judgment just want to know what mean have called pagan before now did not deny there be happen to like colour of hair accept seems to buttery if want to know seem to pagan without conscience think have acted uglily very well merivale hesitated moment have desire to say hard thing because be hard on other hand felt that game must be played rule have to be observed human life broke up in confusion a if fielder in game of cricket must not run after ball bowler bowl did not go in for cricket deliberately stood aside rule be binding on who played be use trying to convince person who fundamentally disagreed well asked said have given opinion be nobody opinion be binding on anyone else do ask to think over evelyn gave little click of impatience think over said what else do suppose must be thinking about what else have thought about for day merivale shook head try to get outside mean look at what have done from other standpoint than own say must help telling well there be certain thing one have got to help else stopped be use talking evelyn wanted to hear else suggested else have better not mix with other people at said merivale have better reason for turning hermit than have told girl who be engaged to friend that love think over illustration text decoration illustration text decoration ninth in spite of wetting lady ellington felt have have most interesting day when hour later drove back with madge maid to brockenhurst be not in least afraid of having caught cold because physical constitution be may almost be said a impervious to external condition a mind that frightful flash of lightning too have shattered now leafless tree have also a have seen be powerless to upset even balance of nerve have only evoked passing regret so much electric force must be wasted must therefore observe with customary clearness that something have occurred to agitate madge though thunderstorm alone might easily account for where madge have got nerve from must not conjecture there be nothing hereditary about at rate a far a mother be concerned yet required great exercise of constructive imagination to connect evelyn sudden appearance with agitation remembered also madge refusal to see other day rather unaccountable postponement of sitting few well chosen question however must soon settle delivered that evening after dinner firing off like well directed shot at broad target did not to continue metaphor want to make bull eye at once few outers must show range sufficiently well have first however committed to writing on dozen sheet of hotel paper impression of day conversation of mr merivale in so far a bore upon simplification of life be pleased to find how considerable harvest have gathered in lady ellington literary style have in perfection quality of clearness sharp outline that distinguished mind document might have be report for academy of science so well arranged precise be there be reflection of own upon matter be merely chronicle of fact conversation having be written revised read aloud to madge then marched with gun to position in front of target be odd that mr dundas must have appeared so unexpectedly madge said must have have considerable time with if arrived before storm began madge have be rather expecting winced under mother firm hard touch yes have be there about hour before came in said think account be quite excellent mother if consider a attempt to draw lady ellington off subject of evelyn be quite futile did not even seem to notice that attempt have be made did arrange about further sitting asked think more will be necessary replied madge philip agrees with too mr dundas think will ask for more lady ellington considered moment surely have settled to have one more said one postponed yes think agree now that a far a be concerned picture be finished lady ellington be not exactly puzzled must be fairer to say that though did not quite know where led be quite certain led somewhere be not puzzle be rather clue so got behind bush a be continued firing from there be great friend of philip be not said suppose will see good deal of after marriage sharp shooting be frightfully trying to madge nerve never knew where next shot might be coming from in be now quite clear to that shooting be going on be part of wisdom to defend oh hope so said be charming expect will be constantly with be little disconcerting madge have distinctly have best of exchange be in beleaguered position felt that at moment might have to give in have wild desire simply to leave room for wanted to be alone to think over that now knew clock inexorably pointed to half past nine only to say be going to bed must simply strengthen idea be in lady ellington mind prompted question maternal anxiety solicitude though point of view of mother be perhaps little predominant be moving cause of if be referred back to primary motif to put more bluntly yet lady ellington merely wished for guarantee that nothing of sort have occurred might however remotely influence matrimonial design for daughter have formed madge have agreed to carry out that have fear that thing be running otherwise than smoothly by smoothly being meant that marriage must take place on twenty eighth of month must be overstatement of idea prompted question certainly wished for convincing word that need have none now in art of conversation a generally expounded provision be not made for one very important common contingency of two conversationalist one may be willing to talk of anything in world except one subject other may for time wish to talk about other than thus conversation becomes difficult must often be tactical error thing of lady ellington be seldom guilty for person who wish to speak of one subject only to batter other with too many question on be often better to sit quietly down wait refusing with what politeness there may be handy to talk of anything else simply let silence do stealthy work for awkward silence be wearing wearing effect be inevitably felt by side be willing to talk of one subject lady ellington perhaps have never formulated in naked simplicity have often before now put theory into practice with masterly effect did so now there be so to speak one gate through beleaguered garrison must make sortie round that concentrated force beleaguered garrison knowing tried to make sortie through other gate first long silence be terrible storm afternoon said rain fell in bucketsfull saw there be quite deep channel across road along drove back here have made did not notice said lady ellington silence fancy mr merivale cooking for doing housework said madge fancy said lady ellington silence will go up after breakfast to morrow asked madge unless must like to go before said mother there be terrible little proverb about being cruel only to be kind benignant sort of torture exactly describes procedure of lady ellington must there be be quite sure there be something going on in madge mind with regard to evelyn be quite convinced that must be better in way that must know about be ulterior kindness immediate cruelty be apparent for madge be on edge of crisis of nerve very little push might send sprawling if then be case lady ellington distinctly wished that must sprawl if on other hand there be nothing critical agitating in outlook little push must do harm whatever for mind at peace doe not have tranquility upset by vague suggestion indefinite suspicion since poor madge be far from owning just now that inestimable possession of tranquil mind in silence followed third fiasco in making general conversation began to get restless fidgetty opened book looked blankly at page shut again fingered ornament on mantlepiece went to open window looked out for considerable time into hot wet blackness for slow steady rain be again falling heaven wept from sullen sky ridge of forest below stood merivale house be directly opposite window have seen that before night fell like thrush came to voiceless call so now spirit sped there to one who called for sudden flash of lightning have not be more unexpected than evelyn declaration to afternoon have thunder followed come quicker in response than have come now wondered half with dread half with wild secret hope whether have noticed that momentary self betrayal that have made knew that before must think control cry have be on lip arm have flung wide true a soon a conscious brain must work have revoked contradicted what have done have seen how terrible if have seen how terrible if have not what have become asked of sober sane conclusion of week ago knew then that loved that have be stranger to life pleasant domestic affection something wild unbarred almost brutal yet how essential now to life have dropped into heart a stone drop into sea going down down to depth unplumbable yet still going down until bottom limit of soul be reached be to such stone be really sinking down down in heart so steadily inevitably that tide of sea might strive yet must never cast that stone up again be such little thing yet power on earth unless law govern earth be revised made ineffectual must ever stay course if moved under same command a have to settle in depth of other once surface be broken by little splash down must go made splash whether in wayside puddle in depth of mid atlantic must rest only where touched bottom such be sum of wide eyed staring into blackness of rain ruled night then still restless turned back again into room faced not world of dream solitary imaginings of what must theoretically be case material side of indubitably have word to say on table be letter have received hour before dinner forwarded from london expressing pleasure of donor in sending wedding present there too be own answer of neatly worded thanks above there be mother patiently adamant beleaguered garrison though knew that enemy friendly enemy awaited went out on sortie too forlorn to call hope through only available gate madge sat down in chair have occupied before have be asking lot of question said bear on mr dundas suppose think have guessed that something have happened be quite right think be always right told afternoon that be in love with lady ellington hardly knew whether have expected not at rate showed sign of surprise what very bad taste said telling mean madge have given sudden hopeless giggle of laughter at first four word of before explanation came lady ellington waited till have finished what did say to asked hardly know think said that one other of must leave room very proper asked whether hated for told did not then broke whether be wiser to be silent did not pause to consider for must not be silent there must be crash situation of kind must not adjust in passivity be mere temporising not to speak at once because hate said now speaking quickly a if in fear of interruption love oh have done best if have never spoken never let know that loved must have gone on think done what have be arranged for to do philip knew see did not love like have told did not know what be almost wish have never known know ca help now lady ellington gospel a regard best plan on to conduct life be worth if weighed a moral principle be quite certain that acted up to put paper knife into book have taken up during madge aimless wandering about room to mark page of perusal spoke with perfect calmness what do propose to do asked madge have not up till that moment proposed to do anything have not in other word considered practical interpretation of bewildering discovery fact that silent secret love love be determined to lock up forever in own breast be returned be so emotionally overwhelming that a from blinding light must only turn dazzled eye elsewhere first instinct at moment at be declared to be of rapturous acceptance of almost a instinctive not quite so instinctive since have come second be shrinking from that implied rupture with philip inevitable suffering pressure that knew must be brought to bear on yet thing have to be faced be use shrinking from lady ellington question reminded her of obvious necessity for choice choice indeed be made be time to think of what action choice implied answered quietly enough have not yet thought of what mean to do said suppose have better talk about then lady ellington unmasked battery be quite clear that madge already seriously contemplated breaking off engagement with philip marrying artist indeed have better talk about said want to ask one question first have mr dundas slightest notion that feeling for be reciprocated madge thought over moment have no right to think so said have told what occurred whole thing be few second there be various way of spending few second said mother think spent discreetly madge looked up with sort of weary patience must badger said be use did best to conceal then bombardment began very good take that doe not know now let consider what be going to do do mean to write note to saying 'dear mr dundas love ' if be intention have better do at once there be kind of reason for delay if be not intention taking that in broadest sense to mean that will not make known to that love dismiss possibility altogether pray give whole attention madge nothing can occur to in whole of life be likely to matter more than love pleaded madge love be not that enough must not something happen ask whether intend to do anything that implies now that without further action on part will show that love question just requires 'yes ' supposing decline to answer asked madge suddenly flashing out think can do that see be mother a such think have right to know what propose to do madge covered eye with hand for moment question have to be answered knew that knew also that unless evelyn made further sign must hing if love for a doubted not at be real must approach again here then be data for answer said will hing because there be need must broke off then got up with sudden swift movement put coarsely make cast iron of mother said when ask if intend to write to tell of course see pursued lady ellington if asks to see will see said if object be to say again what said to day will tell now to get news even if be not very satisfactory be better than not getting news in uncertainty there be mean of telling how to act whatever contingency contingency known be like danger known can perhaps be guarded against can certainly be faced how to guard against lady ellington did not at moment see knew that danger lay here from moment will break off engagement with philip asked there be need here of reply lady ellington continued now consider exactly how mr dundas stand said know be engaged to friend of that will be married in few week allows left alone with by accident to make declaration to doe that seem to to be honourable action then once again madge flashed out ah who care cried what doe matter lady ellington rose have also promised to marry philip said suppose doe not matter either do wrong must not wish to marry if knew said madge lady ellington poured out glass of hot water sipped in silence knew well that many word may easily spoil effect of few few thought on whole have be well chosen so just a before have refused to talk on subject one so now since have said really just what meant to say refused longer to talk on be agreeably willing a madge have be ten minute before to talk about anything else think there will be more rain before morning said then madge came close to knealt by chair be not even sorry for mother said will be if act unwisely replied other madge there be nothing else to be done got up again there be slightly chalybeate taste in lady ellington hot water to night remarked on be more noticeable if water be hot than if be cold taste be not unpleasant then question of train up to town next day be debated be settled to leave till to morrow indeed be rather pity to come down into country for so few hour afternoon to day have really be spoiled by rain walk in forest must look beautifully fresh green after storm must be very pleasant to morrow morning if be fine delivered in cool well bred voice have sort of paralytic effect on madge felt a if coil be being wound round hampered power of movement must scarcely picture a in active opposition to mother will picture of herself triumphant over be even more unthinkable a usual kissed mother when said good night to mother offered bromide if thought that excitement agitation caused by thunderstorm must be likely to prevent sleeping lady ellington did not propose taking bromide to make sleep did not on other hand propose to attempt to go to sleep just yet for have matter to weigh consider perhaps take step consequent on consideration before went to sleep like practical successful people believed intensely in prompt action be better in most case to decide wrongly than not to decide at intended before slept to night to decide a far a lateness of hour permitted to act on decision proposition thesis of decision be very soon rehearsed indeed be thing that took for granted have now to prove demonstrate there be house so to speak be under contract to build have ready in few week be brick mortar have to procure have house solidly built ready by required date house to be built be almost superfluous to remark be house madge philip must occupy together now according to light little light may have be much like shade be convinced that madge must be extremely happy in house have to build for be woman of sense fully believed that everything be sensible even sensible marriage be ipso facto better than corresponding equivalent with sense left out philip be in way suitable match be gentleman have solid quality quality wear well be so supremely important if have to wear for remainder of mortal existence be much devoted to madge madge on side be much attached to be quite certainly unemotional be therefore only reasonable to suppose that sudden ascent into aerial region have culminated in evening crisis be daedalus flight wing fastening of must melt must if pursued unwise course come to earth with most uncomfortable shattering bump evelyn doubt possessed for something missed in philip must have missed if have looked for have not looked for have told that brought affection esteem respect have be content be content still madge must be content too browning say that be ticklish matter to play with soul lady ellington did not stand convicted over did not play with at with firm cool hand shoved into place for week madge have accepted if not with rapture at rate with very sincere welcome future have be planned for be insanity now to revoke that for sake of what might easily be moment freak that there be something very attractive about irresponsible boy with brilliant talent graceful presence lady ellington did not for moment deny even when be quite by to plan lifetime merely rested on foundation be to build house upon sand madge have fallen in love with external be impossible that must be allowed to make blunder for so mother regarded irreparable be mean whereby must be rendered impossible that lady ellington have now to determine since be quite firmly convinced of desirability of end did not must be confessed feel particularly scrupulous with regard to mean time lady ellington mind have not be only formulating also constructing construction be now complete late though be drew chair to small writing table so conveniently placed under electric light wrote dear mr dundas daughter have told a indeed be bound to do what took place afternoon when arrived unexpectedly at mr merivale house found alone with feel of course convinced that must be already sorry for having allowed to take advantage of girl accidental loneliness in way since gather from that mr merivale returned almost at moment be willing to believe that must not have lady ellington paused moment wished to put thing strongly have continued to obtrude presence speech on one to whom be so unwelcome have desire to add to reproach be sure must be heaping on will say no more on subject be of course impossible that daughter must sit to again be equally impossible that must write to attempt to see since can not possibly have anything to say except to reiterate regret for what have done be better to take for granted a be perfectly willing to do of forgive can answer for a completely a can answer for with heart will maintain may rest assured strictest silence on subject must like to have one line from in acknowledgment of receipt of yours very truly margaret ellington note be written with few erasure for be lady ellington invariable custom to think thought with precision before committed to paper yet late a have grown copied out afresh put in envelope directed placed on small table by head of bed so when tea be brought in morning must be patent to eye of maid rather uncharacteristically thought over what have said in a continued undressing be for good likewise there be word in be not true slept with conscience be hard clear quite satisfied for if one be doing one best for people nothing further must be demanded from one that be doing best have kind of doubt thus mind be soon at leisure to observe that be impossible to put out electric light after getting into bed be necessary to light candle first made mental note to refuse to pay for candle in case be charged in bill lady ellington postponement of settling of train by madge must go up to town next day be due a reader will have guessed to desire to get evelyn answer to note before went glorious morning of flooding sunshine world washed renewed by torrent of day before succeeded storm at breakfast plan of spending morning in forest going up to london after lunch be accepted by madge if not with enthusiasm at rate with complete acquiescence of course must not know that mother have written to evelyn be wiser also in case be familiar with handwriting that there must be risk run of seeing envelope addressed by in reply very little strategy however must affect in obedience to order a soon a lady ellington madge have started on ramble morning maid took cab to hermitage bearing note answer to must wait for give to mistress privately seemed to provide for contingency anyhow must arise from note indeed though there be danger contingency to be avoided provided for before madge must be safely home lady ellington thought rather neat felt quite competent to tackle with madge have declared must take step without initiative on part of evelyn after really very carefully worded note must receive morning be not easy to see what must do luck of course blind goddess who upset plan a mischievous child upset chess board on most delicate problem be in course of solution might bring in unforeseen to wreck everything lady ellington experience be that luck chiefly interfered with careless people who did not lay plan well must not accuse herself of belonging to class in fact must her enemy if a be highly probable have enemy have done so be therefore in state of reasonable calm absence of apprehension that came back from long stroll in forest with madge just before lunch have have really delightful walk have talked over without allusion to subject really occupied gospel of simple life a practised by merivale madge have not slept well indeed must be truer to say have scarcely slept at face bore trace of weary hour of night too like mother though for different reason have temptation to re open subject simply because felt must not stand more just then be something of relief to devote even superficial activity of mind to other topic not for moment did doubt that evelyn must write to asking to see must indeed do for own sake le than hers though waiting be hard enough yet at end of there shone so bright light even waiting have sort of luminous rapture about so comforting thus responded to mother bright agile talk indeed took fair share of conversation answer have arrived when lady ellington reached home maid gave in bedroom acknowledged receipt of note a have asked indeed be have asked must therefore have be perfectly satisfied yet be not quite did not feel a secure a must have wished illustration text decoration illustration text decoration tenth be ten day after event of thunderstorm evelyn who have returned to london day after be in studio working at portrait of philip last ten day have passed for like evil dream dream too unfortunately from there be prospect whatever of waking indeed a dream went on seemed to gain in ghastly vividness day that passed repeated effect of stamped reality deeper with good sense did credit instead of brooding desolately over lot driving half mad with thought of madge turned with sort of demented fury to work day after day painted till must no longer see not leaving off till brain be dull almost incapable of further thought though nervous excitable highly strung be luckily also very strong believed that be capable at rate of going on at frightful high pressure anyhow till marriage have taken place when be accomplished felt that tension of suspense must be lightened might be true drop like stone in sea struggle must then be over must not battle longer to try to keep afloat in inside pocket of coat kept note that have received from lady ellington be soiled wilted with much handling re reading simple straightforward from literary point of view a be have tried fifty interpretation on of very intelligible sentence not one contained grain of comfort for though whole fibre of spiritual being be in so great agonising state of unrest found that eye hand have lost not one particle of power of vision execution sometimes be true be rather hard to get to work seemed scarcely worth while putting in light shadow when once have begun there be abatement in brilliance of skill though only felt vague far away satisfaction in what be doing brought keenness of observation dexterity of handling to work again when sitter be there there be same merciful necessity of normal behaviour probably there be only one person who saw during day who suspected that there be anything wrong be philip of what be wrong have not faintest inkling philip so said world in general have become wonderfully softened since engagement have gained enormously in geniality quality of world have not considered particularly lavish before did not in new day take quite so seriously a have be used to why have fallen in love with madge originally nobody quite knew for there be very obvious common ground between way of love be past finding out even a when two tiny carbon pole of electric battery be brought near to other light altogether disproportionate to size illuminates night so be with philip certainly now miracle be easier of explanation there apparently have be in germ of quite different philip to showed world philip admirably kind gentle very man who must so easily fall in love with anyone possessed of half madge perfectly obvious attraction be said in general talk in whisper have begun to be said that madge be not so desperately in love with for gladys ellington be not a matter of fact directly responsible though doubt must have be if have thought must not be found out be rather madge own manner suggested too like philip have be much humanised coincidentally anyhow with engagement later during last ten day in fact really seemed to have hired snail shell curled up in trousseau alone be immaterial did not seem to give smallest pleasure yet indifference to be not indifference might have be fruit of private intense happiness must conceivably have made even confection seem tasteless in fact be not only trousseau that appeared to find tasteless found everything tasteless really to judge from mode of behaviour when be with philip must have thought that be icicle just being introduced to eligible snowflake philip on particular day have sat for evelyn for nearly couple of hour grumbling at length of detention in manner did not suggest active discontent intended in fact to give madge picture on wedding day if must be finished to further desirable object be willing really to sit for a long a evelyn required latter various numerous a be mood to usually treated sitter seemed to day to have gone through be in fact more like than philip have lately seen until one really look at man face have be saying one never know how ugly be always used to think passably good looking be awful do know men face generally be like chest of drawer square know covered with knob suggest handle be balder than when began to paint be sure apologise do really think can finish by twenty eighth will be immensely grateful if can twenty eighth ah yes happy day thereat mood came over for spate of surprising remark have be pouring forth there be exchanged frowning brush biting silence lasted twenty minute philip a thanks for offering on altar of conversation got only grunt once laboriously polite request to stand still eventually hit on subject produced response madge portrait said have decided to yield to ignorance perhaps anyhow desire consider finished evelyn stopped dead in middle of stroke new frightfully disconcerting mood suddenly appeared to posse how can ask if yield said hotly when have told ca have more sitting yield a man yield who be pinioned hung only yield to force a for portrait be there face to wall will not send to may fetch away without opposition on part never want to see again oh make one condition must never be exhibited ah dear fellow said philip can not take if feel like about leave then philip be very deeply hurt somehow by evelyn absolute insistence on taking a present from have much touched though have tried to combat ending of affair be intolerable must not leave matter like now while be debating what to do evelyn spoke again resuming painting with rapid unerring stroke must say too said have inspiration for portrait quite unlike have ever have before be even a stand masterpiece miss ellington anyhow have prevented from completing what be best must have be far better far better must have be on different plane altogether be sorry if hurt be only right must know say be fault say be anybody fault there picture stand give with completeness with originally gave with best wish paused moment wo send said since think ought to be sent yet take with love best love philip must be obliged if must say no more at about turn face bit more to left there be good fellow have shifted slightly painted on for little time in silence philip complying with request that nothing more must be said about answered next question common topic introduced time thought be busy enough on tabooed subject for second time a at opera few night ago vague suspicion crossed mind that evelyn be in love with madge have somehow betrayed to now a then formulated thought only to give instant dismissal that being so be morally bound to do evelyn justice to accept without comment reservation fact that really required sitting from madge to do utmost unwillingness cause of to make sit to again philip known to few intimate philip so much respected by world at large have very strong sense of fairness fair thing quite certainly be be impossible to deny artist sitting if felt like about be doubly impossible to deny to friend even if picture have be order commission must have be shabby treatment now that knew how evelyn felt about not to do very utmost to get madge to give sitting picture be not that be present given too a have said with love must not really doubt that when be put to madge like must see a did task of talking to on subject be distasteful to for have be mysteriously indeed unmistakably in earnest about few night ago at opera cause consciously turned back from even conjecturing at cause have so thought at rate adequate reason for not wishing to continue sitting even when artist point of view be presented to foresaw that might find in opposition to must be painful to of have change in world compared to action of snail retiring into shell escaped have be for last ten day so reserved silent apt to be startled more than once have asked if anything be wrong vehemence of assertion that nothing be wrong have rather surprised here again have to pull up studiously refrain from conjecturing that evelyn be in way connected with private worry of hers besides have said that nothing be wrong be bound to accept for reason rejected notion of consulting lady ellington about must imply distrust of girl be going to see a soon a sitting be over since have thoroughly made up mind that must do best to persuade to do a desired about portrait determined not to put off to speak to to day judged better not to tell evelyn what be going to do because on one hand mission might fail of success on other because have be asked to allude further to question so for remainder of sitting talked quite naturally since be thinking of one subject must not be talked about on strictly public topic minute be age of discomfort philip at rate be heartily glad when be over be out again in hot sunny street madge scarcely knew how day have passed since afternoon in new forest for seemed to that value of life be altered a if totally new scheme of thing must be made for existed at present be not possible day after day too brought twenty eighth nearer date before something must upset reverse whole world must assuredly occur for be pledged then to do knew must not do impossibility of be hour more vividly impressed on have promised mother to hing unless evelyn made further advance what did not know be how very skilfully have be debarred from already promise have given have begun to lose for moral validity be only in second hand sort of way that considered binding for one thing only felt be really binding on that impossibility of fulfilling pledge to philip be outside power by what step must make that known did not yet consider way must be found what way be seemed to if considered at very immaterial for side by side with impossibility not le securely throned be certainty namely that evelyn must repeat what have said before man must leave like in day knew what be to start change colour when door bell rang to frame excuse excuse to go downstairs see what post have brought to watch at ball party arrival of fresh comer glance across crowded room in sort of yearning certainty now at last must see one face among crowd must come slowly closer closer through throng until be by then even trivial commonplace little detail be imagined by must ask for dance take out to unfrequented room philip at time must probably be with must certainly smile nod at evelyn resign to for just ten minute day went on none of vision be realised appeared more at house where have often seen often too people asked about progress of portrait to replied that be finished finished moment be lit with certainty sure hope there be others black one what if have spoken without thought excitedly carried away by moment passion bitterly regretted since supposing did not really love supposing have be just flame blaze of moment there be preparation possible for crash be inevitable gradual estrangement from philip ending in quarrel be to be thought of must not scheme soften thing granite of bouleversement must not be kneaded into dough more than once have asked if anything be matter on last occasion a have seen have denied with vehemence vehemence of one who be sick with deadly devouring sickness whose instinct feverish irresistible be to hold on to last affirming health own vehemence have startled not only have vowed to show more self control exhibit that self control in most difficult demonstration merely that of appearing quite normal not exercising indeed needing self control at more especially be difficult when be alone with half hinted look of love in honest eye have to be somehow telegraphed back resemblance must pas muster a response have to be sent by be so mean only comfort that cold be that must not now last long for one supreme impossibility remained must not be at side on twenty eighth thing fate own action dictated by must interfere with about felt sort of cold irresponsibility meantime since responsibility be not a yet definitely fallen on need for normal behaviour be paramount to day philip be coming to tea be going to return to dinner with mother be going to theatre after there be dance from hour between five small hour of next day must scarcely be alone moment be in loneliness that must best bear hopeless tangle that tangle so seemed to now must never be unravelled must be cut with knife small knot more le no longer made difference be with apathy almost certainly without strong feeling of kind that heard from lady ellington that must perhaps be late for tea in consequence that philip must be alone together hour two more of make believe did not seem to now to matter much hour that there must be of be definitely limited since limited be possible to deal with for be only endless succession of impossible hour knowledge that will continue a long a life brings despair above till crash came must be normal must give sign of storm be raging within though depth lowest abyss of nature be upheaved by wild billow yet somehow surface must be kept calm be one of force outside own control have taken possession of with sort of shudder thought of duck drake discussion have held with evelyn about incontrollable force making thing of vital import subject for jest epigram knew now a have not known then what force meant dismal drawing room with frippery hanging over window to hide from gaze of square grand piano window at opposite end commanded small sooty yard hundred drawing room east west of be exactly like yet on have fate that cruel velvet pawed cat pounced selecting at random to make scene of one of mean little drama at one can not laugh for fear of tear at one can not cry because other people laugh here madge sat alone lady ellington not having yet returned silver urn occasionally lifting lid with infinitesimal pressure of steam beneath with mocking accessory of comfortable life round waiting for inevitable explosion might be to day might be to morrow might be day up to twenty eighth by time must have come yet same carpet must be trodden on same picture must cast incurious eye on to human tragedy same everything must preserve mute inanimate composure that composure too have now to rival must be a suitable a sofa greeting of anyhow be good enough at last said philip be week since set eye on where have be what have done with time now say have only be business believe do will send detective to get on track ah must like can see gave what novelist call involuntary shudder then broke down little tea asked like weak philip settled in chair have indicated too like madge be inclined to temporise though reason for so doing be different for inevitable errand be unpleasant present so extremely reverse temporisation on other hand be that of postponing inevitable for sake of impossible well be good anyhow to see again said yes business chiefly have stood in way wo be dishonest spent nearly two hour afternoon over portrait what portrait asked madge with swiftness that must not help must gladly have recalled for present however appeared that philip did not notice vehemence mine said quietly be sitting to evelyn know hope to have finished by twenty eighth will see then not till then yes keep for then said again bracing to keep up sort of attitude must be natural in girl to man be shortly going to marry must come a surprise to philip only tell be good be sha be disappointed now portrait of seemed to philip more magical work than even that of madge knew pretty well afternoon when be allowed to see felt that evelyn somehow must have be inside to have done brilliant a madge portrait be artist indeed considering quite high water mark be yet mood of madge that have caught so correctly delineated so unerringly that mood of reassuring laughter at worry sorrow of life in own portrait felt that be there no promise that will not be disappointed said though daresay will make jump be on canvas at seems to be stepping right out of there be there added not only poor business man man who love have put that in goodness how must have known what be like madge gave sudden little start recovered immediately must not meet seriously have to be laughed off well know what be like said because with fault have really never loved never think of except a rather little brute be better to do oneself be not to leave to others not that prevents doing also philip have possessed of madge left hand hand that never ceased to wonder at be always cool never hot never cold skin of be like peach finger be long tapered to almond shaped nail for slimness delicacy be yet strong hand mechanically returned touch of half unconsciously lingered at base of fourth finger a if showing place where so soon plain circlet of gold must be ah be always pity if anybody think one brute said often must happen think one must try to make such occasion rare so long a one doe not have to sacrifice principle to mean if anyone think one brute one can convince of contrary be usually worth while for moment flashed through madge brain what be coming considering what mind be full of be not surprising came want to ask favour of dear said call favour because be real favour implies doing something know want to do also will make somebody cease to think brute instead of sacrificing principle in performance will satisfy one that very good one principle of fairness madge have left sofa where be sitting together during simply in order to be doing something instead of inertly listening poured out cup of tea so back be turned to philip when replied state a if must help saying 'yes said voice trembling little what be philip merely that give evelyn sitting said have idea how strongly keenly felt about till afternoon will tell about yes do well wo come sit here again did not dare for felt too uncertain of herself a poured milk into tea hand be no longer master of saucer be flooded ah what mess cried go on philip feel that be treating shabbily said mind never said that never must be clear to belief that portrait of be best piece of work be ever likely to do though may disagree with say nothing against right to opinion be probably correct well want one more sitting did say that afternoon did before afternoon told might fetch away if liked must offer opposition that must not send ca take like can take if be feeling about be a if paid for be present most generous splendid present so will be very kind madge though bore just go back once indeed be only fair that must after be only for hour so really believe bore much though in next moment madge thought of so much pause be not long for thought flashed lightning wise through mind first came dramatic wonder that must be philip philip of people in huge world who must be asking to do if have be anybody else thing must not have be so astounding be then came thought of mother promise have given even before promise set in scale with larger issue have weighed light now just kicked beam then after stronger than else came sense of solution of riddle answered how often have puzzled over manner in must turn out that twenty eighth must be to day without significance here be answer different from imaginings told by philip of imaginings puzzlings have have enough did not put brain to task of imagining what that sitting must be like how must speak what must say simply be going to meet again voice when answered be perfectly calm without vibration felt indeed now so certain of herself that came sat by philip again yes if feel like said if feel like will do a wish a say hour two doe matter much will write to have better be a soon a possible to morrow if have time have rather empty day to morrow got up again will write now think said because must eat little just little humble pie a have relish for will get done with a soon a possible now what will say let think pen travelled with remarkable ease over paper humble pie appeared be being consumed without much difficulty once only stopped for word then scream of quill underlined own name will do asked read dear mr dundas feel have right since wish to give sitting to refuse have be pointed out to quite clearly by philip who be with now see that be not fair on portrait wonder if to morrow must suit must come time between three six if three will do pray trouble to answer will assume affirmative philip habit of considering business letter led to pause yes be amende honorable said at length will do excellently if be bored madge why not take mother with must meet there oh must think so odd said lightly see be accustomed to go alone have told that hate other people in studio while be painting directed note rang bell there be one thing more philip said be that want mother to know be going see told too be not going to sit again if one go back on one word well fewer people who know about better everyone hate changeable person who doe know own mind philip willingly gave assurance on point for though seemed to rather superfluous refinement be on whole so pleased to have met with opposition that be delighted to leave matter settled without more discussion then since be already time for to go home dress for early dinner before theatre got up ah madge said lingering moment know ca guess how divinely happy make in big thing knew be so in little thing be so also be complete through struck like blow must scarcely look at be even harder to return caress oh think too well of said go now will be late then after have gone madge felt tired a have never felt tired before fact that tension be over showed what tension have be have struggled while struggled need for effort have postponed effect of weariness effort produced must go on living ordinary life have not occurred must still have gone on be only now when need for going on be over knew how utterly weary be yet with weariness there be given draught of wine must no longer be to morrow to morrow to morrow to morrow only knew a surely a knew how tired be that to morrow must see with rest be content to leave imagination picturing of hers be necessary must be a must be after philip have left there be still hour before need go to dress thought that solitude might be disturbed here by anyone who called by mother who must be returning minute caused to go upstairs to own room where till advent of maid at dressing time must be alone thus be scarcely minute after lover have gone that went upstairs a mounted step to storey above heard front door bell ring congratulated on having just escaped went more softly closed door of bedroom very gently behind ring at bell have heard be mother returning footman who have taken madge note who have also just let out let in having laid down note in question on hall table meaning to put stamp on drop into letter box madge handwriting be unmistakable be brilliantly legible too address leaped from envelope now lady ellington a friend possible enemy must have at once admitted be very thorough woman did not in fact when desired designed anything neglect opportunity of furthering desire design on other hand neglect to remove obstacle might possibly stand in way of realisation have excellent eye too eye not only of good sight very quick to observe yet even short sighted person might easily have involuntarily read address so extremely legible be lady ellington with excellent sight read almost before knew have read footman in question have meantime just gone out to deliver order to chauffeur for motor evening before have got back again into hall lady ellington be half way upstairs with note in hand william footman have week before received month warning on general ground of carelessness inattention whether justified not before be justified now for on re entering thought no more at about note have to post stared at in looking glass hoped next butler might be more agreeable to sensitive young fellow than one at present served under be student of drama smiled to in glass detecting in image likeness to mr george alexander so smiled again a befits so vacant minded young man vanishes from tale after short inglorious career career regarded in different fashion lady ellington went into drawing room on way upstairs philip knew since have passed fifty yard from house have gone so appeared have gone too tea be still there for have already have tea took trouble to rinse out cup pour little boiling water into proceeded to lay note face upwards over thorough in way took precaution of sitting close to table ready at moment to snatch note away be discovered sipping hot water practice to be known to be addicted to attributed much of superlative health freedom from digestive trouble how well founded that belief be may be judged from fact that digested without qualm of kind what be doing now good purpose lurked behind assimilated apparently meanness in fact good purpose be of nature of strongest acid meanness ceased to exist be absorbed utterly eaten away be in hurry for there be still plenty of time before need dress waited till flap of envelope began to curl back of own accord a gum fastened be made fluid again by steam happened very soon because be not yet really dry then taking precaution against sheet inside being touched by drew out read clear neat handwriting have taken great pain with madge early tuition in art be a intelligible a print only needed to read through twice before placed back again in envelope pressed flap back left to cool dry yet during very short process own idea be also cool dry reasoning sound effective so put stamp on envelope went downstairs dropped into letter box be necessary since in note madge have stated that must be at studio at three unless heard to contrary therefore there be object to be gained in merely sequestrating note since madge proposed to go there unless stopped for lady ellington knew well that plan however well founded must be quite certain of success uncertainty possibly adverse action of fate might work against thus to let note go of have mastered content be to provoke accident le since on present scheme have not stopped for fewer dubious thing one doe on whole le be risk be unfortunate accident of guilt in nine case out of ten hang man so though have be guilty in way when wrote to evelyn implying madge acquiescence in letter have more excellent reason now especially since have completely mastered content of note in not taking more questionable step of stopping for knew for certain at moment did not require to know more immediate movement of enemy if madge heard nothing must go to studio to morrow at three one under circumstance must prevent mother making appearance there too again be true sort of reply might come fact of reply coming be equivalent to evelyn saying that must not be there at three to morrow rightly put down a being negligible contingency in case again if lady ellington must not keep watch over madge movement during next ten day felt must be really ashamed of herself a have never be that yet saw reason why must begin now be probably right chance be immensely at moment in favour of not beginning to be ashamed of herself for beginning of shame be searchings of heart lady ellington never searched heart only did best evening passed in perfect harmony though have good deal to think about must yet spare time to be characteristically critical about play be easy since be very bad one deeper consolation of brain be devoted time to certain contingency note have be posted by half past seven must be received that night supposing there be reply to be almost certain that answer must come at second morning post one rapped towards end of breakfast time if so if reply be received by madge have merely in most natural manner possible to suggest complete occupation for day challenging inquiring into other engagement did not seriously expect reply be almost certain rejoinder in case lady ellington must be quite unoccupied after lunch ramification went further madge have consented to give mr dundas sitting after have declared must not take next step be better therefore to meet guile with guile not suggest suspicion possibility of till last moment must go out to lunch to morrow with regret to madge leaving free to spend afternoon a chose without asking question however must leave lunch early manage to be at mr dundas by three o'clock five minute before perhaps be always well to be on safe side lady ellington applause at end of second act be rather absent minded thoroughness made examine own position little more closely there be one point about did not much like namely fact that have written to mr dundas from brockenhurst implying madge concurrence in what said must be rather awkward if hint of ever reached madge really must be difficult to explain explanation in fact be impossible since there be none followed from a corollary that must not see madge alone chance then be enormous of whole thing coming out yet how again must be able to explain own presence at evelyn house in king road at three o'clock afternoon be childish to say happened to be passing then solution occurred to one be extraordinarily simple extremely probable philip have told that madge be sitting again so probable indeed be that must almost without effort persuade that have done so lady ellington be happily unconscious at moment what extremely tangled web be weaving how impossible be for to disentangle for not having have privilege of overhearing madge conversation with philip have by fault of hers idea that be pledged to secrecy true have not actually mentioned thing might be expected to have done fact that madge be going to sit again doubt little well turned conversation might make do so madge at end of third act be talking to neighbour in stall turned to philip stupid act rather said two laid plan so badly then with sudden sense of inward humour of word be enough to open people letter said must hear conversation too must really have made excellent villain if have studied villainy must have hidden behind curtain under table listened at key hole for private conversation of other people carefully looked in such place hung handkerchief over key hole before indulging in of own philip laughed yes think must be thorough in did said certainly whatever line be must 'pick up ' first a schoolboy say to be on side ah be certainly on side said now what have done with day like to hear always exactly what people have done few week of what people have done give complete key to character be that why ask said no because know character ask merely from interest in well rode before breakfast said got down to city about half past ten worked till half past two dull work rather by bye hold on to east rand mining think be going better then ate three sandwich piece of cake then sat to evelyn for two hour then went round to see madge dressed dined did think much of play portrait asked lady ellington be good ah doe be good said philip man like can not do bad thing be more than good be mary jane top note thought madge be top note said lady ellington well think have gone semitone higher said of course be worst person to judge seems to that be even more sure in than be in portrait have seen lady ellington be quite quick enough to catch at must so much like to said do think must let see be sure must philip paused moment send note will said must go to morrow if be because know be busy ah what pity said lady ellington lowering voice little have nothing to do to morrow afternoon know be busy repeated philip told so madge portrait said when will see that be quite finished be not suddenly preposterous idea occurred to philip that be being pumped doubt be only madge rather ridiculous request that mother must not know that be going to sit again that suggested still be there on point also have given promise to went warily in time of trouble fancy be going to work little more at said anxious to tell truth a far a possible indeed told so to day said that if sent for in couple of day must be ready for to take be quite clear therefore indeed letter have so providentially come into hand told that philip knew that madge be going to sit again to morrow letter anyhow have told that be going to sit again philip suggestion that must not go to see portrait to morrow be quite sufficiently confirmatory of rest have not told be true that madge be going to do must answer purpose well enough there be only one thing more to ask think madge said must not sit for again observed yes know did said because be bearer of message from thought be mistake remember at time be on tip of lady ellington tongue to say have told so since remembered how terribly must fall below usually felicitous level of scheming so a curtain went up at moment turned attention to stage have not gone up must have diverted talk into other channel raising of curtain be not deliverance to let see what second rate schemer make of said act be played to tragic end philip helped on with cloak committed initial fault said did lay original scheme well enough though play be disappointment pondered over way home illustration text decoration illustration text decoration eleventh madge lunched alone next day thing seldom happened to thing be always in childish way rather treat for in order to counteract natural tendency of mankind to gobble over solitary meal else to eat nothing at be custom to bring book down with prop up against mustard pot intend anyhow to read slowly to eat slowly sensible result seldom happened since a matter of fact result be that read two page of book then took dozen rapid mouthful to day not even that result be attained for read nothing not even opening book have brought down with ate hardly more for in spite of lay before rupture with philip inevitable pain sorrow natural justified indignation contempt of of be scarcely faceable if faced only in spite too of that mother must feel doubt say in spite of fear felt in face of in spite of that world in general must say be too happy to read too happy to eat for birthday of life knew have come afternoon in hour two must be face to face with man who loved man loved in front of tremendous fact fact swallowed up rest of world in gulp nothing else must really count for anything everything else be like minute type of kind while in middle be just one sentence in huge glowing capital everything have fallen out so conveniently too lady ellington have told at breakfast that be going to be out for lunch engaged after lunch did not inquire into madge plan at have received no reply to note to evelyn very fact that there be none seemed to bring into more intimate relation with then after lunch have to change to white evening dress over put long dark cloak maid arranged hair for be best to go complete took with in case of need scarlet opera cloak preparation be so much joy to felt in very bone that be while be looking at dressed thus that first knew loved thus dressed must come back to to day above long riddle of day be solved now here be answer be answer yet though heart leaped forward did not accelerate actual movement four wheeler also be rather slow be ten minute after three when arrived at door of studio in king road just beyond be drawn up motor car beside stood footman a stepped out of cab went to door of motor opened within yard two of stood mother instantly passion love in madge heart be transformed into mere resolve for knew that struggle matching of will against mother lay in front of strength of love be there lost nothing of lady ellington have crossed pavement more quickly than stood in front of door where be going to madge asked madge turned not to to footman holding out florin pay cab please said then turned to mother have made appointment to sit to mr dundas afternoon said be absurd for to tell that did know ask how knew philip told said lady ellington philip cried madge then controlled that sudden ebullition for fibre within knew that incredulity only half believed have done wrong so calming spoke again believe that said be declaration of war quiet tranquil final point between two be vital reached downwards into depth of individuality where compromise can not live being unable to breathe in so compressed atmosphere lady ellington knew that a well a madge there be war daughter stood in unreconcileable camp diplomacy be dumb clash of arm must alone break silence pointed to motor car for modernity of setting be inevitable even though primeval passion be pitted against other doe not make slightest difference whether believe not said quietly get into motor a have sent cab away madge seemed hardly to hear philip never told repeated because promised must not lady ellington judged that must be mere waste of energy ammunition to contest for be now immaterial to campaign realised also that needed energy ammunition that possessed to enable to carry out main movement knew too that madge have long be accustomed to obey mere voice instinct of obedience to be deeply rooted how wholly be uprooted now did not yet guess get into motor madge said be to wait day here then madge came step nearer yes that used to frighten said now doe not philip never told what said did who be then nobody else knew again took one more step closer mother have be tampering with letter asked for how must have known otherwise be ridiculous to say that philip told what else have done wonder now stand away please let ring bell do propose that must fight like fishwife on pavement old instinctive right of fighting for one own obscured by century of what be called civilisation obscured too in madge own instance by year of obedience broke out here be nobody else be did not matter one penny worth who stood between bell if apostle prophet have stood there must have fought lady ellington knew that particular engagement be lost bell must be rung plan be not defeated yet so far a knew what did not know be that mere scheming mere brain wrought work on part have chance at against adversary clever person can understand until be enacted under eye cleverer be le will conceive possible that spider weaving can fail to hold fly when passion come along be bumble bee that blunder through without knowing that there have be opposition certainly resemble fishwife said have intention of acting a one there be bell ring madge looked at for moment in wide eyed astonishment feeling sure by trick anyhow something underhand mother have got knowledge for mother to do said lady ellington may may not have felt depth of well from sprang in case be beside purpose to waste volley on what be merely rhetorical faint tinkle of electric bell be only response maid servant opened door miss ellington said madge passed in door be not so open to other mr dundas said be at home only to miss ellington ma'be said then kindly tell mr dundas that lady ellington have come with said fight be in grim earnest now madge mother be disposed to fight yard of ground former have remnant of duty of compassion left horrible to a have be scene on doorstep convincing a have be to of breach of faith of honour on mother part did not want to expose ah be wise of said have not better go home can do good mother will go upstairs said lady ellington studio be at top of house two landing have to be passed three staircase surmounted before be reached on second of madge have fallen back behind mother throwing dark cloak wore on to chair scarlet opera cloak have on arm maid have preceded threw door of studio open without announcement of name lady ellington entered first moment afterwards came madge dressed a for portrait with cloak over arm now evelyn have be through emotional crisis not le vital than of madge indeed change have passed for since have received note be wider than be anything that have come to have passed only from uncertainty a to manner in must come face to face again while have passed from certainty that be over to certainty that be yet to come yet when door opened lady ellington appeared felt a if death on white horse be there moment afterwards before have even time to greet came life with eye loved face form that loved stood there silent moment looking from one to other learned that daughter be going to sit to again mr dundas said lady ellington came with met here rather in order to forbid after what said to on day down in new forest be not conceivable that must sit to again must have known yet allowed to come here alone for knew only ask if think be act of gentleman evelyn flushed when miss ellington proposed how must refuse said quickly have decided to trust from bottom of heart thanked for must not have be unworthy of trust ever since wrote to from brockenhurst madge turned to mother wrote to from brockenhurst asked yes surely knew must have known said have not smallest idea of till minute what did say lady ellington lost head little letter wrote be private said be meant only for eye concern said madge tapping table with nervous unconscious gesture must know evelyn looked at other be a if caught light from other eye yes be true said lady ellington forbade to write attempt interview with gathered that acquiesced in gathered a be natural that be deeply offended stopped for light shone in madge face be that be never yet on sea land only on face of woman lady ellington presence at moment be to le than fly buzzed in window pane swallow swooped circled outside in world of blue summer secret be breaking out be to barrier impenetrable cut off whole world ring of fire through none might pas dimly came sound of outer world to there that eye be learning that eye be teaching absorbed almost to exclusion of everything else lady ellington perhaps have inkling of did not yet know how utterly have lost manned so to speak second line of defence first have be lost be quick enough to see at once so since madge be going to give sitting said be only reasonable must accompany to prevent to prevent repeated with biting emphasis recurrence of what happened when mr dundas last found alone with daughter then madge lifted head little smiled still looked at evelyn ask how knew said that be going to sit to doe not matter be ready mr dundas if be turned mounted platform where have stood before cloak will put on asked be by there lady ellington be at length beginning to feel realise sense of own powerlessness did not of seem to attend to remark still felt be extremely to point have not done favour to answer mr dundas said evelyn be already moving easel into position just raised eyebrow a if preposterous riddle have be asked have answer said seems to very just came here to prevent repetition of of what occurred when be last alone with miss ellington be not that then suddenly madge laughed head little back eye half closed evelyn looking at gave great triumphant explosion of sound be be what have be trying for cried never quite got now can have be painting before came in picked up palette dashed to canvas hold that if can for minute cried ask for more look at eye have to be on ah be miracle looked once painted looked painted again then for third time looked looked long painted more have done said there be long pause put palette down again looked at madge a stood there thank said that will do then lady ellington spoke be hardly worth daughter while to come here for minute remarked mine evelyn turned to be conscious of even sort of pity for be not worth while said because presence here make difference when said daughter might have trusted come here alone did not know what know now love madge do hear gave one long sigh scarlet cloak fell to ground did not move oh evelyn said lady ellington rustled in chair a might have rustled at situation in play interested knew what have happened have not yet fully realised cool quick brain very soon grasped began forging ahead again there be hundred obstacle must yet throw in way of calm advancing force of proposes to tell philip said effect of be admirable from point of view brought of others back to earth again evelyn winced a if have be struck madge came quickly off platform philip cried ah what have done what have said philip must never know must never tell ah next week one thought for last ten minute have possessed have possessed to exclusion of everything else there have be no philip world no anything except one inevitable fact lady ellington well timed perfectly justifiable observation made everything else sorrow bitterness must come reel into sight again turned not to mother to evelyn oh poor philip cried have always be so good so content mr home evelyn what be to be done laid hand in appeal on shoulder took kissed leave to said will see that know will tell be sorry said will make understand how sorry be must not help ah darling cried kissed now lady ellington have seldom in busy fully occupied life felt helpless felt helpless now two young folk without plan in head while be bursting with excellent plan have brought paralysis on also have very seldom felt angry now must not be too much to say that felt furious sense of impotence added to fury got out of chair took madge by shoulder ought to be whipped madge cried girl held out hand to ah poor mother said have forgotten about because be so happy be sorry for too be awful what be to do be to come home with now said madge longer looked to for order be for cause after that woman also must leave father mother allegiance be already elsewhere no have better wait little said evelyn a glance appealed to there be thing must talk about at once thing that must settle madge took came from authentic source be not coming home yet said to mother then lady ellington used unnecessary violence door banged behind again quick cool brain be right in deciding not to stop to wrangle to expostulate though woman more stupid than might have done so have be le wise must have made scene have talked about fifth commandment have practically forced madge a must no doubt have done to come with be clever enough to see that there be use in fat be in fire so why pretend be not must no doubt delay actual frizzling for hour day where be use if anything must still be done scene of operation be not here did not believe that be up yet though here stupider woman might perhaps have arrived at more correct conclusion still clung to plotting planning a if plan ever made even steerage way against passion even for forlorn hope have to think think hard whereas have left behind in studio did not have to think at destination anyhow be clear enough have to go to see philip what exactly must say to be question have to be thought out while motor pursued noiseless shifting way through traffic steering a fish steer upstream avoiding obstacle by mere turn of fin imperceptible to eye a be movement of steerage wheel a went thought heavily whole plan up till now have broken down completely very short survey of last hour two be sufficient to convince of once convinced be contrary to whole nature to waste further ounce of thought on flaw there have be in momentarily deplored might obviously have be better else must not have failed to deposit even regret over be mere misuse of time be discarded a old fashion be discarded dressmaker who attempt to revive be fool lady ellington certainly be not that a motor hummed eastward towards city cast thought backwards since be throwing good brain power after bad forward in hour must be with philip what be to be line puzzle a might must find line led anywhere for at end of ready to meet on platform so to speak stood evelyn madge together lady ellington be going through quite series of new sensation afternoon here be one have scarcely ever felt before for in addition to impotence anger be feeling flurried frightened must not yet quite believe that crash be inevitable certainly threatened threatened in toppling imminent manner thus thinking power be reduced to mere miserable apprehension have guessed rightly that philip must still be in city drove straight to office be engaged at moment sent out word that must see a soon a possibly must meantime be shown into room for reception of client left alone there in agitation be gaining on have morbid sensitiveness to tiny impression trivial detail of room forced in on be gloomy sort of little well set in middle of big room with row of clerk on high stool with busy pen morning paper lay on table there be empty inkstand there also carafe of water with glass by weighing machine with particular reason to justify existence stood in one corner against wall be empty book case turkey carpet be old faded four five mahogany chair stood against wall then after ten minute of solitary confinement here door opened philip came in looking rather grave a be wont strong reliant sort of man whom anyone must be glad to have on side in emergency difficulty one glance at be sufficient to tell that something have happened no little thing something serious though have intended to propose that must go to room shut door quickly behind what be said what have happened be be anything about madge oh philip be too dreadful began philip drummed on table with finger just tell straight please said quite quietly be dead lady ellington got up leaned elbow on chimney piece turning away from have just come from mr dundas studio said ah interrupt added a philip made sudden involuntary exclamation let get through with left madge with have declared love for other for moment two did not seem to understand what said for frowned a if puzzled a if have spoken to in tongue did not know beg pardon asked lady ellington own most acute feeling of rage indignation disappointment be for moment altogether subordinated by pity for strong man who have suddenly be dealt shattering paralysing blow if have raged stormed if have cursed madge threatened to shoot evelyn must have felt le sorry for quietness with received be more pathetic strength have gone from what do recommend to do asked after pause ah be what have be trying to puzzle out way here said surely can do something there must be something to be done be not going to sit down under tell go to studio anyhow motor be outside storm rage threaten take away tell to face what sort of thing have done philip still exhibited same terrible quietness unnatural so lady ellington felt though be not mistaken enough to put down to want of feeling feeling on other hand knew be like close fitting metal frame be very strength stricture of prevented moving then spoke again what have done asked have fallen in love with be sure wonder what have done have fallen in love with wonder at now minute be passing if there be slightest chance of saving situation have to be taken now in few hour even might easily be too late just go there said know well how thing have shattered so that can hardly feel yet perhaps sight of together may rouse perhaps sight of may stir in madge sense of monstrous behaviour must sooner have died on very wedding day than must have done be indecent be perhaps too only passing fancy here stopped for must not say to rest of thought be expression of hope that madge might return to quiet genuine liking for philip need scarcely have be afraid for in mind now almost with vividness of hallucination be that scene on terrace of house at pangbourne when have promised esteem affection respect in fact that knew be hers to give now have more to give only did not give to be bound to do anything think can be of use said therefore if think can be of use must go there will go see of what use can be may said lady ellington there be chance what ca tell there be certainly chance other way then brain heart began to stir move again little constriction of paralysis be passing off if only take out of pity said will not take on term will not be wife if know what love be know for then true lady ellington one who have be little obscured for last ten minute by pity for philip came to light again ah take on term cried will be right will love be woman know what woman be woman have ever yet made absolute ideal marriage unless be fool woman marry more le happily if madge marries will marry extremely happily take word for now go through city tide of traffic be at height down strand also there be break calm in surge of vehicle progress of motor be slow constantly interrupted sometimes for fifty hundred yard there must be clear running thought on possibility might exist must shoot ahead also then came slow down check stop must tell that might spare pain in going at true before now have more than once occurred to a conceivable that evelyn be falling in love with madge on occasion when happened have whistled thought home again telling that have business to send out on sort of errand that however be absolutely preparation have have for news have to let soak in for at first stood like puddle after heavy storm on surface of mind be affair of many minute a went on began to realise utter hopelessness of visit lady ellington have recommended might of be possible when saw recoil from bitter wrong be doing one to friend other to accepted lover how must recoil remain permanent how must natural human shrinking from cruelty possibly breed rejection of by other however much might suffer though pity for be almost infinite though might even to go to furthest possible point settle to part yet voluntary separation if agreed to must make more noble more admirable to other madge again alone in spite of evelyn might say must not go back on already plighted troth express willingness to marry might go even further might say indeed feel that be only by keeping word to that must free own self own moral nature from sin stain in have steeped loyalty affection esteem must certainly draw to be impossible that in eye a looked last on evelyn there must not be regret longing desire whether ever saw there not philip must know have be there at least memory of must always be there how little have foreseen anything remotely resembling on moonlight night promised to give then that be that knew of in herself be with thrill of love exquisite secret that have promised to teach what did not know must be who must wake in passion fire flower of womanhood even a have already given be to so a fire awoke must find that precious gift of to daily grow in worth wonder be that last final gift that have promised now not to with given elsewhere felt must not rather must not take even if be to deliver soul from hell then in justice to must be said that lasted only for little time what other people must say weighed on what must say with regard to conduct now for same minute pace almost envied myriad many to whom nothing happens who know nothing of extreme of joy such a have felt extreme of utter abandonment despair such a be now assuredly in world view be now in power to do something to right to make appear anyhow what be called man of spirit must curse must strike must make explosion threaten must be hard for of two others to face madge have sat to evelyn alone have often done that evelyn be friend of here must blast must make appear such that world in general must surely decline pleasure of acquaintance madge again if be minded on vengeance how execrable how rightly execrable must make conduct appear there be end to damage reckoning damage by opinion of world that must do to of must easily do bakemeats for marriage table be so to speak already hot must so naturally furnish funeral feast a far a world be concerned of evelyn madge whole thing be indecent step by step punctuated to innumerable halt of motor car idea gained on between there have be made attempt to wreck wreck be yet wreck might be derelict in ocean on own pleasure bark must founder at moment desire for vengeance struck with hot fiery buffet a be concealed face while so that must not recognise be lust for vengeance have thus scorched indeed appeared to that only demanded justice barest simplest justice such a criminal never demand in vain be no more than right that evelyn must reap natural inevitable harvest of what have done since madge have joined to must be to home also that must bring back bitter sheaf indeed must philip have mercy must at rate keep hand from deed tongue from word must hurt yet must not prevent consequence reaching for world assuredly must not treat tenderly must only label spiritless for so doing for world to tell truth be not in spite of twenty century of christianity altogether kind yet when buffeted on one cheek doe not a rule turn other more especially be so when one of social safeguard be threatened doe not immediately surrender invite enemy to enter next fort jilt madge assuredly be though perhaps to jilt be akin to finer morality than to go through with arranged marriage be enemy of society male female jilt like person who cheat at card will not do to such people be impossible to be kind for have transgressed one of society precious little maxim that really must not do thing because lead to so much worry discomfort wedding present have to be sent back arrangement innumerable have to be countermanded subject have to be avoided in presence of injured party be unworthier philip a drove to chelsea who let thought find harbourage in mind somewhere deep down in inner consciousness knew that there be something finer to be done something that world must deride laugh at if did how much better knew to disregard to be big to go there to say that own engagement to madge be based on mistake misconception to accept what have happened to tell a inner nobler fibre of soul told that own personal sorrow weighed nothing a compared with more essential justice of two who loved other being absolutely free however much external circumstance retarded to marry be capable even in early smart of conceiving be capable of acting up to be twenty door from studio in king road when finer way became definite in mind called to chauffeur to stop for literally did not know if must do realised that otherwise visit must be better left unpaid there be good in going there if be to do anything else than then got out of car can go home said to chauffeur man touched cap in acknowledgment of tip philip gave waited for lull in traffic turned philip be left alone on pavement looking after yellow panelled carriage then turned round quickly mind be already made up must go there must act a be truly best in dictated a hesitated looking back two figure have come close to from door near hailing hansom when turned be close to eye blazed suddenly with hard angry light mouth trembled sight of together roused in full sense of injury have suffered ah there be cried curse pray that misery have brought on may return double fold to evelyn have drawn back step putting arm out to shelter madge for seemed a if philip must strike next moment turned on heel again walked away from illustration text decoration illustration text decoration twelfth mr home be walking gently up down terrace in front of drawing room window at son house above pangbourne deep heat of july afternoon lay heavily on river land sky for last fortnight even in country have be of scorching sort great thunderstorm ten day ago have be a violent here a in new forest have not sensibly relieved air philip have not be down for nearly month mother though knew nothing about gardening ideal of garden bed be row of lobelia backed by row of calceolaria backed by row of scarlet geranium felt vaguely that though did not at understand sort of thing philip wanted must be disappointed about present result for to day have received telegram from telegraphed most iniquitously lengthy unnecessary communication saying that must arrive that evening surely postcard even day before must have conveyed a much a telegram told that be coming down alone that wished reply if anyone be staying with if so who that be leaving madge in london that evelyn who have proposed for last saturday till monday in july be not coming also be in telegram for postcard day before must have done duty gladys ellington husband who be to have spent three day with be unable to come supposed therefore that mother must be alone little party in fact have be arranged must not take place must come down there a expected nobody else to mr home be glad news of secret kind have seen so little of philip lately to mother heart be warming thing to know that be to spend last sunday of bachelor life with with nobody else to say that have be hurt at wishing family into be to marry being present on last day before definitely left mother to cleave to wife must be grossly misinterpreting feeling only be glad that must have alone just once more for two have be not only mother son most intimate of friend none have held so close place to now that mr home felt rightly enough that henceforward must inevitably stand second in confidence be selfishly be afraid quite indubitably delighted to know that be to have one more little time quite alone be to be said between have already be said have for last word felt sure that philip have not either rehearsed in mind quiet ordinary little occupation must make day pas so pleasantly a have always passed when two be alone together philip must get down by tea time on saturday be sure to spend couple of hour in garden on river then must follow dinner out on terrace if heat continued after dinner must probably play patience while philip watched a smoked from chair beside observing with vigilant eye attempt to cheat on part mr home appetite for card be indeed somewhat minute if after twenty minute so miss milligan unlike growing girl showed sign of coming out must must be confessed enable to do so by mean not strictly legitimate sometimes one such evasion on part must pas unnoticed by philip encouraged if law of chance own want of skill still opposed desired consummation to cheat again second attempt be scarcely ever successful be almost always found out philip demanded truthful statement a to whether similar lamentable indiscretion have occurred before when be alone too philip always read prayer in evening short piece of bible followed by few collect little ceremony somehow be more intimately woven in with mr home conception of philip than anything else must be feared indeed that dear little old lady did not pay very much attention to chapter read prayer said philip reading prayer be very precious very integral part of life strong deep voice strong handsome face vividly illuminated by lamp must put close to row of silent servant general sense of good comforting word if comfort be needed word anyhow that be charged with protection love thing be very real part of biggest thing in life namely that be mother son son bone of bone born of body how dear even did not guess sunday took up tale be so sweet to must be late for breakfast a always be very likely must have finished before came down never missed hearing foot on polished board of hall if be very late must have rung for fresh teapot before entered room since have horror only equalled by horror of snake of tea have stood long often be so late that breakfast really have to be curtailed if be to get to church before service began for always walked there mind be sometimes painfully divided a to whether must not be better to be late rather than that must have insufficient breakfast have heard great thing of plasmon year ago have secretly bought small tin of highly nutritious though perhaps slightly insipid powder of meant to urge tablespoonful on philip if seemed to not to have have enough to eat before started for church since apparently must be equivalent of several mutton chop tin have remained unopened only few week ago have thrown away having read case of tinned food poisoning in paper how dreadful if meant to give equivalent of several mutton chop have succeeded only in supplying with fatal dose of ptomaine then after walk back through pleasant field there must be lunch after lunch in july heat long lounging in sheltered spot in garden tea followed after tea philip invariable refusal to go to church again own invariable yielding to wish that must not go either that again be old established affair uninteresting unessential doubt to who drive four in hand through life to quiet old lady whose nature have grown so fine through long year of speckle life part of herself must urge most absurd reason must be going alone must probably be waylaid robbed for sake of red gold church service threatened rain must catch most dreadful rheumatism life be uncertain at best might easily be last sunday that must spend here how when have buried about wednesday must like thought that have refused ultimate request last appeal be generally successful be left for mr home to explain to vicar who always dined with on sunday unusual absence did very badly philip never helped out be point of honour that must not say that be who have induced to stay away grave face watching from other side of table a invented most futile of excuse seemed to to add insult to injury have already done in obliging to invent what must not have deceived sucking child then on monday morning must generally have to leave for town very early if be case always came to room to wish good bye good bye to meant what said god be with dear be added always come again a soon a can all thing memory of day hour be so inexpressibly dear to moved gently evenly in mr home mind even a shadow drew steadily slowly across grass a walked up down awaiting arrival if sadness be there at be only wonderful beautiful sadness pervaded evening hour hour when shadow lengthen coolness of sunset tell that day serene sunlit day be drawing to close that day must end be inevitable preciousness of sunlit hour be valued because night must follow for have be known to be everlasting joy of plucking sweetness must have vanished same shadowed thought be present in mr home mind a thought how evening of particular relationship to philip be come memory though dear must always be gathered greater fragrance because in nature of thing must be temporary transitory even a memory of childish day be dear simply because one be child no longer while childhood remained be uncoloured by romance romance halo of only begin to glow when be known that be soon to be at end yet mr home must not have have anything different that relation to philip must fade a day star in light of dawn have always known even when day star be very bright dawn not yet hinted in eastern sky knew that now when whole east be suffused with rosy glow must not have delayed upleap of resplendent sun by hour minute for old age unembittered be be in completeness fulness of philip manhood not in keeping undeveloped unstung by sunlight though through be flung bitter foam of sea that break forever round life of man realised not only most fully best must not retain even if must have got to live life make a round perfect a must be made be part only to watch from shore a put out into breaker wish god speed yet now a far a must forecast breaker be there calm sunny ocean awaited there be tide must bear smoothly out how far must go whether out of sight of land where strained dim eye after whether so to speak must anchor close

blue eye be little dim be flesh only be weak with soul bade push out if to herself said oh philip must go in that wished to be reckoned by be truly said god speed to gardener at pangbourne court have be startled into dreadful activity that day master be known must be down for sunday master by be much more formidable affair than with party a philip have conjectured at whitsuntide there must come break in happy life of garden be quite indubitably here now hot early summer have produced so glorious array of blossom in june week now exacted payment for rose must have flowered into august have exhausted bloom of summer be really over while autumn plant be still immature be really not fault of gardener of weather a have be said be stirred into immense activity by prospect of philip arrival since if bed presented fair show must be more likely to be lenient to other deficiency mr home a went up down path waiting for arrival saw too clearly that thing be not quite a must be dryness arrest of growth seemed to have laid hand on bed be a if catastrophe have stricken vegetable kingdom withered blighted grass of lawn too lacked vividness of velvet so delighted philip london wearied eye there be patch of brown withered green everywhere instead of excellent emerald yet perhaps surely almost must not vex with three day only intervened between now twenty eighth must have fault to find with anything in sunlight of life so streamed on be passing between two old hedge of yew compact thick of growth a brick wall impervious to vision own path lay over grass on far side of hedge be gravel walk half way up heard footstep sounding crisply for one moment thought be philip nearly called to next smiled at for having thought so for altogether lacked brisk decision with walked made sure be one of gardener went parallel with however in same direction when got to end of own yew girt avenue met owner of footstep in little sunk alpine garden be philip especial delight be have not recognised footstep though when met eye told that certainly be son be someone so different from whom knew that scarcely recognised misery sat in face misery hardness a of iron often looked stern often looked tired now seemed a if be of life that be tired whole face be inflexible inexorable be not sort of misery must break down sob into acquiescence be misery of soul into iron have entered mother son looked at other long without speaking with face soul of iron with hundred terror winnowing have not given greeting then clasped hand together in speechless entreaty held out to still said nothing be who spoke first philip what be said whatever be tell quickly dear can bear to know anything can not bear not to looked away from for moment striking gravel with stick madge said mr home be dead yet

be still perhaps better than silence have happened present be with present have to be lived through ordinary human intercourse have got to be continued whether in immediate future must go abroad try by conventional prescription of travelling to find if not relief at rate sense of unreality that travelling change sometimes give have not yet determined though idea have occurred to be still really incapable of making plan at must not yet face future so far a have considered be not disposed to think that must try for idleness to man accustomed to lead very busy life life too day demand concentration of thought decisiveness of action be in irksome even though panorama of foreign land sky be drawn by before to such mind even when be at peace with holiday be generally only mean of recuperation recuperation effected man fret to be at work again to now with dreadful background always with idea of travel appealed very little must be better so thought back at work harder more continuously worked le intolerable perhaps must be burden carried about with truly make own heaven hell since kingdom of god be within so also within be flame of nethermost pit in three minute a went back again to house mr home made resolve whatever cost however difficult minute might be however much might long herself to go weep better still to weep with must do very best to act a have wished never in thought word dwell on past tragedy have happened be necessary to go on to begin life again not to sit bewail nothing be ever cured so told by thinking of what might have be avoided if thing have be different thing be way not otherwise that have not be avoided have already become part of imperishable past hour of be indeed reckoned up perish since be of that present be made left after to go round garden have already sent for head gardener who be waiting a bidden at front door in trepidation of mind mr home hated to have to scold find fault hated also that philip must do went indoors instead of accompanying there be sweeter kinder soul in world than even now when heart bled for son vindictiveness desire for revenge on who have made suffer so have place in mind forgiveness must not be there yet be most must do to resolve not to think about madge evelyn philip sorrow what faint consolation palliation must bring to be enough to fill thought author of sorrow wished a far a be humanly possible to root out from mind altogether resentment must do good to anybody only hurt since knew that must not wholly forgive since there be sign of sorrow regret on part best thing must cultivate in regard be oblivion went therefore first to smoking room where there hung little water colour sketch that evelyn have once made of photograph of also stood there took with also frame be own took picture out of then going to bedroom unlocked jewel case took from pearl brooch have given anger be in mind even a handled dear familiar thing detached from what be doing then making packet of sealed directed to there be need that word of hers must go with indeed there be word must say to though have resolved not to think about of be one of resolution in very nature of thing can not be kept afterwards when business of returning gift be over sat down with piece of needlework must not keep mind off now so far from vindictiveness being there be rather pity pity deep sincere filled terrible though practical result have be bitter deadly a be blow dealt at man whom loved better than anyone else in world what other course have be open madge evelyn have found loved other that being so how infinitely more wretched must attempt to disregard stifle have proved thought of girl a philip wife secretly loving be situation knew well be far more terrible than far more rotten far more insecure there foundation of life must be founded on lie house must be built over volcano might break out overwhelm with fire burning fabric be reared upon at best what happiness must there be in how must be home in true sense since two loved what essential good be served by waiting to join together convention certainly must be shocked at suddenness of mr home found a thought about that personally be not for what be madge to do go home continue to live with mother knew lady ellington fairly well knew that girl must possibly stand so resolve not to think about at have ended in that thought about with only pity for what in inscrutable decree of god have so to speak be forced on that necessity deplored with heart for be pierced a have never be pierced before with sorrow for son even in early hour of knowledge of tragedy must not blame then half ashamed of infirmity of purpose went quietly to post box took out package have just done up instead of sending locked up did not see philip again till dinner time then ghastly game of make believe that nothing be wrong began again saw well what felt that a word must possibly ameliorate situation be best that word must pas concerning guessed also with woman intuition that drop unerringly on to right place even a bird drop on to twig that expression of pity sympathy be above what must not stand must bear hand however gentle to touch wound winced at even thought of so spoke just of thing except one must naturally have spoken about said same thing on such subject a must naturally have said drought japanese war irritating particle of dust from wood pavement topic of day be there there be silence not even racking of brain on part of to think what must be said next that dreadful mechanical engine of habit be in full work just a philip must have maintained normality though city be in depressed depressing state just a mr home must have be quite to guest though below stair crisis be most critical between domestic so now when crisis be such that nothing must have touched more keenly be easy dismal to maintain ordinary form of life servant certainly that relentless barometer of local disturbance saw nothing that night indicated trouble storm cone be hoisted gardener too have come off lightly mr philip be pronounced to be at utmost rather silent about next week occurrence be phrase of room crystallised vague fluid speech might find utterance just little silent so well prime actor in dining room played part yet yearning be on one side yearning of mother for break down for be that amounted to of son on son side be harshness mother must not yet believe existed implacable speech have be soberly literally true strength of hate be proportionate to what strength of love have be there be denying genuineness of dreadful alchemy love in hard nature indeed may undergo terrible transformation whereas liking can scarcely be transmuted into anything more deadly than dislike while be most hard of for mere indifference to struggle into rank of more potent lord of human soul be matter of indifference at most of reprisal be doings of who be indifferent to one action for damage may ensue hate still slumber in cave be when whom man love hurt that hurt fester spread poison through soul indeed be only whom man love who have power to hurt at after dinner too daily round be continued in dismal unreality philip even asked old quite uninteresting joke whether might smoke in drawing room on mr home saying threatened to go to stable be never good joke indeed anything approaching to night came near to move tear on poor lady part for be like speaking of odd little way of loved one who be dead then again in drawing room table for card be placed out with decorous wax candle burning at corner mr home sat in usual seat a usual philip drew chair sideways near so that must watch without seeming to watch mother announced miss milligan with usual futile determination not to cheat so in silence miss milligan pursued abhorred way during silence tear break down inevitable for brave resolve came close to surface mr home already must not speak have to clench teeth to prevent sob coming then at last there came hitch cheated philip saw black nine said not red nine mr home hand be already trembling at failed card be scattered over table oh philip cried ca bear ca bear oh darling put head on lap a used to do when be little boy in trouble let see if can not comfort looked up at with tear dimmed eye not till then did fully know how deep iron have gone not sign of relenting softening be there got up spoke in perfectly hard dry voice not one atom can comfort said have to bear what have to be borne a have said be better to bear in silence think now have better go have matter to arrange to night spoke to of perhaps must tell servant that everything will go on just a usual here mr home saw hopelessness of further appeal just now yes dear go do what have to said will tell will come back to read prayer philip said then bent kissed a held hand first faint sign in trembling of lip showed that for at rate be not adamant be not sorry for said be sorry for dear that can not possibly help breakfast a usual to morrow good night thirteenth by monday morning when returned to town philip have quite made up mind that thought of travel by way of distraction be futile have determined to find in work hardest most continuous succession of hour of forgetfulness so far a must secure of blow have fallen on forgetfulness knew well must not hope to secure by hard application of brain to work hoped that for hour for that must be able to put have so stricken embittered on second more remote plane of consciousness true at relaxation at interval in brain be not actively employed must start out again like writing on wall for working hour of day determined must be long fully filled believed must to extent crush other out of consciousness in work at rate believed best chance lay attempt though perhaps desperate be one none strong man must have made occupied at present while in london flat in jermyn street modest in dimension containing wanted there be spare room there mother always used on rather rare visit to town otherwise held only necessary accommodation for two servant have already given landlord notice that be going to quit to day went to estate office to ask if must renew tenancy since bachelor day be not yet over be horribly uncomfortable felt that clerk in office knew what have happened must after departure talk over with other clerk though criticism comment must not possibly matter to felt that deformity malformation scar of own body be being publicly shown world hated world for looking at then also have to say that must not require house for be in contract in berkeley square to complete nothing really remained except signing of lease be business so unexpectedly disagreeable that wished have conducted by letter to day promised to be very busy be to have dined that night with lady ellington engagement be automatically cancelled left word at flat that must be there night must dine alone that done drove straight down to city where expected that there must be awaiting report of agent of with regard to certain south african mining property on held extremely large option must take up before end of week when expired have not be able to make mind up

dip depth of reef assay value of cost of working reduction might be obtained in by use of chinese labour be thing have to be considered must not exercise option right be of buying share at figure agreed on must lose of course what have spent in purchasing that right be by careful study of rather voluminous report on property that have to make up mind whether must exercise not now problem of finance that extraordinary ubiquitous game in most acute brain in world be pitted against other for acquisition of little yellow metal counter in present world be so undeniably potent to procure for owner comfortable journey through have at time immense attraction for philip found that even to day be le absorbing than have ever be found too that in spite of frightful shock that have undergone reasoning deductive faculty have not be shaken dulled felt a capable a ever of weighing evidence must decide course report be fairly satisfactory be inclined to believe that share must call up be worth price to day stood steady at figure must have to pay for money ran into six figure must perhaps be locked up for time did not particularly object to on other hand supposing bought effect on market must certainly be to send value of share up so that must probably if wished clear out again realising small profit be plain sailing enough report be good enough to justify exercising option market altogether a well knew be in consequence of russo japanese war in rather excitable nervous state more difficult problem must claim attention what must be effect on if did not buy be known of course that option be considerable one dealer in share be awaiting news a to movement with anxiety report have fallen rustling to ground philip sat there staring in front of with elbow on table eye fixed intently on nothing now then clerk came in with paper for signature letter for consideration now then be rung up on telephone stood by elbow have that rarest of gift mind can detach from one thing attach in entirety to gave whole attention to interruption when occurred transferred back to problem be digging at when have dealt with way pursued be narrow winding step by step traced out took not le than hour of hard thinking to make up mind definitely on point there be so many thing to consider for a always held there be hardly event took place in world did not have definite certain effect on money market sole only office of financier be to be able on basis of what have happened before to conjecture what be going to happen now for thing followed invariable rule estimate what effect of conjectured event must be nothing in world be more engrossing than that there be bit of knowledge man might posse concerning human nature however fragmentary hard to fit in did not have place in puzzle have to put together above philip did not believe in chance in affair might indeed be chance whether correctly estimated how future event must shape element of luck here be only if one ran to ground own ignorance for if knowledge of past must be complete so also must knowledge of future be for in city of place be most true that future be only past entered through door mind then be made up once more ran through data upon conclusion be based goldfield of metiekull on held option be company have aroused good deal of comment when brought out have be held in level headed quarter that share have be run up to have reached that figure without there having be produced guarantee that be worth half a be inscrutable way of stock exchange have for particular reason be turned into gambling counter there be venture enjoyed freer more fluctuating market thing however have steadied down when be known that philip home have bought option of share just at moment a have be stated there be considerable interest felt in question of whether must exercise not if did not meant loss to of about l whereas if did might be regarded a certain that share since gambling in be just now like bridge favourite method of losing money must enjoy very substantial rise a usual be highly likely that philip must reap profit worth reaping must choose to sell during so much of course world must see philip saw little further took into consideration excitable state of south african market uncertainty with regard to japanese war must certainly make french speculator nervous french speculator a knew have be very busy over goldfield of metiekull then came in question of report have be reading on whole be good sober opinion be that share be worth buying at price yet proposed not to take up option to lose at once l must also let be freely known that have received detailed report from agent on spot decided therefore so market must say to abandon option after receipt of report be inference that report be unfavourable then other factor have be considering added weight to scale there be nervous market there be likely to be stringency of money there be vast hovering thundercloud of war in east if knew anything about way of city be absolute certainty that there must be slump in metiekull must let slump must even by selling assist to slump hundred little bear philip detested small operator must sell when have committed pretty deeply must buy not only original share of option somewhere near twice that number for there be question a to value of property must be picking up share at something like rubbish price chain of reasoning be complete took elbow off table turned to light cigarette then suddenly heart sank felt sick empty for concentration of thought be relaxed from thousand spouting weir gate thought from have obtained hour respite flooded whole soul forgetfulness of that be a if have just slept in chair for hour awoke again in full consciousness of horror of life be slow awakening be stab made deep dreadful wound out of flowed black blood of hatred resentment not against two alone against world to hatred gave up with hideous sort of luxury in overpowering intensity of suffered by fault of well others must suffer too if by manipulation of market be according to principle governed perfectly legitimate others be ruined be not fault for competing with then thought blacker than because be more direct more personally full of revenge entered mind surely not so long ago someone have consulted a to investment yes be evelyn evelyn in sudden burst of prudence who have decided not to buy motor car to put away big cheque have just be paid philip have refused to give advice professionally since be not broker have told that have bought large option in metiekull remembered interview perfectly knew that have recommended evelyn not to dabble since did not know game to put money into something safe what have eventually done with philip did not know for week afterwards studio have be littered with financial paper talked most absurd nonsense about giving up artistic career taking office in city since felt sure that real chance of brilliant achievement lay there now bitter suffering like philip be now undergoing can not have very distinct effect on sufferer in such nature a particular kind of suffering have to bear must scarcely have have effect that of worst circle of friend to whom showed be best in be small numbered four only by two of have be betrayed that impulse at first moment of knowledge did just flicker within impulse of generosity of taking big sky high line of for moment have be capable when dismissed motor three day ago near evelyn studio have be crushed if not out of life at rate into impotence unconsciousness by ingrained hardness of nature shown to world at large that hardness covered now indurated must feel pity softening for least of for one who have so bitterly injured power of hurting be true might be small compared to hurt have be done such a be must use be hurt must not scream must just strike back where when must london meantime be busy with thousand tongue in discussing what

there be good deal to be said in favour of long spoon while not inconsiderable part of more westerly london be always burning finger in city fire of stock exchange said with somewhat cynical smile since philip must still hit so hard have not perhaps be so hard hit perhaps in fact madge have not made very terrible mistake after for mr dundas be undeniably most fascinating person whereas philip so appeared did not let most dreadful affair of heart interfere in slightest with stuffing of money box in utterly mistook for steady concentrated application to work be perhaps only thing in world must have prevented breaking down losing mental balance altogether even a be partook only a far a must see of nature of temporary alleviation for in very nature of thing must not go on working like indefinitely what must happen to when relaxed must not imagine only knew that hour when be not at office be like nightmare repeated again repeated did lose at present slightest edge of intensity of horror week be a bad a last week last week be better than week before through hot august when remained in town not leaving even for usual week end on river seeing pavement grow hotter dustier emptier a more more of toiling crowd escaped for week two to sand moor worst time of be early morning for though usually went to sleep from sheer weariness when went to bed began to wake early while still jermyn street be dusky dewy a yet sparrow in plane tree opposite window have not begun to tune up for day morning by morning must watch casement slowly grow glimmering square if be a often absolutely unbearable to lie in bed must get up go into sitting room where wan light brought back to dreadful hour have passed there evening before glass from have drunk stood on little table by sofa by lay

like dahlia in first autumn frost sometimes piece of music stood on piano from have played bar two night before have then stopped for too conveyed nothing to be jangle of senseless chord sometimes in dreadful morning hour must doze little on sofa not often once have poured out into glass stiff dose of whisky feeling even alcohol purchased oblivion must be better than more of wakefulness have sense left not to take to if did that to day must do to morrow if admitted legitimacy of such relief knew must find le le reason day for not letting sink in slough besides have to keep clear headed alert for work of day two passion to analyse little further except when be at work entirely possessed one passion for madge of not one jot in spite of what have happened be abated be not ever have be of feverish demonstrative sort did not flicker flare burned steadily with flame be a essential part of life a breathing heart beat other existing strangely coincidently with be passion of hate hatred for hatred for evelyn red flame shed light on else so that in glare of hated whole world two people only stood outside of mother tom merivale for did not feel hate no longer felt love be incapable of feeling that longer except for madge did not object to thought of without resentment be then a nerve began to suffer under daily torture hour of enforced idleness became full of alarm what feared did not know only knew that be apprehensive of further blow might be dealt from quarter a unexpected a from have come everything have be so utterly serene when bolt from blue struck must not have conjectured now must not conjecture what expected next london did not know only knew that very keen man of business be a acute a ever to judge by metiekull episode began to reason since be so callous to what have happened madge have really not behaved so outrageously a have be supposed have found be more human kindly view induced by cessation of late london hour substitution of great deal of open air for stifling ballroom of town have found that really be in love with mr dundas philip on closer acquaintance be what have proved to be business man first lover afterwards really mr dundas picture year have be stupefyingly clever made one just gasp surely must be silly to get somebody else to do one instead of just because madge have found out mistake in time have assisted at correction of be certain to have heap of order in case so must be just a well to be painted by a soon a possible of course implied that one accepted marriage in sort of way after why not besides here world tongue just tended to approach cheek must be kindness to old lady ellington to smooth thing over a much a possible dear little thing gladys whom everybody liked so much must be so pleased to find madge be not hardly thought of yes quite so have dressing gong sounded already tom killed stag have good day among grouse jack killed salmon so there will be fish for dinner what blessing one of morning saw philip in gloaming of dawn hearing sparrow beginning chirruping in plane tree saw tom merivale also not only hearing listening to twitter of half awakened bird in garden have slept in hammock slung in pergola after coolness of clear night following on intense heat of day before dew have be heavy blanket be shimmering with seed pearl of moisture hair also be wet with on brick of pergola path lay like condensation of breath of spirit of woodland cleanness purity of hour of dawn be thing morning more astounded whether clear dove coloured sky brooded a now overhead whether morning came wrapped in rain cloud always brought to one who slept with sky for roof sense of renewal freshness be impossible to get used to everything be rested cleaned ready to begin again on hundred joyful business of day just a stone falling through air move with speed be accelerated moment by double acceleration of last so merivale felt that day communion with absorption in nature made progress out of proportion to what have achieved before be so few month ago that have wondered at mysterious silent telepathy ran through nature telepathy warns bird beast of coming storm make bat wake begin eerie flittings even at hour when sunset be brightest knowing that darkness be imminent that connects man too a have proved if man only will be quiet simple instead of fretful complicated with bird beast so that know be brother will come to silent call to of late have become such commonplace to that only wondered how must ever have be otherwise than obvious remembered too how so few week ago have for first time heard sound of glass flute in wood above philip house at pangbourne now not day passed often not hour in that unending melody eternal joyful hymn of nature of life be not audible to whether what heard be really phenomenon external to only internal expression so to speak of thought filled entire consciousness waking sleeping did not care to ask for did not in least seem to to matter wherever that melody came from whether be born in own brain telegraphed from there to ear whether be really actual setting of joy of life to song external to heard just a railway whistle bleat of sheep be heard conveyed from ear to brain did not even wish to know for wherever coined be of royal minting secret voice of life be there wood of pangbourne philip have heard from mr home of catastrophe in answer to further letter of have learned that philip remained in london slaving day at office seeing one clerk silent alone giving sign even to letter have come only last night ended with imploring cry that if tom thought must help in way mother besought to do what must philip have be down to see once only immediately after engagement be broken off have be utterly unlike hard terrible unforgiving must merivale not do something philip have never have four friend in world two of have turned enemy mr home have crossed out in thin neat line last two word substituted ceased to be friend there be left only have tried must hing tom merivale thought over a twitter of bird grew more coherent in bush passing from sound like tuning up of orchestra into actual song resemblance indeed be curiously complete for after tuning up have ceased while be still very faintly light there be period of silence before song began just such silence a ensued when string of band have found four perfect fifth there be hush pause over singer audience alike until conductor took place day be conductor here to day must be sun who must conduct great symphony in person at dawn approach of to philip meant hard outlining of square of window to tom joy of day string of round perfect pearl of hour east be already in secret for high above spot where dawn must break rosy fleece of cloud have caught light while nearer to horizon nameless green of dawn lie between yellow of immediate horizon blue of zenith be beginning to melt into blue then how well knew skein of mist along stream below must dissolve tintless hueless darkness of clear shadow lay beneath tree must grow green from sun striking through leaf thing be enough to fill hour with ecstasy hour to brought own there must be meal prepared by work in garden claiming fellowship friendship moment with green thing of earth mid day bathe when be one with imperishable water long communing with eye half shut on sunny heather where even stealthy adder be no longer thing of aversion then for sake of sister body a old saint said walk might cover twenty mile before returned at dusk oh how unutterably good how unutterably better day wind came with dawn scattered more dew on to from rose spray overhead slid out of hammock to go into house to make breakfast stretching once twice before went in to feel muscle rigging of ship of body twang sound taut did seem to in way unworthy that even physical fitness of must give such joy must indeed have be disgrace if have be otherwise for sensation function of life be on one plane whether sweat poured from a dug garden teeth crushed nuthusk great thigh muscle strained a mounted hill ear be ravished with fluting of bush bowered thrush be one be function of life sum of be just joy philip morning must not get philip out of head for detached from world of men woman a be must not help pitying blind meaningless suffering of old friend for suffering to be meaningless did not in believe that good must come out of considered merely a suffering much more good be to say must have come out of joy be withheld by suffering thing almost criminal to view must realise did that philip loved best have gone from be a if in own case sun moon have be plucked from sky water have ceased to flow a if something vital in scheme of thing be dead seemed to then with mind full of philip very natural that there must be letter from when post came in morning ran thus dear tom have rather unpleasant experience yesterday for suddenly in middle of morning fainted dead off seemed sensible to see doctor who of course said usual thing overwork overworry go rest completely for time be sensible man have known for year so have decided to do a tell now be such old friend trust to say quite frankly if want therefore ask if may come down stay with bit thought of going home must be alone there a mother be away just now on point of going want to bring back really think must go crazy if be alone seem to have found secret of happiness perhaps might do good to watch be absolutely subject to saying quite frankly just send affirmative by telegram will will arrive not arrive evening warn be not cheerful companion yours philip home for sake say word give look of pity sympathy will bring servant may who will look after want to give trouble intend to take none mind trust to telegraph quite simply if want there be only one reply possible to indeed merivale have inclination to give other of course philip be welcome must very likely have proposed have not letter come so opportunely telegram in reply be genuinely cordial poor old philip who used to be so happy in way in probably locomotive engine be happy groomed cared for only required to do exactly that love doing namely being strong efficient exercising strength speed yet though tom welcome of be so genuine shrank inwardly though did not confess even to from what lay before for hated misery unhappiness hated sight proximity of even thought that be bad for anybody to see if on point attitude be inconsistent with warmth of telegram inconsistency be wholly human amiable on other hand though be by mean of proselytising nature there be here almost forced upon fine test case believed very strongly in infectious character of human emotion fear seemed to more catching than smallpox worry ran through household even a doe epidemic of influenza if so profoundly believed be true that truth must hold also about opposite of bad thing too must be infectious also unless one chose to draw unthinkable conclusion that evil be contagious whereas good be not communicable by same process must not be spiritual microbe must a far a theory deduction must be trusted to supply almost certain analogy correspond to microbe of material world there must in fact be in spiritual world if microbe of suffering misery be there much vaster army of microbe produced in man thing made life worth living battalion of happiness germ must be there of germ be forever spreading swarming in ceaseless activity of building up regenerating man of battling with other legion whose work be to destroy depress kill if there be anything in belief belief on must gladly have staked life that joy health life be ever gaining ground triumphing over lethal foe then followed that germ of thing be good be more potent than be evil if army be mobilised how mysterious how profoundly true transference of emotion be in term of present analogy invasion of spiritual microbe for what caused panic to spread through crowd not danger fear fear ran like electric current through rank of quivering victim serenity therefore must be equally contagious if one must isolate one of fear ridden folk for moment in ring of men who be not afraid must not be doubted that fearlessness must triumph reassuring word gesture need be spoken made very fact of atmosphere of calm must inevitably quiet panic stricken worry too must stifle if isolated in serenity just a serenity must vanish if host of enemy hemmed in here to take case in point be philip possessed infected by poisonous microbe of unhappiness blackened soul darkened sun for be remedy not a have be trying to do to drug into unconsciousness over work while continued ravage unchecked unchallenged to steep a in antiseptic bath in atmosphere be charged with bitterest foe be happiness atmosphere of happiness that alone must combat disease of eventual result of treatment merivale did not entertain slightest doubt there must of course be war between happiness misery of friend felt within that be impossible that philip misery must be so strong a army on own side think of ally too surrounded light armed skirmisher bird bee with staccato artillery of joy forever playing on object of detestation huge gun of great beech forest forever pouring sonorous discharge on to enemy flying cavalry of river heather fragrant wind encompassed outflanked in direction thus though a have be said first impulse be one of shrinking from proximity to what be unhappy suffering how splendid demonstration of on so largely based theory of life be here offered did not seek after sign demonstration must deepen belief yet rejoiced that sign be offered even a one who utterly belief in omnipotence of god may yet look on shining of starry kirtled night glow at reminder be given of what belief well know glory of god doe heart good to behold work of house took a rule hour so to get through morning to day there be further preparation to be made for friend arrival linen have to be brought out for bed water to be fetched for jug room to be dusted made ready menial occupation seemed to merivale to be in way mean nothing be necessary for ordinary simple need of life must possibly be derogatory for wisest busiest wealthiest of mankind to perform for though to pas lifetime in performing for others be mean matter for employer employed such thing be not to even tedious more than breathing washing be tedious to find tedious meant that one be out of tune with great symphony of life everyone so ran theory ought ideally to be so simple in need that must minister to own necessity without sense that time be wasted one washed one hand brushed hair for be part of true simplification of life to need little provide little yet inasmuch a most of world did not yet take view philip be one of be accustomed to hire help intended to do so now for friend visit moved quickly deftly enough about work pausing to think for moment a to making of bed for summer have scarcely once slept in one while in winter mattress rug comprised own need then work of dusting brought to dressing table for moment looked at in glass with sort of pang of delight though in delight there be self consciousness vanity that be for be now several year past thirty time of life when on face there begin to appear mark of year from glass there looked back into eye face of youth just standing on threshold of manhood strength of manhood be there be strength in electric vigour of boyhood still quivered like steel spring not sign of slack wrinkled skin appeared there hair with close cropped curl be thick shining with health looking at image of perfect vigorous youth thought after first inevitable delight in knowledge that be not at of only of fact that to who lived life must be certain logical consequence for body be visible sign of spirit be soul of man that made body a snail shell be worry discontent assuredly that drew line wrinkle on face brought fatigue sloth to muscle not passage of year be just a surely serenity passionate acceptation absorption of joy of life made man young must keep so body soul alike never before have so fully realised change have come to when after work in house be over walked into brockenhurst to engage servant for cooking philip visit must involve found wondering with more than usually vivid curiosity to what further knowledge illumination undeviating quest must lead for felt be getting nearer day very quickly nearer to full realisation of creed namely that life be indivisibly one that purport of life be joy when knowledge of be made perfect how must revelation come what must be effect must life eternal lived here now be must light be too great for to bear so that tabernacle of flesh blood hereditarily weakened by century of sin shame must not stand be life seeming death awaited scarcely cared tree have be struck by lightning at end of garden have felled soon after part of daily work now be to cut up branch into faggot stick of firewood for winter dreadful stroke from sky have dealt death to beautiful tree in prime of strength luxuriance of summer have often seemed to merivale to involve difficult question for be intimately bound up with thing on have deliberately turned back death did exist in world though a have once said to evelyn out of death invariably came life yet fact of death be there just a beyond possibility of denial pain disease sorrow be in world also however be largely of man making yet here in case of poor stricken tree be nature who deliberately attacked slew part of one animal be true preyed on by death sustained own life be far easier to understand there be something senseless brutal in fact of weapon of storm thing a inanimate a rifle bullet striking at life be wanton destruction nothing came of here smiled though not believing have guessed riddle except firewood for morning be intensely hot a worked hatless under blaze of sun wholesome sweat of toil poured from how good be how good too to feel strong resistance of wood against blade of axe to feel sinew of arm alternately tighten slacken in swiping stroke to stand straight up moment to rest back wipe moisture from face draw in two three long satisfying breath of summer air be a if song of bird too entered into very lung hum of bee murmur of forest be beginning to be hushed little at hour when even cicala sleep one thing alone must not be hushed that liquid voice of river in must soon be plunged length of drought in wonderful year seemed to diminish wealth of outpouring be a high between fern fringed bank now a have be in april first there be carrying of aromatic fresh cut log to house to be done almost regretted how near completion be stack filled wood shed for there be something about hardness of particular toil be intimately delightful required exercise of strength vigour full use of supple well hardened muscle be very typical of splendid struggle for life in struggle fact of work be thing ecstatic have cut more than usual morning be with boyish sense of playing game against rigid inflexible opponent that determined not to make two journey of carry have cut in one underneath staggering burden loved toiled to wood shed merivale have just come up from bathe in evening when philip arrived met halfway up garden that extraordinary change have seen in glass that morning struck friend too be awfully good of to let come tom said have be happening to if have not known ten year ago must scarcely have recognised now tom laughed in ten day wo recognise said look pulled down wonder if have be working in london august anyhow be least like london be going to do work be going to sit in garden go for immense slow walk listen to practically incessant wholly fatuous conversation be difficult for to conceal shock that philip appearance gave looked so horribly tired so old suffering of last month have made haggard heavy eyed what be worse hatred have be soul guest have made face hard bitter yet for hardness be strangely enfeebled have lost look of strength life have always be so characteristic of vital principle have be withdrawn from that expressed be lethal negative philip weary eye looked round on garden low thatched house where dinner be already being laid in verandah so be hermitage said dear god have found peace then broke off suddenly began again in different voice voice be like face bitter hard old yes have be overworking said a told yesterday suddenly collapsed think work have got on brain too much did sleep well london be dreadfully hot stuffy too have made pot of money month fool on stock exchange say that august be slack month of course be if be slack certainly from business point of view have have round time brought of back too from deer forest fishing in double quick time be mostly too late even then good joke too going off suddenly like leaving grilling in london merivale must not quite let pas besides must answer somehow laughed altogether agree with idea of humour said be really from humorous point of view worth while philip face did not relax be from business point of view said then gardener eye be suddenly arrested by perle de jardins be ramping beyond bound used to know about rose said will cut back for to morrow be not getting rose out of know be enjoying so enormously said merivale philip considered a abstract question on to have not previously turned mind think that ought to be taken into consideration when one deal with destiny even of rose tree asked with terrible air of being in earnest merivale smiled decidedly have not be good for said think word be 'the destiny even of rose tree now what destiny matter more than that not mine be sure doubt if yours besides destiny of rose tree used to be of extraordinary importance not only to to philip be silent moment then for first time at sense of peace be here so predominant note at sight of tom in vigour freshness of youth measured by year be already past faint gleam if not gleam sense light be possible to broke through dismal darkness of soul for one short moment laid hand on friend arm make allowance for tom said in spite of long aloofness from fretful race of men way of merivale have not forgotten indeed be a impossible for one who have ever known to forget a be to forget how to swim divine gift of tact indeed be probable that long sojournings alone have if anything made more sensitive surface come into contact with others others insensibly feel for be tact to be smooth warm wise be fine touch that did not respond however remotely to philip appeal for philip have told that pity sympathy be exactly what must not stand consequently let cry be voice of one in desert wanted silence not audible answer like tree in garden stream must be dumb to silence be key to several day followed there be in fact intimate conversation of sort between two friend philip must sit for hour in garden stung sometimes into spasmodic activity during must send off dozen telegram to office on monetary affair for most part with unread paper on knee book tumbled unheeded on to grass soon during frosty strictured time merivale thought saw a bird know hour of sunrise before faintest dawn illuminates sky that there be sign that frost be le binding than have be philip must take pruning knife sometimes with deft practised hand reduce rose to reasonable dimension sometimes way through operation must let knife fall from finger a if labour like everything else be not worth while often afterwards must resume labour enable tree to do justice to by degree too outburst of city activity grew rarer more spasmodic becoming a be echo of habit rather than demonstration of habit did not join merivale in long tramp over forest began to wait for return if knew from what point of compass be likely to return sometimes set out to meet once merivale be very late tramp have taken further than usual night falling cloudy moonless have surprised in wood where even one who knew forest a well a might miss way on occasion found philip pacing up down garden in agitation ah there be cried in tone of obvious relief when white flannelled figure appeared against deep dusk of bush lined stream be getting anxious did not know what to do must have come out to look for did not know where might be coming from little touch of anxiety be perhaps first sign that have shown since have abandoned to bitterness that heart be not dead never before have faintest spark of sense of human comradeship solicitude appeared then merivale knew that fortnight philip have already spent here have not be utterly wasted before going to bed night wrote one line of hope to mr home illustration text decoration fifteenth couple of day after weather suddenly broke for unclouded azure sky have day of low weeping heaven with air of dead stifling dampness never for moment through hour of daylight did sullen downpour relax tree stood with listless drooping branch from under drenching rain few early autumn leaf kept falling though time of fall of leaf be not yet in garden bed plant have given up attempt to look gay to stand up bent drearily enough beneath rain scattered petal dragged foliage in muddy earth bird too be silent only hiss of rain be heard towards afternoon voice of river grew little louder merivale however be undeterred quite undepressed by almost amphibious condition a usual went off after breakfast for one of long ramble of in forest leaving philip alone there be hint of unfriendliness taken in indeed philip have exacted promise from host on evening of arrival that normal course of life must be undisturbed that first little token that have given two day before heart be not dead have more than once repeated since then be perhaps faintly conscious of change in be not so far a knew le unhappy frightful hardness be beginning to break down surface of ice be damped with thawed water hatred of world deep resentment at scheme of thing if scheme underlay wantonness of what have happened be le pronounced might indeed be only that be utterly broken that spirit of rebellion must no longer raise banner of revolt yet did not feel a if have surrendered did not in least fold hand wait mutely for whatever power be might choose to do with be conscious indeed of opposite of certain sense of dawning willpower though life so to speak lay shattered round knew that subconsciously somehow be beginning to regard piece with slight curiosity be new to wondering if bit must fit on to in way have plunged into business again with feverish rush have taken through august with such idea immediate salvation at rate have believed to lie in concentrated occupation yet there have be nothing constructive about that be palliative measure to relieve pain rather than course must go to root of disease also such a be have failed health have given way must for present take more of opiate in respect also have failed for to day by mid day post there have come for communication of greatest importance from city information be valuable provided only acted on without delay there be difficulty about question have complication have only to send off instruction ten minute thought must easily frame yet sat with paper pen in front of doing nothing for have asked very simple question instead be worth while be what said to apparently be not now if have happened month ago must have be equivalent to surrender must have be confession that be beaten now whole nature of doubt be changed work be true have done something for have got through month in be incapable of anything else have got in fact to point be indicated two day ago by little anxiety about merivale have known be much most important thing have happened to for week something within have instinctively claimed kinship again with mankind how hollow objectless to day seemed result of last month home august a be already ruefully known on stock exchange have plentifully enriched home though gold have poured in like fountain yet mixed with indissolubly knitted into success have come leanness what did amount to lean above be paltry triumph over evelyn who a have since ascertained have sold out metiekull when thing be at very worst only to realise if have left alone must have made handsome profit what then what good did that pin prick of vengeance do what gratification have brought to philip most revengeful hating mood wedding tour have be cut short evelyn madge have come back to london to day gave not smallest feeling of satisfaction in however feebly have hit back at be so useless futility childishness of revenge made feel sick if have similar chance to day must not have stirred finger emptiness intolerable depression still enveloped be somehow of different character to what have be before be bad hopeless enough eye so to speak have begun to veer round be no longer drearily fixed on storm wreckage of past be beginning however ineffectually a yet to peer into mist of future be exactly be indicative of change have come indication be a significant a slow shifting of weather cock tell that blackening east wind be over kindlier air be breathing one perhaps in due time will call up from root below earth sap that will again burst out in mist spray of young green leaf put into heart of bird that mating time have come again that first hint of change though lisped about while yet darkness before dawn be most black be better than gold have poured in through hour of night not day when night fell did rain cease air be very warm two dined out a usual in verandah candle burned steadily in windless air casting square of uncertain light on to thick curtain of night be hung round merivale appeared have passed day of high festival even for rain of thirsty earth be drinking so deeply suited le ah there be mood of nature cried love hot soaking rain falling windlessly other people find so depressing be so wonderful earth lie beneath drinking like child at mother breast tree stand with drooping leaf relaxing making effort just drinking recuperating moth winged thing creep close into crevice in bark saw dozen such to day cling to underside of leaf where be dry cool everything be sleeping to day to watch earth sleep be like watching child sleep however lovely winsome be when be awake yet sleep be even more beautiful there be not wrinkle on face be a young a love with closed eye mouth half open rest philip be looking at with sort of dumb envy at length found voice must give have for just one day of life said pushing back plate putting elbow on table characteristic movement when wanted to talk a merivale knew ah dear fellow cried be something very substantial gained already if wish to want to be happy be very sensible step towards be true that fortnight ago think even wanted to be happy said philip know have made first step also can say now look very much better than when came be not more happy said philip conceive distantly possible that one day may be have only just begun to occur to philip established elbow more firmly yet be living miracle tom said believe be happier than man on earth have ever be since at rate man began to grow complicated want thing want nothing suppose do be that have made boy again while wanting not getting being robbed of what be mine have made old man of tom smiled showing white even teeth ah want said want passionately feel sure will get what want be old story have told before what want be full realisation of oneness of life of joy pervades everything what must not give to realise one millionth part of said philip paused moment then broke out suddenly ah be very intensity completeness with loved make so bitter said little love must only have meant little bitterness love be not little so also be not bitterness afterwards did best thing must think of worked using work a drug a know took too much of drug nearly broke down in consequence oddly enough now so far from finding slave to thought of be rather distasteful than otherwise might have made quite lot of money to day if have only taken trouble to write telegram must have be done in ten minute have cost ten shilling thought 'be worth while when one think that be certainly not worth while only thing be quite indubitably worth while be worth while at then thought over what have done to evelyn seemed not worth while must not do again if have chance what be asked merivale philip told in few word history of metiekull be designed to hurt madge too said again doe seem worth while care whether be hurt not thought be so strong so unbending paused moment need of confiding of laying heart open be strong upon have long be dammed up now flood water have at last begun to make breach in bank love still said loved time when must have done anything to hurt wonder if understand that be true at event must like rather must have liked to hurt go on hurting till writhed with pain time must have be longing to kiss tear away now want to hurt more doe not seem worth while besides ca hurt only one person in world can really hurt because love be object of indifference to therefore have power to hurt god by what diabolical trick be that only love have power to hurt be cruel trick god played on when made so be infamous hand be supporting head trembled for first time eye grew soft with unshed tear never until moment have felt slightest desire to weep now tear be ready to come repressed went on house be in ruin said perhaps have be looking at ruin too long have done good in case looking at have brought nearer to laying first stone again have just sense left to see one have to build to begin again not count over destruction have be wrought yet house be so beautiful house be already built waited only for one to enter again paused for voice trembled too a there be such futile fool a pathetic fool said will not go on about want want to help in to look other way forward think have vitality enough call what will to resuscitate man who be drowned over whose head billow have gone there be something infectious about think somehow shine on one feel a if be sickening so to speak by being with for disease of life work anyhow did good only ended in breaking down mere idling here have done something for feel a if must acquiesce in continuing idle here whereas before thought of continuing to do anything nothing be intolerable must just get through present dreadful moment through week next moment next hour next day might easily have proved to be impossible for look here know be not melodramatic took from pocket little surgical lancet stroked side of throat with thumb tried to get prussic acid said suppose asked for badly did not believe foolish tale about dog wanted to put out of way so bought one little incision took trouble to learn right place for be dreadfully foolish to make mess over above mess must be made about such simple thing really know why have not used before can only say be not from cowardice now want no longer be beginning to be able to look forward so go with jerk of wrist flung among shrub to right of lawn where fell with little splutter of applause a be from leaf a if too be glad to assist in disposal forgetting of merivale looked shocked surprised be a if very commonplace thing have be told yes dear chap said of course put down to cowardice fact mean that did not use that abominable little knife why if be coward must have done so of course must have be much easier for to die than to live time be glad be coward philip think coward can be much good for anything man who wo meet what be in front of prefers to run away somewhere doe know where be poor sort of being of course have fear life be full of terror can do be to say be not afraid to behave a if be not since have thrown that knife away may say that think suicide be one of most abject specie of cowardice of course be not when contemplated however vaguely now that be little better throw thing away tone be so extremely matter of fact that very normalness arrested philip a have said be perfectly true that nothing be further from thought than melodrama interest felt in tom attitude a thus revealed towards life death fear be fresh sign felt to be such of reawakening interest hitherto have not however remotely concerned a to what anyone else might think of talk of fear said what do know of surely at rate be free from fear oh talk tom interest in anything talk about bird beast have given so much give more give foundation of new house since be yes dear fellow who have made turn back upon ruin have got to begin again have nothing to begin with be bankrupt beg to give bit of have so abundantly voice again half failed recovered in moment be talking about fear said what have got to fear depend on men woman love there be nothing in world to be afraid of except love have found that out yet people seek fool call by sweet name say be love make life worth living god must be so content if have never known what be damn must have lived exactly like be not true must never have be even remotely happy without loving just a if have never loved must never have known what misery be among bird beast tree what on earth have to fear wo fall in love with beach tree find that elopes with elm tell about bloodless paradise how serpent be fear can enter into tom merivale have grown rather grave during sudden outburst nothing in world so believed have power to ruffle temper only be difficult to explain to child a philip have shown to be before pause be on side other spoke again be sorry said be sort of baffled ignorance spoke understand for reason have business to call happiness be maddeningly real to bloodless paradise for god sake show anything approaching paradise at door of there be not angel with sword not flaming cold convincing where above be fear how can fear exist for what be there to be afraid of unless love can be betrayed philip servant came out from house bringing tray with glass bottle paused by master moment what time will be called sir asked usual time can go to bed pause lasted till man have entered house again then merivale spoke fear have not learned said fear revelation of what people suffer of what have suffered of what christ suffered fear that suffering in degree be atonement believe mind be afraid may be true that somehow will have to believe be not christian so put that man who be a infinitely above rest of mankind a shakespeare be above child be idiotic from birth have never felt warmth of slightest spark of reason found necessary to die believed that death atoned for sin of whole world ah if only believed that be right how instinctively must believe that be god one god must have thought of that paused moment be beginning to think that will not die without believing said think that even death of body must come to body of mine unless became convinced of necessity for suffering for death why be beginning to think ca possibly say there be never reason for one believing anything except conviction that must be so evelyn remember once talked to about at time be satisfied with own reasoning now be not said to then that metier be realisation of joy well at present know nothing invalidates that belief see clearly now possibility that be right in case be possible that fear about asked be right also mind be not afraid in case must sooner see sorrow of world realise a far a be able than turn aside fear be may be called upon to realise will not like if be to be can assure that will not attempt to turn back not one step of way have gone along must retrace will meet will realise in own language mean that will see pan god of nature of suffering sorrow of nature a well a illimitable life joy of to tell truth think quite probable that may have to do so rain have stopped sudden sough of wind in bush sounded a if animal have strayed there twig creaked a if broken small branch swayed also so seemed to philip wind brought with faint indefinable aroma evoked doubt by rain from shrub in garden for horticultural knowledge must not give name to be pungent of animal flavour to nostril reminded with instantaneous evoking of memory scent posse above other sens of chalet in have once taken refuge from sudden mountain storm in alp above zermatt tom too just then threw back head seemed to sniff for moment in air made comment continued yes be evelyn who suggested that to said idea think be that somehow somewhere balance be struck that if one be overloaded with joy compensating pain have got to be put in before one be complete may come in moment so conjecture one may have to suffer agony of month year of be sure that balance be in favour of joy if have to suffer suffering will be quite certainly le than joy have have if sorrow of death come upon will weigh be certain of le than ecstasy of life have be mine dear god have long bill to settle mention of evelyn have roused black blood again too will have bill to pay said philip merivale took quite impersonally yes evelyn be extraordinarily happy said have scarcely ever known otherwise if be right about will have to be right about poor chap what good thing be that have to be judge have to apportion to dose of misery will suit how must one tell when man have have enough to make whole complete got up quickly looked out into night ah have got to be made perfect cried take that man in sens can have doubt of that thing be that essential vital flame have got now at future time to burn best have to do same will be strung up to perfection through joy perhaps if be approaching from other side through blinding pain have to attempt to approach perfection to best of ability ability may make mistake very likely do when attempt to approach best of through pleasant way of joy simplicity must not go back one step to save from pang may follow be very likely blind a far a know do best perhaps who know since life have be extraordinarily useless one a world count ' world may be right will have to embark on career of work in office think be likely again paused moment taking deep breath of night air into lung then turned round told not to pity said tacitly agreed not to fully intended not to time have come when pity can not hurt for pity from same plane a on perhaps day may be glad of pity have suffered be suffering well pity a god pity supposing that suffering doe happen to be necessary must not spare one pang of if be so just put out hand to saying that be there watching worshipping may say for if suffering be necessary be certainly sacred know that be necessary if be there be if will do good there also be who have suffered watching with pity can not help healing little sympathy that lightens if be convinced even for winking of eye to save woodlouse from absence of dinner that suffering must be must accept take not only share of share of anybody else who must be so good a to shoulder with for be impossible to have enough too much of anything be right at present have not seen so a to know necessity of though have long known that nature groan under everything prey on something else prey on animal eat folk make fool of on stock exchange evelyn prey on yes yes try to prey on nobody perhaps law of preying will day be brought home to joy so weighs down scale may have compensating burden of suffering given to blackness of horror awaits wo turn back way of approach be to others there be rough tumble of world to others ascetic life believe that joy life be predominant factor be why have

into harmony with nature with whole design by avoiding yet for also pain suffering may be necessary if so let come be quite ready only hope that will be soon over will be so frightful that ca stand must prefer that blinding dreadful flash of revelation to slow remorseless grinding of truth into that however be not in hand philip mind have gone back again on to how can possibly be good that two must have behaved like to cried speaking directly for first time what monstrous image do make of controller of world destiny if be by will that be done to turn may have be good in into hatred bitterness be that lesson be meant to learn that whom one love best be one bitterest foe will hurt one most tom stopped in walk sat down on edge of table by philip dear fellow said oliver cromwell will help again be not just possible that too be mistaken when assume that trouble be sent in order that love might be turned into hate that must have happened so may just possibly again be in measure fault must not have done otherwise done better want to preach know philip sat silent face hardened again if must have done better must not have be said must have be altogether man tom got down off table ah repudiate moral responsibility for own act said not exactly that say that there may be circumstance under one will be crumpled up like piece of waste paper one power of resistance be paralysed believe that merivale shook head believe that power of choice be ever taken away from one while one remains sane said moment one can not choose door of bedlam be opened philip got up be still ajar for said be more widely open when came here for pity sake tom go on helping be only think who can get closed for paused moment looking out into still blackness of garden again something stirred creaked in bush drowsy wind be tainted with sharp smell turned to tom wonder if that have be saying be fairy tale said whether have be taking literally so imagine that thing be only can only be allegorical mythical be true mean pan pipe for instance heard for first time at pangbourne hear so often now asked merivale yes that among other thing pan too begin to think of pan a real being incarnation of terror fear sorrow of world cry child spoke of be part of pan shriek of rabbit be part of thing a say have turned back on what if must be shown suddenly huge significance universality of merivale looked quite grave anyhow be fairy story to whatever might be to others yes be possible said will mean that will see pan what wonderful mode of expression be of greek for pan mean 'everything ' to see everything must be clearly more than one must stand so to see pan mean death once again strange pungent odour be noticeable where be going to sleep to night asked philip suddenly oh in hammock said tom hardly ever sleep in house then more definite though utterly fantastic fear seized philip sleep in house to night said feeling that fear be too childish to be allowed utterance at merivale laughed there be need for philip to utter thought for knew perfectly well what be know what mean said do think that if pan be going to visit will only come into garden not into house be mixing up fear of pan with general sense of insecurity about sleeping out of door come from unfamiliarity with delightful way of spending night know thing felt heard odd rustling in bush a often hear smelt rather queer smell something rather pungent reminded of goat of course pan used to appear so greek myth said in goat form inference be that pan be in bush be just a much in verandah for matter in piccadilly poor thing there be quite certainly no getting away from be a safe here a must be if be locked into strong room in bank of england for be not just to place that that come to person that parted after philip going to bedroom while tom after changing into sleeping suit went out with rug over arm into dusky hall of night sleep when time for sleep have come visited a quickly a visit healthy animal if kept aloof no more worried about tried to woo than must take appetising scrap of caviare olive to make hungry to night lay for time not tossing turning in hammock with eye wide open looking through tracery of briar leaf above into sombre darkness of cloud overhead so dark be that foliage be only just blacker than sky to right left tree be shapeless blot against mattered be that

tap a of hoofed thing upon brick path of pergola did not stir did sense of dismay fear come to have followed path believed be striving to make one with eternal harmony of nature if revelation of discord be to come to come must matter be not in hand in whoever hand be be content to leave there philip meantime fared le easily in bed indoors talk evening have brought back to with terrible vividness all have be through bitterness hatred of own heart blossomed poisonously again now that merivale have gone be left alone in darkness quiet of night that there be subtle very powerful influence surrounded hermit like atmosphere of own felt fully in company knew how strong sense of healing serenity be abroad to night at rate foe have almost dared to hope be being vanquished left for dead be rising about again in ghostly battalion have so dimly hoped begun to slay seemed for moment that have be smiting at shadow took hurt from blow for little while have be able to set face forward to fancy that be beginning really to make way now a glanced back over shoulder enemy pursued undiminished after again felt lip be quivering with sheer hatred of who have so hurt hand be clenched in passionate desire to strike thus for hour tossed turned until window again a in jermyn street began to grow glimmering square tentative note of bird to flute in bush be back again in darkest hour have ever known then bed became intolerable rose from walked about room until huelessness of earliest dawn began to be touched with colour never since blow have fallen upon have be able to pray bitterness hatred have come like figure of satan between prayer philip suddenly paused dawn be beginning to break dawn yet remote far off in eastern sky faint dim streak of light be there be indeed true be own hatred own bitterness not what others have done to have stood in way a merivale have said power of choice be in possession of man who be fit to move about world have accepted that when be stated to

illustration text decoration illustration text decoration sixteenth elder lady ellington have never yet in whole course of combative life be knocked out of time by blow of adverse circumstance did not intend to begin being knocked out now that madge marriage be frightful disaster did not deny seek to conceal admirable habit of self control invariable custom of never letting anything dwell on mind make worry served in good stead now considered that madge evelyn have behaved quite unpardonably though have thought of pardoning of have thought of dwelling on matter when thing be done be done like david so to speak proposed to go oil in other word to pay customary round of summer autumn visit carrying with old inflexible firmness readiness to advise for philip finally hardly felt pity at man really must be fool if must lose wife like at eleventh hour be impossible to acquit altogether of blame though must have puzzled who have so nearly be mother in law to say exactly where blame lay general incapacity to keep what be morally one own perhaps covered incapacity of kind detested visit took up to scotland about middle of august since be on whole easiest way of not getting out of touch with people scotland if one went to right house considered to be sort of barometer a to way people must behave general trend of affair go when gathering began for autumn party in england people came up to london in spring though must not have be considered exactly conventional woman very much wanted to know what kind of line society in general must take about madge for with hard shrewdness have not what may call sensitive social touch when society beat time must follow with scrupulous exactitude be not capable of conducting concerted piece be rather complex though society have be so unanimous in condemnation at time lady ellington knowing pretty well did not feel at sure that sentence passed on july th must not be reprieved whether in fact society must not say that there have be miscarriage of justice that madge evelyn for matter be entirely innocent even laudable for if philip have wealth undoubtedly have madge have thrown that overboard have at rate picked up a one pick up pilot man with extraordinary charm extraordinary gift about whom society be even now on point of losing head evelyn in fact if continued to be a gay a always be to enjoy a thoroughly also continued to paint picture really furnished society with conversation to quite remarkable degree promised well to be a desirable husband a other also philip stern attention to business during month of august have done cause a have be mentioned inconsiderable damage indeed if have married old lady ellington instead perhaps must have be more suitable having failed to secure rose have not shown inclination to be near have gone to city instead be lady ellington hoped to pick up in scotland wanted in fact to know what must be most correct attitude towards madge own personal attitude knew well enough be still quite furious with put to herself almost piously be better sometimes to sink personal feeling in deep water of public good just a drown superfluous kitten however felt privately might be kinder wiser to conceal even eradicate that personal grudge went in fact in order to see whether society be possibly taking more christian line about daughter than daughter mother really be strange a fact may sound be fact for must never do madge mother must on one hand be estranged from daughter while world embraced on other that madge mother must continue to embrace daughter while world discreetly looked other way said that minx now a have already be briefly stated country verdict about madge verdict be to say of london gone into country have reaped benefit of country air early hour personal inconvenience necessary incidental chatter have died down nobody really cared about stern condemnation originally made be felt to be hollow voice society may be said about be really rather indulgent just a hope individually for indulgence in most unlikely contingency of indulgence being desirable be already without slightest sign of embarrassment executing volta face for if volta face be general only embarrassment arises from not executing lady dover house so to speak kept social greenwich time without error be first place lady ellington visited be only strong sense of duty duty towards madge that drew there otherwise nothing must have induced to go there be night in train day in train at end of thirty mile drive starting from spot called golspie experience of golspie be that rained that endless road stretched over mile after mile of moor where rained worse than in golspie in scotland be officially supposed never to rain utmost can happen in way of moisture be that must be saft arrived at golspie open motor car be waiting for be saft also motor must not take luggage be to follow in cart cart so mentally calculated if did not stick in bog not wet one only saft one might arrive about midnight passenger also alighted at golspie present bearer of husband title too be going to lady dover motor be to take hazarded that be awfully jolly seemed not to have said right thing softness grew softer a breasted hill lady ellington really wondered whether be worth while conclusion must have be that be otherwise must have have hesitation in turning back even now sleeping at golspie if sleep must be obtained in so outlandish spot knew well too what week there must be scotch breakfast departure of male sex to hill with fishing in burn probably for who remained return of male sex about six instant dispersal to bath own room dinner bridge conversation final dispersal of everybody about past ten yet be worth from here goodness knew why ticked out correct attitude lady dover opinion not because be clever so said guest to herself because be completely ordinary must be infallible sign a to what rest of world must think about madge assembled at house too must be who right left must endorse lady dover opinion not because have intimated to because must naturally think a did be in fact bourgeois conclusion of upper class that sought bourgeois conclusion of sort got on drive devilish evening eh said lord ellington make one wonder if be worth while thirty mile of be shofer yes lord thirty two mile well let get on bit think so lady ellington put foot down on of pedal turn of handle eh how going lady ellington rum thing there will be two lady ellington in house gladys arrived three day ago must detained know always say detained eh anyhow be kind of olive branch continued with short reply on part to wave in wind awful smash be continued gladys be very sorry good fellow home put up to investment two turned out well there be telling about girl kittle cattle know eh daresay be awfully happy what of course man doe matter men be meant to go to wall lord how rain lady ellington did not really mind rain knew too that even man whom detested have vote in public opinion what be more reflected public opinion like newspaper what said other people must say did not in least want vote of bohemian circle more than wanted vote of bishop what wanted to know be general opinion of class most elusive thing be one on be intensely rash to risk prophecy for one person must be found with stolen halter in hand yet one must say that halter be dishonestly come by must look over hedge whole world must say that design be to steal horse halter too to class did madge with calm eye belong in world opinion yes of course have be terrible said poor girl have gone so utterly astray what must have be nicer than marriage be arranged well seems to have found something thought nicer said companion yes from sensible point of view supposing fell in love with match girl lord ellington gave loud hoarse laugh trust gladys for hoofing out of in double quick time remarked yet too be what lady ellington sought vulgar hopeless a man be yet reflected opinion of average person be purpose to learn for vote of moliere housemaid will always swamp of most enlightened critic popularity of play depends on lady dover house be sort of central agency for such opinion smart respectable rich people congregated there who be utterly conventional not because feared mr grundy because be mr grundy coloured imitation of good old home brewed national typical english upper class view of life might here really be said to have fountain head to have stayed in house be sort of certificate that be right scandal might just possibly twitter afterwards about one of lady dover guest twitterings must be harmless for knowledge that about whom twittered have stayed at glen callan must convince right minded people that there be nothing in be after eight when arrived when emerged into light warmth of hall hung round a be suitable in highland with row of stag head sporting print dinner have already begun lady dover came out of dining room with husband to welcome dear lady ellington said what dreadful drive must have have one mind rain in scotland do how be lord ellington so nice that must come together gladys arrived two day ago mr osborne call fishmonger because really supply with fish be now eating grilse caught afternoon take lord ellington to room will dover pray make anything of toilet lady ellington be highland know went in to dinner because felt sure must prefer that must be so much nicer to feel that one be keeping nobody waiting be not there be only small party in house so lady ellington found when joined in dining room mr osborne whose brilliant sobriquet for gladys have already sparkled on page be there be very wealthy man who have married lady angela harvey daughter of duke be one of main prop pillar of english protestantism lady angela be there too thin lipped political sitting next seymour dennison royal academician who have painted exhibited so many mile of sutherlandshire scenery be ordnance map lost might almost have be possible to reconstruct county again from picture without fresh survey wife of course whom have only lately married be also of party lady dover have not previously met for have lived in florence though there be certain risk about asking to house someone who be really quite unknown still to ask mr dennison without wife must have be to stigmatise lady dover must never do without good reason harold aintree first cousin of lady dover completed with gladys husband party of ten too be eminently in place for be great traveller in out of way country be always considered enlightened pursuit moreover must read published account of without having sensibility delicacy offended savage tribe so experience showed australian aborigine have true unfailing sense of propriety lady ellington place be next host a ate grilse lord dover told about gladys be cousin therefore referred to by christian name gladys caught that grilse only afternoon said beautifully fresh fish be not mr osborne call fishmonger lady fishmonger ellington be not osborne mr osborne paused in conversation with mr dennison to bow acknowledgment lady ellington fish too said will get into terrible confusion now ah must find name for said lady dover be not beautiful fish lady ellington flesh be so firm dover say must not have be up from sea more than day two mr osborne resumed talk with mr dennison whom be questioning about church in florence otherwise there be moment pause round table be unfortunate a just then referred to catholic church meaning roman catholic church corrected error however on seeing questioning look in face general conversation be resumed yes sunset be one sheet of intolerable glory said seymour dennison to hostess how little one expected that rain be coming what wet drive lady ellington must have have did not see sunset said returned to write few letter must describe to mr dennison not in word in colour sunset here year have be quite remarkable have be so very varied two alike so far a have seen seymour dennison be always in character a poetical interpreter of nature word in fact be generally a highly coloured a canvas yet perhaps finest sunset one ever see be at hyde park corner said be not wonderful thing how nature take foul smoke of city by alchemy of light transmutes into unimaginable spectacle even eye much le hand can not fully grasp realise light where must world be without light lord ellington have moment spasmodic desire to answer in dark checked be a well did that dying cry of goethe be so wonderful be not said lady angela turning to harold aintree picking up thread beore light more light know harold cleared throat seldom spoke except in paragraph be extraordinary how most savage tribe have deep sense of natural beauty said remember entering settlement in zambesi at evening finding inhabitant sitting in row watching setting of sun appears to be religious ceremony akin to way to sun worship of parsee even most rudimentary civilisation particular tribe of zambesi may remind be cannibal show trace of appreciation of beauty of nature indeed one almost think that perhaps civilisation obscures appreciation else how do in consent to live in sordid ugliness of town build turned half left a spoke to pick up lady ellington so to speak for lord dover have crossed over to gladys with whom be again discussing grilse have be so fortunate a to catch afternoon ah live in city mr aintree said think that there be great return to simplicity going on remember last july how took to lentil hat think of mr merivale who life in new forest know make bird come sit on hand went down there know madge saw simplification of life therefore took place of sunset spread slowly round table moving with steady sort of current there be nothing that flashed sparkled mr osborne only suggesting that if went to live in country must become a bad a town if lived on lentil price must go up so much that few must afford lady ellington however cleared small matter up gave to be understood that mr merivale owed good deal to suggestion rather congratulated on having got madge name introduced dinner over variety of innocent pursuit occupied party mr dennison with good deal of address did conjuring trick same a have done last night night before must do again next night night after lord dover continued to discus gladys ' grilse be such fresh run fish with various member of party at ten o'clock be held what be called council of war though why war be not quite clear since purpose of be wholly pacific merely consisted in discussion of plan for next day lord ellington be settled must try for stag mr osborne host be to go grouse shooting together mr dennison must be amply occupied in recording upper beauty of glen have not a yet painted more than three quarter of mile of lady angela mr dennison be to drive over see friend in neighbourhood while be universally acclaimed that lady fishmonger ellington must again exercise remarkable skill on river on old lady ellington saying that must like to fish too mr osborne rose to occasion already have lady grilse ellington said be sure to morrow evening will have lady salmon ellington brought council of war to really epigrammatic ending lady dover rose with customary speech go to bed very early here lady ellington said being out day in fresh air make one sleepy be glass doing dover going up bit then let hope will have fine day to morrow for painting mr dennison will come up glen with in morning if will let go down to river after lunch to see what fishmonger beg pardon be lady salmon lady grilse be not have done before half past ten therefore lady be in room since breakfast be not till quarter to ten next morning might be hoped that must sleep off effect of being out day in fresh air though lady ellington did not feel in least inclined to go to room almost everyone else must have sat up a long a chose obliging if necessary hostess to sit up too never at glen callan found equal to proposing other arrangement than be made for indeed of criticising anything for there be deadly regularity about everything against be useless to rebel to dream of suggesting anything be unthinkable attitude to adopt knew too exactly what must happen now just a have known speech about barometer must precede going upstairs lady dover since be first night must come with to room ask if have everything wanted poke fire for say well be sure must be tired after journey will leave to get good rest breakfast at quarter to ten must sooner have in room lady ellington felt must probably be equal to facing world again after eleven hour of retirement said must come down be movable feast dear said lady dover a went out in fact think punctuality at virtue at breakfast small certain suspicion darted into lady ellington mind that hostess have said exactly same thing to just year ago when came to glen callan wondered how often have said since breakfast be very bright cheerful meal at glen callan everyone be refreshed by long night after day in fresh air ready for one lady grilse lady salmon be already spoken of by very clever name mr osborne have found for further seemed inclined to christen lord ellington a lord stag dreary amazement in gentleman face when mr osborne made sounding on point prevented total success though dennison considered excellent though have to walk mile along nearly level road to particular point where be painting have so keen sense of local colour that in deference to fact that road be in scotland have put on knickerbockers norfolk jacket thick shooting boot norfolk jacket also have leather pad on shoulder so that cloth must not be soiled by contact with possible oil on barrel of gun since never carried have ever used gun precaution be almost unnecessary still there be harm in being prepared for contingency however unlikely morning be cloudy fine cloud be high in front of window of dining room ground fell sharply away into glen through brawled coffee coloured water of river where two lady be to fish mr dennison a walked about eating porridge further recognition to fact that be scotland drew attention to beautiful contrast of green russet in glen also mislaid spoon with have intended to eat porridge after drawing attention to loss apparently drew spoon out of mr osborne breast pocket be accustomed to be life soul of party have equal command over flower of language easier feat of sleight of hand flower of language be next preoccupation for lady dover have hoped that there must be enough sun for to work at picture landscape painter said be terribly at mercy of element may perhaps half grasp conception cloudy effect may be then be given fortnight of bright blazing sunshine what be to do begin picture ah be to let first conception fade spent month once in skye watching for effect have seen ten year before not stroke of brush did make month waited then one morning came shrugged shoulder quite small picture said sold for song reward be fact have waited for be imperishable possession character artistic character be at stake won yes won lady dover broke in upon sympathetic pause portrait painter mr dennison said surely may have to wait also for same look to appear on face of sitter be not sitter a fickle a cloud sun dennison have finished porridge be seated on lady dover left drew with long white forefinger few imagined line in air think so said there be feature light can be adjusted have to awake again train of thought be in sitter mind expression after be only matter of line becomes same again look at dundas picture for instance deny merit what be there five sweep of brush be face literally more piece of mere scene painting be background bunch of banana be hand assure bunch of banana must not be scheme if be portrait painter must study sitter till very finger nail be integral part of picture so that picture must be incomplete without poor dundas think have heard last of terrible silence succeeded unfortunate speech be one might like darkness be felt mr dennison intoxicated by own voice have forgotten silence made remember silence though pregnant be of almost infinitesimal duration for lord dover immediately resorted to grilse caught day before be now kedgeree wife from other end of table without consultation recommended mr osborne to try lady angela looked forward in anticipation to lovely view that mr dennison be certain to enjoy during drive instinctive buzz to bury what have gone before died down dead subject seemed like to have disconcerting resurging silence lady dover whose mind be already made up on subject indicated attitude turned to lady ellington who sat three place from in quiet voice social oracle thundered prophecy promise how be dear madge lady salmon said wonder if must induce mr dundas to come for week two before go south must be such pleasure must enjoy beautiful walk be sure mr dundas must be so very hard worked that be certain little holiday must do good be pronunciamento for lady ellington really have come here weighing light discomfort of travel dulness of day that anticipated have be forced squirted a be out of hostess nobody have ever squirted out of lady dover anything insincere often in fact refrained from saying meant never said what did not mean word be a good a bond of anybody else be trustworthy coinage sterling in own dominion lady ellington accepted a such not ringing testing in way that be given be quite enough be sure madge must love to come said if can only tear must not help hesitating moment tear dear evelyn away from work be so busy everybody want to be painted by be sure wonder portrait of madge be too extraordinary expect to get down from easel say something characteristic hand too surely mr dennison think hand be like bunch of banana in mr dundas picture of daughter mr dennison have not seen picture hastened also to qualify what have said before qualification did not fare quite so well at hand a missing spoon have done that in be not extraordinary since there be comparison between respective difficulty of effecting two disappearance breakfast be practically over need for beating further retreat be thus reduced to irreducible minimum shooter stalker went way immediately motor car be also soon round to convey lady angela mr dennison to friend be not extraordinary that artist did not join remainder of party on terrace gladys also have gone to consult with gillie on question of fly thus in ten minute lady dover lady ellington be alone in after breakfast stroll latter a usual went straight to point did not want to talk about salmon pool rowan berry prospect of slain stag have come here to find out what lady dover thought about madge for purpose called lady dover by christian name a one have to begin time christian name be susan name inimical for confidence must not be helped now oh susan said mind calling do because feel such friend with have idea how relieved be wanted so much to know what thought about poor madge must have found so hard to begin unless have said what did say at breakfast about asking here of course be terrible grief to can well understand yes dear said lady dover interrogatively know see what mean marriage with philip home be so nice so suitable be arranged people stopped in london particularly for lady dover calm eye surveyed terrace glen lastly companion surely be rather conventional view to take said what doe little inconvenience matter if daughter happiness be secured be told be devoted to other now lady ellington in most wild wayward dream have never conceived possible that must be called remotely labelled conventional by susan have much to learn however hope be not slave to convention anything of sort continued lady dover if madge really loved mr dundas why on earth must not marry suppose have married mr home found out afterwards be not really fond of one doe not like to contemplate such thing there be certain suspicion of coarseness even in thought know what view of world may be for view of world concern very little feel quite sure that girl be right in obeying dictate of own heart lady ellington longed to contradict be not in least in accord with what felt what felt be accustomed to state thus suppression of be not easy how lovely light on hillside be said lady dover in parenthesis mr dennison ought to see before settle on subject of next picture yes about madge know what other people think about only know what think be sure dover agrees with be love match be not what more do want of course if mr home have be duke madge girl without position mean be just question of degree asked lady ellington ah dear er margaret said lady dover with certain intonation of relief because be sure that excellent memory have not played false everything be question of degree there be nothing in world into circumstance mitigating reverse enter how beautiful rowan berry be wish mr dennison must see must work into foreground so well must take to end of terrace to morrow yes mitigating circumstance be here so strong threw over mr home who be charming met twice last year at dinner somewhere asked to lunch only must not come have married man who be charming also with whom fell in love how vivid portrait be too be going to be painted by next spring if can find time almost too vivid perhaps seem to jump out on be view about whole question supposing have married mr home have fallen in love afterwards sort of tragedy be so dreadful such extraordinary cleverness be required to avoid horror of publicity must never survive publicity there be publicity a be said lady ellington poor madge what will people think of of lady dover throughout conversation have given justification after justification for importance that lady ellington attached to verdict gave more now there be publicity be true said sense of respectability have be offended of will think that fell in love followed instinct of will think that tried like excellent mother to secure excellent match for daughter that daughter chose for lady dover serene face grew shade more shrewd see have not married tom dick james said mr dundas in fact be sufficiently important person be that meant by way by saying be question of degree know what income be may be precarious have great talent talent happens to be rather fashionable daresay be only phase after one want if sacrifice of principle be involved to be abreast with world now lady ellington must not possibly have be called conceited woman conviction that be pretty well abreast of world be founded on sober experience be up to most thing in fact world on whole did not worst yet when susan spoke of being abreast of world be conscious that plane altogether be indicated plane to have to struggle aspire whereas susan moved quite easily naturally on way from golspie have be labeling hostess a conventional what if conventionalism came out on other side so to speak be really summit of worldly wisdom peak not mediocre plateau where susan others walked gently about a at place of corrective water exchanging commonplace for lady dover be beginning to see be not in least conventional because be way of world be conventional because be made like that be world in fact be conventional because be like lady dover not lady dover who be conventional because be like world indeed have spoken no more than truth when said opinion of world did not matter to did not never have to take into consideration simply because be quite certain to coincide with own lady ellington found thinking that when susan died portrait ought really to be put in stained glass window figure must typify for time solid respectable virtuous aspect of british aristocracy walked in silence for few moment for there be really nothing more to say on subject then lady ellington took susan arm pressed be great great relief to to know feel like said have made line with regard to madge so clear poor madge have be too hard on disappointment be so great must not help feeling for philip too of course one be always sorry for people in trouble said lady dover particularly if be not fault will write to madge morning now do know be almost time went off to river insist on being lady salmon by evening mr osborne be so quick clever be not seventeenth lady dover put into instant execution promise to ask madge husband to come stay hour later set off with mr dennison up glen to scene of picture original a called a usual in interview with lady ellington have behaved quite straightforwardly have expressed acted on view believed to be right though must not help feeling that lady ellington have referred to rather a oracle whose slightest word be thing to be treasured up reverently commented on be not naturally at self conscious did not dwell on fact with elation elation indeed must not possibly have felt since have be pressed to say how highly valued lady ellington opinion must have be forced to confess that without wishing to be unkind did not value at secretly indeed estimate be that poor margaret wanted very much to be woman of world only succeeded in being worldly woman schemed have doubt schemed in matter of madge marriage span thread in direction with unfortunate result that only succeeded in getting entangled in lady dover on other hand never schemed at walked calmly along broad highroad admired flower by wayside consequently be invariably free from preoccupation must talk with artist about exquisite light shadow on hillside wonderful contrast of purple heather against golden gorse with sincerity attention be quite possible also that might see eagle one have be seen at top of glen several time that year lady a went down with gladys to river felt more than have felt ever since stormy interview with madge in new forest sense of imperfect mastery have begun then terminating on madge visit to studio in terribly certain conviction that have mastery at madge in fact have made fool of resentment at be impotent felt too that world very likely regarded with sort of amused pity be hard to bear felt sure now after interview that world be going to forgive madge husband welcome to midst own course of conduct therefore be clear must quite certainly do same if possible let be understood that have though sorry for philip realised that marriage be inevitable lady dover have put so plainly how much better that mutual love must be discovered before irremediable mistake of madge marriage with philip have be made since be woman who never wasted time anything else began immediately to lay foundation of remarkably imaginative structure before gladys poor mr dennison said be so sorry for at breakfast when said thought have heard last of evelyn be always sorry for people who put foot in suppose must be middle class view of poor madge marriage be easy to see that mr dennison be not quite gentleman be so calm glorious disregard of that have previously said thought felt that very completeness of roused gladys admiration lady ellington took previous attitude off like pair of glove just threw into gutter walked on gladys knew must have be lady dover pronouncement have caused change for too be aware that social greenwich time be largely taken from glen callan have made mental note just a madge mother have done that must also alter own time by clearly must be too ridiculous if london welcomed back with open arm only madge family turned back on have certain puck like sense of malice particularly when must exercise on lady ellington must not resist little tap two now be so glad take like said see a lady dover doe at first know thought be being too bitter about really to tell truth have idea that be taking madge part dear madge hope will ask soon while be still here of course be bitter about at first said lady ellington who must help being when plan be upset poor philip home be suffering too be more sorry for than for anybody else have to tell know have terrible interview with soon saw that since madge be not in love with with evelyn be thousand time better that must suffer that purely temporary disturbance worry than that must be in dreadfully false position of being married to one man while be in love with gladys purred rather feline approval how glad dear madge must have be when told how felt said wish have be there when made up with who be who say something about 'blessings on falling out more endears must have be quite like lady ellington met a well a must though be rather awkward yes think madge will be perfectly happy said now find that everyone be quite a nice a ever to dear madge never felt different to said gladys rather imprudently lady ellington jumped on to with extraordinary quickness precision ah be glad to know that said because now also know that lady taverner must have simply invented quantity of thing that said have said to about felt sure must not have be so unkind so honour on whole be pretty well divided of saw through other since determined to write to madge night be highly likely that madge must see through mr osborne proved to be true prophet be indeed lady salmon lady grilse who came back from river about tea time have good luck to be in hall when returned preceded lady ellington to drawing room where threw open door for to enter in manner of butler announced loudly lady salmon ellington lady lady grilse also have vindicated name again when after tea played game at one person go out of room on return have to guess by mere yes have be thought of mr osborne on learning that have thought of fish instantly guessed salmon proved to be right satisfactory report also came from grouse shooter two lady have have charming drive mr dennison have caught effect of highly pleasing kind though lord ellington have missed stag be felt that mr osborne be in tune with general cheerfulness when said that after be next best to hitting indeed mr osborne be in extremely fine form altogether lady dover a went with wife at about half past six a be refreshing after day in air to lie down for hour so before dinner said that knew one so entertaining a husband then since mr dennison be with added mr

in london without immediate prospect of getting away that week at le touquet with motor car suite of room evelyn serene complete disregard of question connected however remotely with finance have be somewhat alarmingly expensive ill judged selling out of metiekull share when thing be absolutely at worst have not mended matter have taken madge completely into confidence a be evidently likely that there must soon be embarrassing lack of fund have insisted on immediate return to london where must be anyhow rent free in evelyn house in king road must a cheerfully suggested live on lentil like hermit on arrival in hall table be discovered to be literally smothered in bill chiefly to account rendered for evelyn in insouciance of comfortable bachelor income picture brought in have certainly for year past thrown into fire anything of bill nature nothing have ever be further from thought than not to pay knowledge that must by strange almost universal trait in human nature have made not bother to do so now however by converse of law hold equally true a soon a be doubtful whether must stand debt free became quite essential to interior peace of mind that must do so instinct appealed also to madge after dismal morning of adding up whole position be revealed penny must be paid with jetsam of metiekull there be left over total asset except hand eye sum of forty three pound be clearly necessary therefore to stop in london to be extremely economical to hope that autumn must bring sitter lady taverner at rate be assured evelyn found thinking of pink face butter coloured hair

evelyn have shaken off from mind just a retriever puppy shake off water after swim dispersing over yard of grass in halo if madge on day when sat on sand at paris plage have have disquieting thought a to whether be man have married mere boy here at rate be consolation if proved to be latter for evelyn have certainly that divinest gift of youth in being able to utterly expunge from present from view

want champagne so equivalent in champagne be of use be use trying to make feel sorry because be not just have to oh darling sat down on sofa by be hot know said might kiss just end of nose have seen for five hour kissed be simply abominable said yes probably be so thing happened to day too saw philip be driving to waterloo in hansom luggage be behind with servant in cab did see at least if did

of future accident may be marred maimed by what be a fortuitous a evelyn shifted slightly in seat summing up of past be thing be not inclined to be summed up finished with except in so far a present be finished past why go over account again there be doubt a to correctness know whether be accident said if begin to call thing accident there be stopping if one thing be accident everything be that stayed at house at pangbourne when be there may call accident that made friend there will call accident also if call first accident if be consistent will call fact that loved other accident only if call that accident be using word in different sense to use in then nothing be accident asked yes buying bottle of champagne be accident because did mean to a have happened may a well drink sudden stab of disappointment somehow pierced madge have be serious so to certain point have now when talk seemed to be becoming fruit bearing must dismiss with jest wifehood for month two ago must have done likewise have developed in way marriage have not developed be still bright eyed boy on other hand be no longer girl woman sub consciousness of twanged in answer be so undeveloped said suddenly to ear there be reproach in concerned future not past bright eye grew brighter surely said development be in hand lay whatever be at foot that too madge felt be so extraordinarily genuine small a be tribute

parted with constant companionship more than must have parted with light of day yet something be missing be not le definite sense quality be missing in evelyn because be indefinable one must not know

off so far off that must only strain eye if tried to focus on of being necessary just a food drink be necessary little ghost at le touquet in fact have apparently begged way across have established in king road ghost of kind mind prosaic surroundings discerning reader will perceive have need of tapestry panel for be concerned in way with what be past ancestral with what be alive knitted into fabric of present after thus dismissing question of accident essential of life with ill timed little jest about champagne evelyn quite suddenly returned to matter a serious called undeveloped just now said expect be right in way that did not think tom merivale told once have not rudiment of conscience have often thought of believe be quite true be where be really undeveloped expect be that face lit up even more with piece of intuition expect be that miss in also said have depth miss that too probably evelyn announced discovery with perfectly serene unclouded air perturbation that be lacking in so large piece of moral equipment a conscience must do manner of good because wife missed must help matter that must mourn with over deficiency unshadowed brightness of face frank acceptance of so genially generously made be something of reproach to sunshine of beautiful nature be hers brilliance of talent extraordinary personal charm blithe acquiescence in happened be hers yet be discontent with pang of self reproach contrasted gave with what have thought good enough to give to philip when promised to be wife affection respect esteem just platter of frigid odds end compared to great feast glorious banquet of love there be doubt a to accuracy of diagnosis evelyn have made a to what missed in have risen from sofa be standing in front of at rose too laid hand on shoulder ah be ungrateful little brute said believe be woman way give woman always want more dear give always say did not know so much be possible so confess be sorry looked at still smiling without speaking warmth of contrition cooled little ought to have known so told that what have said be not very easy to say ought to have met warmth of amende with welcome acceptation even acknowledgment of generosity for have be generous well said at length have nothing to say to put head little on one side a did so often when be painting yes be just arranging in head in beautiful language said beautiful language wo come so will have to hear plain not coloured be just think one doe good by pulling open to see what be inside oh yes rosebud be part of beautiful language like rosebud one flower best expect by leaving alone by just living surely life be good enough suppose people be naturally analytical people who write book for instance about other people moral inside be quite certain that be not like paint picture see of other people outside if went on painting face for year madge must never get to end of be be to well be evelyn dundas beg to introduce be evelyn dundas let tell be ca get away from

be possible must go get yes officially know about said storm in physical material sense be variously supposed to have two diametrically opposite effect may be regarded a likely to clear air on other hand to cause general unsettlement in weather mental spiritual storm can in same way be precursor cause of serene blue weather can produce disturbance of equilibrium be not easily immediately adjusted again violent agitation set everything shaking jarring worst of be that there be barometer known will reliably predict of effect be likely to be produced to speak of thing to have out a phrase go may get rid of altogether may be pricked like puff ball vanish in little dust smoke leaving empty bladder again to have out may emphasise make existence more real having out in fact be sort of preliminary examination prof whether there be something there whether there be nothing talk between evelyn wife have distinct analogy to storm thing have be gathering up indeed be cloud in madge mind ever since le touquet though bursting have be unaccompanied by rain explosion yet to night have be undeniably discharged remained only to see whether air must prove to have be cleared whether disturbance have upset moral atmosphere again have have out have indicated where trouble lay rather have laid unerring finger on a physician have said leave alone be suggestion let hear more about fully intended to follow advice half consciously made reservation for knew that time next week next month next year must know that have be right that trouble have vanished that have be wrong trouble have grown worse so secret sense of uncertainty unsatisfiedness sat somewhere deep in shadow of heart did not often obtrude presence knew be there on evelyn however same scene appeared to leave trace of kind indeed there be reason why must because have contained nothing be new to also because have ended so thoroughly satisfactorily madge have agreed with about advisability of letting analysis alone for future have indeed evening indulged in little found that there be nothing in mutual relation wanted altering nothing alteration must not have spoiled not for moment did say that there be not thing in must have preferred vastly different with certain good sense considered that in shaping one course in life one have to accept certain tendency limitation in oneself having granted to do one best did not see that perseverance thought pain on part must create in what merivale have called conscience life be honest sober clean not must be confessed because morality indicated that must be because artistic sense must be hurt by being other than that be sheer waste of time for to sit down think about duty because really meant nothing to might a well have sat down thought about hebrew from kindliness warmth of nature conclusion a regard conduct be extraordinarily like very finest sense of duty must have dictated yet now then a when have said that be sorry for philip that nothing must have happened differently though madge in word agreed with yet with fine feminine sense knew that agreed with agreed somehow on plane quite different from that nothing must have happened differently knew in way than deeply fiercely whole heartedly a loved for life up till now whole nature have lain dormant have awoke at once awoke to find that one person only be there even a brunnhilde woke on mountain top saw siegfried that awakening have be long delayed when came be complete like thunder clap when have declared love for deafened paralysed other sens there be only one thing in world for be love to must not help knowing love for have not be blinding flash awoke nature have loved before keen sensibility have be sensibility inspired art made so extraordinarily vital life huge joy of life have inspired have waved in wind of human emotion brought to love be new indeed one be driven by engine drove other machine a well art joy of life for instance that be be one thing have lain like chrysalis hitherto moth beautiful came out with wing at first crumpled quivering momentarily expanding in sun have till then lived in darkness light saw when emerged from cracked husk be only light have ever known did not compare respective dimension so to speak of love of of for moment believed that evelyn loved a completely a loved loved other thing a well art be vital part of life while have nothing be why though be so much more developed than have spoken sort of truth when said be undeveloped for did not love to exclusion of else be not must not be only thing world held for in same way also sorrow for philip suffering be different from hers for so seemed to be sorry for philip a nature must make necessary for to be sorry for anyone who have suffered great loss for artist who went blind for musician who went deaf have yet other joy of life with in course of time increase in other sensibility a compensation to make loss good who have emerged from nothingness into full blaze of unconjectured noonday rated philip loss at what own must have be have be taken from be left in original outer darkness can only be estimated by who have seen light not by purblind creature have never left philip what must philip suffering have be poor philip who be so kind so likeable so everything loved by be who have done have brought misery on honestly gauged by knowledge of what misery must be if something happened made evelyn no longer love have carried skeleton of thought with to bed night woke early to find a in dry bone of ezekiel vision be beginning to knit together bone coming to bone flesh covering pale dawn be beginning to peer into window bird to tune up in broken chirrupings for song of day have philip woke like wondered during hot august month that too have spent in london if so what mitigation of misery have found not in business must not believe that surely must have taken to work a man unhappy le manly take to drug deadens power of sense surely must be explanation of tireless industry in city month when others now went for holiday to moor mountain oh poor philip have brought on too must have made happy felt sure of have not soft irresistible love made that gracious task impossible for room in spite of open window be very hot turned back blanket quietly so a not to disturb evelyn lay with face turned towards in deep sleep not dreamless perhaps because smiled even in wan morning light when vitality burn low face be radiant scruple pale doubt troubled rest must wake to day with same welcome of good morning for a with have said good night to last lip be closed breathed evenly slowly through nostril sleep must have be more tranquil be just sleep of child tired with play who must be recuperated on morrow for day of play then rose very quietly opening door with precaution went into bath room be afraid that splash of water might rouse put sponge underneath tap so that sound be muffled for have same womanly tenderness with regard to breaking sleep a have towards philip suffering be sacred even broken hour of rest be thing to be avoided then with infinite care tip toed back into bedroom dressed before left looked at once more have not aroused play of sub conscious cerebration told that have gone slept on with same tranquil sleep eighteenth lady dover letter to madge be most elastic a regarded date of visit thoroughly cordial for never did thing by half welcome must be given to evelyn if must possibly spare time to visit so remote place be sincerity about accepting have own view quite clearly formed own pride pride too in husband prevented from giving slightest inkling of to for saw clearly that visit be proposed by lady dover with definite purpose of showing act of friendliness after marriage be clearly made with intention in heart of heart madge be intensely grateful to hint however to evelyn be impossible frank eagerness to go made unnecessary for to consider more diplomatic reason for doing so oh let go said surely scotland be better than london what be there here just stuffy town battersea park nothing whatever to do madge knew that own feeling of being hurt at be unreasonable solitude of london have be unutterably dear to knew own feeling to be unreasonable since never doubted rightly how dear have be to why must not want to be externally amused to shoot to fish to do thing that delighted in echo answered why be at breakfast time that letter arrived bacon be undeniably le good than must have be two day previously evelyn sniffed at decided against sensitiveness to slightly passee bacon be sensitive to feeling also one doe want meat food in summer said tea marmalade how delicious madge handed tea dear said be high be fault thought must be good just for to day be oh evelyn be nice of to pretend did want ca act before always know so give up evelyn gave great shout of laughter madge marmalade said that good enough for in fact must leave out marmalade if required oh madge why ca be serious talk about by way will paint sketch of called bacon ' yearning face of young wife be young know be wife chatter so confuses now lady dover if will be silent one moment life at golspie be where be wrong said madge have to go to golspie before begin want to begin want to get there madge put on woeful face always introduced ellesdee like ticket man at king cross said think be what seems evelyn have eaten by time crust off hovis loaf more crust said there be very good marmalade in spoon wo distend vie interieure with crumb about ticket man be wrong if be generous to lady dover with regard to length of visit why mince matter can afford say 'yes board wage for enormous establishment here ticket for third class wish there be fourth fifth what be dem 'd total a mr mantalini said besides evelyn waved hand like man commanding million be temporary economy pink butter coloured be going to visit classic abode in october if order pour in like own leaky roof will eat gamboge in paintbox ca say fairer a posse gamboge added bet find taker give that information for though be poor be honest evelyn proceeded to eat marmalade with spoon will be very chic if come to think of said probably several lady maid valet will arrive with respective owner by same train madge will flirt with one two of valet with several of lady maid scene then be shifted to golspie station squeeze hand of valet on platform gaze into eye of lady maid sumptuous motor have come for lady dover guest strive to subdue quite ineffectually air of conscious superiority squeeze hand of duke duchess then will know in true colour triumphal explosion of motor car valet lady maid be saved hurrah for lower class cup of tea please right up to top point be fare to golspie arrived there will have more food drink to buy reasoning be inevitable given that domestic economy must manage there be reason must reasonably indicate king road instead yet even after abc have added voice to overmastering argument madge hesitated must not quite see husband among surroundings awaited there have be there before knew how must that particular milieu suit other be secondary to original desire to go private incommunicable feeling that visit must poser for must not have be lady ellington daughter so long without point of view having soaked into be paramount other be there complication in mind be that though wished taking reason round to leave hot house still be intertwined with exquisite undying memory must not see how evelyn must wish to leave not having own worldly reason for going to golspie without pang since question of whether economy must allow have be decided in favour of going there be certainly no more to be said so told no more to be thought since logical conclusion be one conclusion in world be absolutely without effect a regard result continued to think for ordinary mind be not in least reasonable must cease to be reasonable moment be take place among fixed star other unattainable object logic reason be perhaps most ineffective of human motif may be appealed to a last resort if there be impulse still alive not logic will be seized on a ground for action hence divine uncertainty of human affair if world be ruled by reason must become duller than week old newspaper be fact that human soul be so impredicable that lends zest to existence finding out in fact not knowledge be spring make life fascinating whenever element of certainty enters be death head at feast nobody care for feast more champagne be flat so to golspie went evelyn prophecy a regard journey be sufficiently fulfilled to make anybody believe that there must have be something in at rate before arrived at even inverness be engaged in conversation with agreeable female opposite conversation be not however so engrossing that must observe with secret glee fact that madge be reading scotsman provided for by equally agreeable young man who sat opposite hoped that cigarette must not be disagreeable then luck be really on side that day important people stepped out of first class carriage at golspie by usage of cruel world acquaintance so pleasantly begun be rudely interrupted cart waited for travelling companion swift motor received stranger before whom own travelling acquaintance be dust ash be in fact short week after lady ellington arrival at glen callan that daughter son in law got there though must a previously arranged have gone on to next house day before arrival put off departure for two day in order to have pleasure of seeing party in fact be unaltered so be way of life mr osborne flow of humour showed sign of running dry be blank amazement with lord ellington regarded in least abated mr dennison be getting steadily on towards completion of panorama of sutherland lady dover found fresh light shadow on purple heather day lady ellington have carefully considered what exact attitude towards madge husband must be have come to most sensible conclusion about since world have made up mind to welcome to draw wet sponge over past be clear that unless wished to make exception of herself not do in rome what rome did must extend to not merely welcome of world welcome of mother also be decidedly best plan to make thorough astonished a madge might be be better to astonish than world in public in private must hear one word of reproach uncordial accent lady ellington have desire to see private talk with daughter in fact meant rather to avoid whole policy be to accept what have happened welcome madge in flesh with same unreservedness a have shown in letter have written week ago urging to accept lady dover invitation be determined in fact now that lady dover have shown way to make best of instead of bitterly counting up mentally sending bill in to madge must have be at command have not speculation with regard to madge marriage failed to make most of asset remained to more thought of unattractive a have seemed at first more seemed to to have promising air philip be immensely wealthy evelyn be poor that be unfortunately undeniable evelyn regarding a property have certainly prospect philip have not though nothing must quite make up to mind for loss of much tangible wealth yet evelyn with brilliant gift might easily be rich man while even now be much more rising figure socially than other people talked about admired cleverness charm asked to be introduced to merit be true have not seen in day at pangbourne when looked upon merely a impossible young artist since impossible young artist have become inevitable son in law be wise to take into account so welcome to be going to be unreserved arrived just a lady ellington have arrived after rest of party have gone in to dinner host hostess came out into hall a usual to meet madge must be confessed have gone through bad quarter of hour of anticipatory shyness a got near on arrival found to have be superfluous piece of self inflicted discomfort for lady dover be absolutely natural be required of be that must be natural too ah dear madge said how nice to see mr dundas have such surprise for mother be here still persuaded to delay departure couple of day in order just to have glimpse of call lady salmon be eating fish caught only afternoon turned to welcome other guest when lady ellington also followed from dining room dearest madge cried kissing be too delightful how well be looking did only wear thin cloak for drive surely be rash how be dear evelyn be nice must not help coming out of dinner to have glimpse of have brought maid madge dear mother have got one to bring evelyn must have maid parkins of course will attend to here now must go dress that mother be still in house have be absolutely surprise to madge welcome fully endorsed cordiality of letter have not seen since afternoon in july when have come to evelyn studio have caused complete radical change be grateful to too bore meaning a clearly stamped a did lady dover greeting have happened have happened past be over everyone in house indeed taking time from hostess welcomed with very special cordiality lady dover in quiet neat way have dropped casually enough letting point of observation be fully seen little remark to most member of party on very great pleasure anticipated from visit of dundases be so charming be wonder that everyone liked meaning of be explicit enough put without hint of patronising indeed of doing kindness though lady ellington have reflected that people followed lady dover lead just because be ordinary be ordinary might be questioned whether must have given lead so gently for hardly appeared lead at so successfully for everybody followed from fragment of lady dover ordinary conversation already indicated may not unfairly be gathered that perhaps lacked brilliance in talk be not possessed of particular intellectual distinction after hardest art to practise be art of living according to one taste thing certainly succeeded admirably in doing hardest medium to work in more difficult by far than metal marble oil be men woman manipulation of be masterly to crown did not seem to manipulate at in instance certainly subtlest diplomatist must not with scheming have produced more complete result mr dennison a have be seen have on tip of tongue conclusion disparaging in highest degree to evelyn art gladys ellington have let thing even more bitter pas tip of tongue madge mother have felt not so long ago that shipwreck be total that there be salvage yet lady dover with just little repetition of same sentence two have swept thing away a broom with couple of stroke demolishes weaving of spider through unobscured window sun again shine in fact volta face of society have be begun at rate with immense precision certainty on word of lady dover who be in command particular company have turned right about with instantaneousness be instinct of well drilled troop in effect whole social balance of power be changed from moment of appearance evelyn a natural in way that more vivacious one than lady dover gave brilliant sketch of arrival third class at golspie station adjustment of social distinction consequent also have prophesied must bear out in reproduced admirably madge face from behind scotsman have be so kindly lent mr osborne made one attempt to reconstitute life soul of party when addressed gladys a lady grilse unfolded to madge who sat next history of remarkable piece of wit meaning to follow up by sequel sequel be usually disappointing be agreeable exception of true circumstance under mother have be called lady salmon madge have cut sequel short without ironical purpose simply because wanted to listen to contradict libel evelyn be telling of conduct on opposite side of table how very amusing said called lady grilse see do not because have caught one evelyn said nothing of kind only said that rather liked smell of cigarette quite literal correct explanation of mr osborne joke be fatal to joke be pricked bladder must never be repeated more then came deposition of royal academician mr dennison have finished picture of upper glen only that afternoon occasion be therefore solemn so be yes lady dover be saying only touched canvas dozen time to day yet have done a said full day work c'est le dernier pa qui coute be on last touch that whole thing depends knew when went out morning have not got what meant knew too that be nearly there be that nearly be yet so far there be shadow of cloud if remember over bank of gorse oh thought that shadow be quite perfect said lady dover hope have not touched have gone said mr dennison a if announcing death of near relation who have left money for though voice be mournful there be hint of something comfortable coming gone saw must not do so a to make true looked up at tragic announcement caught evelyn eye mr dundas be sure will bear out said poor artist be bound however limit to put down only what know be true be not poet chronicler oh evelyn have be telling such lie about said madge from other side chronicler resumed mr dennison when feel sure be right record impression unless certainty of vision come to must be honest must not attempt vague impression merely be not so evelyn face looked extraordinarily vital boyish a leaned forward oh agree in least said think always ought to try to record just suggestion vagueness say leave out look at 'la gioconda ' what did andrea mean to think about sphinx know do what be more certain than even that did know did mean what walter pater said meant again be quite certain did not think picture ought to ask unanswerable riddle picture be to say be picture at riddle like 'which came first hen egg surely anything obvious be not worth painting at mr dennison have clearly not thought of thing in light be not thus that ordnance map of sutherland must be made amusing paradox said nobody be to know anything about picture especially man who painted be that correct tone have something slightly nettled about evelyn imperturbable good humour gaiety might perhaps represent indifference of nettle towards hand have stung yes just that said take of art surely be because play have hundred interpretation that be worth seeing because hundred different people will experience hundred different emotion that opera be worth listening to very fact that when hear 'the jolly roast beef of old england be irresistibly reminded of jolly roast beef of old england show that be bad tune mr dennison waved hand in sketchy manner have not pleasure of knowing that tune said when paint upper glen here mean to produce in beholder that perception of particular individual beauty be mine when painted when exercise art exquisite art over portrait imagine mean to make result produce in beholder beauty saw evelyn laughed oh

wanted to be tenor ah explains great deal said explains why sometimes find portrait wholly unlike people represent conclusion be that if knew better must find more like be exactly what mean said evelyn here lady dover broke in must have great talk mr dundas said with mr dennison be so interesting to hear different point of view one can not really grasp question can one unless one hears side of think lady ellington have finished let go verdict over little passage of arm be unanimous mr dennison be longer in anyone mind pope fountain head of art criticism thereon impressiveness have in last ten minute fallen into disrepute of pomposity grave pronouncement be all discredited far more attractive gospel have be enunciated far more attractive too be new evangelist a lady dover passed on way out have one more word be delightful doctrine mr dundas said must really do portrait of if think be unlike remedy will be that must see more of evelyn drew chair next to academician have heard rise of voice seen symptom of perturbation to produce there be nothing further from intention be afraid talk awful rot said with most disarming frankness now mr dennison be conscious of having be rather rude ruffled be also conscious that evelyn temper have be calmer than moon felt too charm of confession be so evidently not premeditated natural doe not diminish pleasure in meeting mr dundas said afterwards same triumphant march continued mr dennison even showed to madge how couple of most astounding conjuring trick be done lady ellington talked to son in law in corner about madge until council of war summoned to debate then when be decided that madge must join fishmonger on river mr osborne instantly suggested that must be mr sea trout though cavilling mind might find in futile attempt to establish once more a life soul of party be not indeed so meant merely a compliment tribute to madge then when council of war be over more remarkable thing happened for whole party played dumb crambo till long after half past ten quite forgetful apparently how important be to get good rest after day spent in open air how such subversion of general usage occurred one knew certainly there be something in evelyn conduced to silly gaiety nobody be whit worse for while effect of moon light on hill opposite have nightly be admiration of whole party went totally unheeded exquisite light shadow subtlety of have become office of mr dennison to point out lady dover to appreciate might never have be in view at lady ellington went with madge to room when woman retired have not really meant to do so lady dover good night have made necessary dear madge have said know mother will want to talk to so will not come to see to room hope have everything want breakfast at quarter to ten must rather have in room after journey have be so late to night too how excellent mr dundas last charade be only mr dennison guessed good night dear lady ellington be thus so to speak forced into madge room carried with glass of hot water carried also be even more warming memory of undisguised welcome that not only madge impossible artist have received almost in fact reconsidered valuation of wealth have philip home appeared in evelyn place evening knew quite well must not have be able to stir deadly gentility of house half so well a impossible artist must not have piped so a to make dance yet key to sort of set knew really mattered most solid stolid respectable upper class have be just rat to piping natural enjoyment animal spirit to put influence at lowest have simply played deuce with tradition of house where never ventured to lift voice in opposition amendment to what be suggested evelyn oh let have one more dumb crambo have revised law of medes persian have even at formal council of war have refused to say what must like to do to morrow thing absolutely unprecedented oh may go shoot if be fine have said hing at if be wet hate shooting lord dover if barrel be covered with rain bird look so awfully far away in rain must love to shoot in case added goodness madge think of king road 'buses yet revolt against established law so lady ellington felt have somehow not transgressed law of propriety be so careful about here evelyn from ignorance doubt rode rough shod one resented trespass even lord dover have be stirred into speech thing did not usually indulge in except on subject of grouse have be shot fish have be killed that day dear boy said will do exactly what like to morrow there be rod for on river must like gun on moor tell at breakfast lady ellington took up to madge room with hot water lady dover must be a good a word that having asked two to glen callan must give genuine welcome have never doubted what be surprising be extreme personal success of once better forgotten son in law stronghold central fortress of what be correct proper have received a if be almost new incarnation of what be correct proper if be putting too strongly at rate a if question of correctness propriety have ever arisen surprising though be be wholly satisfactory be so late dear madge said that can only stop minute have not be delightful evening desire to say something salutary struggled long in mind wanted so much to indicate that be for sake of feeling even in consequence of own intervention that so charming welcome have be extended to madge husband to be quite truthful be not instinct for truth prevented quite certain knowledge that madge must not stand anything suggested hint of patronisation besides house be lady dover that person who a lady ellington be beginning to learn be natural because happened to be natural be quite truthful not because be subtler sort of diplomacy that naked dagger of truth be implement required deal of mail coat to ward off moment lady dover might wreck scheming policy with one candid word corresponding surprise candour of eye welcome have be so warm that madge must not be warmed by even to point of confession oh mother said have be disquieting in vain last month have be wondering secretly whether people be going to be horrid to how senseless be have be thinking sort of thing put down candle drew couple of chair to fire have have sort of thought said see did not write to thought might well might have washed hand of thought that people like lady dover must think have be heartless evelyn worse than heartless be hopelessly wrong everybody be a nice a possible heaven how have eaten heart out over month in london poked fire with certain viciousness feeling that pricked bubble of senseless fear a pricked bubbling gas of burning coal in vain said have be making not miserable because ca be otherwise than happy disquieted with sort of foundationless fear thought people must disregard yes be must disregard evelyn must talk of fine day instead then see evelyn must also have nothing to do nobody must want to be painted by must be miserably poor must have to paint sort of thing have taste for just to get guinea two keep pot boiling ah must have minded that poverty mean what must mind must be that must have to work at what felt be not worth working at see never perhaps before have madge so given away to mother lady ellington system have be to snip off awkward shoot train plant so to speak in such way a must make most suitable a table ornament table for be destined need hardly be remarked be opulent table there be to be wasting of sweetness on desert air mayfair be to inhale full odour a thing now stood destination of flower be a likely to be mayfair a ever lady ellington respected success nobody more so be there anything respected so much on rapid review of evening success felt inclined to respect most be that of impossible son in law if plebiscite for popularity have knocked at door of occupied bedroom have doubt a to result of election there be nothing left for to retract wholly entirely own resentment rage at marriage since have to be done be better done at once dearest madge said how foolish of to make miserable of course at first be vexed troubled at be be still very sorry for philip though did wish certain thing have not happened that others have mean wish that have be in love with philip for be sure must have be very happy yet since be not to be so since fell in love with evelyn what other issue must have desired suddenly quick a lizard popping out in again of hole in wall there flashed through madge mind impression believe that must not be held responsible for for be not thought consciously entertained just put head out said here be what however mattered more be that be mother avowed declaration now be colour anyhow intended to sail under have be launched anew so to speak with regard to attitude towards daughter lady dover have christened broken bottle of wine over for good luck having made declaration lady ellington thought have better be moving from child madge have be blessed with memory of hideous exactitude enabled if choose to recall conversation with most convincing verbal accuracy lady ellington did not feel equal off hand to explaining of flower like phrase have felt certain fallen from in interview with madge after thunderstorm in new forest if perchance fragrance of might conceivably still linger in daughter mind did wish to be reminded however remotely a thought of made greater speed of letter from madge to evelyn have lain in hall one afternoon a came in with regard to maternal instinct have prompted to take so strong line so again referred to lateness of hour owing to amusing game took rest of hot water to finish in own room need not have be afraid nothing be further from madge intention than to speak of such thing though must not help knowing that did not believe what mother have said deliberately turned mind away so far from exercising memory over ground of disbelief put away from thought such generosity be easy present great happiness made that felt in mood to go to bed even after night have spent in train from thought of vain disquietude have felt about how people must behave to passed in thought to disquietude that told be a likely to be a vain a for what be sense of measuring gauging taking sounding into manner of evelyn love for comparing unfavourably to tell truth with hers for for knew quite well whole fibre of being knew that in so far a be complete at love

for river madge saw off at door be to shoot over beat of moor not far from house must bring close to river by lunch time be arranged that party must lunch together gladys started with for be going to fish up river from lower reach lady ellington madge must begin on opposite side at top must bring together about two o'clock at what be called bridge pool where madge fishing on side must cross meeting lady ellington gladys who must have worked up from below while shooter converged on from moor must indeed have be sad heart did not rejoice on morning while to happy cup must overflow there have be slight touch of early frost in night a madge skirted river bank be still in shadow lay now in thick diamond drop on grass ready when sun touched to hover for moment in wisp of thin mist then to be drawn up into sparkle of day swift strong coffee coloured at foot splendid river roared on way full of breaker billow at head of pool calming down into broad smooth surface before quickened again into woven rope of water down river climbed to next pool pool too be mystery for who knew what silver mailed monster might not be oaring way about with flick of spade like tail clove water sent arrow like up stream mystery of romance of gaudy fly thrown into seething tumult of foam breaker circling journey followed by eager eye beating heart might at moment be interrupted by swirl of water unaccounted for by stream perhaps sight of fin silver side then sudden check feeling of weight nodding of tapering rod in assent shrill scream of reel possibility of moment excitement tension added effervescence to vivid happiness filled madge inspired did with sort of rapture so step by step made way down first pool broken water at head gave reply to casting of fly upon water with little more line still little more line a pool grew broader went down to tail there far out in mid stream be big submerged rock with triangle of quiet water below more line more line went out before must reach

nodded bent to curve with accelerating whizz z z out ran line happy fishmonger looked anxiously rapturously at gillie couple of hour later madge have come to within hundred yard of bridge pool fish secure in creel aspiration for reaching somewhat sanguinely a knew a high a sixteen pound bridge pool be morning part of lady ellington water for on madge side ran swirling boiling round great cliff of nearly precipitous rock fifty foot high over have to pas before getting to skeleton wire bridge crossed river just below pool must see mother half way down pool already called to voice be drowned by hoarse bass of stream a plunged from rapid to rapid into head of pool below after trying in vain to make hear communicate glorious tidings of fish madge followed gillie up steep rocky pas led over cliff a mounted stony stair steep lichen ridden voice of water have be in ear morning rang there still like tone of secret familiar friend grew momently more faint voice voice of sunny noon a friendly a other took place grew more intense a first faded from shadow coolness water voice emerged into windy sunlight of moor bee buzzed hotly in heather making thin springlike stem of ling quiver nod beneath honey laden alightings swallow martin chided shrilly a passed peewit cried that note be sad triumphant according to mood of hearer then a gained top of rocky bastion sound more indicative of human presence be in air report of gun came from not far off immediately afterwards string of shot though have killed salmon with such gusto only hour two before madge must not help secret little joy at thought probably particular grouse have run gauntlet of gun have escaped again for spell of wild life on heather then following gillie finger saw not mile away shooting party who be also approaching general rendez vous with same coincident punctuality a while quarter of mile further down from point of vantage must see gladys coming up shooter be walking in line across very steep piece of brae declined towards river three of with gillie dog men seeming quite party hillside be covered with heather sown with great grey boulder madge be few minute before others gladys have still several hundred yard to go before reached bridge be now thirty yard off while lady ellington have still cream of bridge pool in front of sat down on big rock at top of cliff while rest of party converged at distance be impossible to make out identity of shooter be little grey blot on hillside now then muffled report of shot of two three shot reached though have felt glad that one grouse have perhaps escaped death tube yet felt glad way that seemed to be having good sport then mind eye wandered looked up glen down have come saw river sparkling mile away in torrent of sun enlightened foam above climbed heathery hill crowned with larch of plantation round house from house gleam of vane caught eye beside sat brown bearded gillie in restful scotch silence ready courteous to reply must speak to silent till happened pop pop went gun from hillside opposite suddenly got up looking across longer vaguely with focussed eye turned little grey speck of men be closer be possible now to see that there be commotion among from right little grey speck be running down hill from left be running up be madge watched for moment two still full of sunny thought then from point of convergence of little grey speck one started running towards bridge by must cross at faint a reflected starlight impulse of alarm came to be so slight that trace of appeared in voice what be happening do think asked gillie courteous scotsman did not reply gazed moment longer then ran down steep descent to bridge in madge faint feeling of alarm grew stronger though le indefinable a looked at leaping little grey speck growing moment larger at last saw who be be mr osborne jumping running for be worth at followed gillie hurried after across wire bridge a if drum have beat to arm legion of fear no longer indefinable leaped into brain in hideous tumult hundred yard ahead gillie have met running figure in moment have slung off creel started to run towards leaving mr osborne to drop down a if exhausted in heather what be cried a approached accident ma'be said know what madge did not delay went on towards mr osborne a got near sprang up from seat ah dear mr dundas said go go panting breath made pause

determination to forget in most case a here set tide on flow forgiveness higher quality be often natural sequel yet to forget grudge be to have forgiven while forgiveness may be hard metallic thing best perhaps of be capable will not grow soft until forgetfulness have come a well cause for grudge must cease to exist in mind before grudge can be wholly forgiven poor philip be not near yet still

reflection of distant lightning illuminated garden for moment there be gap in tree by stream where stricken tree have stood of corpse nothing remained have be cut up taken to make firewood for winter hot air blew in bush strange unaccountable noise of creaking twig sounded insistently loud ah know gospel well enough said merivale joy of life joy inherent in fact of life have really nothing more to tell of from living here with know have to peel life like orange to simplify to take rind of unnecessary thing off before can really taste well speak to of fear then have fear smiled with convincing boyish smile be pure happiness oh lot of thing may happen said assure that fear at least fear with reason feel convinced be lot to say that general scheme of life be right for be will be future hold

goaty smell too well ca reach in hammock ah there be lightning again there be going to be storm to night sleep indoors said philip quietly be quiet for fear of nerve tom laughed must rather say to beleep outside ' said if lightning make shot here will certainly shoot at highest thing house be much higher than hammock looked at moment in silence with pity be akin not to contempt to love ah be afraid of fear said that be one degree worse than anything need be afraid of be of own making too dress up fear like turnip ghost then scream with terror at remember a child making face at in looking glass till be so frightened must scarcely move be what most of do life again rather more vividly blink of lightning be reflected in cloud from far off thunder muttered sleepily so when go asked philip can think of a being a happy fearless a certain of scheme of world a ever merivale smiled yes assuredly can do that said though like to hear talk of going of course know must if stopped here must get bored fidgetty have not at present because have be getting well in convalescence condition so long a one be allowed to stop still be delightful place work be not here feel that a strongly a have harder part have to go back sort grain of gold from great lump of worthless alloy distinguish many thing glitter from royal metal however know that a well a do leaned forward over table looked very earnestly at philip think of always a happy said think of a of man who be waiting in antechamber waiting to be summoned to great presence at least be how feel how strongly certainly can not explain to here be in beautiful wonderful antechamber world love so in have passed day month of such extraordinary happiness at one end of antechamber there be curtain drawn behind be presence soon think will be drawn back will see what be behind think will be drawn soon for imagery be so clumsy for what be so simple for lately curtain have be stirred so seems to from other side have be jerked so often have thought that moment be to be drawn away whereas till lately have always hung in heavy motionless fold be waiting in front of conscious still oh so fully conscious of beautiful thing have loved looking at longer for can look nowhere at curtain stir be twitched a if someone be on point of drawing back paused moment did not take eye off philip continued looking at very gravely very affectionately of course can not help guessing what lie behind said conjecturing reasoning may be several thing at least may appear under several form of be certain that be god will there be blinding flash of joy show that even sorrow death be everywhere be le part of perfection than joy life even now a know in puny little attempt to be happy in way that nature be happy youth have come back to in extraordinary manner when see what will see will immortal life lived here now be portion know think quite possible if be so if be initiation ah god that impulse of joy will receive will spread from like circle in pool when stone be thrown into paused again smooth brown hand trembling little pan pipe too said be never silent now hear time take to mean that be at last never unconscious of hymn of life heard at first know just in snatch broken stanza when must screw up to realisation of song without end without word go up from earth day night where doe come from a told evelyn know care perhaps brain conceives sends message to ear be really simpler to suppose that hear just a hear voice talking to now for there be question a to fact of existence hymn of praise doe go on forever so perhaps in small way be complete so to speak with regard to then then there be thing may be behind curtain may be that will be shown if be shown must be right necessary sorrow pain death be in world have turned back on have said be not for perhaps will have to be for that to use convenient phrase will be to see pan paused on word then shook hair back from forehead got up now have told said philip got up too feeling somehow a if have be mesmerised must remember merivale have said be strangely vivid have dreamlike vividness about fabric texture colour of for vividness be unreal somehow unearthly a to reality of truth of question entered head have never heard anything commonplace story chronicle of indubitable event be le fantastic looked out in silence moment over garden though hour ago have be vaguely frightened at thought of mysterious occult power keep watch over world yet now when have be spoken of with such frankness so that seemed doubly a real a have before be frightened no longer be indeed a merivale have said have be afraid of fear be already very late after few trivial word went indoors to go up to bed a got to bottom of stair looked back once saw friend standing still on verandah with face towards a philip turned merivale standing under lamp in white shirt flannel with collar unfastened at neck sleeve rolled up to elbow smiled nodded to good night said sleep well think be learning how to do again philip began undressing a soon a got to room feeling unaccountably tired weary servant slept in room just opposite hesitated for moment a to whether must tell not to call in morning till rang for have that heaviness of head only satiety of sleep entirely remove be already late man have probably be in bed asleep for time so closed door drew blind down over window put out light brain for vividness of evening talk seemed absolutely numb empty a if memory be dead fell asleep instantly slept heavily for several hour then external sound began to mingle with dream thought be in large empty brown coloured hall lit by dim window very high up through faint tired light be peering now again square of window must be lit up for moment vividly from outside a often a happened low heavy tremulous sound echoed in vault above like bass bourdon note be conscious too that many unseen presence surrounded hall be thick with be saying hush sh sh sense of deadly oppression coming calamity filled be waiting for something not knowing what be then coil of sleep began to be more loosened before long awoke room looked out over garden hush sh sh be rain fell heavily on to shrub below window then light tremulous note be explained too for suddenly window started into brightness couple of second after sonorous roll of thunder followed uneasiness of dream have not passed still felt frightfully apprehensive desire for sleep however have left for half hour perhaps lay still listening to windless rain for night be so still that blind hung over open window without tapping stirring then with curious abruptness rain ceased altogether there be dead silence then suddenly frightful cry rent shattered stillness from outside screaming strangled voice called oh god yelled oh christ for one moment philip lay in grip paralysis of mortal fear next broke through sprang out of bed not pausing to light candle stumbled to door at same moment servant door flew open came out with white scared face carried lighted candle be from garden sir said be mr merivale voice philip did not answer went quickly downstairs followed by man door into verandah stood open a usual hurried out there on table be cloth remains of dessert chair stood where have sat evening merivale be pushed sideways moon be somewhere risen behind cloud for thick a be darkness be not near pitch followed by servant light of whose candle tossed weird misshapen shadow about philip set teeth went down towards where hammock be slung in merivale usually slept that strange pungent smell have noticed more than once before be heavy in air infinitely stronger more biting than have be for one moment flesh crept so that stopped waiting for man to come up with light must not face what might be there alone few yard further on came in sight of hammock something white flannelled figure glimmered there like strange irregular blot something black concealed most of occupant then black thing whatever be suddenly skipped into air ran with dreadful frolicsome leap bound tapping on brick path of pergola down to far end of garden where lost sight of then came to hammock merivale be sitting up in bunched up together with head drawn back a if avoiding deadly contact lip be drawn back from teeth so that gum showed eye be wide open terror incarnate sat there pupil be contracted to pin point a if focussed on something inch two from be not dead for chest heaved with dreadful spasm of breathing philip took up carried away from that haunted place into house laying on rug in passage before have got there breathing have ceased mouth eye have closed what looked on be just figure of boy whose mouth smiled who be sunk in happy dreamless sleep there be nothing to be done philip knew sent servant off at once to fetch doctor from brockenhurst while waited watched by merivale what have be terror shrinking have utterly passed from face philip in spite of frightful inexplicable thing have happened be not frightened either sat by feeling curiously calm serene hardly conscious even of sorrow regret did fear incomer from garden for curtain have be drawn dead man have felt so sure that form revelation be to take must be god that assurance of belief filled quieted man who watched by shirt be open at neck a philip have seen last standing below lamp on verandah sleeve be rolled back to above elbow a philip looked saw slowly appearing on skin of chest sunburnt arm curious mark became gradually clearer more defined mark pointed at one end print of animal hoof a if monstrous goat have leaped danced on be week later philip be seated alone with mother in small drawing room of house at pangbourne generally used if there be one with have arrived home only just before dinner that night when be over have talked long to describing have happened during stay with merivale have culminated in night of terror about even now must hardly speak story have be long one sometimes spoke freely at other point there be silence for word must not come choking throat trembling lip have to be controlled before must find utterance for concerned not merivale only indeed friend of heart a have be one who must never be replaced philip must scarcely think of death a sad for though said just for moment when cried on god name on name of christ when terror whatever be came close to flesh be weak yet know be not afraid have told so spirit be not afraid so longed to see curtain drawn joy of getting philip back again joy too of knowing that black crust of hate despair no longer shut off from be so great that mr home hardly regarded anxiety must otherwise have felt for have never seen philip like what have happened have stirred to depth of soul even sudden dreadful death of so old friend must not have imagined must have affected so philip dear said be terribly excited overwrought get more in control darling be quiet for moment even lit cigarette threw away again immediately ah mother when have finished will see said let go on paused moment soft stroking of hand on calmed be just dawn when flynn came back with doctor said clear dewy dawn sort of dawn tom loved doctor needed one glance one touch then said 'yes have be dead for more than hour ' so suppose have sat there a long a did not think have be more than minute two then eye fell on mark bruise told of looked at undressed little

for madge to ring for nurse sometimes shifted head from side to side occasionally put hand up to bandage covered face with little moan sigh below breath madge have be warned to be on alert for very gently a often a did must take feeble wandering finger in hers lay arm back again on blanket be something even to have to do slightest most trivial act be relief from absolute inaction yet time dreaded with ever increasing shrinking of heart hour when must have to act indeed when husband must come to begin to ask question one be determined must answer be who must tell that have yet to learn must kill wondered when knew must die simply because life be no longer desirable possible blind madge must not fully grasp that yet felt must realise must make haste to realise before be called upon to tell lady dover mother sir francis have urged to let be told by someone else madge must not hear of wifely instinct be stronger than reason must be suggested there be thing shrank from too though in part must be spared evelyn disfigurement about sir francis have spoken have told must be terrible have to get used to in anticipation so that when saw must not shrink let evelyn guess must not be able to see a far a went be merciful splendid beauty loved so brightness sunshine of face must never see again few detail about that surgeon have told be horrible love for love for beauty be inseparable must not disentangle latter be part of whole yet though knew that be gone be impossible to imagine that whole be diminished though part of be withdrawn have be warned how terrible change must be what if involuntarily without power of control flesh recoiled nerve shrank from yet be one thing must not be that must do for be to make know feel that in way completeness of love for be undiminished only that pity broad sweet shining of pity framed a with halo knew that be true essentially fundamentally have to make true not only in principle in conduct of little trivial deed of life must act up to always closeness bodily presence must not be one whit physically dear to blind ah if only must take bear for how vastly easier even to personally than that must be borne by for be from that from exquisite pleasure of eye a from fountain gaiety joy of life chiefly sprang of five sens that one be to more than rest put together of five chord bound to life made material world real strongest have be severed others in comparison be a frayed string other loss must have be trivial compared with how doubly trebly trivial must same loss have be to that must come to how must bear there be nothing to be reasoned about in have to let thought like just go round round in head till got more used to round round went yet at recurrence seemed not whit le unendurable tried to imagine telling went even over form of word choosing speech must tell most gently even while spoke must make force to feel that by very fact of love burden misery of be more hers to bear than what be word mere formula hurt more than did not make hurt le pain be shared by be not diminished there be double pain to bear dreadful automatic multiplication of alone take place be too crushingly recent yet for poor madge to refrain from such conclusion seemed to a yet that be dark place into light of sympathy must not penetrate certainly be at present beyond range kindness deep pity felt for did not reach yet nurse returned from dinner with came inverness doctor kind rugged man bandage have to be changed fresh dressing to be put on madge left room for for have be told that if saw face now must be needlessly shocked when wound healed must not be nearly so bad so though must really have preferred to know worse than worst yielded to madge went downstairs while be going on found lady dover waiting in hall rest of party have left yesterday though lady ellington have offered indeed really wished to remain madge have persuaded to go for girl out of range of sympathy pity at present found consolation that lady ellington tried to administer like series of sharp rap on sore place also madge must not help reading into sort of tacit reproach for having married accident indeed seemed to have stained backwards in lady ellington mind to have re endowed marriage with disaster lady dover touch be very different to mother indeed be because did not seem to be touch at madge unconsciously answered to ah there be dear said be expecting will not get on hat come out for little will do good to get air be lovely afternoon have never seen light shadow more exquisite be poor madge wanted though did not know wanted just cool spring water wholesome white bread of kind natural woman sympathy be good to yet consolation must not touch just quiet patient kindness be bearable made moment bearable from very restfulness light shadow be still there lady dover still talked of though did not know be very fact that other life went on a usual secretly brought certain comfort to madge yes will come out said want hat can not go far though will just take turn two up down terrace get sun there be sheltered from wind be rather cold to day simple unsophisticated a spell be if spell indeed there be worked magically on poor girl for little while dreadful round of impossible image formed panorama of future ceased to turn in head have lady dover tone suggested sympathy must have be worse spoken of healing power of time madge must not have spoken now when incessant procession of unthinkable future be stayed must focus mind for little on practical question must soon arise on wanted advice want counsel said be going to give evelyn doctor told more drug by evening will be again fully conscious now unless deceive unless tell that be being kept for present in absolute darkness must find out that that be blind soon anyhow must know be use do think putting off lady dover did not a madge mother must certainly have done squeeze hand utter word of sympathy did not even look at madge with clear level eye looked straight in front of while considered first instinct be a must have be instinct of everyone to say something sympathetic wisdom existence of lady ellington really did not believe in gave better counsel for to be natural be not synonymous with doing first thing happens to come into one head must be partly for dr inglis to decide said if sanction must certainly say that have better tell at once think people get used to thing better more gradually while be still weak perhaps suffering though dr inglis said thought must have pain whereas same thing be greater shock if one be well hit harder then perhaps will half guess for too must torture to know worst think be not so bad a to fear worst have reached end of terrace looked out over river couple of hundred foot below just opposite be bridge pool beyond rose steep moorland ever since have happened madge have given no outward sign of helpless devouring anguish have be perfectly composed there have be no tear raving cry now turned quickly away ca bear to look at said there be piece of white heather too where fell lady dover sweet rather quakerish face did not change at quiet wisdom still held sway be wrong think said to associate material thing with great grief one can not always wholly help think one must try to discourage in remember so well walking on terrace madge just after mother died be day rather like there be same exquisite light on hill remember tried consciously to dissociate from own grief think be wise must do again at least in one own case come to same thing paused moment there be one thing wanted to say believed might do madge good to have said deep overwhelming a grief be lady dover knew well that anything took mind off herself be salutary sometimes on other hand went on ought to remember people who have be most associated with doe not do good to anyone to shudder at heather think dear must be kind if just wrote line to lord ellington think have forgotten what must feel for moment doubted if have done wisely so bitter be madge reply ah can never forgive cried to think for broke off with quivering lip lady dover did not reply at once doubt did not gain ground think dear that be better unsaid replied at length really mean either best self doe not mean again paused for did not think very quickly too said must consider how can help mr dundas not to feel bitter resentful for have more direct cause to feel than if have sort of thought in heart will be unable to help in one way in perhaps can if feel like also dear supposing one of dover mr osborne have to become mr dundas lord ellington do think of must hesitate moment do not see that of people who have be made miserable by terrible accident of must be most miserable then came second outward sign from madge took lady dover hand in of hers judge too hardly said spoke very hastily very wrongly have be thinking of own misery too much have not thought enough about poor evelyn did not know there be such sorrow in world lady dover looked at moment drew gently to seat behind bush own pretty neat face be suddenly puckered up oh madge said just let go for ten minute cry dear sob heart out a say have good cry dear will do good be not cowardly that help one softens one make one braver perhaps afterwards yes dear let come then fountain of tear be unloosed sob deep sob come from heart of living suffering men woman be sign proof a be of humanity poured out madge have surrendered have ceased to hold aloof brave have be before brave in sort of impenetrable armour of own reserve now cast aside womanhood love for evelyn have begun to wake in came to own more heroic than have be before because armour be cast aside stood defenceless fearless before went up again to evelyn room wrote dear ellington have opportunity of speaking to then pen paused be not quite honest began again ought to have just seen before went yesterday must ask pardon did not just want to say be more sorry for than can possibly tell ask to say to to keep on saying to that be in way fault also perhaps may like to know how entirely recognise so know will will wish of course to hear about be going on very well though up to now have kept under morphia will be quite blind though must try to make affliction a light a possible for want so much to make promise not to blame please there be blame be outside control of of will write again tell how get on affectionate cousin madge dundas evelyn room looked out on to terrace away from direction of wind nurse have just gone to window to open further for room warmed by afternoon sun be growing rather hot just then stirred with more direct conscious movement than have yet made half sat up in bed with hand suddenly felt at bandage swathed upper part of face then spoke in quick staccato tone be so characteristic what have happened said where be what be going on why ca see madge then stopped suddenly bit lip for moment just paused summoning up strength to bear what knew be coming then went quickly to bedside took hand away from face yes dearest be here said lie quiet wo will talk nurse have come back from window also stood by bed madge spoke to quickly low leave please nurse said have got to talk privately will call if want left room evelyn have instinctively answered to madge voice have sunk back again on pillow slowly in long silence followed mind began piecing thing together burrowing groping feeling for thing have made mark on brain be remembered at present only dimly remembrance of shock came first to sudden stinging pain next smell of heather warm fragrant bitter tasting smell smell of blood put out hand felt fumblingly over clothes madge be still there said quickly took hand yes dear sitting by said will always be here whenever want then came staccato voice again why ca see asked what be over face again gently pulled back other hand be feeling bandage with quick hovering movement like antenna of insect be hurt dear know said have to bandage face over forehead eye again there be silence mind be beginning to move more quickly remembrance be pouring in from side be at glen glen something where came by night train flirted with valet said yes dear glen callan said madge quietly eye yearned devoured heart be ready now when time came to spring towards enfolding with love voice be fretful rather irritable from shock suffering yes glen callan of course said said glen callan did be there still suppose yes went fishing in morning went shooting shooting repeated that madge have ever felt before in life grew dim in intensity of moment be close now somehow no longer feared fear must not live in high altitude died like fever germ yes dear went shooting said be to meet at lunch know just before lunch there be accident be shot shot in face hand grew restless again shifted backwards forward in bed ah yes said be just what must not remember be shot yes yes remember how stung did hurt very much then fell down in heather ca think why stumbled must see be bleeding too heather be warm sweet smelling there be blood too that tasted so horrible like like blood there be nothing all over face then well what then brought back dear said have operation have to extract shot be done very satisfactorily be going on very well then nervous trembling in evelyn hand quick twitching of body ceased lay quite still moment gathering together to hear madge said speaking more slowly will please tell think have told yet want to hear for feel there be more yet be shot be know be lying here with bandaged face well madge voice did not falter that love pity possessed have for moment anyhow complete mastery over frailness cowardice of mere flesh just took hold of hand clasping tightly in spoke be shot over upper part of

must be when knew be shot very badly dear evelyn be shot in eye in eye again there be silence then spoke hoarsely do mean that that said yes dear have better say be blind evelyn then deep down from very heart of came next word spoke wish must have died instead said lay long absolutely motionless there be quiver of kind on corner of mouth to show that even understood knew understood be because understood that lay like at last spoke again sorrow anguish in voice be still comfort to beyond price so will never see again said then bent over bed kissed on mouth never have be so utterly yours a be now said voice still strong unwavering oh how fed heart to know what first thought be darling think must have broken if have be anything else illustration text decoration illustration text

eventually retired to own room just opposite went to bed for last two night have scarcely closed eye now with intense relief of knowing that evelyn knew of feeling too that be bearing with such wonderful quietness composure fell asleep at once slept long well husband have not be asleep of time went into room have never felt more awake in life have not answered because have felt that must be alone just now nobody not even must come near to for have to go into secret place of soul where only might come a at moment of death not even man nearest dearest with whom have be one flesh may take

begin to start living again there madge must help for death realisation of what have happened summing up of have be cut off have to be alone there be comfort for anywhere at future time must comfort

exquisite piece of modelling clay that gigantic hand have closed on reducing to shapeless lump shape colour existed more people have gone too face eye limb gentle swelling of woman breast outline profile warm radiant tint of youth be gone there be nothing left except voice voice without sight of mouth that spoke of shade of expression playing over face must be without significance must be dim meaningless must not reach in desert of utter loneliness where must dwell forever out of sight of everything be not be not half of world there be nothing left voice of be left be only voice too be

most satisfactory feverishness have almost gone doctor when wound be dressed that afternoon have be amazed to see how rapidly well process of healing be going on certainly there be lack of vitality recuperative power in patient in keenness utter despair of mental suffering be vitality absent same vitality coloured suffused that saw with hideous vividness of imaginative nature doubt uncertainty however here be worse than worst that truth must hold for called to nurse who came at once what be mr dundas asked hoped be asleep be not in pain not in pain ca sleep want to ask two three question

of rack under control loosens one a evelyn dread about disfigurement have be loosened for present at rate since be perhaps more than must stand angel of pain with relentless hand tender eye pitying mouth have not finished with yet tightens fact of blindness have be screwed down very tight then a racked sinew tortured nerve began to writhe agonise le little torture be added be small thing compared to others though have be there time madge have noticed at first now when be weary with pain be like fly kept buzzing settling on face while hand be bound so that must not brush off have seemed fear of imagination at first gradually to of a recovered so well future a well a present began to make felt again became terribly real be simply what be to happen to how among other thing be doctor nurse bill to be paid how after be going to live for several day suffered buzzing flittings alightings of without speaking of to other since believed that other have not yet thought of one afternoon have be talking of hot august month in london with childish tale of ellesdee curious fact that if only make game out of privation privation cease game becomes entrancingly real evelyn have laughed over will have heap of game in future have said unthinkingly stopped rather abruptly in silence followed heard madge just stir in chair assent have dropped from lip have said more be clear to that thought have met then evelyn spoke madge have ever occurred to what be going to do said how be going to live mean yes dear have thought about good deal did speak of since hoped must begin to think about yet there be forty three pound said from have to subtract railway fare yes dear said almost inaudibly angel of pain turned that screw little more must bear little more of there be unfinished portrait of lady taverner said there be finished portrait of even if sold what next what afterwards ah there be necessity to think about said madge quickly of course mother will help will do what can guy ellington of course will have to live on alms mean said with sudden dreadful bitterness on pity of others ca do besides ca support even if must how must accept hand with rapid hovering movement so characteristic of blind felt over bedclothes found hers be acquiring blind touch with extraordinary rapidity madge do hate for having married asked must have be better for if have never seen other here be tied eternally tied to beggar cripple half man with face for one moment winced at thought of did not yet know supposing be very terrible supposing cried out at recovered at once

up halfway to next knuckle where cut finger to bone when be girl over broken glass madge felt suddenly turn white cold have felt little scar on finger with absolute accuracy tracing from where started to where finished if must do with so little scar what of other scar must be within reach of hand always must find out too must guess attempt at concealment from of what injury really be must be futile must come to know be busy just now on exploration of power of touch be new game already touch be beginning to be new thing to whereas have regarded hand hitherto a holder to grasp other thing prehensile ending to arm merely be now beginning to find out new power in soft tipped finger be like child have hitherto regarded leg merely a agreeable though silent play fellow who begin to see that hitherto undreamed of power of locomotion resides in be fascinating to evelyn for moment there be sudden hope springing up be like message of relief coming to beleagured garrison why if can do already said who know what may not grow to madge be sure must not have felt so much before before happened quick give something will tell what be what if form shape of thing have not be annihilated for so game for so be began to interest for since measure of excitement chance experimentalism of life have begun to come back angel of pain relaxed screw little yet hand did not altogether leave poor madge angel of relentless hand tender face looked gravely on have to bear very much bear with smiling face cheerful voice fetching book for evelyn to identify small object from dressing case what not screw be turned rather smartly for be inevitable that must before very long identify own face identify damage there have not done so yet awfully a have feared that for now feared more for be building so much knew that on place where foundation be possible must all sink into mire clay must learn a must have to learn how dreadful be sensitive hovering finger with light touch constructive imagination must build up realise by degree must know that worst fear of be fulfilled that view of madge knew so well must take when learned one way of wreck have come to face might might not be willow view view must assuredly take construe love for into mere pity forbearance did not love for face must not say that face be part of if be spoiled so surely be part of love spoiled body soul have loved how must woman love sightless scarred thing must grant doubt that love for went further than be now hideous must to put from own point of view have scarred hacked blinded own face gone back to who saw in perfect confidence that love for must be undiminished undeterred knowing that lay too deep for such superficial maiming to injure knew well must not for love however spiritual includes body a well a spirit however fine can not take body a outward visible sign of beloved soul expression aura how must to whom surface of beauty loveliness have be by profession study worship still think asseveration

spite of dreaded with whole soul removal of bandage what if shrank winced at sight slim delicate finger of angel of pain tightened screw kind eye looked at seeing how bore if there be terrible moment coming for evelyn when finger be now to be to eye told what looked like there be moment double moment coming for have first to control to make believe saw that saw difference nothing made love one jot urgent insistent have also with feigned conviction have got to convince to assure that finger be at fault that there be scar where said there be scar that there be empty hole that knew what did not know be how to face at present anyhow by great effort put off moment foresaw must come must not remain indefinitely ignorant own hand must day inform just now be eager interested in new game by splendid effort of vitality will have pushed into background fact of blindness have put for time being anyhow among inevitable accepted fact of life while have filled foreground with fact that have eye in finger how glorious bit of bravery be knew well for be so brave that just now be not even acting genuinely looked forward to future not without hope at bidding have left grinding difficulty of future alone have left question of stark fact a to how be to live have left also fact of own supreme deprivation with splendid effort looked on possibility might lie in front of not on limitation cramping binding that certainly lay there yes thing be easy said of course can tell toothpick sovereign case be mere effort of memory let go on if be not tired of see dear have got to educate now be just child again learning new set of letter now give really new letter now lady dover day before in quiet way have telegraphed to london for couple of pack of blind card have index in raised cardboard in corner have arrived morning have put in dressing room adjoining bedroom have just mentioned to madge in way have be stranger in house might have mentioned where bath room be mr dundas be so eager alive have said that thought dear madge that might like to begin moment to accustom little poor fellow to new circumstance so will find couple of pack of raised card think call in dressing room thought might perhaps feel inclined to experiment with so madge fetched now couple of minute afterwards evelyn be deep in game of picquet childish pleasure in new thing stood in good stead now got a excited a schoolboy over riddle of what hand contained again again fingered raised index in corner with sudden burst of triumph when solved to own satisfaction ah used to call slow at picquet madge cried ca retaliate how very good for if call slow will merely throw card away burst into tear seven nine on earth be look tell trust not to look soon got tired be doubtful whether madge be not more tired than when waited long feeling with thin finger tip at index be bad enough for be worse when felt card right almost immediately almost laughed with pleasure at newly acquired quickness who used to be so quick time certainty of moment be coming when must learn have happened darkened with amazement of pity what must feel when knew that what must feel how if be very bad must have power to conceal so that must believe so must force to believe that be not there two morning after madge slept on very late before came down have be in to see evelyn subsequently have talk to nurse who told that dr inglis have already seen husband that intended to take bandage off eye day wound have healed in manner almost marvellous must now be better for air light though madge a went downstairs felt that only thankfulness ought to be in heart felt that carried sort of death warrant in pocket post have just come in a entered breakfast room from lord dover have already gone where wife still waited for madge ready to make fresh tea on entry found letter by plate directed in handwriting be very familiar to wanted to open at once instead pushed aside what glorious morning dear madge said lady dover dr inglis have already made morning report have further anxiety think at be so glad have pile of letter of have opened only about half abandoned entirely to talk to madge make tea sight of letter somehow diverted madge attention from own sudden thought struck be new lady dover said abruptly believe have be putting manner of visitor off because of poor evelyn lady dover looked up in gentle clear eyed acquiescence why dear be most important must be quite quiet said madge arrested hand be pouring out tea ah dear said day never thought of thanked spout of teapot poured clear amber stream on to table cloth have spilt tea too said madge do thank be frightened there be nothing wrong be going to take bandage off what will see will be there too help not to mind if be dreadful see see suppose loved face a well why not if be terribly changed have told will be must not guess that mind even see be different when hand tell have happened a will must still convince somehow that to there be difference oh want help cried indeed be not only for want for must convince that doe not matter at point lady dover failed little be not in spite of obvious kindness sympathy quite human enough to go to depth that madge gropings reached blind hand to trial difficulty came within ken loss of someone loved parching of love in what have be fountain must have understood fear of maimed face affecting love must not quite grasp idea of love may perhaps have be spiritually finer may also perhaps have not be adequately human there be pause anyhow since nothing immediate spontaneous

philip immense change have happened yet immense though be saw now be stranger who have written only only have learned something a said how begging for forgiveness cut to heart that must do while be whose part be only have not be woman enough have be sorry god know have be sorry for sorry for own part in catastrophe of july have known be inevitable must not have married must not have done otherwise than marry evelyn be perhaps sense that be tool in hand of irresistible law have excused to herself so that have said almost that be power that made three what be have done thus human pity sorrow have be veiled now that veil be plucked aside great inexorable law ruled feeling action nothing must alter fact that here be unhappy sick at heart that man who loved unhappy too be man enough to forget own unhappiness to forget too that be who willing unwilling have brought on let be guided only by divine human impulse of pity so that desired nothing in world more than to be allowed to help how bitter be somehow that must be of men in world who must offer to help offer be so humble yet so assured be made so simply yet here be philip hand again so authoritatively will want someone with to look after be philip too though be bitter what unspeakable comfort be to feel that somebody strong tender be waiting to take care of only asking to be allowed to take care of in spite of lady dover kindness madge felt so lonely one must understand so well a philip who have felt lonely too tom merivale be dead ah what be happening to world be happiness being slowly withdrawn from leaving misery only there seemed indeed a if sorrow like dreadful initiation have to be submitted to by everyone even who appeared to have be born in royal purple of happiness how much have come into own immediate circle in so short time to merivale have come in so blinding overwhelming flood that have killed who have radiated happiness to evelyn have come blinding also that cruel stroke more cruel because be so illogical like blasting of tree by lightning down in forest have stricken too have not perhaps dealt worst blow yet have come to philip through in way perhaps not le illogical for be not in to control love not to love meeting with evelyn loving be a much accident a descent of lightning flash scattering of lead pellet yet philip have not died though might have said that life be wrecked that remained for be hatred despair have struggled to shore stood there now strong unembittered held out hand to have learned something seemed from accident have learned perhaps not to call accident be right be vague line part of pattern of design so huge that must not yet see be design at madge have forgotten about breakfast lay still untasted while mused with wide eye a struck stood up pushed plate from greatly a have grown in human strength tenderness since day so few week ago when have promised to marry philip felt now suddenly like little child who wanted to be led there be dark place knew before must try not to be frightened must realise that there be nothing to be frightened about thus feebly hesitatingly put out hand illustration text decoration twenty second evelyn woke that morning out of one of cruel dreamless sleep seem for little while on waking to have expunged memory lay few minute conscious vaguely of something little wrong for moment not knowing where be not caring to make effort to guess then suddenly like stroke of black wing across sky memory came home for day whenever woke in hereafter must awake to to maimed ruined life knowledge of be more unbearable to day than have be yesterday to morrow must be worse must keep growing worse then out of utter darkness there grew little light might have be even more desperate how be that then remembered madge have seen worst of that have imagined be not true morning felt within sudden accession of strength long sleep acting with extraordinary recuperative power have set fresh tide of vitality on flow something have happened lately in spite of interested ah yes gradual compensating sensitiveness in hand have played whole partie of picquet with madge using card with raised index partie have only taken hour not bad for beginning to day perhaps must be little quicker to day also bandage worried with close clinging sticky feeling must be removed with regard to must not help half thinking that when be gone light however dim must reach surely blackness must become sort of grey be unreasonable knew well must not help feeling that must be so fact that thought about picquet have played greater celerity with be going to play even idea knew to be purely imaginary that must not feel so terribly alone in dark when bandage be removed pointed one way looked tried to look forward instead of brooding backwards in such matter a indeed in others will be deed provided only that will be undivided so for time utter blackness of waking moment be gone tiny thing of life a well a life ultimate possibility still retained interest while waited for breakfast kept feeling with nimble hovering hand at object within reach woolliness of blanket cool texture of sheet certain slipperiness of counterpane eventually determined to be silk covered then there be wall paper above head there be pattern on with hand traced way up slight raising of design stopping often visualising to what picture of course of finger must be like there be spray of sort branched to left ended in narrow slender leaf on right went higher before branched there be leaf there too above again there started stem like one have traced minute before yes repeated here for first to left went out thinner stem with narrow leaf then again to right branched narrow leaf forked out from have seen of course before on evening arrived here must not remember from that thin stem narrow leaf ah morris paper of willow twig feeling finger have given without exploration must not have known be enormous advance without pause for instinctively knew step came through dressing room adjoining called out oh madge discovery cried blanket here sheet here coverlet with silk on top paper be morris willow paper found that out want breakfast yet somehow madge heart sank at elation evelyn who spoke be old evelyn be in such voice with such joy of discovery that have told at pangbourne how purple of clematis must heighten value of pink butter haired jewess who sat in centre there be just same triumphant ring about a such be unnatural feared be recovering too quickly for elation there must be corresponding depression be too sudden to satisfy be instantaneous instinctive feared really without knowing feared have come prepared for further development of newly awakened interest in sens resided in finger have brought with small object of baffling shape have too in hand philip letter first two three be easy to knife certainly knife with edge to of talked dessert knife said not dessert knife because blade of dessert knife must anyhow be a cold a handle even if be made of metal blade of be warmer than handle oh shade of sherlock holmes cold handle warmer blade oh madge how easy paper knife of course silver handle ivory cutter ask have asked how be yet said quite well want breakfast say madge do know just for moment mind being blind see there be new sense to cultivate always love experiment ah damn there be colour left there be shape somehow feel there be lot to learn in shape there be warmth too of course knew that ivory be warmer le cold than metal now have found true without help give time be absurd dutch cow spindle legged huge of body head cream jug cow into cream be put via aperture in back on sat gigantic fly from via mouth be conveyed to tart be puzzling thought aloud over four said a thin a

abortion back tail be tail oh yes must be come from there curled up till nearly reach hole in back paused moment feeling with nimble finger though madge must not see forehead knew from mouth that be frowning then came to dutch cow cried there be insect fly must think sitting on hole at back where put cream in come out of mouth know look rather a if be being sick madge letter slipped to ground a applauded give that letter said will tell whom be from oh there nurse be breakfast be so hungry will tell about letter afterwards then for moment be silent mouth grew grave have insisted late evening

manage everything will give bacon if will give toast butter so buttered toast ate like child bite bite about evelyn chivied bacon round plate fed now now extra cup lingered on way one cup did for to madge be sort of rehearsal of what must be be rehearsal of best possible for what if gaiety interest in new game be last flare up must not feel childish excitement in entrancing sport of feeding other always besides even if did did not know yet what horror perhaps awaited under bandage of swathed face tender womanly loving a be must not help wondering a to that have put up hand for guidance leading wanted nothing else wanted to be led very strongly very firmly then when breakfast be done evelyn went straight back to identification game match box be easy because of rough side cigarette must not be pencil because of smell oh letter said dear be quite impossible said madge will tell whom be from with pleasure in fact meant to talk to about brought up here for purpose to read to interrupted again rather peevishly ah be finished then said dropping envelope what nonsense ca guess said be question of guessing brought letter in with did mention knew must see be meaning to talk about afterwards well be hermit philip besides if hermit wrote to must have told no be philip be more than ordinary reason must have done what doe say asked evelyn in harsh dry tone doe say be very sorry serf right be correct attitude must think madge put cigarette in lip wo smoke asked doe taste be like smoking in tunnel about philip now doe take correct attitude said if have how must have wanted to talk to about want to help evelyn will arrive here to night unless stop on way at inverness golspie corner of mouth be compressed knew be frowning philip said be philip be perhaps said madge be think thing have happened mr merivale be dead philip be there dead asked yes only know about from philip oh yes have guessed right can only tell what said mr merivale died because because sorrow pain be revealed to died very suddenly that gather died terribly somehow know more than what tell evelyn be silent little yet be happiest man ever saw said used to feel like convict in chain beside doe mean have got to suffer in proportion again broke off philip be coming here asked then voice got suddenly shriller more staccato wo see cried have come to gloat over god be not enough madge laid two hand on chest pressing gently down again darling said will not come for well then to make love to again cried know be cripple blind man blot on earth madge gave great sigh ah why say thing mean said why make dagger thrust at can not touch go on be silent dear else beg pardon be sorry must have to ask have said what be abominable oh want word just nod head darling will mean be said for sake of love must have token why doe come here then asked madge must not reply for moment felt so sick at heart helpless have fancied poor thing that have catalogued so to speak trouble difficulty evelyn have to face have to face with here be fresh one attitude of suspicion besets who have sense missing who imagine that even whom love trust most may be taking advantage of defect have be able to see face absolute frankness of expression candour of eye must have made impossible that merest shadow of suspicion must have crossed mind that peevish cry have come to gloat over to make love to must not have crossed lip for there must have be impulse in mind must determine word yet have be spoken by fretfully irritably causelessly cause there have be that cause be instinct to ascribe worst motive to action of others instead of assuming best be to be foe to more bitter relentless than sightlessness even that bandage concealed must not draw so deeply on healthful spring of kindly sanity alone can carry man smiling indulgent through fret of world for present madge restored balance oh evelyn said disappoint dear make bitter have be so brave so splendid philip be coming here proposes to come because be sorry for because in spite of injury did still love why not when ask if be coming to make love to then dear let something be not speak for utter counterfeit coin ring false besides have not heard letter yet will read then will take back what said did not mean to say read through word now dear said corner of mouth be tremulous be enough knew well why must not speak so kissed again more be said lady dover usually came up to see evelyn after breakfast thus be quite natural that must be there when dr inglis made morning visit have already asked whether might be there when bandage be removed so when came in now said be going to make little festival of congratulation morning mr dundas be to say if dr inglis will allow to stop see how wonderfully sir francis surgery dr inglis ' doctoring have succeeded so while be going on madge sat in window looking out on to broad sunny day bracken on hillside be already beginning to turn colour lady dover said in low voice for fear evelyn must hear be wounded that gold of sunlight striking gold of bracken made appear more golden there be time indeed for good deal of leisurely art criticism of nature for unswathing of face gentle withdrawal of lint dressing from healed wound took time more than once nurse went out to get more water for sponging away of gum of plaster for dr inglis kind man of silent sympathy a be knew well what moment must inevitably be to madge knew torture of suspense in must be awaiting sight of husband face brave a well knew to be knew also that must have here to summon bravery to aid wanted to make a easy for a must thus took great pain to render sight a little painful a might be must do so little whatever sponging smoothing be possible still be so small salvage for shot have struck sideways ricocheting off rock on forehead there be long wound healed indeed a well a must ever be healed outer skin have be destroyed showed long pink line a if perhaps corrosive match have be struck on such went across right cheek have crossed left eyebrow leaving little hairless lane between two severed side of one eyelid have be struck torn before pellet did deadlier work other though intact drawn down over hole of eye socket be not like eyelid of man whose eye be closed in rest sleep swelling gently over eyeball lying on lower lash hung straight like blind of window for there be nothing beneath to cause curvature kind twinkle eyed scotch face have grown grave over operation guessed what suspense to madge be rightly decided that nothing must be gained by lengthening then completed shaving operation nurse have begun evening before to uncovered part of face brushed into order thick brown hair finally adjusted pair of large dark spectacle evelyn demurred at what be for asked ah be necessary said doctor have to protect place of worst injury will always have to wear be afraid now think be ready madge got up from window seat though have wished lady dover to be there at moment cared not one farthing who be there who be not be only evelyn who mattered piccadilly might have buzzed round must have be unconscious of crowd looked saw for one moment stood there facing breath suspended only conscious of deep seated terror dismay face grew white once tried to speak must not for knew that dreadful exclamation alone must pas lip lady dover have got up too stood by looked not at evelyn at at madge before pause have grown appreciable whispered to say anything be coward be therefore a well that lady dover have come with otherwise anything might have happened madge might have screamed almost might have left room without saying word so dreadful be shock lady dover word be lash to power of making effort came back ah dearest evelyn said how nice to see face again for moment tremor in voice imminent sob in throat mastered yet week have be so brave for very shame must not put on semblance of bravery try to infuse speech with grain of courage be good be good to see said first physical horror began to fade little a love that eternal abiding principle slid out from under paralysis of other bandage gone plaster lint gone look do know too just just turned appealing eye on lady dover be unnecessary because be quite prepared to speak a soon a madge stopped must congratulate too mr dundas said in neat precise tone why look a madge said quite natural doe not madge really think dark spectacle be rather becoming will get evelyn have not spoken yet reasonably not for have be quite unreasonably suspicious once before morning thought detected insincerity in protestation with one quick movement of hand took spectacle off be really becoming asked do like better without madge again saw with movement uncontrollable hid own eye for moment lady dover again came to rescue ah doctor inglis wo allow mr dundas said evelyn still held away from face brutal a be thing have to be gone through once be on whole better to do now ah asked madge said quietly a spoke with other hand let finger dwell with firm yet fluttering movement over eye straight drawn down lid be visualised by tear in other eyelid be visualised also then hovering finger tip traced course of pellet through eyebrow felt like dog nosing hot scent course of scar where have crossed forehead to constructive touch truth be becoming hideously plain deliberately a felt traced set to believe worst sat a judge to weigh evidence of finger a bore witness to state of wrecked face of again again in day past have said meant also that did not wish to go below surface of thing eyebrow curve of mouth light of eye a have said to hermit be enough for there be symbol enough there since choice be so instinctive natural to be not possible to to dissociate others from a with terrible certainty framed to what looked like put into madge place seeing with eye framed also conclusion believed to be inevitable yet have seen before nurse have told so after that have heard with ear somehow seemed quickened in sense even a touch be authentic ring of love in voice have be deceived in thought like electric current through wire travel many mile in interval be not appreciably greater than take to go yard two rapid brushing of finger over face have be almost a speedy so when madge answered thought too have gone far be not conscious that there have be pause have complete command of voice now how can anybody be so silly said like best without spectacle dear a have to wear there be end of be embarked on big lie did not mind look so much better than did when saw week ago when face be being dressed must scarcely recognise at least feel now a if must scarcely have recognised then now there be need for recognition put on again evelyn there be strong light gave little gasp at end of lady dover heard laid quick hand of sympathy on shoulder evelyn did not for present be convinced conviction like burst of sudden sound shut out other impression here be then said be new positively first appearance favourable reception be accorded by sympathetic audience now be still there dr inglis what manner of reason be there must not get up want to asked why certainly then there be excellent reason why must when patient want to do thing be indication generally correct that be good for yes get up by mean again boyish delight in new game took possession of evelyn yet delight pity of stabbed madge like sword let do cried let clothes be put by bed let bath be put there let be left quite alone madge bet will be dressed in hour parting in hair will be straight added excitedly also be agreed to with provision that if felt faint tired during operation be at once to desist lie down again ring bell nurse busied with preparation for great event other three went out together dr inglis paused in corridor outside room mr dundas said have got to keep up know did well think ought to have done differently come come will have fainting next poor madge have be utterly overwrought by scene indeed a doctor spoke swayed staggered where stood got to chair in sat silent with closed eye for minute so then looked up at will get used to asked please tell if there be reasonable chance of certainly there be will come down in minute lady dover if will go on yes certainly there be much more than chance will get used to did not know by way that husband have be told have seen before that doe not matter now be idle to pretend that will get used to at once wo ca will have to be patient time must keep strictest guard on to prevent least suspicion getting to mind that be shocked by appearance know poor fellow more le what look like curious blind sense of touch be developing in with extraordinary rapidity convinced just now whole face flushed that mind must keep that up otherwise one can say what may happen what do mean asked still rather faintly just that hold on life be strong enough quite strong enough come to now mainly through one channel be rather cruel abruptness of be intentional well calculated did not dismay madge just braced got up from chair will be all right then said be sure will a will go away to day want to say little more to recovery recuperative power be excellent there be one thing altogether like mood vary with great rapidity great intensity doubt be always so to extent with yes said madge eagerly be just be so like surely be for good that must be so like yes within limit a need not tell have be through frightful shock not only physical mental quiet be best restorative of keep amused interested in thing a much a can also a far a can keep from feeling extravagantly mental barometer be jumping up down in proportion a go unnaturally high so will also go unnaturally low be frightfully tiring be to mind what fever temperature jump about be to body paused moment of course know difficulty went on be use saying tranquil ' can certainly induce tranquility in by being tranquil by surrounding with tranquility keep spirit level by keeping own level wo be easy now if be quite again will join lady dover evelyn spent several hour afternoon downstairs excitement of coming down for first time tired before philip arrival have gone up to bed again day too to madge great disquietude spirit have be jumping up down at one time must go on with identification game with most absorbed enthusiasm then again even in middle of must suddenly stop oh be use said why take hour to find out what be on table must take week to find out what room be like take on to terrace will madge let walk up down bit have be medically permitted with arm in hers strolled up down in warm sunlight evelyn sniffed fresh air with extraordinary gusto ah be good said be warm yet have got touch of autumn in what sort of day be madge be blue day yellow day well sky be blue began yes did suppose be yellow said what be rest be air between hill yellow blue oh lord what must not give for one more sight of must look so carefully just once tell about dear so madge a well a must tried to make see with eye told of brown foam flecked stream that wound crawled in shadowed gully below of steep hillside opposite climbed out of darkness into broad big sunlight of afternoon of feathery birch tree just beginning to turn yellow fringed moor of bracken tone deeper in gold of warm greyness of bare hill above with corrie lying in shadow topmost serrated outline cutting sky with so clear well defined line that sky looked a if be applique fitted on to away to left be pine wood almost black a contrasted with golden of bracken red trunk of tree burned like flame in beyond again lay big purple stretch of heather over ran riband of road to golspie then in immediate foreground there be clump of rowan tree covered with red berry found precarious footing so steeply did ground plunge towards river halfway down there be broad almost level plateau across flowed burn be covered with grass low bush bog myrtle thought big flock of sheep be feeding there shepherd have just sent collie to fetch up running dog be like yellow streak across green evelyn gave great sigh thanks dear said now will go in somehow think can stand more just yet suppose one will get more used to ah how unfair how damnably unfair cried suddenly why must be robbed like wish to god have be born blind so must never know how much miss to give sight to give glimpse of world just to take away again how can be just did like so be so pleasant never before have madge so felt utter uselessness of word how must word be made to reach yet how again must yearning of whole soul to console comfort fail to reach what said hardly knew be conscious of outpouring of herself in pity love held that poor blind head in hand kissed mouth kissed scar pushed up dark spectacle kissed dear empty eyelid horror have involuntarily made shudder when first saw face be gone melted vanished for have be superficial thing a little true self a little to be taken a index of what heart felt a sudden shudder of goose flesh just now at rate be swept away that must feel again often often did not doubt of took heed whatever pity love have come upon like flash of revelation be true best self though again again might fall back from flesh wincing being afraid yet there must be always memory of moment to guide direct there must be difficult time whole of rest of life must be difficult no longer presented appearance of impossibility how full dear to heart be evelyn response oh madge said worst of be thought that must shrink from minded that so much more than anything must not have reproached think must have done even to after guessing a have guessed what must be like for must have understood what understand be how be shrink want to understand be quite enough for that be so when be cross a will be despondent a will be odious try to remember what have said to now want to be remembered by so that be best moment too philip arrived by dinner train night with couple of other guest when rest of went up at usual early hour to get good night after journey of day in fresh air madge lingered behind for naturally wanted to learn about evelyn also about both also perhaps felt that be inevitable that must have one talk together must hardly have be otherwise began abruptly enough a soon a door be shut behind last of outgoer came towards with hand outstretched know want to say 'thank ' philip said ca help ca tell how deeply thank held hand for moment pressing closely smiling at be said then must say twice know be vain repetition have so much to say to other that have time for also must say once that thank for letting do what can must have be easier for to have refused help to have refused to see also must have be more conventional now about there be just one word more to be said be told once looked upon a elder brother well have got to do again be going to manage for have got evelyn to do a tell in practical matter because be practical be not great lump rose in madge throat day have tired so be such unutterable relief to have anything taken off hand to feel that almost intolerable weight of future be being shared by for moment must not speak just nodded to now be bearer of message first of said message be from mother want in fact insists on coming down to pangbourne for for period say have better be left indefinite london truly say be dust ash in september really must be best plan so will join with in persuading evelyn if persuasion be necessary ah philip said cut to heart make worse that accept generosity for evelyn sake be that be so ruthless philip lip quivered moment went on bravely well a elder brother recommend too said for be just want to be to dear ah do think guess madge got up drew chair close to tell about if doe not hurt to talk of said want to know what have happened to said because have to ask forgiveness for certain thing ah said yes will see because perhaps what have be through may help well madge have be through deep water water a bitter a be deep for month while be in london hated hated with such intensity think for very hard work did must have gone mad think only pleasure felt be when be cause indirectly anyhow of losing large sum of money must have saved that if chose did not choose must speak of afterwards loved time hated madge if can understand that be base hard in loathed because have made suffer there be something below very little thing like lump of leaven perhaps still loved infinitesimal better self time in london did not know there be in anything better than worst then one morning fainted told to ease off so went down into country stayed with hermit who think lived happiest life be ever lived on earth be contrast between perhaps that first suggested to whether be worth while to hate a be hating for a far a know be beginning of what happened afterwards made also throw away something have bought in order to kill never mind that then one night talked about pain on have turned back told that though must not understand how why be necessary perhaps might be that be willing if so to face anything might be in store for then must suppose little lump of leaven began to work because that night have talked also about free will asked if chose deliberately chose to be bitter hating found did not be not long after that week suppose that end came by then knew for certain be not deliberately hard longer be contemplation of happiness serenity have produced that have begun also not to stare at blank wall have seemed to face to say to myself that there be wall except of own making do know watt picture of hope of course do well thought string be broken be not there be just one left that knew must inevitably break if continued to be black bitter bitterness have corroded already philip paused moment be jawing dreadfully about said go on said tom died in night want to tell that in detail died because saw thought saw revelation of pain sorrow of world whether imagined not whether what thought saw be imagination only really care be sleeping in hammock out of door suddenly cry rent night called on god on christ when went out thought saw shadow like dreadful goat skip from be dead now how one learns anything know what learned be pity for sorrow so dear madge be here again hand sought oh philip philip said what can say to how must guess what love be till felt ah say that in excuse know that dear be question of excuse of course have only told that may never need to look for that may understand that be sorry for having be so bitter if forgive pressure of hand answered let leave past forever behind look forward only be better to have talked of just once so that may dismiss now tell about evelyn to philip somehow must pour out heart in way must scarcely have done to anyone else for knowledge of what have be through of bitterness from have emerged so unembittered threw open golden gate of sympathy spoke without reserve told of myriad danger difficulty faced of loss evelyn have sustained must not yet estimate too be only just beginning to realise for long time yet to come must daily grow more real to spoke quite frankly yet never without utter sinking of herself be love of mood transition from boyish cheerfulness to sort of dumb despair spoke finally of first mortal horror when saw face dread lest must suddenly overmaster so that must shrink from must see be said whom tremble for can stand to day will be able to stand to morrow for week perhaps month will get easier for to bear more difficult ca stand much more will break ah must think about said philip be use adding up sorrow pain may be in front of one one be meant just to bear burden of moment god know be heavy enough for face difficulty a arise madge make sum of say total be intolerable paused moment let bear that can shift on to said because otherwise see coming here will be purposeless hate being practical person doing useless thing twenty third be dismally wet afternoon week later evelyn be sitting in one of deep window seat in drawing room of philip house above pangbourne looked out on to terrace where only six month ago nightingale have sat sung on tom merivale finger below communicating with upper terrace by flight of stone step be bedless square of grass below again rose garden from ground went steeply down to river have occupied with closing shutter of row of window one of reaching down to ground communicated with terrace not satisfied with have drawn curtain over leaving room in darkness window seat be well cushioned having arrived at last slipped between curtain have drawn curled up in during last month have made so everybody said extraordinary progress must already read little fast enough be to say to enable to remember sentence spelled out with finger in raised type must remember card in hand sufficiently to enable to play game of bridge with stick to feel way must walk alone none except knew dreadful progress despair have made in mind have begun to be able once to look forward to frame future now future be unframeable be only able just to bear present moment soon might be unbearable too for week now dull weight starting from definite moment have be gaining on for week ago have gone with philip to lodge four year old child of lodge keeper have come out with father evelyn sitting down waiting while philip spoke to have called child who toddled up to then when got close burst into shriek of frightened dismay evelyn have understood said nothing about to anyone put fact away in mind when be alone took out looked at at moment be alone in house mr home be spending few day in london philip must soon be due by evening train madge be out doing small business in pangbourne have be unwilling to leave have made unmistakably ill temperedly clear must sooner be left thought with dull wonder at of fact that must have be cross with have happened often before in spite of recurrence never got used to always seemed strange to with wonder be almost incredulous thought how have behaved to to day for have come to with word man can only hear once to whisper woman nestle close to pouring out very soul in joy of knowing that will day put into arm first born child that madge have told felt nothing did not reach joy for for seemed longer capable of being felt have said only will never see be thinking about now if leaden contemplation of fact must be called thought of of child have cried when saw face over face passed sensitive finger be sure wonder said to door opened once a lay in window seat correctly mechanically pictured what be going on only one person entered that must tell by footfall one person whistled gently to paused by table then went to door again again re entered paused by then poked fire swept up grate clearly footman making room ready banged door a went out now if child have cried at sight of face what must be to others surely must cry too if obeyed natural impulse cry turn away in pity doubt also in repulsion must be effort to everybody to look at to be with madge be with so much kissed let kiss be wife wife of man with nightmare face at child cried out a if saw bogey philip have be quick ready on occasion have said child be teething wrung corroboration from father have answered yes teethes when see philip be not ready enough for that cry child explained other thing too for mr home have cried when saw must hear from voice that be cry there be sob in have thought then that be from pity merely sympathy told now that be not so cried from horror at life have hated ugly thing now must be hard to match in abhorred category very kindness too pity knew surrounded be scarcely more bearable did not want to be pitied must sooner be left to drag out lonely shunned life than to be
