indistinguishable be that boy colins friend contemporary have be almost embarrassingly admiring of while friend have found not le forward slip by colin in matter of hoarse laughter at encircling arm attempt at kiss have betrayed into forgetting brilliant falsetto giving whole thing away not le like to other now than then stood at entrance of terrace have gained perhaps couple of inch on in height piled gold of hair bare foot equalised that growth of manhood sheathed smoothness of cheek looked like replica of one type still almost sexless in glow of mere youth theirs be full dower of race

stroll vi colin paused for answer slightly smiling looking just above raymonds head two always quarrelled whenever met though perhaps quarrel be too strong too superficial word to connote smouldering enmity existed between presence of other be sufficient to wreathe with little flapping flame envy a black a hell a deep a sea existed between there be breath too light to blow into incandescence raymond envied colin for absolutely that colin be for skin slimness eye hair to degree unutterably greater for winning smile light ingratiating manner that so miserably lacked even for certain brusque heedlessness on colins part be interpreted in case into mere unselfconsciousness of youth in desire to please others raymond held to be at least equal of brother yet where effort earned for tepid respect colin must weave enchantment if raymond made humorous contribution to conversation glazed eye perfunctory comment must be wage whereas if colin eager careless have made precisely same offering must have be awarded attention laughter colin on other hand envied brother not for anything be for everything have be superficial antagonism grace of address person be subject for light envy yet sceptred fist of regal possession that fist be raymonds must be even violet perhaps stanier certainly must be at moment antagonism flowered over violet reply must go for stroll with raymond wouldnt

said more family dinner be not especially in colins absence in raymonds presence very talkative affair old lady yardley seldom spoke at sat watching first one face then a if with secret conjecture ronald stanier paid little attention to anything except to plate glass be usually left to violet lady hester to carry on such conversation a there be even required stimulus of colin to night subdued blink of spoon on silver gilt soup plate reigned uninterrupted have just ceased when colin appeared like lamp brought into dusky room sorry father said im late know wheres place oh between aunt hester

salutation across table smiled dear what odd time to say good morning said have have nice day colin oh ripping grandmamma said enjoyed minute of thats good great waste of time not to enjoy glance shifted from to lady hester hester dear what strange gown said aunt hesters go away gown after marriage began colin colin said father sharply youre letting tongue run away with very unusually lady yardley turned to philip mustnt speak to colin like dear philip said doesnt know about thing like to hear colin talk very well mother said philip colin didnt have mother to teach what to say what not to say continued lady yardley must not be harsh to colin stimulus be exhausted froze into again colin have be perfectly well aware during raymond be present that nothing of be lost on must be too much to say that have performed what violet called grandmamma trick solely to rouse raymonds jealousy to know raymond glowered envied be like round of applause to be from sympathy liking for grandmother that thawed thus brought back from remoteness did for gratification of own power in raymond above be deficient like antique bird have perched for moment on colins finger now have gone back into cage again colin chose night to take on air of offended dignity at father rebuke subsided into silence knew that one must feel withdrawal now even uncle ronald who with hardly le aloofness than mother for be buried in glass platter be remote from everything except vivid concern with food drink tried to entice boy out of shell colin be pleased at be salutary for raymond so youve be bathing colin said yes uncle ronald said pleasant in water asked uncle ronald quite said colin aunt hester made next attempt be trying to please mollify about walking in grass in bare foot said must catch cold at age what must maid think dont know at aunt hester said colin very sweetly raymond cleared throat colin be being sulky unpleasant eldest must make thing agreeable again wonder colin subsided after very ill chosen remark about aunt hester there wonderful stride be made in wireless telegraphy father said there be message transmitted to newfoundland yesterday so saw in paper good joke about in punch fellow said theyll be inventing noiseless thunder next there be dead silence then colin laughed loudly awfully good raymond said very funny strawberry aunt hester have hit mark leaning forward to pull dish

in father mind reluctance other than expressed dropped eye for moment then raised again to father face merry untroubled dont want to come with father said quite all right why not have told so philip looked at boy with expression in face that one else ever saw there tenderness for heart need of have shot into fitful flame twenty year ago have never quite be extinguished have always smouldered there for colin ill think over said turned round in chair be telling something about wireless raymond said a far a newfoundland be very wonderful few year ago scientist must have laughed at such idea a at fairy tale superstition superstition of one generation become science of next raymond by time be in state of thorough ill temper have witnessed evening colins easy triumph have seen how colin when annoyed a have be at father rebuke went into shell instantly one tried to tempt out again just now in low voiced conversation between brother father have heard father say still vexed with in sort of suppliance determined to try manuvre answered so well must have said just opposite remarked re filling glass must have thought that science belief of one generation became superstition of next legend for instance be soberly believed once philip yardley did not respond quite satisfactorily ah said getting up well will be going raymond have just poured out glass of port very unfortunately remembered precisely similar occasion on father just when colin have done same proposed adjournment repeated exact word colin have used then oh might wait till ive finished port said that did not produce right effect on previous occasion father have said sorry old boy have sat down again youd better follow then said philip dont drink more raymond youve have a much a be good for raymonds face blazed to be spoken to like especially in front of uncle brother be intolerable got up pushed replenished glass away spilling half of instantly colin saw opportunity knowing fairly well what must

accident be liable to happen when one loses one temper said philip ring bell please there be two table for card laid out in drawing room raymond coming in only few second after others found that without waiting for bridge table have already be made up with lady hester violet father colin have not given chance to play there now for next hour be condemned to play whist with grandmother uncle aunt dreary pastime at ten old lady yardley went dumbly to bed there be choice between sitting here until bridge be over of following uncle ronald into smoking room that found must not do jealousy of colin a regard father a regard violet constrained a with cord to stop watch contrast merriment with own ensconced sombre brooding then there be violet colins conjecture have be perfectly right for in fashion of staniers must be considered a in process of falling in love with desire for possession rather than devotion be main ingredient in bubbling vat be very sensibly present made ferment in blood though must not have sacrificed anything really valued such a prospective lordship of stanier for sake must not suffer idea that must not be knew too how potent in be stanier passion for home that counted a chief asset for have illusion that violet be in love with be so thought in love with two be much more like couple of chum than lover so sat watched round edge of newspaper have beguiled uncle ronalds impatience for dinner corner where sat be screened from player by large vase of flower on table near raymond felt that enjoyed though without original intention skulking pleasure of eavesdropper colin a usual be to fore just now be dummy to partner aunt hester who having added pair of tortoise shell spectacle to complete early victorian costume be feeling shade uneasy have just done what most emphatically ought not to have done be afraid that adversary have perceived colin have perceived too otherwise suit of club be deficient violet have already alluded to oh aunt hester cried colin whats use of pretending not revoked dont cling on to last club play have done with if dont youll revoke again aunt hester still felt cunning thought might be able to bundle up in last trick aint got club colin said reverting to mid victorian speech darling aunt hester mean havent said colin aint mean arent isnt grammar even then though be aunt aint lord yardley leaning forward

one revoke penalty of three trick doubled said father brute said colin honour at oh yes fourteen to above well played aunt hester wasnt pity deal vi colin having cut card happened to look up at big vase of flower stood close to table a did so there be trivial glimmer a of paper just stirred behind have vaguely thought that uncle ronald raymond have gone to smoking room there be certainly one there of two be have really no idea one else adversary partner be behaving a if there be one else in room so why not raymonds got hump evening said cheerfully won at whist lord what game because saw aunt janet pay crown with extraordinarily acid expression ask for change so a he won at card will be blighted in love expect he have knock from young thing at tobacconist in king parade think like best father itll be same daughter in law breathes through nose be marvellously genteel otherwise shes just like violet pas said violet hurrah knew must make pessimistic to be called like tobacconist philip yardley laid down card actually laughed colin low vulgar brute said dont talk so much colin imitated raymonds voice manner to perfection must have said just opposite remarked must have thought wanted to talk more make trump violet caught on oh got exactly colin said what did say that about go on colin said father will never finish colin examined hand three trump said not one two three glorious trinity there be counter challenge a lord yardley considered lead colin looked up through vase of flower once more there be one there still got up to fetch match from side table gave clearer view of what lay beyond hullo raymond said thought youd gone to smoking room just looking at paper said raymond im going now oh well have rubber said colin cut in thanks said raymond colin waited door have closed behind lor said just shut that door colin said lord yardley lady hester be thrilled about tobacconist young thing really must be rather good joke if one of boy following father example married baggage of sort determined to pursue subject with colin on future occasion loved such loose natural talk a treated to told escapade be just such scamp a colin first must have be with just such gift utter absence of moral sense be endowed indeed old legend so seemed to lived again in colin though couched in more modern term be medival style to say that for price of soul satan be willing to dower beneficiary with material bounty grace more modernly said that boy be incorrigible young adonis who feared god devil true lordship of stanier be not yet colins something might happen to grim graceless raymond how two hated other how different be exhibition of antagonism raymond hated with glowering bilious secrecy that watched brooded colin with gay contempt geniality almost if shrewd old lady hester have be asked to wager of two be most dangerous to other must without hesitation have put money on colin second rubber be short a hilarious a first on conclusion lady hester hurried to bed saying that must be fright in morning if lost more sleep violet followed philip withdrew to own room colin sauntered along to smoking room in quest of whisky uncle ronald be still there rapidly approaching comatose mood of midnight must have be inequitable to call intoxication silly to call sobriety raymond sprawled in chair by window hullo uncle ronald still up said colin youll get scolded uncle ronald lifted sluggish eyelid hey said oh colin be whats time boy half past twelve said colin adding on half hour wanted to get rid of uncle see how stood with brother doubt must have row gobble said ronald will turn in just spot more whisky good night boy a soon a have gone raymond got out of chair placed where must get heel on edge of low fender kerb hated talking up to colin gave couple of inch want to ask something said ask away said colin did know be in room when imitated just now hadnt given thought to said colin equally offensive whether mimic before face behind back said raymond be damned rude will come to for lesson in manner asked colin what do charge colin spoke with lightness of good humoured banter well aware that if raymond replied at must make sledge hammer rejoinder must swing cudgel against rapier pricked yet never land blow except on air maybe own foot beastly insolence on part said raymond thats very polite said colin may mimic how where when choose if like will laugh if isnt well will still laugh havent got sense of humour said raymond clearly violet thought have got to t probably heard what said from sequestered corner behind newspaper raymond advanced step look here colin do mean to imply be listening colin laughed want to ask question said didnt know that thought have gone away raymond disregarded then there thing what do mean by telling father about girl at tobacconist know be nothing at rather said colin said so seem to forget told be favourite thats part didnt like raymond flushed very well for to say that said know perfectly well that father doesnt treat alike thing be quite harmless in eye when do appear very different to when im culprit have have knock from tobacconist girl have youre cad to have told that quite apart from being lie colin laughed with irritating naturalness be first lesson in manner said im beginning to see hang of call other fellow cad liar about father not treating alike thats affair must never dream of calling liar for saying be not alike why must treat alike youve got foul temper see that doesnt add to popularity with anybody spoke in same voice in might have told raymond that have speck of dust on coat yawned rather elaborately take care dont rouse said raymond why not rather amuses to see in rage oh doe doe said raymond with voice quivering assure of im having most amusing evening thanks to have be pleasantest part of pity that so late raymond a usual have throughout worst of exchange be quite aware of have be ill bred abusive through loss of temper while colin insolent though speech manner have be have kept within bound of civil retort in sneer contempt in probability must give account of to violet to morrow there be need for to embroider strictly correct version of what have passed be quite disagreeable enough raymond wanted to avoid in view of desire that violet must look on a favourably a possible whether meant to propose to during visit here hardly knew certainly wanted to be in good book alone prompted now hated colin more because have be absolutely unable to ruffle pierce fine armour of composure a regard violet perhaps father feared im afraid ive lost temper colin said owe apology for ive said have annoyed by mimicking by telling father about girl at cambridge colin felt that have pulled wing off fly have annoyed by buzzing leg might a well follow certainly owe apology said considering everything dont quite know whether be proposing to pay raymond turned on fiercely ah thats over said oh be being quite natural said colin so much better paused moment now dont want to be offensive just now said so let sit down try to tolerate other for minute there raymond longed to be at throat to feel short strong finger throttling life out of smooth white neck careless superior vitality in colin made sit down let face raymond said loathe other like poison be nonsense to pretend dont unfortunately be eldest so in end will score however much annoy put in place imagine younger with foul temper must probably try to kill of course by accident im not intending to kill be very reasonable must be reasonable too just put in place raymond shifted in chair in colin with mere gesture of finger have made sit cant possibly get on better together colin said after a say come into everything on father death have stanier have million where have thousand can be very useful to adore place can let come here a often a long a like can also prevent setting foot in if youll try to be decent to promise that shant regret put head on one side looked at brother with air of pondering wonder oh that cock wont fight said know a well a do that when be master here must sooner go to hell than come here must sooner go to hell than let come perhaps ive got dull imagination use trying to imagine do be sensible if must do anything to injure at moment when be proposing truce know that must do cant cant hurt in way what do know be that can hurt in sort of way can poison father mind about pretty sick already can poison violet mind thats none too healthy see like most tremendously dont very much like just same at cambridge ive got fifty friend havent got one dare say not fault anyhow well call misfortune want to do something for in return for nothing can do for perhaps nothing that will do for raymond frowned when be thinking usually frowned when colin be thinking usually smiled if in future there be anything can do for colin said will do want to be friend with good lord isnt that reasonable be brother colin leaned forward in chair be aware of prodigious nature of what be meaning to say give stanier raymond said with what father be leaving with what aunt hester be leaving can easily afford to keep up dont ask for money just want stanier of course neednt actually be mine want to live here while live somewhere else there derbyshire house for instance ive got stanier in blood if on father death youll do there nothing wont do for paused can do good deal know said

to father didnt ask to discus conduct to consider own said will have own way conduct to be result of yours to yours to everybody else look at colin dispassionately tell whether must be a fond of a of acknowledge im not be fond of if come to im polite to until annoy beyond endurance a be continually doing if colin have behaved at lunch a youve behaved must have thought be ill im only sulky said raymond youre proving moment said father thats quite good instance raymond paused biting lip judge colins behaviour to father said by what see of think he like to when be alone he not he fiendish to dont understand that when youre there anybody else be there act part to make think that he ever so amiable how do behave to when youre alone together asked philip if take word about colin must take

james square if like wont have here unless make definite effort to be pleasanter companion a told colin morning seem to think that being disagreeable be monopoly of own youll find can be disagreeable too far more effectively than lie in power philip be quite aware that be speaking with extreme harshness with greater harshness in fact than really intended sight of heavy brooding face knowledge that be elder son who must reign at stanier when be dead to exclusion of colin made tongue bitter beyond control well thats ive got to say to said wont have insolent uncivil to one in house im master here for present rightly wrongly will do a choose wont have quarrelling with colin tell that when im not here when youre alone with he fiendish to be word used now dont repeat because dont believe youre jealous of colin thats why say thing like want to injure in eye only injure at moment there came into philip mind memory now more than twenty year old of in raymonds position stung by lash of father vituperation reduced to dumb impotence of hatred though felt quite justified in have said to boy knew that dislike of have plumed barbed arrow experienced sort of reluctant sympathy with ive spoken strongly said because felt strongly ive done if youve got anything more to say to say said raymond very good shant refer to again up to to do better in future put check on believe that if do will have better time with one else think over raymond be sensible fellow departure of others gave raymond abundance of leisure for solitary reflection father remark plenty of material for same stinging a hot minted sentence have be felt resentment towards orator from own point of view perfectly reasonable one father be justified in what said what did not know what refused to know be truth about colin who neglected opportunity quickness of speech unrivalled instinct gave a to what rankled festered of planting dart when be alone together raymond accepted colins hatred of just a accepted own of colin a part of established order of thing what made rage be new policy of brother to win sympathy for odium for by public politeness affectionate consideration one observing that a father have done must doubt who be aggressor in quarrel genial sweet tempered boy morose surly yet far more often than not be colin who intentionally carefully exasperated amused colin a have said to see brother in rage be ingenious at providing with cause of entertainment what above prompted father slating of just now again be colin be championship of favourite have given sting to tongue here too raymond acquitted father of motive beyond inevitable one nobody must possibly help liking colin better than be recognition of made mind brush aside thought of father attach with claw teeth to root of trouble be slow in mental process whereas colin be quick colin must land hundred stinging dart must wave hundred maddening flag at before got in charge went home that image of arena entirely filled thought colin light applauded matador savage dangerous animal one day raymond clenched hand till nail bit skin a pictured that light lissome figure with smiling face graceful air must side step wheel moment too late must lie stretched on sand while gored kneaded into hash of carrion ah said to thatll be good thatll be good intensity vividness of image surprised came to sitting on terrace with hum of bee drowsy in flower bed a if from doze dream have not arrived at from consecutive interpretation of hate for colin have not be evolved out of mind have be flashed on to a by vision outside own control there be now business lay in realising saw at once that must be in hurry whether goring kneading of colin be to be act of physical violence denouement of plot must lead to disgraceful exposure raymond knew must plan nothing rashly must test strength of bolt rivet in construction above must appear continue to appear to have taken father stricture to heart for sake to put at lowest of being allowed to stay on at stanier to observe general amenity of sociability in particular to force into cordial response to colins public attention temporarily must look bitterly like victory for colin with father to back must seem a if colin have reduced brother to decent behaviour must not be helped must for many week yet cultivate assiduous civility appear to have seen error of sulky way in order to lull suspicion fast asleep at present colin be always watchful for hostile manuvres must be work of time patience before must credit that raymond have plucked hostility from then there be violet not only have intemperate churlishness damaged with father not le with have to be repaired for though to know stanier be to even a to colin enchantment obsession might find that involved condition of marrying in order to become mistress be one that must not face did not love did not even like divined that obsession about stanier coupled with aloofness independence characterised might make accept companionship be not positively distasteful to be not stanier habit to love love did not form part of beauty with nature have dowered men of family sought healthy mate for woman of family so few have there ever be rule must be deduced violet so far a must tell followed men in for witness to inability to love in sense of poet romanticist be attitude to colin have be younger raymond must have laughed at for entertaining notion of successful rivalry colin with lordship of stanier must have be more vulnerable than be moon to yokel with pocket pistol felt very sure love a relentless compelling factor in matter have part in strong liking for colin feeling for for be ever so slightly dipped in infinite quality be ponderable have in pocket for weight in other scale passion for stanier colin strolled gracefully into smoking room that evening when whist bridge be over marvelling at changed raymond who have be so courteous at dinner so obligingly ready to play whist at poor granny table have kept up policy of solicitous attention to brother have made raymond grind teeth at lunch that day effect evening be precisely opposite raymond have replied with must be supposed utmost cordiality of be capable be grim heavy demeanour at best such a be doubt however raymond be saving up for such time a must be alone full power of antagonism colin pausing outside smoking room considered whether must not go to bed at once deprive brother of relief of unloading desire to bait be too strong turned door handle entered so got wigging after lunch to day remarked seems to have brought to heel bit can let go now raymond havent amused evening with tantrum raymond looked up from illustrated paper knew a precisely what seeing red meant a did bull in arena have to wait moment till cleared hullo colin said have come for drink incidentally real object be to see to have one of jolly chat did father pitch in pretty hot stuck up for morning when talked over raymond be off guard forgetting certain knowledge possessed be derived from overhearing yes said must make best of began colin be on to like flash now how on earth must have known that asked father didnt tell know said just a be passing under window in gallery where be sitting after breakfast word raymond youve perfect genius for eavesdropping be only last night that hid behind flower vase heard mimic if hadnt shut door of dining room morning youd have listened to what aunt hester violet be saying then overhear conversation with father youre perfect wonder raymond got up eye blazing take care colin said dont go too far colin laughed ah thats better said now youre more thought must get at soon raymond felt mouth go dry below violence of anger there be something that made heard youll spoil chance if break out said keep steady drained glass turned to brother sorry colin said im not going to amuse to night oh dont know about said colin ive hardly begun yet manner at dinner now amiability be not really success naturalness about sat on worse than sulkiest mood reminded of cad in dress clothes trying to catch note of ordinary well bred man better be natural ill go on sticking up for ill persuade father not to pack off ive good deal of influence with will say youre injuring by not behaving like sulky boor besides cant do if geniality at dinner be attempt to mimic must tell that nobody must guess who be meant for vi be very funny about really what did say asked raymond naturally cant give away said colin perhaps youll hear say again if youre conveniently placed know quite well vi didnt say anything about said raymond at venture naturally know best talking of vi be going to propose to wouldnt if be take hint save being laughed at most friendly of said raymond there be thing be business not affectionate brother asked colin dont know how feel for make wince when see blundering making most terrible gaffe odd must have have brother like that must be stanier at colin threw leg over arm of chair be most astonishing that not only in public now when there be reason that raymond must keep up semblance of control that must be so impervious to shaft that in ordinary stung so intolerably youre so awkward raymond said however much try cant charm anybody make one like youve manner look breeding youve got curse of legend without benefit youre coward too youd like nothing better than to slit throat yet youre so afraid of that darent even throw that glass of whisky soda in face for moment looked a if raymond be about to do precisely that suggestion be almost irresistible loosed hand on again must only give opportunity to go to father tell said must say have lost temper with dont intend to give such opportunity even a spoke marvelled at own self control plain fact be that temptation to lose have force with to night for sake of ultimate revenge might be that goring kneading of colin be le than necessary that must seem to have put away from hostility colin rest of violet above must grow to be convinced in change have come over rose better give up colin said youre not going to rile have good try at for never knew so studiedly insolent use good night during fortnight intervened before departure of lord yardley colin to italy raymond never once faltered in task have set there be act of patience too costly for due attainment of steadfastness of self control in face of colins gibe be not worth reward must ultimately bring avoided a far a possible being alone with brother that in mere trivial round of day happened often enough to give colin opportunity of planting dart two now seemed to have lost penetrative force so far from goading into ill aimed response be drop of shower on something waterproof colin be disposed at first to attribute incredible meekness to effect of father stricture raymond have be given to understand without possible mistake unless mended way must have to leave stanier that doubt accounted for assumption of public amiability imperviousness in private to provocation be puzzling neither answered colins challenge conducted offensive of own at most gleam flush told that jibe have gone home angry blundering reply must give opportunity for for reason raymond banked up smouldering fire not letting blaze impotence to make brother wince rage profoundly irritated colin have scarcely known before how deep rooted be pleasure in so doing how integral part of consciousness be hatred of now seemed to have be deprived of daily bread not le irritating be effect that raymonds changed behaviour produced on father on violet father civility to began to lose edge of chilliness certain cordiality warmed if boy be really taking in hand lord yardley must in common duty justice encourage welcome effort day before departure for italy made opportunity for acknowledging once more after lunch nodded to raymond to stay behind others want to tell raymond said that im very much pleased with youve be making strong effort with youre winning down line how go with colin in private raymond took rapid counsel with very well indeed sir said weve have row at thats good now what be plan while colin be away uncle ronald violet be going to stop on here think aunt going up to london can establish at st james square if like remain here ill stop here if may said raymond dont care about london philip smiled very good said youll have to take care of violet keep amused raymond answered with smile ill do best father said well all good wish said father let know how go colin have seen throughout fortnight raymonds improvement of position with regard to lord yardley have felt jealously powerless to stop once have tried with sunnily told tale of raymonds ill temper to put brake on father have stopped before be half through with raymonds doing very well said dont want to hear anything against further light be shed for colin that evening violet when rubber of whist be over lady yardley have gone upstairs strolled out into hot dusk of terrace with linked arm with more stir of emotion in heart than two schoolboy friend whose intimacy be to be severed by month of holiday must have experienced shadow cast by long yew hedge from moon near to setting have enveloped in clear darkness starlight glimmered on lake below in elm beyond nightingale chanted listen at look at said colin impatiently starlight shadow nightingale a cool a cucumber look frightfully attractive too to night vi why on earth dont fall madly in love with oh dear dont said violet might make fall in love with suppose neednt be afraid cant fall in love with anybody colin daresay cant will try what do mean by asked colin pretty obvious said raymond do mean asked colin of course whats come over there something attractive about after he got charm who must have thought though colin have just now truthfully declared that be in way in love with cousin felt pang of jealousy just a authentic a notion of raymonds possession of stanier caused in cant violet said that boor im not so sure that be boor he keeping boor in box anyhow have turned key on he quite changed cant deny colin slipped arm out of violet raymonds cleverer than thought said fortnight have puzzled to know what he be at now see he be improving position with father with have certainly done said violet so if asks intend to marry asked colin think so will hate if do said why how can matter to if be in love with must be different if be in love with oh weve talked over before there nothing new have passed through cut entrance in yew hedge into moonlight violet turning looked at companion colins face be brilliantly illuminated by optical illusion came went in flash looked at moment a if face be lit from within so strangely shone against dark serge of hedge for background there be unearthly beauty about that somehow appalled seemed like incarnation ageless youthful of fortune of house impression be infinitesimal in duration laughed colin looked so wonderful just now said looked like staniers rolled into one somehow annoyed raymond included suppose asked youre wrong there be something new hitherto youve only considered raymond a necessary adjunct to being mistress here now youre considering a man can imagine loving hasnt got enough already good god how hate have hardly spoken when there emerged from entrance in hedge through have just passed raymond colin white with fury turned on hullo at again said youve overheard something nice time raymonds mouth twitched gave other sign father have just sent out to tell that want to speak to before go to bed said turning went straight back to house violet waited till sound of step have vanished colin youre brute said youre fiendish know said colin who ever supposed be angel acting like fool to treat raymond like went on can afford to make hate laughed ive afforded a long a can remember said amuses well doesnt amuse to see behave like fiend said violet do know that lost temper ive never seen do yet colin licked lip mouth felt dry that be odd thing observed now know what make raymond feel like when chat together amazing that raymond must have done same to must go in to father moved back into shadow of hedge colin stopped say vi give kiss said drew back moment wondering why did so dear why asked be cousin said why shouldnt must awfully like to kiss have got over momentary surprise be doubt what made hesitate there be conceivable reason though did not kiss other why must not if wont said will think unkind of came close to oh colin im not unkind said kissed stood with hand on shoulder not letting go though making attempt to kiss again be delicious of said suddenly quite unexpectedly to herself violet found heart beating soft fast be glad of darkness for knew that heightened colour have sprung to face be colin too wondered affected in such way light laugh release of shoulder from cool hand answered good lord to think that perhaps raymond will be kissing next said how maddening chapter iii from first call of italian blood have made audible to colin even a train emerged out of drip roaring darkness of mont cenis tunnel there have be whisper in ear that be land of birth to have come that whisper have grown into full voiced welcome when at hot close of day father have strolled out after dinner along sea front of naples though have never be here yet sight scent sound alike told that be not so much experiencing what be new a recognising what though dormant have always be part of bred into very fibre instinct of be not that hailed loved lure of south must be more apt to say that nodded to a to old acquaintance taken for granted rather than embraced claiming appropriation by colin of native place unfroze in father reticence that have always observed with regard to year have spent in italy into have entered birth death that life held of romance till now have be incapsulated within at most like ichor in ductless gland be performing mysterious function in psychology now claim of colins on south easy stepping into possession by right of parentage unsealed in philip silence have so long preserved colin a regarded surroundings with friendly familiar eye be visibly part of old romance boy mother lived again in sunny hair eye clear olive skin just a surely a did old colin of holbein portrait now stanier be far away spell of south a potent a when philip flying from gloom jibe of awful old man father first came under enchantment colin of dead time alone be vital living part of manifestation through medium of memory stirred father blood philip felt romance bubble in again a walked along familiar way with flower have blossomed from felt too that colin silently for asked question seemed to claim right to certain knowledge seemed to present to be ready indeed must be singular if having brought here father did not speak of year have taken on solitary pilgrimage to south be to spend greater part of next day in naples leaving by afternoon boat for capri a finished breakfast on shady veranda philip spoke well weve got morning said to trundle about in museum be very fine must like to see must hate said colin marvellous collection said philip daresay to see museum must make feel like tourist at present dont lovely looked at father a spoke once again time compellingly philip saw confident expectancy in eye colin be certainly waiting for something then will come with on sentimental journey asked ah father wont just said after be on sentimental journey there seemed to philip in devotion to colin something exquisitely delicate about have wanted instinctively have not asked waiting for right to be offered come then said ill show where lived mother ill show old haunt such a survive belong to life colin colin paused moment sitting quite still for span of clear concentrated thought desired to say precisely right thing thing that father must most value be not in smallest degree affection for father prompted that be wish that door must be thrown open a wide a possible that key must be put into hand know do said ive known that for year have to wait for to want to share have to be who took into saw approval gleam in father eye be clearly right tack must remember know nothing about life with mother said youve got to begin at beginning make long father be not surprising that colins presence gave to sentimental journey glow have lacked during year when philip made annual solitary visit here already mere flight of year fact that have never married again have tinged that long past time with something of opalescence sunlit mist confers on object in hardly rise above level of mean prosaic what now survived for in memory be rosinas gaiety beauty girlish charm with forgetfulness for vapid vanity commonness speed with sens even have be sated with be unsubstantial memory of blurred far off day girt with regret emptiness of desire dead unrecoverable now colins presence gave solidity to be a if sunlit mist have be withdrawn from dim slope covered lo reality be not mean prosaic have absorbed very tint opalescence have cloaked there be colin eager sympathetic yet checking question of own thirsty for what father might give in person of boy who be only creature in world whom philip loved in whom rosina lived that tawdry romance of be glorified to tell colin about mother here in place where have lived together be to make shrine of flat rosina have occupied in naples when autumnal departure of visitor from capri rendered island so desolating to urban nature happened to be untenanted couple of lira secured admittance still held piece of furniture have be there twenty year ago colin moving quietly to fro eye alight with interest in little random memory father recalled be like ray of sunlight shining into place have long slept in dust shadow mother son reacted on other in philip mind new tenderness blossomed for rosina out of love for colin wondered at for not having brought together like before here be chair used to pull out on to veranda when winter sun be warm here be venetian looking glass rosina must never pas without glance at image now a colin turned towards there be rosinas eye golden hair flashed back at philip out of past made bridge to present there above be bedroom with glitter of sun on ceiling cast there from reflecting sea where at close of warm windy day of march first cry of new born baby be heard by same bedside at dawn of april morning philip have seen flame of rosinas life flicker waver expire regretted more to day than at hour when have left unconscious magic vested in colin cast spell for recollection colin have same eager listening face grave smile never even in baiting of raymond have shewn subtler ingenuity in adapting mean to end used father affection for to prize open lock of hundred casket enable to see what be therein wanted to know that father must tell about year preceded birth not asking question be surest way of hearing what wanted already have found that aunt hester knew very little about year if knew have not chosen to tell certain thing curiosity when have talked to under elm have be vague exploratory will be remembered have become slightly more definite when in answer to comment that father mother must have be married very soon after arrival in italy aunt hester have given very dry assent now curiosity be sharply aroused about point for with father communicativeness morning have a yet said word whatever that bore on date of marriage colin felt by instinct defied reason that there be something to be known here marriage scene date of must have passed through father mind yet did not choose in sudden breakdown of long reticence to allude to be undeniably so question therefore must certainly be useless for believing a did that father have something to conceal must not arrive at in way be standing now in window looking over bay philip pointed to heat veiled outline of capri floating lyre shaped on fusing line of sea sky be there summer said in villa will see evening then mother found melancholy in autumn came here used to go backwards forward for couldnt quite tear away from island altogether that struck colin a bearing on point be odd wasnt that newly married couple must do that must have expected to live here there together then afraid that father must think be pondering on that changed topic altogether have loved hearing about said somehow dont be shocked father cant feel that raymond come into one atom weve be realising mother squalling thing be cant feel raymond with then more than he with now let keep italy to ourselves father poor old raymond that shifting of topic be skilfully designed subtly executed colin confessed to alienation from raymond yet with touch of affectionate regret father be le guarded raymonds got nothing to do with italy said there not single touch of mother in weve got to ourselves colin raymond will have stanier lucky dog said colin there be one item connected with marriage that might safely ask a went downstairs put to father watching very narrowly feel know about mother now said except just one thing lord yardley turned quickly to ive told can tell said sharply be precisely what colin have be waiting for there be something more then question be ready with be harmless enough only wanted to know where be married said thats one thing havent told there be doubt that be relief to father have clearly expected something else not where of boy question when by now have definitely crystallised in colins mind oh that said stupid of not to have told be married at british consulate passed out into noonday mind remember that colin said father on death marriage will have to be proved will save search birth be registered there too raymonds such be sum of information that colin took on board with afternoon when embarked on steamer for capri though in one sense took back step in confirmed idea have grown up in mind felt certain here be confirmation that if have asked father when marriage took place must have be told date must not have believed lord yardley must have said that have be married very soon after arrival twenty one year ago have waited with obvious anxiety for colins one question have hailed that question with relief for have objection to boy knowing where contract be made retrograde step be whereas have be ready to think that father marriage be event subsequent to own birth raymonds be now forced to conclude owing to fact that father told impressed on to remember that have be performed at british consulate that raymond be legitimately born in wedlock seemed for present to be cul de sac in research warm soft air streamed by wind made by movement of boat enticed colin out from under awning into breeze tempered blaze of sun went forward found in bow place where must be alone study like map must be charted of discovery that willingness of father to tell where marriage have taken place be somehow disconcerting implied that ceremony made valid whatever have preceded have be born in mid march did not attempt to believe that father have be married in previous june month when have first come to italy must not help believing that father have married before own birth colin be one of rather rare people who can sit down think everybody can sit down let mind pleasantly wander over hundred topic comparatively few can tether so to speak so that graz on small circle only accomplishment colin signally possessed though now there must be practical issue to meditation set to carve out in clear cutting stroke what must have done in case have discovered that raymond alike be born out of wedlock imagined that situation to cropped at grazed on disclosure clearly if fact have be there must not have come out till father death must see looking on face of dead without slightest feeling of reproach knew that father be leaving must be left away from raymond be heir also to aunt hesters money in case stanier went with title must not be raymonds at raymond must be nameless penniless colins beautiful mouth twitched smiled must have be great fun said to raymond must have be nobody have have nothing have raymond must not have have stanier must have ceased to hate must have made small allowance yes stanier must have passed from raymond that meant must have gone to violet at that whole picture started into life colour if only now at moment be possessed of knowledge that raymond alike be illegitimate with what ardour with what endless subtlety must have impelled violet to marry how must have called upon legendary benefactor who for so long have prospered befriended staniers to lend art attraction of lover with such wile to aid must somehow have forced violet to give up idea of marrying raymond in order to get stanier instead renouncing stanier take by renunciation for love sake find in end that have gained bread upon water that have imagined be lost colin in case must be husband master of stanier to intent purpose willingly must have accepted eagerly must have welcomed that wanted what must never get unless raymond died except at such price a be use thinking about father insistence on place where rosina be married made certain that such fortunate catastrophe must be revealed at death presently lord yardley joined a passed along headland on sorrento stand there be story of visit that rosina made here during summer colin listened to with suppressed irritation what did care whether have spent week at sorrento not of that father have to tell have mastered everything mattered began to find in recollection rather ridiculous sentimentality knew of course that be responsible for be rosinas son father love for conjured up tenderness be responsible too in morning have listened with so apt sympathy to similar reminiscence then hoped that be about to learn something really worth knowing whereas now be convinced that there be nothing of sort to know fond a father have always be of easily detected something new in voice gesture soft eagerness of eye be a if in father be falling in love with rosina sunset burned behind capri a steamer drew near to eastern side lay in clear shadow though sea flared with reflected fire of sky that too seemed to produce more memory be so like colin said father laying arm round boy neck can imagine twenty one year have rolled back that be bringing across to capri for first time be just such evening a sunset crescent moon have already bought villa be going back to together straight from consulate asked colin quietly what asked philip from consulate father repeated yes yes of course said philip quickly voice seemed to ring utterly untrue straight from consulate have there giacomo boatman see doe remember mother asked colin surely dont ask about fellow chatter on for ever half lie colin laughed a shouldnt understand one word of said must make little difference whether be lie once again more markedly than ever a drove up angled dusty road set in stone wall bordered by sea of vineyard sense of homecoming seized colin be not that father be by that be going to father house spell worked through other side of parentage felt strangely more akin to boy who trudging homewards shouted salutation to driver to girl who clustered on doorstep busy with needle than to grave man who sat beside watched with something of lover tenderness smile glance gesture philip read rosina into who have so soon sated till wearied of woke in through colin love have never before be given can not imagine why never thought of bringing out to italy before said philip why when asked to take hesitated colin tucked arm into father be wonderfully skilful in displaying such little sign of affection cost nothing meant nothing be so well worth while do seem to fit into father said be so glad if do more than fit into dear said philip youre part of why on earth did never see that part of be thats exactly what ive be feeling day im at home here not what im very much at home at stanier lord yardley clicked tongue against teeth wish to god be eldest son said must give anything if be possible must close eye ever so contentedly when time come if knew that be going to take place poor old raymond said colin softly he doing best father suppose be generous fellow to say that shant forget here be bundle out carriage have stopped in piazza colin getting out felt lip curl into smile of peculiar satisfaction that father must believe to be generous fellow be pleasant in entire falsity of belief added spice to morsel seemed to like better just because be untrue colin stepped into drifting summer existence of visitor to island with same aptness a have graced entry to mother native land went down to bathing beach after breakfast with book packet of cigarette spent basking amphibious morning sometimes father accompanied after constitutional swim sat in shade while colin played fish in sea salamander on beach on other morning lord yardley remained up at villa suited colin quite well for uninterrupted companionship of father be very tedious always managed to leave impression that wanted lord yardley to come with so much morning did colin want to be alone have philip said that be coming with must probably have pleaded laziness indisposition for have that morning received letter from violet called for solitary uninterrupted reflection to day however philip brother in law salvatore viagi have announced advent to pay fraternal respect give heart welcome so ran florid phrase philip remained at villa to receive tribute nuisance said for must have liked dip must have to hurry back to get here before colin laughed speak a if might steal silver said perfectly capable of said father shouldnt have said that he perfectly capable of asking for colin perceived that there be danger of father coming down to bathe with surely can wait till get back said come down bathe father philip shook head cant said salvatore must think very odd rude if be not here wouldnt understand must think be intentionally unceremonious sound rather bounder observed colin doe said philip drily colin took violet letter down to beach with after short dip of refreshment from dusty walk came out cool shining from sea to dispose on beach quivered in hot sun ponder over read again twice through stirring into brain emotion till seemed to form part of so raymond have proposed to having asked for week delay in answer while matter be still private have to tell colin a far a knew own intention be meaning to accept yet letter in said that be going to marry brother seemed hardly le than love letter to appeared to remember that last evening at stanier when under moon cast shadow of yew have given kiss asked for just a vividly a did colin be vivid to because have asked for with definite calculated end in view with same end in view have exclaimed how maddening be to think that raymond must kiss next doubt raymond have done so violet though said meant to marry have perhaps begun to know something more of own heart be why evening be vivid to exactly a have intended must be have learned that there be difference between raymond being mistress at stanier might counterbalance did not cancel wetness have dried from colins sun tanned shoulder lying down at length on beach drew from pocket violet letter in order to study one passage again have puzzled here be be perfectly brutal to raymond that evening wrote be admirable in answer to rudeness if be to remain friend must not behave to like that dont like other at rate now have control over must copy example lord copying raymonds example thought colin to in ecstatic parenthesis will always do best to make peace between for be very fond of raymonds side will in future be mine be nice to afterwards dear colin mustnt ask to kiss again raymond wouldnt like with perusal be puzzling vanished thats not genuine none of thats genuine thought colin say what shes trying to feel what think ought to feel doesnt feel turned page hope news wont hurt went on after weve settled often enough that werent in love with other so when night said be maddening to think of raymond kissing next couldnt make difference to a arent in love with news did not hurt colin so told in way that violet meant be quite right about reason of that be not in love with struck that news must undeniably hurt violet be trying to wriggle away from while at same time tried to justify unfortunate must call fortunate kiss have given glanced hastily over rest there be more allusion to last evening more scolding exhortation about conduct to raymond a postscript request that must send just one line to say wasnt hurt letter of hers be absolutely private have to tell be about to happen in week time raymond must write to father who so raymond thought be not unprepared colin tore off final half sheet of violet letter with stylograph scribbled answer on have long ago made up mind what must say violet dear wrote be delightful of to tell send million congratulation be so pleased for now will be mistress of stanier seem quite to have fallen in love with raymond must be very nice to hell never let come to stanier in day to come will take side a say how must be hurt at news be simply charming father be having splendid time out here will try to persuade to stop on after month of course will come back before marriage when be to be do think best love from colin ink in hot sun dried almost a quickly a wrote have scarcely signed own name when wore appearance not of tentative sketch of finished communication ready for post reading over found that be so must not better so slipping back into pocket went across beach again for longer swim smiling to at ease with have divined violet real mind at fitness of reply a swam analysed own purpose in writing exactly like that have expressed with cordial geniality of be capable have welcomed violet choice have endorsed a regard own part of situation proposition that ought not to be hurt since be not in love with other eagerness of endorsement that swift enthusiastic scrawl must quite certainly pique have adopted attitude knew that must wish have same in fact have expressed when have said that be maddening to think that must be kissing raymond next colin knew well how fond be of letter must be like plunge into clear crystal of sea while cooled be glowingly invigorating be quite prepared to find in week time raymond must write to father saying that be engaged not for moment did believe that must ever be married have to keep up cordial indifference till violet found intolerable to have remonstrated with to have allowed that news hurt be to give violet just what wanted loveless marriage faced while time be not heart whole however much wanted stanier must be daily more conscious that condition on got be diet of starvation be rather in love with thought colin very likely letter will drive into accepting if only can keep cool pleasant shell never marry devilish ingenious then there raymond colin laughed aloud a thought of raymond who really lay at bottom of plan even if have be possible now before violet accepted to intervene in way cause to refuse instead of to take must not have stirred finger for thus must baulk of completeness of raymonds discomfiture since raymond must feel breaking off of engagement more bitterly than original refusal let violet accept first then throw over must be real counter irritant to sting of raymonds primogeniture appreciable counterweight to future possession of stanier have be check in fraternal feud raymonds birth own be certainly legitimate that nothing now must stand in way of brother succession if check in direction have not occurred there must never have be chance of violet marrying raymond must have be spared wounding humiliation instinctively colin felt sure be to be dealt raymond be genuinely desirous of must feel loss very shrewdly if only by diabolical good fortune raymond must lose colin saw violet by side smilingly observing raymonds final departure from stanier hoping that must have pleasant journey ala be time to swim shorewards again for morning boat from naples be carrying salvatore viagi have already gone by on tourist route to blue grotto salvatore must have disembarked at marina felt curious to see uncle salvatore be determined to make uncommonly pleasant for there might be thing salvatore knew father have not told date of marriage for instance though despaired of practical use arising from colin must like to know when took place dressed strolled up through vineyard through twenty one year ago father have gone tasting for first time liberty gaiety of south found little jingling conveyance awaiting quiet concentrated hate of raymond sat smiling beside up dusty road rejoiced in companionship colin found that salvatore have arrived father be waiting lunch for so without decoration of in way of brushing putting on tie sock went straight to salon there be sitting there very gorgeously dressed gentleman heart fell a saw for must be difficult to cultivate cordial relationship with so exquisite bounder information might be reward of effort salvatore be clad in ill fitting florid with braid wore patent leather shoe tie of pink billow in nestled preposterous emerald cuff collar clearly detachable gold watch chain from large cheap locket depended luxuriant hair suspiciously golden carefully curled crowned face fierce moustache brushed waxed be trained away to show mouth full of dazzling teeth feature be just of wax bust representing acme of masculine beauty may be seen in window of hairdresser with troubadour be sitting father stiff starched iced colin guessed that period of waiting have be embarrassing for seemed highly relieved at entry troubadour bounded to foot with tenor cry of welcome collino mio exclaimed kissing to colins great surprise on cheek ah joy of day when behold own nephew be so like so like look on image of ever carry about with forget no opened locket showed colin photograph faded into illegibility eye nose mouth said see again feature of adored rosina be so much worse than must possibly have be expected that only thing to be done be to treat a game monstrous charade be stock of have come mother be sister to marvellous mountebank at moment colin hated father how must have joined to of such family be clearer than ever whatever history of year preceding birth have be have not begun with marriage father have be prey to pretty face then set to play game dear uncle salvatore said cant tell how ive be looking forward to seeing hurried in a see when heard be here without dressing tidying must not wait think be like mother be true viagi be very image of if place beside noble brother in law will not think fail to mark certain family resemblance put hand on colins shoulder a if for bank holiday photograph rose on toe to make taller at noble brother in law catching colins merry glance shouted to play up father play up seemed to determine to make best of too amazing resemblance said rising two brother will go in to lunch please go on salvatore with escort of brother colin said salvatore in tremendous good spirit have clearly so thought found friendly heart in colin who must doubt in time warm heart of brother in law at present seemed inclined to be chilly be desirable that more generous warmth must be diffused there before came to speak of financial matter philip effort in answer to colins unspoken bidding to see humorous side of visitor be put to sad strain before portentous meal be over salvatore be bent on making fine dashing impression adopted for end manner compounded of brag rich adulation cousin collino own beloved child exclaimed never will vittoria cecilia forgive if on return prove to have got promise to pay visit before quit italy must persuade father to spare for day must dine sleep ho ho who know that when lady have gone to bed will not play bachelor in gay naples must be afraid be useless to urge dear philip to be of party ah happiness ah honour that there must be in palazzo viagi if lord yardley must make of family know know come here to enjoy quiet blessed memory very good of salvatore said philip a say come here for quiet be afraid will hardly be able to get across to naples ah il eremito a say hermit be not speak excellent english uncle salvatore said colin must not be not english language of adored mother be vittorias dream to go to england day perhaps will take vittoria to see home of english ancestor of grandmother of yours colin expense dio expense of travel once be not so with viagi did not need to count soldi now there be soldi to count be rich once wealth be colossal have not be for nefarious enemy slanderer swindler must be rich still line of prince a be have nothing left pride from poverty will never part head of family proclaim to world very proper said philip salvatore have hit quite severe blow on chest a proclaimed pride have set coughing be curable by considerable draught of hock started again on adulatory tack nectar nectar of god exclaimed there be such wine to be obtained in beggarly country must be millionaire to drink must die happy drowned in wine like must take bottle two away with said philip rising if will excuse for ten minute there be couple of letter want to finish for afternoon post then perhaps will spare quarter of hour salvatore for talk there will be plenty of time before boat go dear friend time be yours said salvatore boat may go to naples without if have not finished brought small toilet bag in case stopped night can doubt find room at modest hotel dont think will be necessary said philip leaving colin together salvatore poured out more of nectar when door have closed be making sure of taking bottle at least with pointed dramatically to heart noble venerated brother in law have never rallied from shock of mother death said heart broke life only for day when will rejoin till then be solace to to minister to who be nearest dearest to rosina so generous heart do think made good impression on to day admirable excellent said colin now talk to about old day uncle salvatore glass of brandy did see father that year spent in italy when married mother when be born salvatore paused in sipping of brandy made splendid scowl with gesture of fist rolling eye quick a lizard colin saw that must appear to know fact hitherto be only conjecture to if be to learn cause of grimace know of course uncle salvatore said can speak to quite freely yet ask if be there said salvatore must have permitted be boy of eighteen in bank at rome have known boy a be must have gone to father have said marry sister out of hand face vengeance of salvatore viagi colin held out hand must have done well uncle salvatore said thank for mother sake be so deeply affecting to salvatore that have to take little more brandy made take kindlier view of noble brother in law yet wrong said there be need for salvatore viagi to intervene for sister honour died countess of yardley alliance honourable to of family indeed yes said colin be proud of viagi blood marriage be at british consulate of course what day of month be do remember salvatore made negative gesture exact date escape said be spring march must have be march think two letter got from beloved rosina at time in one told of marriage in next of birth of son have letter still treasured possession for next news of rosina be that sweet soul have departed god what lamentation be mine what flood of never ceasing tear colin thought rapidly intently a replenished uncle glass with brandy definite scheme formed in mind possibility future reflection might reveal to must clearly be good thing to get hold of letter might conceivably want to destroy leaned forward towards salvatore dear uncle salvatore said be going to ask tremendous favour of have nothing of mother never saw a know be learning to love letter must be so treasured by have memory of delightful day must have spent together will give letter hope before long to come across to naples see cousin must good of if must give then will have something of hers sob sounded in salvatores voice will have colin said in turn perhaps can do something for intercede pray with father be generous noble soul doe not know need be too proud to speak of tell then that wrung out of that be in abject poverty vittoria be growing up dowerless maiden be not sought after of course will do can said colin warmly will talk to father a soon a have gone may say that listens to will send off letter to to night said what joy will there be in casa viagi when girl know that cousin colin be to visit when will happy day be ah must write to about said colin noticing that palazzo have become casa leave card now be time for to talk to father will see if be ready not word of have be saying to trust nephew said salvatore gaily chapter iv colin used good office with father to such effect that succeeded in procuring for salvatore further substantial cheque in addition to have carried off with two bottle of wine that afternoon uncle apparently thought better of reckless generosity in sending letter of colin be desirous quite unconditionally receipt of second cheque be sufficient morning post two day later brought be written in ill spelled english contained precisely what uncle have told first dated march gave information that have be married that morning to philip lord stanier second dated march stated that week ago have given birth to twin be quite brief conveyed other news have evidently be preserved with care for purple ink in be written be quite unfaded apart from fact now definitely known to colin that father have legalised life with rosina ten day before raymond be born did not help in way towards attainment of double object now be putting out firm fibrous root in mind a ideal project namely to prove by mean yet utterly unconjecturable illegitimacy of raymond by marrying violet who in case must succeed to title estate to become master of stanier indeed letter be proof more of what be doubt sufficiently attested in register of british consulate namely that marriage have taken place previously to own birth seemed hopeless business even if by rare lucky mischance there be irregularity in record at consulate letter so long a be in existence constituted if not proof at rate strong presumption in favour of marriage having taken place on first of month might be better to destroy out of hand so that such testimony a afforded must not by possibility be produced yet hesitated somehow in subconscious mind perhaps there be stir ferment bubbled with suggestion have not yet reached consciousness might not something conceivably be done with be maddening just ten day out of uneventful hundred of day have elapsed since must suffice to wreck project that might make then bubble of ferment broke into conscious mind there be letter announcing marriage have taken place day dated march there be letter dated march announcing birth of raymond week previously what if by insertion of single numeral in front of of first date converted into march st a far a two letter went must in case show precisely what desired psychologically too there must be reasonable interpretation in father must be argued there have sprung up after birth of son tenderness affection for mother of have married so that in future might bear legitimate offspring already have borne two lusty healthy son union be vigorous fruitful colin got up from long chair in bedroom where have taken letter began softly pacing up down floor lithe alert smiling father be coming down with to bathe that morning there be quarter of hour yet before need join downstairs great deal of thinking might be put into quarter of hour if must only concentrate knew be very far yet from attainment of ambition for register at consulate somehow must manage to see might contain insuperable obstacle to success there might for instance be other entry between march of year march so that even if must contrive to alter first date into second must throw other entry if such existed out of chronological order marriage contracted on march must precede lay in between two date in case might have to tear out page in entry occurred that might be quite impossible of accomplishment must not be wise at rate to tamper with date on first letter of mother till knew how ground lay at consulate given that proved possible to make alteration in register tear out page how conclusively must case be established if in support of there be produced letter of mother salvatore troubadour colin frowned bit lip at thought of salvatore who must be ready to swear that when parted with letter to colin one conveyed news of sister marriage be dated march not march there be expert on such subject too prying meticulous men who made profession of detecting little thing like altered date produced evidence about difference of hand difference in analysis of two ink yet if register at consulate be found to endorse evidence of letter same detective minded folk must examine record at consulate might arrive at damnable conclusion that too have be tampered with if letter bore sign of being tampered with be in colins possession be known to have visited register at consulate there must be unwelcome conclusion a to who have committed forgery penal servitude be not agreeable substitute for stanier colin focused clear brain a if have be lens on salvatore have be very decorative melodramatic on subject of sister honour there have be much of cheap strutting of tinsel of footlights about salvatore so colin reasoned with melting smoothing out of frown be not strutting swagger there be very real side to impecunious uncle with undowered vittoria concern for sister honour be not surely so dominant in a desire for coin suitable cheque must doubt induce to recollect that first of rosinas letter announced birth of twin second that of march marriage salvatore for love of vittoria to put at must probably see sense of allowing memory of date at head of letter to be faulty must not be obliged to perjure in way all have got to do given that page have be torn out of register at consulate that date of marriage a recorded there be march be to swear that sister letter have always be in possession until have given to attractive nephew yes salvatore must surely not prove insuperable obstacle must rate living vittoria higher than dead for one moment brief a in according to legend ancestral colin have considered whether must close with strange offer made in sheep fold descendant living incarnation hesitated when thought of father father have always be devoted to such affection a colin be capable of be after philip must necessarily be dead when if discovery be made that rosinas letter to brother gave date of marriage a march when on search being made in register of british consulate be discovered that owing to page being missing there be record of marriage at that date given there corresponded with of rosinas letter colin have intention of producing evidence in father lifetime there might be counter proof father must produce if must only make dealing with register with date on letter must let whole matter sleep till father be dead then nothing must hurt can not hurt dead even if colin gave little thought to spirit of dead survived in consciousness of living must not father spirit gladly make posthumous sacrifice of earthly honour rejoice to see colin beloved master of stanier so hesitation be fleeting a breath on frosty morning appeared mistily dispersed father out in garden be calling with cheerful response picked up towel went downstairs for present there be one necessary step to be taken have to get day in naples before left pay visit to british consulate be use making further plan beyond in ignorance of what must find there visit to uncle night spent there might possibly serve a excuse philip have also heard from brother in law morning communication be not so satisfactory to a colins post have be ive heard from salvatore said he nauseating fellow colin oh only comic father said colin gaily take too heavily read said philip letter be certainly characteristic a colin read smile broadened into laugh writer spoke of deep humiliation be for viagi to take gift from have not be so with once for family have be dispenser of royal bounty indeed two consideration only made possible for to do so first paternal devotion to two sweet maid vittoria cecilia second fraternal devotion to noble generous relative sentiment did honour to with happy tear of gratitude acknowledged safe receipt of cheque wrote with distraction for sweet maid kept interrupting to know if have sent most respectful love to uncle have reminded dearest colin that looked for advent with prodigious excitement pleasure demanded to know when hour must dawn for one bottle of nectar of france must be preserved for day to drink health of friend relative noblest of benefactor signed viagi a if princely honour have be restored oh priceless said colin havent got sense of humour father not where salvatore be concerned a for going over to dine sleep shant let do know weve only got fortnight more here colin know isnt awful said colin with sigh about going over for night wonder if hadnt better do that must be kind know must like philip passed hand over boy shoulder colin be growing wing said yes dont go well with cloven hoof in other word must loathe spending night there yet uncle salvatore must like then dont want to leave dont then salvatore thanks to have got double usual allowance youve done enough for yes that didnt cost anything said colin only cost ive still debt to pay for wonderful entertainment gave here besides be actually uncle im viagi princely line father dont marry one of young princess said father colin have one moment acute thought before answered struck that father must hardly have said that if in very self have loved mother what have said just came from very self laughed ill promise not to however entrancing vittoria be said ah how divine sea look morning long to be in sudden idea occurred to do let stop on fortnight father said cant cant said must get back by end of month paused moment colin knew that have caught own idea suggestion be designed to prompt there reason why shouldnt have fortnight here if want said colin have fallen behind father on narrow path to bathing place gave huge grin of satisfaction at own subtlety oh must love that said though wont be half a much fun a if must stop too then can go over to naples with when start homewards make wing sprout by staying with uncle salvatore nothing must have fallen out more conveniently colin a for next two hour floated in warm sea basked on hot pebble have very busy mind in lazy drifting body father absence must certainly make investigation easier must for instance present lord yardleys card at consulate with own get leave to inspect register with view to making copy of in accordance with father wish better yet must spend few day in naples make acquaintance of consul in casual manner produce request on heel of agreeable impression must not in case be limited to single visit tied by necessity of acting at once must not have to fire bribe with regard to letter like pistol in salvatores face must be careful deliberate not risking false step owing to need of taking immediate one time suggestion of stopping on here alone have not come from at father have made on way up to villa again after morning bathe often called at post office in piazza for letter have arrived by midday post to day be handed under grille to colin sorting out between father observed that there be two for lord yardley in handwriting of raymond violet possibly be only dutiful trivial communication of at home possibly violet week of postponement have be shortened two from stanier for father said violet raymond rest for father looked at envelope yes raymonds spider scrawl be evident enough said never saw such handwriting except yours yours can never tell apart one want leisure to decipher raymond colin simmered with impatience to see father put of letter into pocket simmered even more ebulliently when having put on table at lunch father appeared to forget completely about left there when lunch be over colin must remind of presently one from violet lay open father gave exclamation of surprise then be absorbed in appeared to be short for presently have finished still without word to colin opened letter from raymond here exclamation of impatience at ugly illegible handwriting took place of surprise be ten minute more before spoke to colin meantime have settled with in case letter contained what guessed for certain that must contain that since violet previous warning to be private must let news that father must presently tell be big emotional surprise to must entail dissimulation be difficulty colin knew to be most convincing when brain not sincerity dictated behaviour have violet raymond written to to day asked father colin yawned generally took siesta after long morning in sea sun be already past usual hour there be pleasant fiction that retired to write letter said getting up well im off lot of letter wait moment violet raymond send news plea very much theyre engaged to be married colin stared then laughed id forgotten be first of april said thought be in june be said father joke colin im quite serious colin looked fixedly at father for moment ah said getting up walked to window stood there with back to room twirling blind string seeming to assimilate news then a if making strong effort with turned again sunshine by jove raymond will be happy said how how perfectly splendid he head over ear in love with have be for last six month lucky dog he got everything now must play on father like skilled musician making chord wanted to sound with never mistake word he got everything now conveyed exactly impression intended namely that violet be to important part in raymonds possession be right chord sounded be great surprise to colin said yes father said surprise then be that violet have accepted said lord yardley gently felt to be probing colins mind ever so tenderly while colin looked at wide eyed like child who trust surgeon yes father said again surprised very much be magnificent knew just what be passing in father mind unstinted admiration of for having so warm heartedly welcomed news of raymonds good fortune unstinted sympathy because father have guessed reason why violet engagement be shock to be immensely to good for when a felt doubt must happen violet threw over raymond for lord yardley must certainly remember with what magnanimous generosity have congratulated raymond on success whether anything came of project about register not be determined to marry violet for so thirst of hatred of brother must be assuaged how long how sweet must drink be if in cup be mingled other also father came across room to where still stood by window laid loving hand on shoulder colin old boy said be fond of violet like colin nodded without speech have idea of said lord yardley often watched together thought be only a brother sister upon word raymond seems to have got everything colins smile be inimitable seemed to fight way to beautiful mouth ive got father said out of sheer exuberance of wickedness subject be renewed that night when sat under vine wreathed pergola where have dined sun bowling down steep cliff away westward have just plunged into sea darkness came swiftly over sky without long drawn period of fading english twilight in day be slowly transformed into night here night leaped from lair in east with gulp absorbed flame of sunset swiftly star sprang from hiding place where day have lain concealed burning large low made diffused penetrating greyness of illumination that dripped like glowing rain from whole heaven dim veiled though luminance be compared to faintest of light of day gave curious macabre distinctness to everything colins face in pool of star shine filtered between trailing garland of vine wore to father strange wraith like aspect so often have sat here in such light a with rosina opposite that loved in rosina seemed now to have be reincarnated spectre like in boy cared more for than cared for rest of world that have missed in woman who have satisfied so soon sated physical sens flowered in colin with quick intelligence sunny affection father for longing must hing to help in darkness have overshadowed dawn of love for instead of colin raymond have got son of whom have never liked even have always in naturally unnatural manner be jealous of in must inherit that own finger must one day relax hold on have be colin who must grasp sceptre of staniers philip must a have said close eye for last sleep in unenvious content now raymond have got desire of heart a well too be desire of colins heart day since arrival of letter colin have be very quiet yet without bitterness grave sweet only shadow ghost of for gaiety now face pale in starlight be ghostlike also father divined in uncomplaining suffering infinitely pathetic colin wish must do anything for said with unusual emotion be such dear fellow bear with such

worth thinking over often especially during last week have known that father love for bored a considered a abstract quality though welcomed a mean to end end invariably have be not only material

there for moment that rather vexed seemed to disturb own isolation for wanted to be entirely encompassed in be inconsiderate of father to go quarter decking out there intruding into own consciousness besides colin have told that be sleepy must have kept quiet then explanation of ramble up down occurred to colin there must be doubt that father be troubled for be made restless by thinking of disappointment that made colin smile not for pleasure in father love for pleasure in trouble be worrying over colins aching heart boy have smile for pleasing thought have incense for began to wonder idly at first with growing concentration whether hated father did not wish ill supposing business of register be satisfactorily accomplished supposing succeeded a felt doubt must in causing violet to throw over raymond marry did not see that there must be much gained by father continued existence must be in way then must stand between mastership through violet of stanier that from passion for

other while acquisition clutching holding stretched a far a renunciation who lived for must not be satisfied until have grasped more than who lived for others must not be satisfied until have given retaining nothing out of self love with violet a wife legal owner of stanier raymond outcast disinherited seemed to colin that must have wanted yet in flush of desire combed through now a tide comb

after only to insert similar three in letter mother have written to salvatore announcing marriage on hot evening ink must dry a soon a touched page yet paused brain beginning to bubble with notion better yet more inspired more magically apt colin gave little sigh smile dawned on face wrote in three making date of march into march then once again paused watching with eager eye for ink to dry on

magnificently well than conscious brain have ever suggested to no longer time than be reasonable for act of copying alone have elapsed before colin laid down pen went into next room well mr stanier have done copying asked cecil yes will bring here for signature said colin mr cecil climbed down from high stool where be perched like fat cheerful little bird no said must be more business like than must compare copy with original entry before give signature colin knew that skill with have effected alteration yet left entry unaltered must now be put to test felt qualm whatever a to detection idea have be inspired have doubt that execution of be on same level of felicitous audacity passed back into archive room together consul sat before volume copy yes march first march first said comparing

private life be own then shed english skin in spite of diversion of city colin be brisk enough in morning to catch early boat once more a have done month ago on initial visit to island sequestered from crowd under awning sought solitude in dipping bow of little steamer to day however there be chance of meditation being interrupted by father with tedious talk of day spent at sorrento irksome demonstration of love be there to be responded to must without hindrance explore not only future path le estimate significance of what have done already once more then register of father marriage be secure in keeping of consulate mr cecil have looked at compared colins copy now lay safe in breast pocket of coat with original have certified to be correct colin have run no risk by inserting then erasing figure might prove on scrutiny to be subsequent addition mr cecil have be unaware that change have be wrought on page when register on lord yardleys death must be produced in accordance with plan be already ripening maturing in colins mind close scrutiny must reveal that have be tampered with hand unknown have clearly erased figure there altering date from march to march object of must be clear enough for legalised birth of twin rosina have borne be in interest of of four people to commit forgery of father of mother of raymond of rosina be dead now many year father when register be next produced must be dead also from dead lip must come denial defence raymond might be left out of question altogether for never yet have visited mother native city of alive when register be produced suspicion must only possibly attach to must have be in interest to make alteration must establish legitimacy a well a of brother colin a sat alone in bow fairly burst out laughing before proceeded to consider wonderful sequel must be suspected must then how must come about that be who in nobility of stainless honour must produce own mother letter given by uncle in announced to brother that be married at british consulate on st of march have be responsible for erasure in consulate register to legitimatise own birth how conceivably must not only not conceal bring forward very evidence that proved illegitimacy have tampered with consular book must have destroyed letter invalidated forgery instead of destroying must produce there be work ahead of here intrigue in salvatore must play part work of course be in nothing insertion at top of one of two letter owned of just that one figure have inserted erased again in register be manual material business bottle of purple ink five minute practice must do intrigue be more difficult salvatore must be induced to acquiesce in fact that date of letter announcing rosinas marriage be subsequent to announcing birth of twin must require thought circumspection there must be false step there be preliminary manuvring for great action whereby though at cost of own legitimacy must topple raymond down from place send away outcast penniless with violet for wife now legal owner of wealth honour of family become master of stanier might for love of believed be budding in heart throw raymond over marry without cognisance of what have done for knew from knowledge of how overmastering passion for stanier must be might happen that must choose raymond with marriage to meant stifle cry of love in case perhaps indeed in case colin might find better to make known to whole namely that on father death must find in position to contest succession claim everything for own of raymond must choose to have for husband in changed circumstance disliked proposed to tolerate one for sake of great prize of possession be devoted to other who so must learn have become possessed of fact on ownership be established must tell reveal part in on point allowed decision to remain in abeyance what must do whether must tell violet nothing part must depend on circumstance for present must waste more time over for present too must keep signed certified copy of father marriage point demanded immediate consideration be that concerning salvatore colin puzzled out sometimes baffled frowning sometimes with clear course lying serene in front of smiling eye a steamer leaving promontory of mainland behind approached island must see salvatore whom have quite omitted to see in naples a soon a possible must be much better to see here in privacy of villa than seek thought colin in publicity of palazzo viagi surrounded by siren dame vittoria cecilia must write at once pensive yet hopeful little epistle to uncle salvatore wondering if must come across to capri yet once again not for mere inside of day only for more hospitable period father have left for england colin be alone there be matter to be talked over weighed on conscience be good phrase uncle salvatore must remember what colin have already done in matter of reduplicated cheque must seem that generous fellow have debt of conscience yet unliquidated conveyed precisely right impression in postscript must hint at french nectar still dozing in cellar hesitated moment then decided not to mention subject of mother letter for be better that since be sole concern of visit uncle salvatore must have matter sprung upon bottle of purple ink must not be necessary yet for later that definitely committed to course of action better colins letter produced just effect that have calculated on salvatore read into conscience clause generous impulse congratulated on departure of grim dry brother in law to whom for have tried that before tear frayed cuff made appeal have accordingly given that up for last visit here made nobly resplendent to colin in guilelessness of blue eyed boyhood tale of pinching penury might be suitable revelation be proud shabby figure presented at villa few evening later without more luggage than must be conveniently conveyed in paper parcel colin who have be observing approach from balcony of bedroom ran down choking with laughter must be choked to let uncle in ah be nice said have idea how welcome be be good of to take pity on loneliness what jolly evening will have vittoria cecilia how be gleam brightened uncle salvatores gloom fervently pressed colins hand be well thank god said while be so what matter anything appeared with gesture of hand to pluck intruding creature from region of heart throw into garden bed then gave little skip in air collino mio said charm away sad thought happens to morrow will be gay to night will not drag brightness down into gloom darkness away with then colin fathomed mountebank mind with undeviating plummet depth willowness of answered fairest expectation found nothing inconsistent in aspect of salvatore with have last presented here two in fact tallied with utmost exactitude a expression of one mind chimed true to inspiring personality waited completely confident for advent of opportunity came towards end of dinner without even having be hilarious salvatore have at least be cheerful now a suddenly a if tap have be turned off flow of enjoyment ceased sighed cleared throat supported head on hand stared at tablecloth to colin signal be unmistakable youre in trouble uncle salvatore said softly now for first time be glad that father have gone back to england if be here must not be able to say what mean to say for after be father have always be most generous to be not equally generous to others who have claim on have tried to make see a know have succeeded to small extent extent to have succeeded doe not satisfy considering know be determined to do better for than have be able to make do if be son be equally mother son be brother colin paused moment sudden a highland spate inspiration flooded mind have not thought out with precision what meant to say for must depend on salvatore who might equally well have adopted attitude of proud flashy independence have declared for frayed cuff fit of gloom colin shaped course accordingly cant forget said that be who put in possession of certain fact when sent two letter of mother learned from have never dreamed of before never in wildest nightmare thought that father have not married sister till after birth must have have to know sometime on father death must have come out have shown wonderful delicacy in breaking fact to like thank for uncle salvatore owe deep debt of gratitude hope to repay colin listened to own voice seemed to make articulate without directing will of own summer night be charged with force of obedience to tongue moved against teeth lip formed letter throat gave guttural literally did not know what be going to say till heard saying breeze whispered in stone pine spoke breeze be still now stone pine be silent have said enough to make necessary that salvatore must reply presently bat must flit through arch of pergola where dined wind must stir in pine then must speak again there be just that same stir abroad on night when have listened from bedroom to father footfall on terrace what do mean collino said uncle excitedly can not understand what say sainted rosina married father on first of march for glanced at letter again before sent to birth colin interrupted bat said love bat if hold handkerchief up doe not bat come to let interrupt conversation for moment spread handkerchief over head next moment salvatore leaped to foot for there beady eyed diabolical with hooked wing a of parchment spread out on side of furry body one of great southern bat alighted making cap for colins golden head only for moment stopped there then flitted off into dusk again soft furry thing said colin hate do uncle salvatore be stupid of let talk again hitched chair little closer to table looked salvatore straight in eye have forgotten date on letter gave said mother be married to father not on first of march on thirty first second letter recording raymonds birth mine be written on seventeenth again paused raymond be born said slowly distinctly before father marriage letter gave prove if further proof be wanted must find at consulate where marriage took place one have tampered with register date have be made to look a if recorded first of march doe not record thirty first of march three have be erased be still visible saw for went across to naples to see father off subsequently at consulate made copy of entry must have proposed to stay with night uncle salvatore have spirit left in to see anybody when sent two letter of mother hoped against hope perhaps that there be ghastly mistake nearly destroyed indeed in order that from at rate there must be conceivable evidence when saw entry in book at consulate with mark of erasure visible to careful scrutiny knew that be use to fight against fact on father death evidence of date of marriage must be produced will be clear what happened mother bore two boy be one subsequently married hoping have doubt to beget from heir to name property wind sighed heavily in pine little stir of rustled vine leaf be at cost to said colin that keep mother letter prof raymond to be bastard oh be ugly word if be must know that be ugly thing without mother letter sent must be hard indeed to prove indeed one might copy out entry at consulate fail to see erasure altogether raymond at father death must succeed twin beloved of must take honourable place in eye of world for be not nothing to be born stanier colins voice be soft steadfast mother letter to make impossible for to have honour in eye of world to preserve own said ah why did send two letter uncle salvatore be in innocence kindness that sent need not remind that asked for having seen what must one with shred of honour do to admit truth of whole ghastly business only wish have be that father will not know that know want be that when hour of death come must hope that terrible fraud have be practised will never be detected for letter of mother must undoubtedly have happened register at consulate must have be copied at death by clerk consul must have certificated accuracy look at then now look at in same light of unblemished descent raymond salvatore have certainly woke out of dejection impossible cried beating table sent two letter first dated march first announced sainted rosinas marriage to father where be produce colin be quite prepared for that put sun browned finger into breast pocket drew out paper cant show original letter said because be clearly duty to put into inviolable custody a soon a possible sent in fact a soon a have seen register at consulate to bank with order that be to be kept there until gave further instruction until news of death reached in case uncle salvatore gave instruction that be to be sent to father before despatched to bank made copy of here copy be passed over to uncle copy have made of letter afternoon before instead of sending to bank locked original safely away upstairs be accurate copy except that be dated march salvatore took read tallied for date with recollection of be impossible said for year have known that letter when gave be dated first do imply that altered asked colin not living eye have seen that letter mine give reason for altering why must make nameless illegitimate salvatore looked that in face validity of stared at unflinchingly cant believe there be huge mistake said salvatore often have read that letter of rosinas march first be date of marriage will swear to nothing will shake belief in colin shook head in answer what good will do said gave letter to hand mine have ever touched letter must be produced day not for many year hope trust on father death must come to light how will recollection stand in face of evidence can see salvatore glanced round be alone with fitful wind in pine destroy letter collino said save mother honour own colin gave one glance soft pitiful ah must not suggest that to said must not add force to temptation can only just resist where must honour be if did that what shred of must be left how must live lie like colin leaned forward put hand on salvatores arm have got to accept illegitimacy said if be sorry for a think be can shew best by accepting too must be infinitely painful to when revelation be made a will have to be made on father death to have attempting to save mother honour own a put just now by insisting that letter bore date must never have moment peace if thought scene like be ahead of in fact want to be assured against only way can think of to make safe be that when get back to naples to morrow must write couple of line saying how feel for in discovery be new to then want to name discovery be date of mother marriage want to accept date give proof that accept colin made gesture with hand a if cutting off topic instantly spoke again with cousin vittoria growing up said must be put to expense be impossible for to meet out of pittance father give wronged family most terribly must repair that wrong when get letter of yours uncle salvatore will send cheque for colin gave glance at uncle to make sure that there be faintest sign of dissent there be none went on see understand said so let go step further if brother raymond dy before father will make five hundred pound annuity to will destroy letter ask to write now letter of mother about have be talking will never be asked to say anything about of if on other hand father dy first if make marriage expect to make will have to use letter that letter of mother may be asked to swear to genuineness of letter hope will write to morrow to recollection of mother letter will tally with have glass of delicious french wine have need to think what be saying frame specious case spoke quite simply directly a if by inspiration a if be olian harp hung in wind whispered through stone pine dont think there be need for discussion said though of course if like to ask question will consider whether will answer dont think there be need for question be there might tell fancy straight off whether accept reject proposal if reject perhaps have better tell that be exceedingly unlikely that father will give further assistance financially for a know have good deal of influence with must not pay to refuse must a to threatening with making conversation of ours public with view to getting money out of know gentlemanly feeling must revolt against such idea besides must be singularly unremunerative for one must possibly believe conversation proposal must strike anybody a incredible be not perjuring in way did send letter of mother will hope write letter to morrow saying that story of mother marriage be very shocking be indeed true so will be yes uncle salvatore salvatore superstitious like most southern italian to core found making sign of cross below table apart from obvious material advantage of accepting colins offer felt that fierce compelling agency be backing colin up dreadful little incident of bat have already upset now in colins blue gay glance so earnestly fixed on divined manifestation of evil eye assuredly be not wise to provoke into action a if in turn colin divined thought spoke again better say yes uncle salvatore said friend lead more enjoyable life than enemy answer want answer now perhaps through strange trick of light played by guttering candle suddenly seemed to salvatore colins eye undeviatingly fixed on face seemed in luminous a if smouldering light actually burned behind accept said quickly for vittorias sake colin took up glass thought must move paternal heart dear uncle salvatore said drink to pleasant bargain chapter vi though colin have taken news of brother engagement with so touching unselfish gentleness father in spite of joy of seeing boy again looked forward to arrival at stanier with considerable uneasiness trouble trial for must be when saw raymond violet together though to be sure violet did not seem to to embody ideal of maidenly rapture with affianced seemed indeed to tolerate rather than adore lover to permit rather than to provoke to answer with effort innumerable little signal of devotion raymond displayed for about quality of devotion there must be question be clear that in own fashion with heaviness awkwardness in expression be utterly in love with have eye for one for eye be dog like in fidelity when be absent sens dozed be just for present party of three lady hester have gone back to town after departure of colin father to south ronald wife have betaken for month of july to marienbad in order to enable to continue eating too much for next eleven month without ill effect evening old lady yardley appeared for dinner made fourth be not so much presence a shadow in colins absence hardly ever spoke though night monotonously asked when be expected back then after rubber of whist mutely conducted retired again remained invisible till approach of next dinner hour so long have be whitely impassive that philip scarcely noticed mist be thickening about mind raymond then be comprehensible enough be head over ear in love with violet nothing nobody have significance for dog like though devotion be struck father that there be in absence of violet response something rather animal about have met with more than mere toleration glance little secret caress thirst for contact even of finger tip leaning shoulder there must have be spark leap of fire give warmth life to such thing without there be certain impalpable grossness raymond did not seem to care that touch must be responded to contented to touch though to father mind be comprehensible enough violet puzzled for seemed even before marriage to have adopted traditional impassivity of stanier bride have professed in one interview have have with quiet acceptance of position devotion to raymond of expression seemed to be mute passivity towards question of date of marriage have contribution to give lord yardley raymond must have settling of with same passivity accepted date in first week of october then great glass door must be opened bridegroom wing long shuttered for philip bride have never come here must see light again asked question about colins return name never presented on lip unless mere conventional usage caused to be spoken be a if boy with whom have be so intimately friend have ceased to exist for when philip once consciously noted that omission began to wonder if violet be not comprehensible after day in case after philip return while colin still lingered in italy be worthy of stateliest deadliest stanier tradition colin have be expected one long july afternoon announcement of arrival have be ambiguous for might catch early train from paris thus earlier boat connection be uncertain if missed must not get to dover till six in evening in case must sleep in london come down to stanier next day philip have read out at breakfast that morning for once violet shewed interest in colin why not send motor to dover uncle philip said can get there in time for first boat if be not on can wait for second will arrive here then by dinner time raymond looked up from paper at sound of voice vi darling what absurd plan said there be hundred chance to one on colins not finding motor hell get straight into train from boat violet instantly retreated into strange shell of hers again ah yes said philip curiosity put forth horn at there be new element here for raymond seemed to resent idea of special arrangement being made for colin thats not bad idea of yours violet said will save colin going up to london a spoke kept sideways eye on raymond father think of crush getting off boat said chance be that colin wont see chauffeur spoke with impatient anger must not cloak rang out unmistakably in voice well take off chance then said father raymond got up just a like said philip paused moment relation between raymond have be excellent up till to day raymond without charm be not fault have be pleasant agreeable now matter of meeting colin have produced spirit of jealous temper naturally will do just a like observed ring bell please raymond motor will have to start at once though none of three communicated news of colins arrival to old lady yardley somehow got round to via perhaps servant gossip about motor going to dover most unusually came downstairs at tea time with inquiry whether colin have arrived be soon clear that must not have caught early boat must have be here by now thus three hour at least must elapse before arrival must be looked for in spite of old lady yardley did not go back to room again remained upright vigilant in chair on terrace where have have tea looking out over plain where across garden lake appeared glimpse of road along motor must come philip have intended to go for ride too when servant told that horse be round lingered on shewed sign of moving mother gave reason for remaining so unusually here somehow cause of be common property colin be coming raymond similarly have announced intention of going to bathe have not gone instead fidgeted in chair smoked took up dropped evening paper made aimless little excursion up down terrace restlessness got on father nerve well go bathe if mean to raymond said if like take horse go for ride for goodness sake dont keep jumping about like thanks think wont ride father said will be having bathe presently must feel inclined for game of tennis vi think rather too hot said sat down on arm of chair gave welcome to appeared in way conscious of proximity in rather gross fashion of gently stroked tendril of loose hair just behind ear for moment suffered that without moving then put up hand with jerky uncontrolled movement brushed away oh please raymond said in low voice have sullen look for shrugging shoulder got up went into house father gave sigh of relief reason for needed comment colin will be here for dinner wont asked old lady yardley yes mother said philip wont go rest before think will sit here said wait for colin presently raymond be back again with copy of illustrated paper violet philip alike felt interruption of presence be thinking of colin raymond even if sat quiet be disturbance distraction soon be by violet side again shewing picture appeared to think might interest philip watching girl felt by sympathetic vibration how great effort be for to maintain that passivity day have so encompassed imminence of colins arrival must not conjecture be what troubled tranquillity below there be stir subaqueous tumult not yet risen to surface only faintly declaring in rising bubble raymond have placed paper on knee turning page let hand rest on arm bare to elbow instantly let slip to side raising eye at moment caught philip gaze recognition of something never mentioned between took place turned to raymonds paper again quite excellent said good snapshot of

in accomplishment of desire be a obscure to a to others with pushed door back sweet odour of cedar wood confined there for last sixty year flowed out like scent of ancient vintage then even a crunching of motor on gravel outside be heard stopping abruptly a car drew up at door swept across to entrance already colin stood in doorway for coolness have travelled bareheaded gold of hair tossed way that made shining aureole round head face tanned by southern sun be dark a bronze below from ruddy brown eye turquoise blue gleamed like star be more like lordly incarnation of life sunlight spring splendour than handsome boy complete individual presence of wonder enchantment stood there then swift a sword stroke spell have held be broken be colin dusty hot from journey jubilant with

going upstairs colin have come home appeared with tactic be to compass strategy rehearsed ready never have charm be of so sunny magical quality by contrast never have raymond appeared more uncouth bucolic raymond now so ran father unspoken comment on situation have ugly weapon in hand under blow of colin winced started for more than ever be prodigal of little touch caress showered on violet philip must not blame for be no more than natural that young man engaged enamoured must use light license of lover indeed must have be unnatural if have not done so often often ten time in evening philip must see colin take in hand steadfastly avert eye from corner where raymond violet sat ever again that curious habit of self torture in lover whom fate have not favoured must assert eye must creep back to seeing raymond in loverlike posture recall a often sweetness of temper natural gaiety must reassert ray usual light nonsense frequent laugh flowed from exquisite too be tact with violet recognised be clear that old boy girl intimacy must in changed condition be banished must no longer go away with alone to spend morning between tennis court bathing pool with arm round neck stroll off with joint book to read reclined in shade not only must that put raymond into false position enamoured betrothed so argued most pitiless logic of father be capable that resumption of physical intimacy a between boy boy must be tearing of colins very heart string not only for for also in such sort of intimacy colin with brisk blood ardent lust of living must scarcely help betraying surely then violet little though might care for raymond must see pool of tranquil acceptance shattered by plunge of stone into centre of liking for colin be deep must not fail to see that for have even profounder depth light must shine in drowned cave colin a wise a be tender seemed to shew wisdom by keeping on surface with violet only shining on tranquillity never breaking sometimes so thought father shewed face in virtue of past intimacy be almost too gaily indifferent must attempt perfectly trivial exhibition of old relation perch on arm of chair with contrast of bronzed face golden hair tell that must gild face like groom in macbeth dye hair on instant must be alert spring up leaving there for need of cigarette match allowed not most outside chance of resuming ordinary cousinly relation with motive be sound enough loving mistrusted be sealed to be brother wife must not trust within sight of notice to trespasser be better to make stranger to than to run risk of betraying so at least struck outsider to colins consciousness avoided then privacy with violet le carefully avoided privacy with raymond if three men be together father left colin must be sure to follow if three sat up together in smoking room colin must anticipate signal of silence of father yawning observation of clock to go to bed here again almost overdid part for a first week after return went by philip firmly determined to be just to raymond thought saw in kind of brotherly affection for colin latter missed intentionally failed to respond to there must be harm in seasonable word when one morning raymond after dozen chill response from brother have left colin together philip thought that seasonable word be le than raymonds due seasonable word have to be preceded by sympathy sat down in window seat by colin well said blue eye gay veiled by suffering answered damned hard on colin said be getting used to old boy colin with one of inimitable instinctive movement laid hand on father shoulder not bit said ive got to cant go on like must feel friendly to raymond violet must manage to rejoice in happiness got prescription for father ill take be lord how happy used to be philip have missed in rosina be here now tender subtle mind must have be complement of beauty sympathy be up in arm for beloved child of hers sense of fairness elsewhere raymonds doing best colin said wonder paused can say

chum then became to a told so much more than chum cant get back on to old footing with must hurt too much shes hurt that dont can see think be wrong to come back here at yet how lovely be seemed pleased to see raymond didnt guess bitterness of be inevitable that philip must recall surprise at violet passivity colin whose heart knew have be in outward appearance just a passive must not help wondering whether passivity of violet cloaked tumult a profound a colins suspicion have blinked at before like flash of distant lightning now be little more vivid if be true if from quarter storm be coming up better thousand time that must come now than later tragic indeed must be if after have married raymond burst upon have nothing approaching evidence on subject might well be that wish that violet must have loved colin set imagination to work on have really existence outside own brain hate seeing suffer colin said if want to go back to capri of course may youve got to get used to time unless mean to banish from stanier altogether dont do colin pressed father arm ill do better father said ill begin at once wheres violet be in pursuance of resolve must be supposed that when lady yardleys rubber of whist be over night colin moved across to open door on to terrace where violet be standing in spasm of impatience at raymonds touch have just got up from sofa where have planted close to leaving with expression half offended half merely hungry five minute stroll outside vi asked rather late said right said colin cheerfully went forth alone whistling into darkness moment have gone violet regretted not having gone too since colins return have not have half hour told alone with tension of entire indifference to be becoming intolerable have not dreamed that must cut off from with hideous completeness yet how much longed for renewal of old intimacy bitterest of be fact that meant nothing to for have never be more light heartedly gay where philip knowing what did saw strained heroic effort saw only contemptuous ignoring of herself raymond now with same craving for self torture be obsession to luckless in love when colin made first advance to again must need reject there be raymond watching revolt against hungry look of decided stepped out on to terrace colin have come to far end of whistling directed now in strong starlight must see glimmer of shirt front felt knee trembling hid reason out of sight a strolled a unconcernedly a must towards soon perceived whistling stopped hullo vi said so youve come out after thats ripping be close to other now bright be stream of starlight on managed to tear away from raymond for five minute asked be beginning to think must never have word with again thats fault said have be brute last week brute said colin what do

heard violet clicked tongue of impatience have to say that whispered wont come colins psychology be correct enough raymond have not meant to be seen only meant to see besides have grievance against violet for impatience just now be annoyed with thanks said im going to smoking room thats to punish vi said colin with tremble of laughter in voice perhaps have better go in mustnt vex nothing must have be better calculated be one of condition of engagement that mustnt speak to asked certainly seems like colin tucked arm into violet well well break for once said now youre vexed with thats very unreasonable of made choice with eye open youve chosen raymond stanier stand to reason cant always be together cant have raymond stanier be own doing thought everything be going so well whenever look up see holding hand else he kissing back of neck ah said violet with little shiver youve got to get used to vi said youve got to pay for having stanier isnt worth heard take quick breath control be

now in shadow of yew hedge where one night have kissed a thought of that knew that be thinking of too give raymond up said let stanier go will be wisest thing can do paused moment witchery of night came to reinforcement of charm want vi said promise give kiss seal for one second wavered then drew back from cant do that said ill give kiss seal promise kiss then said now confident there be mistaking way in surrendered to stood enfolded by lambent burning knew to be bitterly unwise for moment sweetness be worth water of marah must inundate ah darling never mind promise said will have later just now enough that must hate raymond love buried face on shoulder colin colin what be to do whispered must see well that though heart be idea of giving up stanier still strove with to night

at ebb flow of emotional struggle youve finished with raymond tell said youve given up youve given up stanier havent youve given up everything diabolical love of cruelty for own sake of torturing by prolonging decision pulled at way possessed proud hour for vi said love stanier a madly a do youve given up for adore for doing youll never repent just hug moment though there must come end to let go in raymond will be looking for again go straight to room will come there in five minute for there something must tell to night must just have one look at raymond first thats for own satisfaction colin must not forego that look at raymond knew how must find prospering with glass of whisky disposed a father have said to be brotherly having winning card in hand stanier must be before violet must be colin might be allowed if be very amiable to spend week here occasionally when raymond came to throne just a now have be allowed starlit stroll with violet be indulgence must not be noticed by plenitude morsel let fall from abundant feast life only of one man already old lay between full consummation already foot be on step where throne be set just one glance then at victorious raymond raymond fulfilled highest expectation whisky have made magnanimous be pleased to have granted colin little starlit stroll with violet be crumb from master table heavy face wore look of great complacency a brother entered hullo colin said finished making love to violet colin grinned old brute said not content with having everything must mock for beggary lucky fellow poured out drink sat down raymond have idea how devoted violet be to till to night said think shes afraid to let go to shew too much grossness of raymond animal proprietorship be never more apparent be enough for to desire oh vi right said colin felt rib quiver with spasm of suppressed laughter distrusted power of control if subjected to further temptation im off to bed said just looked in to envy wheres vi asked raymond colin bethought that did not want raymond knocking at violet door for good night kiss oh went upstairs hour ago said told be awfully sleepy in fact soon got tired of drank in final impression of raymonds satisfied face went upstairs going first to room where from locked despatch case took two letter salvatore have given now bore date of march march then passing down long corridor came to room door be ajar rapped softly then entered violet in anticipation of coming have sent maid away be brushing hair golden a colins own before glass often often in day of intimacy have come in for talk during ritual on dry frosty night violet must put out light pale flash of electricity crackling spark must follow progress of brush hair must float up from head cling to colins finger a sea weed have lain unexpanded on shore spread out floating undulating in return of tide to night lay thick unstirred rippling for moment under brush then subsiding again into tranquil sheet of gold saw enter in field of mirror heard click of key a turned just in case raymond take into head to say good night to said have risen from chair stood opposite to what have got to tell colin said looked at moment with parted lip sparkling eye seemed perfect complement of other together formed one peerless embodiment of glory of mankind through there passed quiver of irresistible attraction a two globule of quick silver roll into one so that be merged coalesced in other so with arm interlaced face joined stood there two longer even colins hatred for raymond flickered for moment be nearly extinguished since for violet existed more then evil flame burned up again loosed violet arm from round neck now youre to sit listen to said what have got to tell will take time at opened envelope have brought with drew out

certain revenue certain property always made over to heir on coming of age raymond come of age in few month can let raymond enjoy for father sake have always be amazingly good to oh colin what

a opened violet be talking of nothing so here be bride bridegroom best man let have one cigarette before go to bed raymond wore most savage look thought have gone to bed said thought said violet have gone to bed hour before oh raymond dont be vexed said colin havent got everything in just voice dexterously convincing have pleaded with violet that must forgive father chapter vii philip be waiting in library for raymonds entry wanting to feel sorry for a often a must darken mind behind cloud edge of grew dazzlingly bright with thought of colin sun re emerging warmed delighted yet be sorry for raymond presently must express sympathy coldly correctly be afraid with regret truism paternal platitude duty must dictate sentiment at most must not hope for more than to give boy impression be sorry conceal from immensurable pleasure in news colin have made known to week ever since on morning in capri have learned of raymonds engagement colins desire have never be free from heartache favourite manliness refusal to be embittered effort with gaily heroic have rendered pang more poignant in hour of joy colin have shewn just same marvellous quickness of sympathy for raymonds sorrow a when philip have first told of engagement have shewn for raymonds happiness must have given anything to spare raymond father have said a know kept felt to myself didnt let violet see how miserable be how wanted then last night be like earthquake within everything toppled fell vi be left clinging to other after colin philip have seen violet too have spoken to with simplicity candour have already begun to love colin thought before accepted raymond how loved stanier have be worldly ambitious stifling first faint call of heart thinking a many girl thought whose nature be not yet wholly awake that raymond must do a regard do magnificently a regard longing for being mistress of stanier meant to then came colins return from italy whisper of heart grew louder must not help contrasting lover with friend in new light raymonds attention to caress air must confess of proprietorship grew odious insufferable then just a colin have said came earthquake in disruption from worldly point of view seemed so precious turned to dross at point hesitated moment philip have found recording how like be to colin with just triumphant glow of happiness with have said raymond have got stanier father violet have got other so violet now after momentary hesitation spoke to stanier for longed uncle philip doesnt exist for more how must weigh against colin colins happiness nothing must dim sunshine for father sunshine be not only of to day be sunshine have shone on rosina more than twenty year ago heart melted with love through colin reacted on surely must rejoice at boy happiness to day raymond to be sure be fruit of body also be through colin that lived be memory gracious image of beauty raymond entered snapping golden thread wanted to see father said philip have be attempting to drill into sympathetic bearing towards son raymonds actual presence here in succession to colin violet brought sheer helplessness for brightness beam of others there be solid self sufficiency seemed a if crime have be averted in transference of girl to bridegroom what unnatural union must have be made by mating of heart sang be vain to try to throttle into silence yes raymond sit down said indicating place on sofa where sat thanks doesnt matter ill stand said raymond ive got bad news for said philip must brace to let have said raymond philip felt sympathy slipping from wanted chiefly to get over there be use in attempting to lead up to concern violet said savage look a of hungry dog from whom dinner be being snatched came across raymonds face well said wished to tell that cant marry said father asks to set free from engagement savagery of sullen face grew blacker dont accept that from said if true violet will have to tell philip made great effort with be true said want at once to tell that im very sorry for must have be very painful for to tell be who suggested must break decision to hope wont insist on having from have got to tell said raymond be that father if so ill go to at once there more said raymonds face went suddenly white mouth twitched presented mask of hatred so colin who have got to tell rest said be that be going to marry colin for moment raymond stood perfectly still just hand be moving knitted together made action of squeezing something once seemed that tried to speak word came only teeth shewed in mouth colin have got to tell then said will see colin first philip got up laid hand of authority on raymonds shoulder boy for quietness seemed beside with pent up fury more dangerous for suppression must not see of in state be in now said thats affair said raymond mine too youre son so be colin must wait till got more used to what have happened must remember that few week ago colin be in same case a be now loved violet be then out in capri who told that violet be going to marry took like man like generous fellow be first word be by jove raymond will be happy will never forget mustnt raymond raymond gave dry snap of laugh wont said thats just what colin must say perfect character isnt only last night found talking to violet in bedroom wasnt pleased begged not to be vexed a have got everything have taken violet from when said that if not came back when violet be in bed got engaged to then engaged now stop that raymond said father very good be already engaged to when told have got everything dont understand colin hate more than love have hated life by jove raymond will be happy ill be even with colin day now im going to see will say by jove colin will be happy then youll consider generous fellow once again philip tried to put in raymonds place made allowance for bitter blackness hand went on to boy shoulder again with le of authority more of attempted affection raymond must do better than said must be very unwise to see colin violet just now if insist on doing so will see in presence cant trust in mood youre in not to be violent not to say do something must bitterly repent must find hard to forgive if deny colin have always hated what about of now be on bed rock by implication by admission by denial even have got down to hatred that like vein of murderous gold ran through very foundation of brother existence who knew what struggle might have taken place what prenatal wrestling in very womb of life of present antagonism be sequel logical inevitable even a philip spoke half realised futility of bringing argument to bear on raymonds nature for hatred sprang from ineradicable instinct iron law on intelligence reason must perch like settling fly must deny that colin hated brother must urge raymond to show a generous a believed colin to have be nothing that must say persuasion authority must mitigate fraternal hostility even while denied colins animosity with evidence have already brought forward to back found wondering if at heart colin must feel generosity have expressed whether be not mere superficial good nature mingled with contempt perhaps that have given voice to raymond have ceased from clutching squeezing of hand dont know what colin be said know be use trying to convince shant try judge by what see of put down for black hearted sullen fellow he heart darling youve got right to say said philip can help knowing father asked philip felt that very will power be in abeyance must not even want to readjust place two son held in heart rather to find place in heart for son who have never be installed there yet there must be use in wanting even if must accomplish that colin held door of heart with grudging sense of justice towards raymond be aware that colin must grant admittance to brother be that conviction only echo of own instinct that wanted one colin there have love to spare for raymond such spring of a bubbled in must fall into colins cup cup that never must be filled how must contrast two here be raymond sullen in defeat attempting with unwelcome success to put father in wrong jealous of joy have come to colin insisting shylock like on such revenge a be in power pound of flesh must be in making scene with girl who have chosen a heart bade boy who be choice on other side be colin who when faced with identical situation have accepted ill luck with wave of welcome for more fortunate raymond must have that splendid banner be false flag under cover of whose whiteness treacherous attack might be made dont know that need pursue said philip feeling be outside control what be in control be to be just to in spite of have tried to tell with possible sympathy of of violet jilting interrupted raymond have clearly shewn father sympathy with colins happiness philip felt nerve jarring be not responsible for interpretation of said do accept if design be to be intolerably offensive to must work out design somewhere else be not going to have stop here in order to amuse with being rude to spoiling happiness of others ah just so said raymond colin philip be exasperated beyond endurance quite right said be not going to have spoiling colins happiness violet must have suggested leaving stanier for present for own sake if have allowed to show sympathy for a suggest that must do so for colins sake may go to st james square if like if can

greater grace part of heroine must be filled by creator in remodelled piece what sparkle life must put into scene where have be wooden impassive must be eager responsive that icy toleration must melt into bubbling liquor of joy then there must be part now to be filled by raymond must fill that with colins tact sweetness of minor character there must be father grandmother with what convincing

though have be gave colin thousand opportunity of making writhe with shrewd sting of jealousy with gay deliberation planted dart coup de grce for raymond must not come yet father death must give signal for at present there be very pretty baiting to be done not one of dart so becomingly beribboned failed to hit mark whispered word to violet made colour spring bright eager to face saunter with along terrace in evening even more than colins semblance of sparing raymonds feeling suggestion that must join in trivial pursuit be missile maddingly pierced stung le adequately did philip old lady yardley fill minor part with sun of colins content warming be genial thoughtful towards raymond in way that betrayed without possibility of mistake sentiment from sprang while lady yardley braced invigorated by same emotion be strangely rejuvenated eye dim with age seemed to pierce mist of encompassing year grew bright with colins youth a regard own relation with violet colin found must for present anyhow manage very well old habit of familiarity intimacy appeared to supply response sufficient for shuddering now a at nightmare at abandoned engagement to raymond blinded with splendour of dawn of love saw a god just alighted on gilded rosy hill colin shrugged shoulder at illusion presented to such phantasmal apparition must give liking friendship just what have always have from soon so hoped vision of must fade from eye for even a have found father paternal devotion to in capri fatiguing boring business so foresaw much acuter gne must spring from persistence of violet love doubt however must presently become more reasonable what above fed colins soul be to stroll into smoking room when violet have gone upstairs father have retired to library to make raymond drink cup more highly spiced with gall than have refreshed in public raymond have usually got there first while colin lingered moment longer with violet have beside liberally mixed drink must serve for colins text

out after suppose said theyll be sure to catch colin wondered what that yawn meant to boy of twenty to anyhow there be spice of excitement about news be impossible not to be interested raymond did not seem to be interested did wish to appear that be not interested colin with eye on raymond turned to father two three more little dart be ready for brother at must not yawn oh father said come sleep in

father good night good night raymond sleep well raymond in spite of good wish passed almost sleepless night if shut eye be to see colins mocking face floating on darkness of closed lid to have echoing in ear mockery of colins jibe a passed violet door on way up to bed have heard sound of speech laughter from within jealousy seemed to arrest tip toeing step so that what might overhear must give bitter provender loved new born fear of colin made go on instead of lingering colin seemed prospered in did by hellish protection mysterious instinct might warn that there be listener must throw open door with laugh call violet to see who be eavesdropping on threshold then after have laughed pointed at colin must shut door again locking for fear of of homicidal maniac talking must go on again till be quenched in kiss have tossed turned a on gridiron with thought of colin violet together to feed to keep fire alive did not believe that colin loved if have not promised to marry must not have sought be from hatred of that have given glance smile whistled to so that threw away like scrap of waste paper contract must have installed a mistress of house adored colin have idly beckoned just to gratify hate have flamed into love for what subtle art of contrivance intrigue be also have wanted to feast same hatred on sight of brother defeat discomfiture word from have be sufficient to make father revoke edict let remain at stanier thus colin earned fresh laurel in eye of others for compassionate forbearance by so doing accomplished own desire of having raymond there like moth on pin a hour went on strange red fancy crossed brain imagined going to father room smothering so that next day must be master of stanier free to turn colin out not hour must stay in place out must go violet with better still must be to come behind colin with noose in hand must draw tight round neck laugh to see face go black eye start from head with strangling must satisfy must forgive colin when lay limp lifeless at foot till then must never know moment peace tranquil hour week fever of hatred have be mounting in blood to night heat of made to flower in brain garden of murderous image time be afraid of colin afraid of barbed tongue contemptuous hate above of luck caused to prosper be beloved wherever went just at birth one stroke of ill luck have befallen be earlier in evening remembered idea have flitted vaguely through head have suggested to lucky accident have purposely yawned when notion presented so that colin must not see that took interest in what be being talked about for moment must not recollect what have be then remembered how father have come into smoking room told that homicidal lunatic have got hold of gun be at large probably in park be have yawned then for have pictured to colin strolling through leafy way suddenly finding face to face with man there must be report colin must lie very still among bracken till body be found ant insect must be creeping about have be faint outline of picture now in dark started into colour what if once again colins luck failed in remote glade found alone with raymond must have gun with must fire point blank at colins face leave there must be supposed that escaped mad man have encountered be wild imagining born of sleepless night a thought of raymonds eyelid flickered closed just before dawn fell asleep when be called few hour later be first image came into mind by light of day wore soberer more solid aspect what if be wild vision of night thing might actually happen fresh news when met at breakfast be to hand about escaped man indeed in answer to inquiry sent by lord yardley to asylum there came reply though search party be out after nothing have a yet be seen of colin be engaged to play round of golf on rye link chance of falling in with seemed so remote that soon after breakfast went off on motor bicycle promising in order to soothe violet apprehension to travel at rate of not le than forty mile hour did not please either in fact there be pleasing about expedition whether went fast slow so kissed told to order mourning at last moment however at father wish slipped revolver into pocket raymond a usual refused to play golf preferred wander in park with gun a defensive measure for a offensive measure against plague of wood pigeon be most numerous in wood lay on steep slope through road to repstow passed that have be colins road too when raymond set out quarter of hour later dust raised by motor bicycle still hung in windless air ten minute walking brought to point where road hitherto have lain across open grass of park descended into big belt of wood stretched a far a lodge gate on side of ground rose sharply covered on one side by fir birch with groundwork of heather on other by oak of what be known a old park according to tradition be of planting of elizabeth colin for age grandeur might well be so for stately venerable rose from short deer nibbled turf well spaced with full freedom for root branch alike other tree be on slope great leafy sentinel stood with ring of shade round like well tried veteran who have earned leisure dignified livery of repose low wall of grey stone four foot high mossy creviced feathered with small fern separated old park from road be among great oak that pigeon congregated raymond be soon busy with way that startled by firing flew often wary slipping out of far side of tree interposing branch between so that must get sight of at other time coming out into open giving fair shot before long whole battalion of be in commotion wheeling flying off returning again in hour time have shot forty of not reckoning dozen more winged otherwise wounded trailed off on approach fluttering on in front of raymond be quite willing to put such out of misery if must only stop still be killed like sensible bird on hot morning be too much to expect to go trotting after silly thing especially when have killed so many took pleasure in cruelty of leaving to die be simply indifferent have come almost to end of cartridge if be to continue shooting must have to go back to house for more ammunition borrow from keeper at repstow lodge be nearer than house before going sat down in shade of one of old colins oak to cool down have cigarette for last hour have be completely absorbed in sport now with snap like of released spring mind leaped back to have occupied a walked here saw dust of brother motor bicycle hanging in air have locked up in mind when began shooting connection with hate sleepless night with vision that seemed so wild at time on waking have taken on so much quieter more likely aspect now when unlocked mind again found that have grown like fungi in darkness of congenial atmosphere be solid mature where before there have be fairy ring of imagination where nightly elf have danced there be now red firm fleshed poisoned growth glistening corrupt subconscious mind poured out storage have be busy while be shooting wonderfully acute reminded now that quarter of mile further on old park came to end one clump of rhododendron stood behind wall ran along road just here road took sharp turn to right man walking along for matter bicycling along must only come into sight of one who might happen to be by rhododendron bush dozen yard before came to anything else might see there gun for instance must be at point blank range gun barrel must rest conveniently on top of wall one who happened to be holding weapon must be concealed between wall bush picture seemed to be shewn raymond rather than to be imagined by be a if external agency held open book contained turned over leaf might prove to be who must presently lie perdu there have sense of personal volition share in matter hatred of colin have somehow taken counsel even a doctor consult over bad case with necessity that colin must die be advice raymond be patient who in apathy of sickness be going to do a told not caring much what happened only conscious that if advice be successful in aspect must be restored to complete health hardly knew if hated colin more that be certain of be that there existed somewhere black dynamic enmity hardly knew whether be who be about to shoot colin a presently on motor bicycle must come round that sharp bend by rhododendron bush that be certain of be that colin must presently lie dead on road with face shattered by shot homicidal maniac of course escaped from asylum must have be murderer there be use for more cartridge than two now slipped into gun if fellow hidden behind rhododendron bush must not kill colin with two shot must not kill with twenty raymond looking carefully round began moving quietly down slope to corner keeping in shadow of leafage of splendid tree foot be noiseless on cropped plush of turf passed quickly over patch of sun between shadow of oak pausing now then to make sure there be one passing along road hillside who be within sight of there be one to be seen after cessation of shooting deer have come back to favourite grazing ground be now cropping at short sweet grass lying with twinkling ear alert in shade one be moving up there at top of old park where foot path made short cut to house from repstow lodge deer must not be so tranquil while own sharp eye assured that within circle of vision there be none astir remembrance of rhododendron bush close to angle in road be astonishingly accurate top of grey wall be most convenient rest for gun man coming round corner from direction of repstow must suddenly find within six yard of barrel probably must never see at there must be just flash of flame close to startled eye perhaps even report of explosion must never reach be only imperfect touch in scheme have be thus presented to raymond must like colin to know one half second before died whose hand have pulled trigger put muzzle on mocking mouth darkness over laughing eye determined that when beat of colins approaching motor bicycle sounded loud round corner must stand up show must be too late for colin to swerve duck then must just see who have last laugh raymond felt that must laugh a fired till that moment be best to conceal from road leaned against wall crouching little with muzzle of gun resting on be already after one oclock colin must be here minute now quarter of hour before colin have arrived at repstow lodge with puncture in hind tyre luck be kind to a usual puncture have occurred only few yard down road must leave machine with lodge keeper send mechanic from garage to repair bring back to house for must take short cut through top of old park back home that reduced distance by at least half on hot morning soft turfed shade must be pleasant then sudden thought struck asked whether escaped madman have be captured walk home must be le exciting perhaps pleasanter if have caught again appeared that colins affair be being well looked after man have be found on other side of park hour ago cleverly taken so keeper said must have be in wood night came upon a dozed seizing gun have possessed of before woke getting noose round arm so be right colin with smile for keeper wife sixpenny piece for small child who regarded with wide wondering eye set off for mile walk to house took revolver out of pocket with intention of giving to keeper having brought up to house with bicycle then thought better of emptying cartridge out replaced made rather weighty bulge in coat on general principle be wise not to leave fire arm about thought of raymond at pigeon shooting occurred to a walked sound of firing came from direction of old park now lay close in front of supposed that brother must have gone home by time what sullen awkward fellow be how winced under colins light artillery how impotently raymond hated colin must not imagine hating one like not devising something deadly raymond devised nothing just continued hating doing nothing colin have come to beginning of old park path lying along top of wound in out of great oak below to right lay road with low stone wall running beside road have be out of sight hitherto forming wider circuit just below now there be sharp corner came into view what be bright line of light on top of wall just at point something caught sun vividly gleaming for reason be imperatively curious to know what gleamed there just a if intimately concerned half closing eye to focus detach from that baffling background of dappled light shadow saw simultaneously unbidden idea of raymond out shooting pigeon occurred to what be doing if be raymond hidden behind dark leaved rhododendron bush with gun resting on wall pointing at road be singular way of shooting pigeon very singular colins face broke into one great smile slipped behind one of oak looking out saw that tree lower down slope hid rhododendron bush from keeping behind broad trunk advanced down hill in direction twice again in similar cover approached peering round tree must now see raymond close at hand raymonds back be towards held gun with end of barrel resting on top of wall looking at angle of road round for puncture in bicycle must already have come there be now one big tree between brother on tiptoe a noiselessly a hunting tiger crept up to drawing revolver from pocket came within ten pace of then faint sound of advance twig perhaps snapping beneath step sense of anothers presence reached raymond turned head quickly in colins direction found looking straight down barrel of revolver raymond if stir except to do precisely what tell will shoot said colin quietly if take eye off will shoot colins finger be on trigger revolver a steady a if man of stone held open breech of gun said let barrel drop now hold in one hand with arm stretched out thats right good dog now lay gun down turn round with back to stop like without moving remember that be covering must hardly miss at distance colin picked up gun took two cartridge out put in pocket not till clinked against revolver cartridge that lay there did remember that time pistol have be unloaded stifled laugh take off cartridge bag raymond said put on ground there be more in said raymond speaking for first time ill conditioned swine do a tell said colin shant give order twice again well what said seems to be true thats not point point be that youre to do a tell now have got more cartridge in pocket colin thought have better make sure of for passed hand over raymonds coat pocket now stand just where be said because weve got to talk first ill put cartridge in own revolver have be perfectly empty time isnt that damned funny raymond dear there be expecting moment must be last obeying like sweet obedient boy be laugh cant one of funniest thing ever happened colin lit cigarette with shout of laughter well to business said turn round let see face do know parlour trick called thought reading im going to tell youve be thinking about expected to come round corner on bike from behind wall be going to fire point blank at not at bad idea there be homicidal lunatic thought loose in wood death must have be put down to must have be hanged for same because be taken nearly hour ago without firing shot so ive saved from gallows good idea of yours have flaw in colin came step nearer brother eye dancing raymond cant resist said youve got to stand quite still while smack filthy face just once hard itll hurt im afraid youve just got to bear if resist in way will tell father exactly what have happened morning a soon a get in will tell at lunch before violet servant may settle to tell in case depends on how talk go off if dont stand still like good boy will certainly tell now shut eye see what ill give there quite stung finger so im sure stung face sit down think look nicer standing let think moment colin lit cigarette stared at brother a smoked youve be wise about one thing said in not attempting to deny truth of pretty thought reading youre beaten see darent deny youre whipped cur who darent even growl lucky for that youre coward now ive settled what to do with a soon a get in will write out for confession will say that intended to shoot put down quite shortly clearly what plan be will sign father will sign a witness shant read will tell that be private friendly little matter between just want signature im devilish good to know lucky that affair about revolver cartridge amused that smacking face then will send confession to bank to be kept unopened there except in case of death in case be to be sent to father thatll keep in order see wont dare to make other attempt on life because if be successful must be known that have tried to kill before must be suspicious circumstance hows face answer cant right said raymond good lord dont want to know about face what do say to proposal alternative be that tell father violet about rather fancy correct if be wrong that will believe shocking affair true answer accept said raymond of course do now pick up gun did have good sport with pigeon answer pleasantly got about forty said raymond hoped to get one more at corner didnt yes damned rude of to call pigeon ill pay out for philip be out on terrace when two boy came in colin took raymonds arm affectionately when saw hullo father said weve have ripping morning won match raymond downed forty pigeon theyve caught madman oh bicycle punctured by way be blessing in disguise for have jolly walk through old park found raymond weve have nice talk too want to witness something for after lunch whats said philip oh just private little arrangement that only concern shant show father ray oh think not said colin raised eyebrow a met father glance all right said just a like chapter viii colin be lying on beach of men bathing place at capri after hour swim great wave of heat have swept over europe now though be late in october condition of summer still prevailed might have be june still here with father quietly making plan have turned out so well on beach be that lay pondering reply to violet letter told be engaged to raymond have thought out reply here that congratulatory reply saying how delightful news be a for feeling hurt have be thorn to violet have pricked stung a have confessed have confessed to between dusk dawn on marriage night knew about casual kiss in dusk of yew hedge night before father left for italy have begun indifference to have made ache arrival back in england have made ache intolerable to be mistress at stanier have become worthless to to reward sense of worthlessness have come news that must not be that only colin stirred sun stained body to get fresh bed of hot sand pebble for back have absorbed heat of on have be lying little kneading movement of elbow brought on to baked patch be gloriously hot made pant with pleasure a anticipated one more cool rush into sea purred thought of lovely day have passed of lovely day be here of lovely day awaited quite methodically began at beginning violet have be married in first week of october on very day indeed have be arranged for marriage with raymond there be suave brutality about that have made raymond under slight hint of pressure advocate raymond under same hint have become marvellously agreeable have be almost sentimental have urged violet to be married on day must be best man if colin must allow instead of being bridegroom happiness appeared be of greater import to than own little conversation with colin in smoking room before colin went up to say good night to violet be responsible for scotch sentimentality raymond have be quite like noble character in sloshy play have understood entered into situation have given up without bitterness have rejoiced at brother happiness have be best man happy pair have left that afternoon for italy attitude have forced on raymond gave colin most intense satisfaction have be made to appear to be affectionate loving high minded altruistic colin knew what wormwood must be to be tiresome enough a knew from experience of last fortnight to be supposed to love when only liked how infinitely more galling must be to be supposed to love when hated did raymond justice mere hint at publicity for paper lay at banker together with mother letter confirmatory line from uncle salvatore produced wonderful result raymond must be bridled now with single silken thread colins thought turned over leaf of past pored over present delightful actual present there be sun baking chest leg hot sand pebble warm to back while cool clear sea awaited when rapture of heat became no longer bearable violet have not come down with to day have taken to rather more sophisticated bathing establishment at marina where more complete bathing dress be worn men did not dress undress in full eye of day colin quite agreed with that marina be more suitable for bay be really men bathing place though woman must come here if chose be rather apt to be embarrassing embarrassed must find hut at marina more satisfactory still more satisfactory to be to be rid of for few hour there be stern pitiless insistency about love bored must not be quite tranquil when from moment to moment have to make kind of response glance smile served purpose when violet be there have unless betrayed always to be on look out love be foreign language to must attend if be to reply intelligently liked liked quite immensely that be tireless instinct to be to mental effort be effort on other hand to be with raymond for there instinct of hatred functioned flawlessly automatically colin turned over page of present cast eye over future at first glance seemed prosperous there father have aged considerably during last few month just before marriage have have rather alarming attack of vertigo when after hot game of tennis have gone down with colin to bathing pool to swim cool boy have not be least frightened have brought father to land without difficulty on own responsibility have telephoned for father doctor to come down to stanier report have be quite reassuring man who have left sixtieth birthday behind must not over exert at tennis then bathe nature wise old nurse protested suggested eventuality for future doubt father must now be more prudent enjoy long ripe old age colin quite acquiesced father have be so consistently good to that scarcely felt impatience about what morning occupied with regard to future be idea not of father death of raymonds in uncertain world accident illness might carry off even strongest sulkiest must then be in very odd position supposing a be natural father died first raymond on strong case must be built on evidence of mother letter to salvatore erasure in consulate archive must doubt be incontinently hoofed out of promised land violet be in possession with a husband to owner if raymond died first colin by juggling must merely have robbed of birthright must be rightfully have be great stroke to provide at father death for raymonds penniless illegitimacy by marrying violet to submerge own not possibly must have provided for eventuality of raymonds pre deceasing father a well now that have married violet be worth while brooding meditating over other something might conceivably be done if raymond died first though must not a yet fashion manner of morning have sped by too quickly by now other bather have gone beach be empty colin plunged once more into beloved sea cool brisk welcome of encompassed vigour seemed to penetrate very marrow brain with incomparable refreshment began to think of problem with magical lucidity colin regretfully left water put clothes into boat in have be rowed round from marina meaning to dress on way there young antonio son of giacomo philip old boatman have brought round here be now asleep in strip of shadow at top of beach waiting till colin be ready to return there lay with shirt open at neck carnation perched behind ear lithe relaxed like splendid young faun boy mouth smiled a slept be dreaming thought colin of amorous adventure proper to age beauty black hair grew low on forehead black lash swept smooth brown cheek seemed pity to awake for minute two colin studied face violet before now have remarked on extraordinary resemblance except in point of colouring to colin wondered if through noble viagi blood be related liked to think resembled merry nino must almost have be willing to give blueness of eye golden hair take in exchange that glossy black caught tint of sky among curl then nino stirred stretched lazy arm found hand resting on colins shoulder at that sprang up ah pardon signor said slept have not be waiting colin have picked up italian with great ease quickness came naturally to tongue ive be watching smiling a slept nino said what have be dreaming about nino laughed if be not dreaming of signorino cried what about demanded colin oh just pack of nonsense said be in boat moved of without rowing together sat in stern be telling story of island have heard most of think by now be not going to dress ill

capri there be one here so shameful be thing done in so priest say sea rose swallowed know that priest be right say that do think signor to frighten from wickedness of tiberio one day tiberio saw scusi signor how attractive be pagan gaiety of young islander believed in sunshine wine amusement very good creed be took thing lightly except scirocco love be pleasant pastime affair of eager eye kiss smile at parting for have not seen nino in corner of piazza yesterday making signal to girl one of then strolling off in warm dark be quite without moral sense be ludicrous to call wicked pleasure sanctified did gave took slept off sought again how different from bleak solemn northerner imagine mused colin a really unspeakable history of tiberio gaily unfolded encouraging gardener boy to regale with bawdy tale how must snigger over indecency thus making indecent how heavy dreary must all be here be nino with dancing eye laughing mouth scusi signor be well fellow have charm breeding for birthright somehow mind vice did not sully end of story be rapidly told with gesture to help out meaning of recondite word for be approaching marina colins signora be waiting for there a nino have already seen with backward glance amazing moral be tacked on conclusion of dreadful doings of tiberio for when tiberio died god permitted devil to torture from morning to night a anniversary of orgy came round thats not likely nino said colin deeply interested if tiberio be so wicked devil must not want to torture must be devil dear friend nino took oar in one hand for second crossed what do do for nino asked colin be safer said nino who know where devil be colin made admirably apposite remark thing neapolitan said so mr cecil have told when found talking about devil nino be duly appreciative that be good said muddle up yes signor be a say if tiberio be very wicked devil must be very good friend do believe in devil signor in england be not quite sure in capri nino not when sky be blue like like signor eye said nino when there be scirocco be not so certain prow of boat hissed be quenched against sandy beach there under awning of stabilimento be violet rather fussed at leisurely progress of colins boat for in two minute more funicular must start if missed that there be dusty drive up to town quick darling quick called out have only couple of minute oh dont fuss said run on if want to nino be talking folk lore felt in pocket spoke in italian again nino havent got single penny said to pay for boat if be in town to night come to villa will pay if not to morrow will

waiting at edge of beach midday steamer have just come in from naples now there be need to hurry for funicular must certainly wait for passenger who be landing in small boat at quay nice bathe darling said a colin joined colin found mildly irritated by always saying darling must not speak to without adjunct might surely be taken for granted yes darling said lovely bathe darling darling there be certainly obtuseness about violet have not be hers in old day seemed to perceive impression of banter however good natured in repetition instead that slight flush colin now knew so well spread over face yes darling water be lovely said like warm silk ugh said colin fancy swimming about in silk what horrible idea have dont be so literal said just silky feeling look at boat load of people arent queer little round red one like tomato just getting out colin followed glance there be doubt whom meant for description be exactly apt even a grinned at vividness of vegetable simile sense of recognition twanged at memory past have thought over morning be sharply recalled somehow somehow future entered into why thats mr cecil said consul at naples must know vi mr cecil greeted colin with welcome deference consular business have brought to capri have idea that mr stanier be here be lord yardley here also somebody much more important laughed colin wife be on honeymoon violet be mr cecil

doubt remember about tea coffee to morrow day after day colin amused thus morning after morning raymond have to guess whether violet have be told until one evening wearying of particular game colin casually mentioned that guessing have be superfluous for violet have known ever since one day on honeymoon when have provoked by saying poor raymond even a cat with mouse so colin played with taking notice of except in ordinary intercourse for nearly whole day letting seem forgotten then with quivering shoulder must spring on again tap with sheathed claw velvet paw with more forcible reminder nip with needle like teeth be useless worse than useless for violet to plead for advocacy appeal to most elementary feeling of compassion only exasperated colin darling a if brain wasnt busy enough with raymond must go add to work like said ive got to cure of being sorry for raymond a well thought be cured when told tried to murder just let mind dwell on that planned to shoot from behind wall ill take there to morrow show place to make more vivid to one brother must not make such plan fail without suffering for afterwards perhaps must prefer that have succeeded ah made shudder then trembled deliciously ive got such delightful christmas present for little green jade pigeon with ruby eye cost lot of money green will explain to be jealousy of for he devoted to still red eye be colour of blood whole will remind of amusing morning new year came in with three night of sharp frost ice on bathing lake grew thick enough to bear lake be artificial lying in small natural valley through stream ran dam twelve foot high have be built across lower end of in be sluice gate thus stream confined by rising ground at side dam at end have spread into considerable sheet of water willow where stream entered nine foot deep at lower end where be bathing place header board pavilion for bather dam be planted with rhododendron bush whose root strengthened barrier in summer great bank of blossom overhung deep water path ran behind crossing sluice by stone bridge with balustrade raymond have gone down there directly after breakfast came back with news that have walked way that across ice that seemed safe enough for reason colin failed to fathom seemed in very cheerful spirit to day might be that end of christmas vacation be approaching when must return to cambridge might be that like colin have seen rapidity with old age be gaining on father there be humour in raymond looked forward little wonder to own succession here not knowing poor shorn lamb that must be worse off than ever when unpropitious event occurred a for remission of subtle torture return to cambridge must give there be several day yet thought colin opportunity for much pleasant pigeon conversation so raymond got skate while colin violet sitting cosy in long gallery wondered whether be worth while going out went down by long yew hedge to lake with brisk foot brightened eye after other people besides colin must make plan one of have matured morning into luscious ripeness sleepless night have be with hand squeezing for colins throat dawn breaking in on fierce disorder of thought before have distilled brain down to clear broth wild vagrant fancy got hold of goaded a be to verge of desperation by inhuman persecution red madness have flashed before like cloak that matador wave before bull whether charged not ribanded dart pierced have bitten lip till blood flowed in order to recall to self control to use hour of night when colin be with violet to hew out defence to fluttered red ribanded dart there have be handicap hate of colin have made violent whereas colins hate of have made colin calm self possessed must cease to rage if hoped to arrive at plan so night after night have curbed making wit reduce mad galloping to orderly pace pull steadily in harness grass be encrusted with jewel of frost step crunched miracle of design into powder now for first time since have come to stanier raymond fed with braced joy of frosty morning on banquet season spread be hungry for day have be starved tortured sick with apprehension shuddering at appearance of colin with rack pincer now be hungry again for good thing of life long draught of cold air be one of treading of earth with muscle alternately strong relaxed be sense of great woodland must in distant future be be third for how old how rapidly ageing be father cong must soon give to colin violet be fourth sweeter than how sour have turned love of violet if indeed there have ever be sweetness in lusted after that knew just because knew event of morning when have gone so awry thought of a more than desirable mistress have there be woodcock in frost of morning have lain so close that approached within twenty yard of before got up be near enough to see how pulled forward grasping blade of grass in reed like bill before must get long wing free of ground where squatted with flip flap skidded swerved through rhododendron bush even if have have gun with must scarcely have got shot flip flap be just so that have escaped from colins barrel night of thought when have bandaged eye of rage have given simplicity at last such simplicity a colin have so carelessly arrived at when came through oak of old park have trusted to extraordinary similarity of own handwriting to of colin have written letter in colins name to colins banker requesting to send letter have deposited there last august with note on outside of about eventual delivery in case of death to brother lord stanier whose receipt must be forwarded raymond knew to be desperate measure after nothing must be more desperate than position here bound hand foot to colin a long a sealed envelope remained at messrs bertrams bank might possibly make further inquiry telegraph to colin for confirmation even if happened colin be doing worst already such disaster have followed morning raymond have received from bank registered letter containing unopened envelope forwarded to by direction of hon colin stanier so now a went briskly towards frozen lake confession have signed be safe in letter case carried in inside pocket of coat for very luxury of living over again mad moment now be neutralised drew out read there be in crisis of guilt covered by colins pistol have consented to term now let colin see what must be response when next talked in flash of veiled lightning concerning shooting of pigeon concerning morning when there be lunatic at large indeed raymond determined that very day must fling challenge instead of sitting dumb under colins blistering jibe must defy must insult provoke till be stung into sending to bank for famous confession vowing instant disclosure of whole matter to father how raymond must snap finger in face for threat how when colin received answer from bank that packet in question have be sent by own order to brother must choke with derisive laughter of hate who without solid proof must credit tale besides raymond have ready now doubt lord yardley must remember witnessing with colin paper about now impotently jabbered have not brother come in together ever so pleasantly on morning of pigeon shooting asked for witnessing signature paper so raymond now framed have set forth how have determined to make better job of brotherhood than have hitherto done to realise violet colin be mated in love already pact have fulfilled for never have two spent day of such public fraternal amity write to bank for in name colin must be supposed to have said tear up dear ray itll be fun too to see if can distinguish handwriting from mine be what colin must find waiting for if sent to bank for document on insane accusation be based skate fitted on to boot clanked in hand foot trod briskly on frozen soil must soon be own eye teeth of colins be drawn father aged rapidly without doubt before many month park gate must have clapped on to final exit of colin wife perhaps must let stanier to dollar gorged american have feeling for other two must abhor that never yet have stanier be tenanted by alien be enough to make dead turn in graf what be more important must make living writhe perhaps colin must be very rich ala must try to take must be lessee must be closely scrutinised so here be lake with stiff frozen margin stamp on short slide over black ice produced cluck of remonstrance pavilion of bathing place be on other side felled tree trunk made comfortable seat for exchange of walking shoe into boot with skate on have spent winter month in switzerland two year before hungered for bite of blade on sweet fodder of black field instantly a in swimming instinct of balance came back to with long stroke curved out on to delightful playground outside edge dropped turn outside back taking up of direction with other foot colin at moment have made up mind not to skate till after lunch im lazy said to violet im tired of baiting raymond be more cheerful than like morning vi will smoke cigarette think of something new lord ive got match there be paper basket handy drew crumpled envelope from meaning to get light with from log fire uncrumpling saw be addressed to lord stanier idly turning over a made spill saw seal of own bank envelope be registered tore narrow strip off edge of used for purpose must like to sit here talking to morning said beastly motor bicycle of mine have gone wrong again think ill go up to stable to see about skating afternoon isnt hate seeing raymond skate because he so good at a want to skate whats to be done colin floated off in crisp graceful manner never be so alert a when appeared to be loitering why have raymond received registered envelope from bertrams bertrams be not raymonds bank what have envelope contained strolled out of front door stable lay to right raymond hugely cheerful that morning have gone to lake be in opposite direction so deferring matter of bicycle went down by yew hedge along path on top of dam behind rhododendron must hear ring of raymonds skate on frozen surface raymond must have to cease sport explain matter of envelope hidden by bush have nearly come to bridge over sluice when from close at hand there came noise of loud cracking splintering across lake great splash for one moment colin stood quite still heart beating high fast then with quickened pace walked on to bridge over sluice ten yard out be large hole in surface with jagged edge cap fragment of broken ice floated on bubble rose from below have be carried under ice thought colin how cold must be water be deep there what be to be done nothing seemed must run up to house get help rope plank something to put out across gaping hole on sunlight glittered before must return hope chance rather of saving raymond must have passed be there no other plan mind usually so ingenious resourceful seemed utterly blank save for overwhelming curiosity a to whether raymond must come to surface again just once just for second a looked leaning on balustrade of bridge raymonds head appeared face be white wide eyed lip of open mouth blue with cold across ten yard separated eye met colins bright sparkling with exuberant life others stricken with ultimate desperate terror colin waved hand so youve fallen in said ill go see what can be done if im too late well good bye rather cold isnt last word be spoken to emptiness there be cap still floating stream of bubble breaking on surface of sparkling water colin gave one leap in air like young colt whose limb tingle with joy of life rubbed hand be chilled with leaning on bridge of course be use going to house shock cold soft smothering water must have done work long before must bring help resource of stanier so powerful for living have succour consolation for dead indeed must be better not to go to house at for must not imagine in ecstatic moment simulating haste horror must be appropriate to occasion so making circuit through wood strolled ten minute later into stable yard to see about bicycle have pleasant word for groom joke for motor mechanic just then brain must only be occupied with trivial thing great glittering curtain seemed to be let down across behind be stored treasure splendour presently when came to must inspect showed to violet father who be in long gallery when got back to house said word about motor bicycle hoped that raymond be having good time went into smoking room now be time to pull up that glittering curtain till then fact of raymonds death just removal extinction of have hidden might lie behind now colin saw with amazed gasp of interest how activity of brain be needed to cope with situation raymond be finished with while father still lived remote unexpected unlooked for have occurred yet not quite unlooked for one morning dreaming on capri beach colin have taken possibility into account have let simmer mature in brain a outcome have made violet spend night at house of british consul in naples how wise have proved must have be grinding teeth if have not done swiftly ran over whole process from beginning though there be problem ahead of so far course have be flawless first have come erasure in consulate register insertion of single numeral in mother letter to salvatore must have to see dear uncle salvatore again that have smoothed way for marriage with violet have ensured even if raymond lived to be hundred own mastership that of child after at stanier be not mastership in name for must be husband to mistress knew that name alone must be lacking to completeness of possession must not have provided better for eventuality of father death according to human probability must occur before raymonds fate that blind incalculable chance have decreed otherwise colin gave frown muttered exclamation to recognition of fact have left register alone torn up instead of emending mother letter must now be heir to stanier a indeed truly be in own right be pity to have devoted ingenuity to have saddled with considerable expense a regard that troublesome salvatore when fate time be busier wiser than yet have be necessary be use wasting regret over what stood in way now be letter register with regard to former be easy to destroy to indicate to salvatore that required of be to hold tongue if necessary to tell mere simple truth that have given colin two letter one seemed to recollect dated march in sister announced marriage other fortnight later giving news of birth of twin uncle salvatore with viagi pride so colin smilingly reflected must be glad that stain on family honour must be expunged rosina be married when brought forth for too be pleasant to have bar sinister lifted from must not allowed have weighed heavily on in case must have be amply compensated for by enjoyment of stanier expulsion of raymond now there be need for ounce of bitter so much then for letter must be destroyed violet must ask in vain for production to prove possession what letter do mean darling must answer yes letter must perish at once turned thought to register there at moment reposed in archive room bearing erasure so easily overlooked so convincing when pointed out have to look carefully so to speak must see nothing erased numeral stared at have be true in keeping copy of entry certified to be correct by mr cecil bore earlier date now that violet have be informed of erasure must when stanier changed hand insist on production of register knowing where to look what to see lawyer must draw conclusion even in absence of confirming letter might easily satisfy jury register have be tampered with in whose interest colins by what hand without doubt by father not that must hurt then own there be danger remote perhaps alive smouldering on page must be quenched colin recalled meditation on capri beach foresaw contingency with vividness a clear a be october air on morning circumstance of be equally sharp edged in memory sense of hot pebble of beach on lay sea crystal embrace awaiting when got baked pining for coolness nino joyous pagan boy asleep in shade vesuvius across bay with thin streamer of smoke be milieu where thought came clean clear to clear clean that morning have thought be providing for very situation piece of lay in brain like last few fragment of puzzle have need even to fit together for must see how curve corresponded with curve angle with angle be in order ready to be joined up now that raymond no longer blocked way key piece round others fitted be undoubtedly that visit of violet to mr cecil then came quick step up passage violet burst in oh colin said terrible thing have happened uncle philip walked down to lake raymond be not there boot be on bank there be hole where ice have given way at deep end uncle philip be getting men rope chapter x be not till well on in afternoon that body be recovered day cold have be intense rope with tackle for terrible fishing got stiff frozen at sunset found stream have carried along below ice towards sluice philip sat up with colin in long gallery when violet lady yardley have gone to bed felt sorrow for have not liked raymond have not even loved with fatherhood for have be given to colin often often have longed that colin have be eldest now there be none other than colin must have that father coveted for though felt sorrow felt remorse pity remorse that have not liked dead son of pity that have died young reproach colin most bitterly have be saying be hard to be kind to poor raymond kept kindness at arm length ought to have tried more ought to have taken example from never wearied of kindness colin laid hand on father arm evening have be keeping thing together by tact so supreme that appeared pure naturalness have talked quite freely about raymond recalled hundred little incident in raymond be mild hero shooting prospect of playing football for cambridge be clear too that tragedy have made very little impression on grandmother so have taken for granted that must play rubber of whist why not mustnt think of like father said did what must made very jolly for here liked coming home be going to stop here whole of christmas vacation know if have not be enjoying must not have done colin revelled in underlying meaning of word how raymond have be enjoying hadnt philip servant came into room carried on tray raymonds watch chain pocket book found on lordship body lord said thought best to bring philip took looked absently at watch have stopped at few minute to eleven must have fallen in almost immediately said have better look at what be in pocket book may contain paper must be attended to not until moment have colin given thought to what raymond have received that morning in envelope from bertrams bank now in flash conjectured that whatever be felt doubt of what be must be found in pocket book father even then be opening how lucky be that have not told father about attempt of raymonds how splendid must appear own magnanimity own unfailing kindness to must emphasise even more by reluctance that father must examine remains water be true might have got in soaked paper if be there into illegibility leather of pocket book seemed to have resisted well might easily prove to contain legible document got up in excitement father did not understand be wise to do do think asked in quick anxious voice there may be something there will pain paper must be gone through said father have reason colin cant explain said colin paper be coming out of pocket book now in way perished by long immersion be damp held together colin glanced with lynx eye at a father unfolded there be couple of bill must see philip laid on one side then came to half sheet of foolscap read line two looked at bottom of saw own name what be said signed by raymond witnessed by dont look at father said colin knowing that be inevitable that father must read anything be witnessed by let take burn cant do said philip what doe mean what ah dont read dont read said colin in voice of piteous pleading must then listen to instead will tell never have father looked so old haggard a then have seen enough of what be written there to light horror in eye blanch face to deadly whiteness tell then said colin sat down on edge of father chair terrible story said hoped must never know seems inevitable remember father a tell that raymond be dead voice failed for moment mean forgiveness doesnt said death be forgiveness see what mean who have to teach that will see collected again be after came back from capri in summer after vi be engaged to said that what be referred to there took place poor raymond always hated thought have love must have be a well then have violet love after have accepted for husband there be thought in made so bitter that that poisoned got poisoned must think of like thought

raymond be homicidal fellow got hold of one of keeper gun next morning raymond went to shoot pigeon bicycled on motor to play golf then then father must suppose that devil came to raymond wasnt raymond who planned what raymond did expected to come back along road from lodge hid in bush at sharp corner with gun resting on wall plan be to shoot must have be at distance of few yard only lord yardley interrupted voice be hoarse nearly inaudible wait minute colin said reminds of something have heard yet only half heard colin nodded know said ill tell presently there be poor raymond waiting for to come round corner there be madman loose in park somewhere if plan have succeeded must have be supposed that be madman who have killed accident happened bicycle punctured walked back for trudge along ridge of old park colin choked for moment caught glint of sun on gun barrel by wall at sharp corner said wondered who what must be must not be escaped madman for have told at lodge that have be caught then remembered that raymond be out shooting pigeon remembered that raymond hated occurred to definitely then felt sick at thought that be waiting for then father mere instinct of self preservation awoke if be raymond if be terribly right must not go on like in constant fear of life have to make safe stole down taking cover behind oak till got close then saw be raymond be white with rage be sick at heart have revolver with for vi think have persuaded to take out in case met wretched madman father have met wretched madman covered with then spoke to told that if moved except a ordered must kill collapsed atom of fight be out of emptied gun of cartridge laid down time there wasnt cartridge at in revolver have taken out forgotten to put back be after have collapsed that found that out wan smile a unlike to colins genial heat of mirth a moonlight be to noonday sun shivered trembled on mouth vanished again leaving so serious so tender confessed said have to make safe told must put confession into writing sign must witness be done told do remember that raymond have secret pact wanted witness to signature be be that hold in hand now sent to bank bertrams again in self

before may dine there again want to see other people enjoying want sun be medicine be kind good doctor to mr cecils treatment so congratulated seemed wonderfully efficacious that evening colin cast sad thought behind between one thing specially between one drink be after twelve oclock before returned from dinner to mr cecils flat again even then story be half told mr cecil drew key from pocket to unlock very private drawer where there be photograph about now felt sure colin must be sympathetic youll like giggled a produced print help colin see have put out whisky for oh lord how funny said

so finished own wanted of course dear boy said just night cap eh drop of whisky at bed time ive noticed make one sleep sounder colin be on apex of watchfulness photograph after photograph be handed to long before came to end of effect of night cap be apparent in mr cecil key still hung from lock colin a replaced last of unblushing series got up stood between table drawer host that statuette there said pointing to other side of room surely weve seen photograph of mr cecil chuckled again chuckle must hardly emerge from sleep slack mouth ah ill tell about to morrow said looking round at colin with one of caressing boyish movement put hand on mr cecils shoulder ever so imperceptibly drew towards door feel different fellow altogether said will sleep like top have enjoyed ought to give up consular work start cure for depressed young men youd make fortune be out in passage by time be clear that night cap have banished thought of key from mr cecils head saw colin to room lingered moment to see that have wanted then went to own charming young fellow thought performed somnambulistic feat of undressing fell into bed colin heard door shut then in moment turned off light stealthily opening own door stood in entry listening for sound for minute two there be faint muffled noise from host room soon be still except for creaking of own shirt front a breathed then re entering room stripped put on pyjama soft felt slipper must be noiseless on board outside once more stood there waited now from inside mr cecils room came sound rhythmical reassuring enough light dribbled in through uncurtained window to guide step without fear of collision glided into room have just left felt way to table where key still dangled unloosed grasping in flap of jacket so that must not jingle

work at one time gave mastership of stanier raymonds death have given more completely no longer served end be only danger yet must destroy mind went back to night that violet have passed together here how supreme have be wisdom over for supposing on father death that violet threatened to contest succession on information have given to induce for certain to marry what now must register show excised leaf in whose interest have be to remove except violet for with disappearance there vanished a far a knew record of marriage have have opportunity of doing so certainly for have not spent night here on return from honeymoon must be so unwise a to send lawyer here to examine register on ground that have be tampered with must be faced with tampering of unexpected kind leaf have gone how lucky before suspicious disappearance colin have copied out entry of marriage have certified a correct by consul have safe with date march must be surprise to poor violet when knew finger of suspicion wavering hitherto must surely point in one very definite direction a for letter from rosina to salvatore viagi of must profess knowledge on colins authority what did mean where be letter uncle salvatore whom colin must see to morrow must be found to know nothing about about destruction of page colin fingered own smooth throat a considered that supposing violet seriously obstinately threatened to contest succession what if when page be found to be missing be discovered in locked secret receptacle of own must be devilish funny colin hoped thought that must not come to that liked violet must be good must be wise click of electric switch noise of step outside sent heart thumping in throat next moment have page into despatch box turned key on step passed room be no longer

bereavement joy at seeing colin collino mio cried what happy morning be for poor uncle yet oh what terrible blow have fallen on since last saw dear friend dear nephew heart bled for when saw news so young with such brilliant prospect lamentable indeed enough squeezed colins hand turned away for moment to hide emotion at death of one on whom have never set eye wore enormous black tie in token of grief be otherwise a troubadourial a ever must put away sad thought continued be on tenter hook to know what brings to humble door not further bad news not that beloved father be well hope beloved wife also revered grandmother yes put out of suspense health of be not so much anxiety at moment to salvatore a desire to know that be well with very pleasant financial assistance colin provided be easy in fact to guess real nature of suspense consequently colin found delicate pleasure in prolonging little yes theyre well said father bore blow wonderfully considering how devoted be to raymond

recovered seriously uncle salvatore said want to see if can not recollect that marriage letter be dated first be very important that must do that will be disastrous for if dont just want to recollect clearly be right about letter will never be produced for have destroyed surely when sent thought that be a say probably will never be called upon to swear to belief just possibly may must be nice if must recollect that must remove stain from honour of illustrious house also parenthetically from poor shield colin paused moment with leg crossed in attitude of lazy ease lay back in low chair scratched one ankle with heel of shoe mosquito already said what troublesome thing there be in world mosquito know uncle salvatore want of money for instance if be scheming inventive fellow must try to arrange to give pleasant annuity to mosquito on condition of not biting if one bit after must withdraw annuity what nonsense be talking be getting into sun warmth delightful society make foolish

adored idol have be nightmare to to think ah be just that bad dream be not letter imprinted on heart colin evaded embrace be like monstrous goat in thats settled then said be only teasing when pretended not to remember will be sure not to forget again wont forgetfulness be such natural failing what dreadful consequence may come of let thought of be nightmare in future uncle salvatore therell be pleasant reality instead if will only remember pleasant reality be nicer than bad dream come true ill be going now think can not permit exclaimed salvatore wine biscuit thanks said colin have wine last night though cant remember biscuit probably there be vittoria cecilia what anxiety removed with regard to future movement dear collino exclaimed salvatore go to capri colin thought of tawdry bibulous evening probably awaited uncle question put new idea into head innate love of wickedness made desirable to to hurt who be fond of if affection must bring advantage uncle salvatore at rate must hing more for be not sure that mr cecil must mr cecil have be wonderful host last night have fulfilled utmost requirement of guest in getting sleepy drunk be there more use for mr cecil drink photograph leerings at attractive maiden of naples be very stupid sort of indulgence yes to morrow said perhaps even by afternoon boat to day alone said salvatore how gladly must relieve solitude must bring vittoria cecilia how charming family party colin felt flamelike quiver of hatred spread through nerve vibrated with reached to toe fingertip delightful suggestion said for vittoria whatever other one name be dont want of thank havent seen of guess what be like from youre like youre like mixture of troubadour mountebank man who crack whip at horse in circus uncle salvatore youre

vittoria other make stupendous error im very kind to know im benefactor to considerable extent so mustnt think unkind when utterly refuse to saddle with company butter bread for be content with good bye love to vittoria so be done strolled back along sea front towards consulate capri little more solid only than cloud floated on horizon with delightful goal so near be miserable to picture tiresome crapulous evening with little red bounder last night stupid wearisome though hour have be have yielded prize sought for whereas to night there must be prize of sort in view interminable drink stupid photograph why waste time energy in second hand sort of debauchery have be prepared when started from england to spend with mr cecil a much time a be necessary in order to achieve what be main object of expedition be accomplished now must be so much happier at villa where be after expected to day than in seeing mr cecil get excited familiar photographic intoxicated whispering stone pine vine wreathed pergola piazza full of dusk youth step of belated passenger on pathway outside garden made sweeter music than voice of inebriated consul with hint giggle stout middle aged people if there have to be such in world must keep quiet read book leave mystery joy of youth to young be there in cloud floated on horizon that have first realised hand led in scent haunted darkness whispering of night wind fed soul with nourishment mr cecils cocktail photograph be starvingly lacking in must feast there to night promise to spend night at consulate on return from capri made good desertion to day for in point of fact mr cecil felt considerably off colour morning rather misdoubted capacity for carrying off with semblance of enjoyment repetition of last night reproach disappointment be clearly complimentary rather than sincere afternoon boat carried colin on once have made that journey with father once with violet must wish have brought of to side must no more have breathed than have thrown off boat did not want to be jostled encumbered by love hear gibberish with eager eye revelling in sense of being alone with errand already marvellously accomplished watched mainland recede island draw nearer through fading twilight light be springing up along marina presently there be nino alongside in boat ready to ferry ashore with joyous paganism serene indifference to good evil be far closer to what colin hungered for than father violet closer yet so colin realised be hatred between own dead brother then presently there be garden dusky fragrant with odour of wallflower freesia whispering of warm breeze from sea oblong of light from open door to welcome on table just within there lay telegram for with vivid presentiment of what contained opened father have died quite suddenly few hour ago whisper of pine grew louder breeze suddenly freshening swept in at door thick with garden scent with greeting with felicitation chapter xi just fortnight later colin be lying in one of window seat of long gallery at stanier reading through paper required signature have come by post nino have just given for have brought boy with from capri with view to making valet own said always looked a if be listening to reading of ten commandment colin have use for person nino at rate must bring cheerfulness touch of southern gaiety with shaving water besides servant approached italian in dexterity willingness now that pause of death be over adjustment business taking up of life again have to begin lawyer be getting thing in shape for supervision particular paper be tedious hard to follow be expressed in curious legal shibboleth make unprofessional mind to wander tried to attend effort be like clinging to slippery edge of ice must get firm hold of deep water kept closing over there below terrace lay lake where have seen one such incident happen by that have become heir to that fair shining spring day shewed father death put in possession now morning wherever turned eye whether on lake woodland within on picture carved ceiling be stately home light desire of eye with that meant in wealth position have passed again into hand of colin stanier handed down from generation to generation ever more prosperous from namesake who have built enduring wall founded splendour of father death there be little to tell when coming straight back again from capri have arrived here at set of stormy day philip have reeled a crossed hall one morning fallen on hearthrug in front of holbein for hour have lived quite unconscious suffering nothing then breathing have ceased until moment of stroke that bursting of large blood vessel on brain have be quite well cheerful rejoicing in fact that colin by now have found sun again already longing for return violet have be colins informant told thing with air of detachment from have characterised intercourse with since raymond have come home for last christmas vacation have watched then with secret horror dawning in eye colins incessant torture of brother dismay darkness have spread shadow on in month of honeymoon when first really began to know colin interrupted for time by return home high festival of autumn have returned to then with fresh infusion of blackness never once have spoken to about treatment of raymond be conscious that watched shuddered did not seem that love for be extinguished that horror of hers existed side by side with yearned for love even while shrank from pitilessness feared too not only for ruthless iron of for very charm have power over more potent yet then came week after raymonds death colin thought saw in waning of fear of that reflected be natural time so read mind knew must be mistress here in own right seemed very reasonable that must gain confidence for last few day when wheel of life be now beginning to turn again saw with comprehending sense of entertainment that there be something in violet mind be trying to bring up to certain point be not hard to guess what be be silent preoccupied dozen time day seemed on verge of speaking of knew be subject of thought till to day father mother aunt hester in becoming mourning have be with now have gone violet restlessness have become quite ludicrous have be in out of room dozen time have sat down to read paper next moment have dropped from lap be staring at fire again lost in frowning thought knowing what communication when came must be colin from very nature of case must not help out with wished that must wrestle with vanquish hesitation if have be who in present juncture have have to speak to raymond on identical subject how blithely must have undertaken then finally violet seemed to make up mind to take plunge sat down on edge of seat where lounged extended arm put round well vi said be finding hard to settle down be too weve got to do dear aunt hesters little black bonnet did ever see anything so chic roguish get sprightlier day violet looked at gravely there something have to talk about colin said know what be will let speak for minute two without interrupting put finger on line to have come in tiresome document solicitor assured required immediate attention hour two darling longer better said what be be sure know something nice hope ah be about birthday perhaps last affair that dear father be busy over be plan for birthday of course have counter ordered everything must keep next year well what be wont interrupt more colin leaned back with hand still under violet arm a if to draw with bent with little way then disengaged hate what lie before said ask to believe have struggled with have tried colin to give whole thing up to let be yours cant long to be lady yardley in own right a told must be on uncle philip death that mean fancy understand that think might have given that up if be only of whom have to think dont know cant be sure paused not looking at did not want to know till be done how be taking of course anticipated knew must be here be plain point of havent got only to think about said before many month will bear child will bear other child after perhaps be thinking of of since married have learned thing about be hard in way did not know be possible have love compassion must defend child against only way can do be to be supreme must hold rein not will be good to will never cease loving think cant put in hand must do if did not now use knowledge conveyed to did that with eye open asked for accepted what position here will be did chiefly out of hatred to raymond be motive tell on decision hate more than love be frightened for child be true that when accepted raymond did because must get stanier be mistress here anyhow think be wavering must have thrown over before married have accepted though knew marriage with forfeited other then told be otherwise that in forfeiting stanier found even more completely colin have promised not to interrupt gave sign of sort finger still marked place in legal document have sent for father solicitor said have told be here before see wanted to tell that will instruct to contest succession will tell about register in consulate at naples about mother letter to uncle said must let have on father death must mind giving now therefore may wish to see colin moved ever so slightly for first time looked at there lay with wide child like eye mouth sometimes seemed to to have kissed very soul away have smile for grave glance just so have smiled when torturingly tried to remember exactly what have happened in old park on day that raymond shot pigeon even while thought of relentless pursuing glee charm of sweet supple youth of fire softness smote on heart wont go away till be over said will be horrible for colin dont want to suffer letter be want of will tell mr markham about register will do be necessary go back to beloved island be robbed of stay there wait there until business will be horrible for be done can see dear mr cecil again added trying to smile back at yes might do said colin thoughtfully in fact probably will must try to take in what have be saying cant understand must explain referred for instance to mother letter what letter dont know of letter of mother a being in existence still le have got how must have died when be few week old do mother write letter to baby at breast two letter to uncle said colin planted levering elbow by side sat up suppose be who be mad said because talk quite quietly coherently yet dont understand single word of what say letter from mother to uncle ah took hand again amending plan in accordance with talk with salvatore youre right said uncle salvatore did once give two letter from mother to little faint thing destroyed not so long ago one must never keep letter youre right vi uncle salvatore did give couple of letter once when on earth did mention to what memory have got quite true one announced mother marriage other spoke of birth of poor raymond what of what oh must be mad what in heaven name do mean when talk if understand correctly about sending somebody out to naples register in consulate there succession be connected isnt usual for son to succeed father im at sea be asleep dreaming pinch darling want to wake up what register nightmare sense of slipping slipping slipping took hold of violet erasure in register said that told colin swung leg off window seat got up there be electric bell close at hand rang there plot said have idea what be want witness with regard to anything further that wish to say to whats name father solicitor mean oh yes markham dont speak word to turned back on waited till servant came in ladyship wish to see mr markham said ask mr markham to come here at once colin began be just such face that turned on now a have given to one evening at capri not word said hold tongue violet youll speak presently mr markham appeared precise florid colin shook hand with wife have statement to make to said dont know what be have not yet made concern succession to father title estate have therefore better be made to in presence please tell mr markham what be about to tell violet in dead silence briefly clearly violet repeated what colin have told on night that be engaged time looked at mr markham must have said with tenderness anxiety when have finished spoke hope will go into matter without delay mr markham said wife a have already told be perfectly right in saying that uncle will need address gave two letter from mother to be right also about subject of letter be under complete delusion about date of destroyed not so long ago be afraid so only person who can possibly settle be uncle to whom hope will apply without delay doubt will have recollection of indeed cherished for year if date be a wife say that told be must have known that brother be illegitimate so much for letter colin found violet eye fixed on face deadly pale wore stillness of stone with regard to wife allegation about register said deny that ever told such story have to add when father be in naples last summer made at request copy of record of marriage from consular register thought fancy that in event of death certified copy of here in england might be convenient for purpose of proving marriage made that copy mr cecil consul in naples certified to be correct gave lawyer few day ago when be down here be of course open to inspection colin paused let eye rest wistfully on violet wife of course mr markham said be under delusion have made allegation in justice to think will agree that must be investigated supposes dont darling that there be erasure in register at consulate showing that have be tampered with that erasure point to attempt on one part presumably father own to legitimatise child in answer to be content for present to say that when made copy saw such erasure did mr cecil who certified correctness of mr cecil to whom will give introduction doubt will remember incident be glad have got that copy for if register prof to have be tampered with may be valuable belief be that such erasure exists may suggest mr markham that trustworthy person must start for naples at once will take affidavit be not of uncle with regard to letter of mr cecil with regard to genuineness of copy of father marriage will also inspect register matter be of utmost immediate importance turned to violet vi darling said let agree not to speak of again until mr markham have obtained full information about now perhaps must like to consult in private will leave mr markham shared colins view a to urgency importance of setting matter at rest left for naples that evening
