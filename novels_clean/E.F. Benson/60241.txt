be nothing whatever in appearance disposition must remind friend of moon while be still of early age have taken matter into own hand disregarded baptismal name always called peggy suited quite admirably in own opinion be hideous fact for so honestly frankly considered to be did not in least weigh on mind did let very acute instrument of perception dwell on for be mere waste of time to devote thought to be so palpably inferior knew that mouth be too big that nose be too small that hair might if anybody wanted to be really candid be called sandy did not suit with rather dark complexion knew too that eye be green since be so considered time rather hastily that must therefore be ugly certainly be not for have to wonderful degree that sensitiveness power of reflecting mood

power of friendliness friend therefore followed be many though unanimous verdict be that looked charming with rather severe commonsense distinguished took epithet a confirmation of own opinion for nobody except one enemy said one looked charming if be ever so faintly possible to say that one be pretty beautiful to mind look charming be rather clumsy mode of indicating one plainness accompanied

something of what remained to have studied have worked with whole force of quiet indomitable will have held to knew even in darkest hour to be fact namely that nobody must ruin life for unless acquiesced in ruin a long a must say to allow to be ruined be not to day might fairly say that attitude have become habit to dark hour still came hour of gloom impotent revolt against searing burning year have be through be no longer habitual london never remembers anything clearly for long never wholly forgets spring when edith allbutt have appeared again staying at rye house with sister faintly

broke into full torrent of song other noise of night became one long sustained chord that accompanied edith have now come to river bank stood there in silence of soul hardly listening to just receiving into magical song seemed to concentrate kindle into one flow of melody music that world held did not speak of be eternity of youth immutability of love everlasting beauty of world be there

banished actual external world a by ansthetic saw peggy coming out black blot from vividly illuminated oblong of open french window by drawing room opened on to lawn husband have lingered inside to look at evening paper peggy turned called to darling toby do come said be so late be so hungry well begin not wait for anybody hugh be sure to be late for heard splashing about in bath a came downstairs edith be always punctual be more than be edith called ah there be told so peggy hurried across lawn a edith came to meet listener be listening do hear good of sometimes said a if must ever hear otherwise oh edith what divine night yet sudden interruption be jar to edith here be human voice speaking a kindly a sincerely a nightingale world be not complete without men woman be late went on peggy be really hughs fault who be later dont know do name be mr grainger be playing wild indian with child told fairy story end of heard have sense whatever in be quite divine yes wont think of waiting for must make feel so strange lord rye followed wife out three of sat down be small neat man of extraordinary placidity who regarded wife rather a philosophical citizen may regard meteor cross sky above garden never ceased to admire wonder at always seemed to that crossing over own sky so to speak be act of great friendliness on part often looked up wondered vaguely how fast travelled for spectacle of speed filled with gentle mathematical pleasure at thought of pace be going knew too that sky streaking meteor never failed to come home that for lightning expedition dropped there to husband child naturally also played about with other meteor of whom be hugh grainger too lay about in hayfield told child fairy story repeated to father in fact there be never couple who be so right in liking loving other see that government majority on fifth clause of education bill began toby when have received soup oh toby dont said wife very well said lord rye took up spoon oh darling said peggy edith isnt darling tell so edith looked gravely at brother in law be darling toby said im sure thats very kind of said toby there christian science case meteor interrupted toby dont talk about thing have happened said so dull hasnt happened be going to tell what perhaps might be going to happen thats better said peggy go on dear at moment hugh came around corner of tent have to wash said in defensive apology yes must think so after hay remarked peggy weve only just finished soup hughie arent so very late hugh looked round vividly boyishly coming out of thick dusk of garden eye be little dazzled in concentrated candle light of tent how be lord rye said holding out hand eye be elsewhere dont think began oh dont know mr allbutt do said peggy edie be hugh grainger chapter ii edith allbutt went to room that night feeling that have passed very pleasant slightly astounding evening that did not feel in least sleepy at inclined to go to bed astounding part of evening in main have be hugh through dinner peggy have fireworked away out of sheer good spirit matchless joy of living after dinner have be very insistent on necessity of going on river in punt playing ghost in garden huge high spirit be quite clearly natural to fireworking be quite obviously direct result of in way at social duty squib rocket be a much part of a slight slender frame quickness of movement gesture thatch of thick close cropped hair vivid handsome face with dark eye clear white skin dinner time be there be of be just boy with excellent health almost unlimited capacity for enjoying at end of dinner felt that knew hardly more about than have at beginning felt however though dimly be afraid rather ungratefully for have be really very entertaining must have be sour nature hers be not to feel otherwise than exhilarated by presence of so alert vitality that if be always like that must become rather fatiguing then at once told that be old woman if must not be young must be matter of rejoicing not of fatigue that other people must be that playing indian with child before dinner be characteristic much more to mind that too have not done felt from direct wish to amuse child have done because enjoyed so much though first motive must have be more altruistic therefore must suppose more admirable liked second one best then after dinner have begun surprise boat be locked up lord rye have gone indoors peggy refused to play ghost be clearly impossible for to play ghost alone with hugh have strolled three of up to veranda outside drawing room hugh have caught sight of new steinway grand over peggy have a explained just ruined then hugh have said ill sing to if like peggy have thanked almost reverently edith remembered with extreme distinctness what thought of there be something of coxcomb about young men ought not to offer to sing however well knew hostess be just little like stephen guest for moment wondered whether firework after partook though ever so slightly of nature of showing off hugh went in at once a peggy sat down in chair on veranda close to open window have said to doe sing well yes fairly well said peggy edith thought heard little tremor of laughter in voice edith wondered a sat down what must sing be intensely musical rather seriously so expected something of geisha kind specie of song with be not much in sympathy perhaps even must be worse than more directly comic must be harder to bear waited for inevitable running up down of hand over keyboard usually precedes melody of who offer to sing did not come instead there came one bar of introduction to schumann widmung played with quiet restraint of real accompanist played quite simply perfectly then sang song be perhaps just shade low for for voice be not that so often doe duty for tenor namely baritone screwed up a be nailed firmly to new pitch real tenor soft on high note with intense purity of tone be seldom heard except in boy unbroken voice here there be passion of adult voice passion in simplicity noble sincerity also so knew instantly that voice so wonderful in have be trained to utmost pitch of perfection year of work year of patient learning under supreme teacher have gone to making of perceived almost at once for fine mind cultivated taste require little on to found judgment then thought no more either of voice singer wonderful accompaniment so easily surely handled be just song filled first fine careless rapture more meditative sequel whole hearted cry of love devotion at end on mein gute geist mein besseres ich just laughed laughed aloud for pure pleasure of since beginning of scarred maimed year have not laughed quite like from inside hugh heard laugh pleased enormously knew be singing to one who understood applause word of thanks praise must have spoken to so directly when have finished edith sat still saying nothing for really there be nothing to say mouth smiling from laugh eye little dim peggys oh hugh be said be nearly a appreciative a sister silence sang couple more song one by brahms short one versed be jordan from meistersingers then came joined on veranda thats end of parlour trick evening said promised reuss not to sing much on day when smoked much have smoked much will now smoke more wonder if enjoyed a much a did said edith oh more probably because be such fun doing thing said must have worked very hard did reuss teach entirely at moment childrens nurse appeared in drawing room peggy went in to see what wanted interview seemed not to be satisfactory for went upstairs with leaving other two alone yes brute say wont give more lesson oh not because dont need more made that delightfully clear though of course one knew because wont take up professionally lit cigarette turned around to edith why must said really have rather row say isnt fair on edith felt so keenly on point before answered have to remind that have met young man for first time that evening ah see point of view must say said voice be a know worth anything till be trained owe good deal everyone who hears sing good deal dont want to said hugh a if quite settled matter paused moment do let consult said if doesnt bore see what have happened be that opera syndicate have asked if must take engagement for next year thats what have row about did definitely say must not yes refused to take answer until have thought about said must take fortnight to consider what be to sing in hugh laughed again really sound quite ridiculous said suggested tristan meistersingers lohengrin of course have studied particular part though must have to work hard autumn winter imagine reuss told that in fact imagine worked whole thing edith looked at gravely across brain there came so vividly impression of how must look in blue silver of lohengrin of how silken voice must sound in dead silence of lohengrins entry when turn to swan with nun sei bedankt mein lieber schwan that have almost effect of actual hallucination again have to remember that be stranger to so intimate in quarter of hour when sang have voice made dont think sound ridiculous mr grainger said of course be business yours only whether say yes think must come hear added then if be ah if be must of course do do not being cant understand refusing got up good gracious said havent desire instinct to make have so strongly must so love to impress on world to know that there be hundred of people listening to to make laugh cry to make beside with happiness mute from pure misery paused moment have consulted know said so be own fault do see also reusss point of view then suddenly burst out laughing here be advising a to career when few hour ago have never seen said hugh went straight off on tack oh such dreadful waste of time getting to know people said one know person in couple of hour so else one never know at peggy came down again at moment looking a if have be trying anyhow to be severe edith really bedtime said besides im going to talk to in bedroom probably for hour edith got up nothing wrong peggy asked be child right yes only daisy have announced firm determination to sit up in bed not go to sleep that child can when chooses be naughtier than round of inferno what doe daisy want asked hugh oh heard singing demanded that must come up sing to otherwise be going to sit up in bed until morning that doesnt sound very good plan observed remarkably bad one own daisy have great strength of character im sure dont know where get from good night put light out wont when come upstairs be very hot night hugh stood at window for minute two thinking over evening felt somehow rather stirred excited by two minute talk with mr allbutt for have literally not occurred to at to think of decision a affecting anybody idea that action must affect other people meant attitude of mind egoistic be quite alien to then close on heel of came thought upstairs sitting up in bed with firm determination on feature be daisy waiting till came to sing to honestly seemed to matter much more than operatic career put out light a have be desired to do went upstairs night nursery a knew be just beyond own room be opposite mr allbutts have turned into sister bedroom on way to own to get book so happened that hugh passed on to room while be still there just beyond be door of nursery wide open like window for lady rye be of open window school hugh with backward glance a if be rather guilty went into night light be burning dimly saw little night shirted figure sitting straight a grenadier up in bed in performance of vow hailed with little coo of delight oh hughie have come to sing said how long have be be so sleepy sitonim little brute said hugh really be too naughty why cant go to sleep properly like chopimalive if have come to scold like mummy announced daisy with dignity neednt have come at thought voice quivered little with tired fretfulness thought have come to sing to will sit up just like until do because said so be so sleepy mr allbutt have found book wanted be going to room close by when heard pipe of childish treble at though be honourable woman deliberately stopped listened im sleepy too said hugh little suppressed sob be answer youre not a sleepy a said

best how doe begin asked hugh oh silly sleep baby sleep though im not baby mr allbutt must not help deliberately spied there be big chink in hinge of nursery door looked through hugh be lying with black head on pillow close to daisy a have said bed be not big enough one foot be on floor other leg thrown over jim have not be awakened appeared by daisy deviltry little yellow head on pillow of bed be sunk in sleep daisy have dropped grenadier attitude be lying down in bed two pale little hand grasped one of hughs just last verse then said hugh sleep baby sleep yes hugh turned little so that

hugh sang a artist always sings a if particular song be one that have longed lived to sing there be same perfection a have shown downstairs there be more perfection possible now youll go to sleep sitonim said couldnt help said daisy at mr allbutt went swiftly silently to room closed door craftily be thought over expecting hair brushing visit from peggy must have given precise account of why must have so taken possession of mind except in so far that to musical soul marvel of beautiful voice be wonder be ever new be not hughs singing alone have so stirred more than be little vignette seen through chink of nursery door of radiant youth with radiant voice lying with head on daisy pillow singing in order to free very obstinate child from vow of sitting up until sang to while time knew quite well that ought not to sing at even if pope asked to probably in latter case must have done so like artist have not mumbled whispered though be only singing to one small girl by illumination of night light have sung a if world be listening a if career hung on note yet same boy have rather turned up nose at idea of singing walter tristan lohengrin at covent garden appeared to be much better worth while even in defiance of master order to sing daisy to sleep peggy followed soon after having peeped in at nursery door seen that daisy be already fast asleep nurse doesnt know how to manage child said with air of extreme superiority went up just said have to go to sleep that there be question of hugh coming to sing to what call suggestion edith must not help laughing did go sing to said heard saw oh suggestion plan rather fall to ground then oughtnt to have done quite exactly like wouldnt sing more for daisy be different matter can sing fairly well cant feel rather reverse of daisy said edith feel a if shant go to sleep because sang oh peggy if have influence with do use make go on stage really think that there be moral duty attaching to gift like just a there be moral duty attaching to great wealth mr grainger cant have be given just to sing to daisy know worst of be that be just argument one can not use to hugh must make blush purple to say that to why because whatever else be be absolutely free from self consciousness argument though undoubtedly true one suggests consciousness oh hate word duty even to say that thing be one duty implies one be thinking about though doubt from most excellent motif for sake of other people when get boy like hugh whose huge kindly instinct take place of duty must be really like corrupting to suggest that have duty that talent be given for reason edith walked up down room considering do remember comte remark when doctor told be dying said quel per te irrparable continued peggy there opposite of hugh same be irreparable loss said edith so be year in mr grainger remains private nightingale told evening that have be asked whether must sing in three wagner opera next year oh make peggy hasnt got stern parent of description

edith shook head oh peggy if one suffers then certain thing become unrecapturable one begin day to acquiesce in one limitation when one be really young everything be possible when one be old most thing be inconceivable now be talking like andrew robb remarked peggy of course because be one age be measured by what one expects from life to be quite candid dear expect very little hope on own account to continue being moderately agreeable quite patient quite pleased that other people must enjoy a for heart beat long breath why be finished be ridiculous heresy woman only love once said peggy have known heap of woman who have loved heap of time have told so go to bed peggy because be getting flippant dont understand pleasure good gracious yes hope to have lot of will go mad with pleasure if andrew robb prof successful will look forward even for whole year to seeing mr grainger play lohengrin just a for whole year will look forward to seeing whether delphinium sent will do well at mannington will oh darling will shut up said peggy decisively may call flippant be cynical whether call not when speak of expecting nothing more from life must sooner be anything than cynical even dentist where will breakfast why mr grainger answer categorically please dont argue because be late edith laughed categorically then be mr grainger because introduced to will breakfast in room want two egg otherwise dont get through morning indeed what happens instead be interminable of course will have three said peggy sort of grass not even commonest variety ever grew under peggys foot thus having promised to see what must be done with regard to inducing hugh to accept offer of opera syndicate laid plan next morning without loss of time instead of going to church a ought to have done sent toby there with chopimalive sitonim who have slept till morning announced to hugh that whole duty of particular man be to take out in punt mr allbutt asked will lunch with at one thirty said peggy be in nature of ultimatum hugh when be thus put firmly before behaved like sultan of turkey did a be told peggy be not quite sure that there be not so to speak good deal of moslem fanaticism smouldering below apparent docility however established comfortably on heap of cushion remarking on beauty of view put up huge contadina umbrella extinguished for mile round now wont go far said because will get so dreadfully hot punting simply broiling isnt oh hugh how beautifully do im sure must win punt race if went in for put head on one side a if listening very carefully then having considered remark in bearing put tongue in cheek face however be hidden from peggy by expanse of red umbrella went guilelessly on do lot of thing so nicely went on never do anything with im sure must write beautiful fairy story just like alice through looking glass mean in wonderland suppose said hugh dare say must win punting race hugh removed tongue from cheek merely because wanted for purpose of speech figuratively be there still be writing volume of fairy tale several in fact said be going in for punting championship of northern europe oh how can tell such story said peggy easily there not slightest difficulty about have better put down parasol moment be going to tie up underneath tree oh weve hardly gone hundred yard said be clearly purpose to argue with cant argue while im punting if like will drift down mid stream there be good many excursion steamer about tied up accordingly just below odney weir since peggy intended to begin arguing at once did not seem worth while to disclaim intention of doing so sing so well too said surely ought to do something with of thing now dont interrupt a insist on did come out to argue with argument be to be conducted without interruption from asked hugh yes see be twenty four arent be really middle age nowadays when everybody be past everything at forty time did something doesnt really matter much what do a long a do something men must work a mr kingsley said dead silence from hugh according to instruction peggy wanted to argue question on general line make suggest singing a profession since did not officially know of offer of opera syndicate hence continued with glorious generalisation see be necessity to work said for of though think mr kingsley said that woman only have to weep cease at point to use a authority good heaven how dull must find london if only went to luncheon dinner ball concert life be simply idiotic unless do something doing thing be much more necessary for men than for woman because men be not naturally frivolous be only frivolous because woman ask to play about like like flower maiden parsifal hugh gave little explosion of laughter beg pardon said didnt mean to interrupt then dont because be going on until have finished good gracious think that one of saddest sight that world have to show be unoccupied bachelor who be always ready to go out to tea make fourteenth when there must otherwise be thirteen have be in good many slum factory shelter have never seen anything quite so sad a must have be reading work of president roosevelt said hugh not one line have occasionally driven up down st james street looked at row of bald head back to window in club wretch read time more probably daily mail morning totter out to lunch read pink green paper afternoon totter out to dinner then go to bed close weary eye till late on in following morning hugh will become like if dont take care may speak asked be much older than because be thirty eight though dont look neednt say that through fourteen year separate have be always learning one thing happiness lie in being busy year then romantic picturesque always beat in celtic blood be half irish came to tongue year time whatever be be like golden river flow round said may just sit in a be doing watch golden iridescent stream flowing combing round be letting run to waste use brain hughie let brain talk to finger let finger pull bit of water into grasp that thought be only just water just passage of time in heavenly world be real tangible thing golden thing finger will make golden something book statue song out of must mould carve bit of time when be finished will let float down again on golden river of time who come after will see handle did not want to interrupt now peggy a well knew be doing something for more hour in day for more day in year than one knew be not often that vein of romance surged to surface have quite forgotten must be confessed missionary enterprise on have set out hour ago at sister suggestion just now be speaking not from anothers wish out of own heart oh ought to be so busy said grasping at golden time moulding drop of into golden image also when do that be not only using time be saving be ours be only spent wasted when let go by make of be invested becomes thing of gold that float down on golden river ah dont see hughie be grave too now then do waste time when tell child fairy story sing to asked dear make bigger thing write book of fairy story said be writing only didnt believe win punt race even only didnt believe take hold of world somehow sing to do anything to added afraid have betrayed knowledge hugh be extremely susceptible using that word not in confined sense of being easily influenced by woman in larger meaning of being quick to be caught by idea to be weather cock be phrase have have attached to sense if not opprobrious at rate little depreciatory in reality to be fitted with simile be highest praise since implies wonderful sensitiveness of temperament be never other than artistic to catch to record faintest breeze blow be better gift than to stand four square like tower defy wind of heaven be not denied that four square tower be eminently useful a far a usefulness of sort be concerned weather cock be not in way comparable to yet blowing breathing of wind be perhaps worth record tower show if hugh be obstinate a peggy have declared be be obstinate perhaps with deadly obstinacy of weather cock however much world in general shout northeast will continue to register southwest if seem to that wind be coming from quarter there may be clattering screaming a have said weather cock go on exactly a before on occasion hugh perhaps because have received command did not argue even when peggy said well what have got to say only pleaded original command in defence tongue have be in cheek before a punted back again for lunch again came out want to ask one question said pray dont answer unless wish did mr allbutt tell that opera syndicate have made certain offer mind dont draw conclusion if refuse to answer peggy have put up huge red umbrella again at put down with snap hughie will never tell not to talk again said for believe guess best when be silent when did guess oh guessed right at beginning said did very well said quite beautifully used beautiful language about golden river well asked peggy oh nothing particular be only going to suggest that must have be simpler to have advised at once to accept offer at rate to have asked whether intended to instead of suggesting must go in for punt racing mr allbutt also advises to accept have practically made up mind not to here be again at home what pleasant morning chapter iii peggy rye probably one of happiest people in london be unquestionably one of busiest a be habit of really busy people must always find time for everything pursued myriad scheme of philanthropy kindness not only with sense of duty brought to lively genuine interest that made

to employ there be few day when be in town on great barrack of house in pall mall be not open to something of alleviating charitable nature house in fact a hugh have once remarked be sort of clapham junction of philanthropy relief train ran screaming through in direction at shortest possible interval while like general pointsman for line tugged at lever sent train on various way lever may be remarked be of various kind be firstly own energy position time wealth that cheerfully eagerly devoted to charitable deed secondly used time position money of friend plundering with utmost avidity

past bearing a for instant when wanted to give bazaar during ascot week told that though appeared not to know there be limit for a have be said have most valuable of social gift namely habit of enjoying be quite irresistible though did not spare be even more merciless to herself must be remarked too that without taking cynical view of effort service of friend be unquestionably very comfortable thing for of otherwise worldly inclination to be friend of peggys for did not confine a might be gathered to making lower class more comfortable at cost of comfort to upper ministered with same eager unwearying kindness to taste if who be musical for instance lent talent in aid of scheme on side be always ready to lend opera box entertained largely in town country be also in caravanserai of london one of very few people who really mattered though wealth way in spent might be supposed to have something to do with such supposition must be entirely false where there be so many more wealthy than who must spend uttermost farthing to matter yet never succeeded in doing so what mattered be wisdom charm cachet so seldom won of woman of kind who instead of spending busy life in amusing spent seriously in ameliorating condition of people while at same time gave went to dance entertained be entertained be entertaining socially enjoyed immensely with big house genius a hostess deep rooted desire that other people must enjoy especially at expense be on pinnacle in own world while like skilful circus rider of two horse used to sell guinea ticket make people buy leadless glaze of innocuous dinner service must in fact couple invitation to week end party not at sequestered cottage at cookham at big house at kingston with request for couple of pianoforte solo from renowned player at forthcoming concert in aid of specialised sort of cripple in manner of significance must scarcely be missed peggy have rather rare wholly enviable faculty of being able to sit down think when sitting to arrange thought having arranged particular strain of occupied to dismiss again thus when left cookham following day in order to open bazaar at waynfleet hall in afternoon lunched in train arranged thought be concerned with speech be going to make when arrived at paddington be at leisure again able to give up to most entrancing form of entertainment namely mere watching of busy jostling life of street how spectacle enthralled to keen vivid mind there be such delectable pasture on to browse not even liquid dustless lawn river be so entrancing much a loved swift play of mind on mind much a loved mere quietude of thames green forest idle nonsensical vivid intercourse with friend with friend grave note be often struck there be nothing more attune to than sight of eager crowded street alive with stranger enigma to not le enigma to have once said to that always got up early even in london of late hour for fear of missing something sentiment appeared to wholly admirable what be afraid of missing knew indeed have be definite missing must have be engagement appointment of sort must have be devoid of romance be very vagueness of to half practical half celtic mind be so attractive something might have happened have said how dreadful to have be asleep like pig be so like yet be like too though unsatisfactory that must hing definite with life that must refuse wonderful offer to sing at covent garden artist like have for last four year absolutely devoted to cultivation of voice spending five winter month in year in desolating town of frankfort so a to allow distraction to interfere with lesson now when practical reward for industry be offered refused to a to edith seemed almost crime miracle of voice have be given also part though not of artistic temperament like genius have unlimited capacity for taking pain what have be left out be ambition have strong a instinct internal need of learning must of art of singing not wish to dazzle hold world be for singing sake that for five month in year have cheerfully undergone incomparable tedium of frankfort not for sake of knowing on other side of footlights huge hushed house packed from stall to gallery be holding breath in expectation while stood before master in meadow by pegnitz a tristan strained dying eye over untenanted blue of cornish sea for ship came not voyaged miraculously on swan to where by scheldt maiden elsa called on unknown nameless champion at present anyhow sting goad of ambition of impressing on others have not awoke in did not in least care whether world knew that sang a long a reuss knew knew to edith refusal seemed criminal for never before a far a knew have man voice arrived so early at maturity perhaps at perfection at last ideal wagner hero have come one who be still young still with glow thrill of youth on at last be possible to see tristan who be not middle aged obese lohengrin who must indeed be ideal of girl dream possibility be ruled out because hugh didnt want to be a if key unlocked priceless treasure be put into hand of idle irresponsible child who might throw open jewelled case simply did not care to turn key peggy made effort to bring back thought into more usual channel for at point became aware again that be driving down pall mall wasting time terribly in thinking about hugh instead of devouring crowded pavement turned attention to there be elderly man exactly like rabbit talking with curious nibbling movement of mouth to middle aged woman whose face be like chest of drawer square obviously useful with knob on then passed hansom in be sitting arthur crowfoot one of red hot faddist who spend whole time in pursuing health giving practice have spent april in deep breathing one be liable to come across even in street sitting on little green chair in park looking rather apoplectic because be holding breath for ten second previous to expelling slowly through left nostril while right be firmly closed by finger then gave up deep breathing devoted may to open air cure being quite well already with result that caught dreadful cold however have remedied by giving up eating flesh living on curious gray paste made of nut drinking water in sip for hour two day at moment be observing tongue rather anxiously in looking glass of hansom so did not see peggy registered premonition that nut paste must probably be soon abandoned how heavenly people be then be really in luck found sort of enchanting thing circus be going somewhere elephant at colossal moment did not want to go instead wanted bun with view to getting have taken stand kindly extremely firmly on pavement opposite guard club have inserted trunk through open window of smoking room picked up pall mall waved hysterically in air then ate little further on two intensely english looking men appearing to be rather annoyed with other wanted to pas one going east other west with aggrieved offended face danced sort of sideways minuet in front of other choosing same side simultaneously then man on bicycle approached with tied up look about face peggy must not imagine why looked so tied up until hideous convulsion seized sneezed pavement have be lately watered bicycle skidded fell off how longed to go back see whether elephant have more beautiful plan mr allbutt be staying while in london with sister brother in law in huge chocolate coloured house in piccadilly hugh have called clapham junction of good work dozen family must easily have be accommodated there without coming into contact too close for perfect liberty of action a matter of fact friend relation be encouraged to did treat rather like hotel without bill for what a peggy said be use of dwelling in marble hall in very central situation unless one friend will come dwell there too so came dwelt since peggy with true hospitality besought everybody to make arrangement chose to ask anybody to dinner to go out to dinner to have high tea exactly a wished without consultation notice given to provided only that one motor car must be considered a indeed be private property not to be used without reference to similarly on day of big dinner party asked that intention of of staying with must be notified a soon a convenient so that servant must not go mad in ordinary routine when one person be going to opera to theatre third dining quietly at home at eight people simply went to dining room at time have appointed there a by miracle always found that something be ready for thursday evening in fact night when andrew robb be going to make bow before dramatic world be typical instance of ordinary night lord rye be going to opera with sister have ordered dinner for half past seven peggy mr allbutt hugh be going to dine at seven in order to be in time for first fatal excruciating rise of curtain while frank adam week of whirl have be down to ascot day preferred to dine at home go to ball afterward peggy have be delayed in manner have be impossible to foresee over charitable visit to east end returned at exactly seven meeting edith a came downstairs dressed on way to room darling be late said wasnt fault look perfectly beautiful how can be so calm go in with hugh a soon a come dont wait for because must be there in time whirled on to room edith finding letter two for on table by hall door stopped to read witnessed hughs arrival who like peggy seemed somehow to be going faster than usual on dismounting instantly became involved in dispute with cabman a havent got money cant pay said rather shrilly forgot a tell to bring though im frightfully rich if youll call at dover street to morrow cabman contribution to dispute be to say cheating pore cabby at interval said now be so unreasonable continued hugh wont give watch oh there footman dare say can borrow must give eighteen penny please shilling hugh handed shilling if hadnt be so rude said must have have eighteenpence so hope will be lesson to oh there be mr allbutt arent cabman ridiculous be late peggy be later said have only just come in be to begin without went into dining room in be several small table took seat at one laid for three be never quite sure if enjoy first night said hugh sound polite a be going with to one be so agitated on behalf of actor how author can bear at be thing pass comprehension dont see how can bear to be present of course must be beyond human power for to stop away ah name of andrew robb inspires with confidence said name doesnt sound a if be likely to be nervous hugh looked at with deep interest dont suppose there be andrew robb do asked feel certain there isnt nobody ever really be called that do think dont see inherent impossibility in oh surely cant happen do often go to first night hardly ever said until last fortnight dont suppose have slept in town half dozen time in last three year how wise yet peggy tell that be most confirmed of cockney be in town nine month out of twelve yes then like said hugh eating fish very fast so be wise also how few people know what like yes doe that surprise think be rather difficult to know what one like anyhow most people only see world through eye of others in consequence only like think like what other people like know what like remarked hugh roundly what be oh almost everything said sincerely congratulate said there be gift so enviable a of liking mr allbutt a hugh noticed for second time more emphatically than before have voice of singular charm to to whom ear be main organ of communication between soul that of thing external to seemed voice of wonderful temperament be very level in tone pitched on rather low note for woman quality of be fine clear little veiled a if came from really inside brain not from throat merely utterance too have great distinction there be nothing slurred clipped about word stood up like flower in field personality gave significance what said be echo of other voice be genuine personal a much hers a face cool long fingered hand even have talked mere gibberish voice must have be thing to listen to for melody of a be music be accompaniment to thought so delightfully made audible at moment however while very simple sincere sound still dwelt on ear like song peggy gorgeously though so hastily attired came in with rush snapping bracelet on to wrist ah if only government must bring in eight hour day for upper class cried how must work for conservative liberal socialist whatever be have be on warpath of charity since nine morning make ten hour already if think have done yet why youre mistaken have be mistaken too because find that ladyship be at home at eleven quite forgot so youll come back with hugh wont after theatre cant how tiresome of there going to be dancing be going to talk to other for hour at twelve glass slipper of rather large size be coming for im going to ball wish be dead dear dont said edith anyhow why asked hugh because shant want to go out again must one know quite well that one enjoys everything when one be doing even enjoyed dentist yesterday because be christian scientist told have nerve in teeth even if have wouldnt hurt because mortal mind a far a understood did not really exist then there must have be teeth either remarked hugh thought of too mouth be full of syrinx syphon pad of cotton wool so couldnt talk oh yes doing thing be always pleasant whatever be now hugh wont do thing hugh nodded at be other point of view one dont see have written to reuss not actually because refused to take answer for fortnight practically what be other point of view demanded one dont see hugh looked from one to other seemed a if mr allbutt also be waiting to hear about other point of view merely that to be effective to do thing however excellently isnt necessarily only thing in world worth living for a say like doing thing must be bored discontented if be not flying about like like well said peggy well if dont mind like bee against glass window said hugh go banging about in direction stopping really in pretty much same place serpent said peggy pray go on think will because ive be thinking about probably will forget unless say soon oh think be wrong about bee glass window at least only partly applies to for do get through thing although like bee only charge wildly at like working sixteen hour day having time for lunch plea add to that that have nice nature follows that work sixteen hour day for sake of other people hugh pointed almost threatening finger at if have to work sixteen hour day for wouldnt have slightest idea what to do can improve condition of other people to extent havent got idea a to how to improve own time must hang very heavy for if have to use in improving mind consequently tend to think that people who do try to improve mind be lazy havent got real sympathy with art music literature mainly want to go squall at opera because feel that will then be doing something definite peggy put elbow on table go on about said deeply interesting coil wriggle sting dear serpent very well be hopelessly conventional peggy gasped conventional asked yes have often urged for instance to go into parliament merely because be obvious thing to do do conventional thing with almost fanatical enthusiasm bazaar friday in lent garden party to congenital idiot be so stereotyped there be nothing original about except when induce friend to buy dinner service melt dissolve when soup touch then expect to buy more cant hugh paused moment ah have said cant think of anything dont want to peggy looked at in sort of comic despair dont know what be talking about said because never thought of before said oh know what mean quite well do say for mr allbutt said turning to smiled at do know thing called olian harp said be matter of few string put up in tree happens whether blow gale whether sun shine whether be frosty olian harp a imagine always responds make music of kind oh olian harp began peggy dear be peculiar sort of olian harp ordinary one only make sound when wind blow imagine one turn everything into song be romanticist dreamer be neither moral immoral be only exquisitely sensitive not only in matter of heart in sympathy in kindness in intellectual thing hugh laughed oh how nice sound cried do let go be olian harp then with one of quick eager movement turned to peggy thats other ideal said to catch there be turn into song peggy be grave there be so many thing cant be turned into song said since very wisely recognise try to turn into shilling there be romance about wretched family dying of lead poisoning there be song about except funeral hymn besides gather that hugh want to be olian harp well thats just what want to be whole point of argument have be that must turn thing into song at covent garden got up must go said because have to be there at rise of curtain will follow in hansom olian two sister drove off together in motor be only thing of own that peggy laid claim to conventional said with sudden spurt of indignation be demanded turning to edith suppose everybody who be very young like think other people rather conventional said to be conventional in sense be unfortunately necessary if one be to do anything with life one have to choose one line stick to not mind about other line disregard in fact didnt call conventional said peggy still humorously indignant besides want people to work make happy ah make happy mean of course many people must be happier if did work be not sure that working may not be sort of substitute only for great thing whats great thing why living never feel sure that working be not sort of drug make dream be living to be really alive matter so much more than anything peggy looked at in alarm pray say none of dangerous thing to hugh said will certainly never hear in tristan be afraid think of for said mistake make be in thinking that working interferes with living doesnt people who cant live only get substitute for in work will make happy people who be really alive be not le so by working ah be much sounder said peggy here be in queue already appears to extend from circus to hyde park corner edith gave little groan something discussion at dinner with whom have discussed have completely taken mind off what be coming sight of queue however recalled arent hugely excited continued peggy how can help being yet look a if be going out for drive in country to see place where izaak walton be born feel a if be going to see place where edith allbutt be buried remarked that lady appears to to be gruesomely interesting whole world seems to be coming to funeral service ah not soul guess who andrew robb be said peggy feel sure of mr grainger probably among many more said that be quite obvious there couldnt be andrew robb did seem unlikely when mentioned if huge howling success a know will be said peggy wont unmask andrew edith shook head not till play be established said when have run fifty night will again groaned slightly hasnt run one yet said tragically perhaps wont oh peggy know have fallen between several large hard stool gambit isnt risky so one section of audience will yawn isnt melodramatic so section will cough doesnt contain horse play so third will fidget quite realise now will join in booing how do boo never mind will soon know at dress rehearsal morning nobody appeared to know one single line of part curtain stuck at end of second act ah a told brilliant dress rehearsal mean failure said peggy isnt just possible that section of audience will like play because be indecent farcical dont think so said edith in case will be turveydrop of deportment will join in booing will be insincere said peggy be in plenty of time for rise of curtain indeed orchestra have only just begun to play what be called arrangement from la tosca when took place hugh who with masculine cunning have directed cabman to have nothing to do with queue to drive boldly up centre of piccadilly stop in middle of opposite theatre have got there before be already in box watching rapid filling up of theatre certainly production of piece have roused considerable interest minute before curtain rose house be packed in corner while shrill buzz of conversation always so eager expectant on first night nearly drowned arrangement from la tosca for london fault may be be like athens passionately fond of anything new production by one of best known actor manager in middle of season of play about author of nothing be known be event thoroughly aroused curiosity stall box be crammed pit be one huddle of close packed face gallery be a if swarm of bee have settled on higher more shrill rose buzz of conversation from part of huge hothouse glittering with light then suddenly light went out orchestra stopped rustle of settlement sounded in darkened theatre curtain went up hugh too settled down with sigh of contented expectancy be so nervous said just think of andrew robb act be rather long though there be sign of impatience audible in house yet skilled observer of audience must not have be completely satisfied with quality of silence be silent be true silence probably betokened attention be not a yet throbbing palpitating silence show absorption a in first act good deal of preliminary work have to be got through lady in blue dress have so to characterise in dozen line even if appeared a probably must in second act in totally different colour there must be mistaking that be lady in green have to be mr ashworth other coining of personality have to take place so that came hot ringing from genuine human mint also line of circumstance have to be laid down must have be clear to mind of skilled what reasonable outcome must be only be not quite clear there be still nebulous point on fall of curtain hugh instantly put finger on what seemed to be weak point rather long wasnt said werent there too many aimless bit of talk oh be well written thought dialogue excellent just like people one want plot one want point peggy glanced instantaneously at sister ah what seems to be pointless in first act may prove to have very sharp point said one cant tell there certainly be lot of excursion in dialogue of course if prove to lead nowhere play be hopeless one have to see edith moved so that sat in shadow of curtain yes criterion of first act be last said cant tell if be good first act till have seen end dont think so mr grainger quite agree though that seemed long seemed frightfully long to hugh shook head think ought to know guess at last act from first said anyhow guess two three possible end here cant look at hero at least suppose mr amherst be hero never know mind from one minute to be utterly inconsistent isnt possible that weakness of purpose may be point of play never thought of oh how interesting if be so cant be because must make like real person modern play never resemble real people in way bet be bad play mr amherst be going to develop totally new overpowering characteristic will make whole of first act waste of time do bet on possible ability of andrew robb asked mr allbutt have seen nothing to warrant opinion of house in general tended to coincide with hughs critic olympian of intellect who can leave theatre not before eleven in evening have column about in respective engine of press next morning yawned gathered together in foyer with sense of coming futility too who have come in obedience to peggys command wondered whether andrew robb might not be discovery of hers whom have found scribbling fragment of dialogue in dinner hour at leadless glaze factory certainly be very clever of if be so also very clever of dear peggy even if be pushing leadless glaze rather far doubt at little gathering to night after play one must glean something band having chopped pagliacci up into bit like murderer trying to conceal body be silent again curtain rose for second time have not long be up when silence of quite quality began to spread like waveless tide over theatre what have seemed idle talk in first act took significance on be dark featureless dawn sad enough doubt intensely human began to show contour of landscape audience began to see little careless sentence remembered because of certain distinction unusualness in flashed back again into brain here be meaning be plot be character inconsistent vacillating hero became moment more pathetically human inadequacy in dealing with little thing developed into helplessness of weak man before thing be not little poignant domestic suffering remediable probably by strong man seemed to paralyse must not make move gambit slowly too inevitably counteraction of who be becoming adversary be apparent be short act curtain came down swift a guillotine knife with supreme dramatic fitness moment that whole of position have through indecision become almost irremediable be revealed then for moment there be dead silence afterward before applause huge buzz of eager conversation everyone talking to neighbour argumentative with own idea of solution of gambit must be selected in third last act to audience play have ceased to be play have become piece of life in hour actor have become old friend stall argued right left box be knot of eager disputation pit be babel for three minute went on hugh be characteristic of rest oh be glad didnt bet said because of course be point might do several thing of must be characteristic what heavenly people poor wretch why be like so suppose be heavenly too isnt play at what will be way out why be in theatre after stood up began applauding violently same fact namely that be in theatre seemed to strike rest of house simultaneously from buzz of conversation there rose storm of clapping shouting once again peggy looked secretly across to sister usual barbaric ceremony followed principal actor appeared with fearful grin on face bowed retired came on again did again then for third time appeared hand in hand with leading lady repeated

keeping on hand novel dealing with affair strictly of present fashionable foible frailty learned from how frivolous unearnest london society be becoming must thus warn mannington by example precept against insidious infection mannington indeed especially in summer month be afraid be not altogether outside danger zone perhaps spent more time over garden party strawberry scandal than be right not that canon alington be sour puritanical at underrated value of timely social gaiety to unwary thing might tend to become end in more dangerous yet degenerate into continuous expensive round of pure pleasure week in week out that seemed to characterise season in london clergy generally thought did not make most of opportunity of usefulness by not keeping abreast of time warning flock of danger lurked beneath too great indulgence of innocent indeed helpful socialite also by too sad aspect at tea party total abstention from gave impression that thought such thing wrong canon alington never fell into mistake wife fortnightly little dinner be distinguished for plain yet excellent cooking soundness of wine though be teetotaller sober strenuousness of conversation from indeed scarcely topic

be there hint of religious disability in party dissenting town councillor be entertained there canon alington never showed shade of abated cordiality in welcome of despite great gulf divided from indeed there be reputed atheist among regular guest who never went to sort of church at though there be wonder in canon flock when first be known that mr frawley have dined there by way be common knowledge long before lunch time next day broadness perhaps set canon alington on higher pinnacle than ever text thing to men be felt to be at last rightly understood also dined at frawleyss have be asked to say grace did so so mr frawley in groping purblind way be broad too to night too duty of host must be also for wife brother hugh grainger be coming to stop with for week end of friday till tuesday though can not be said without gross misuse of language that approved of hugh must not help being somewhat stimulated by occasionally in quick youthful way hugh made remark that more mature cultivated mind of canon alington found very suggestive be for instance who have said that rake progress be unsuitable to put up in drawing room because be so intensely violently moral might a well have gramophone shouting ten commandment day on side table though remark be of course exaggerated implied certain flippancy that canon did not find at to taste have not prevented from using germ of truth contained in recently written paper for literific hugh also in point of fact have be author of little conceit about earliest pipe though be only just to to say that have idea be to be have be solemnly inscribed on sill of gothic window of pipe rack yet canon alington have be more than half author of for have quoted original line of tennyson to hugh who have merely said birdseye put on pipe rack indeed hugh have not known where original quotation came from for with superficial quickness seemed to brother in law to have very little real knowledge canon often told that what needed be deepening meditation over half pipe of tobacco lasted few minute for be alien to native activity of mind to indulge in vague reflection of kind soon took up morning paper of day so busy have be have not yet have time to look at outside heard crunch of gravel of what be called carriage sweep be probably not hugh who usually arrived only just before dinner time if be caller wife be out be never disturbed in study for chance visitor indeed on outside door of have playfully put up motto abandon hope ye who enter here explanation of often formed pleasant little topic at dinner party when men guest crossed hall to join rest of company in drawing room so turned over page of paper secure from interruption in general way there be not much to detain in london day by day short paragraph concerning huge success of new play gambit arrested read with distress remembering original criticism of drama have appeared in same paper have shown so clearly that play be typical of tendency of day seemed to so dangerous for such be outline of plot girl have be married young far too young in fact to man much older than who a canon alington easily saw be person of extreme feebleness indecision of mind subsequently fell in love with young cousin of husband who lived with though there be suggestion of infidelity on part be clear that author intention one andrew robb from solid sound of something better might have be expected be that pity sympathy must be extended to be only by degree that indecisive husband saw realised miserable state of affair after wretched vacillation committed suicide that to put baldly canon alington always put baldly affair with felt sympathy be skeleton of play of daily telegraph have so warm appreciative critique now appeared that london be going mad over play pined to know who andrew robb be canon opinion of london have always be low very fact too that play be said to be beautifully written to be instinct with humanity true pathos made more dangerous in single point be of test of literary artistic immortality have laid down so convincingly in paper of afternoon satisfied husband committed suicide because wife have weakly allowed to fall in love with somebody else there must not possibly be germ of immortality in hodge podge of weakness wickedness yet in interval looked a if be going to live long lustily be called human frail feeble a canon alington knew humanity ala to be did not think of so badly a at point however musing set up again by paragraph be interrupted for carriage departing wheel of have just again crunched gravel contained not caller hugh who have caught earlier train crossed grass to below window of study put hand on to sill vaulted on to upsetting small saucer of seed have be put there to soak before being planted oh im so sorry said im afraid ive upset something how be dick dick must be confessed have constantly to make little effort of self control when hugh be in house made quite willingly be ashamed to think that be effort made one now ah there be hugh said cordially how be what burglarious entry whats damage seem to have upset little bean said hugh sat down on saucer so rest tipped up better than that must tip up said brother in law be only of new lupin be going to sow gone on lawn have be of consequence luckily have more will put to soak sow to morrow instead that will be to morrow not to night rather neat eh browning hugh gingerly successfully accomplished task of getting through window into room somehow if brother in law have said clumsy brute how beastly careless be must have felt le blamed than being not blamed at in christian manner hows agnes said shaking hand very well a busy a be down here said must very likely be late for tea told not to wait hope havent interrupted at at anything said hugh unable for moment to remember name of thing made canon so busy not in least have finished paper perhaps have saved from fate of idle hand will go out have tea in garden be cooler think out of door there seems to be le of gale out of door than in study remarked hugh always like living in temple of wind canon smiled approvingly anything suggestive of classical allusion always pleased though exactly how must have reconciled love for classic with view have so pointedly expressed to day that art to be immortal must be religious must perhaps have puzzled have arrived at age dignity put generally beyond risk of being asked awkward question hugh however sometimes asked thing brother in law felt sure must understand when be older occasionally have what canon called great argument together have temple of wind said hall of olus olian hall ill call study olian hall capital im naming rather agnes be naming room give house so much more character strolled out into hall agnes thought of excellent name to put on baize door of passage to servant room continued suggested in fact invented word abigailia country of maid servant see abigaildom be first suggestion proposed abigailia on analogy of philistia whole idea though be hers come through dining room will go out without being seen from front if anybody call will truthfully say that be out passed accordingly through dining room where blind be down to keep out afternoon sun table cloth already laid for dinner glimmered whitely in dusk be not however so dark that hugh must not read over chimney piece in roman character sat down to eat drink while over door into garden be appropriate conclusion rose up to play have be in london last three month have not went on busy suppose at rate occupied agnes be very neat on subject other day said in town seem to make business of pleasure whereas here be sure make pleasure of business like true wit too contains profound truth true wit however did not inspire hugh with fresh thought on subject changed subject with abruptness oh yes one be always occupied in london said by way do know if mr allbutt be down here know dont be house have not be down since moved here dick alingtons face grew slightly reserved yes have taken friar grange said house by river have however called chalkpit tell be real name on old lease pity think rather of course must be last to decry spirit of antiquarian exactitude be possible to lose sense of romance in what be after mere pedantry oh think feel with said hugh retired grocer life in grange slight reserve have come over canon at mention of mr allbutt be not due to pedantry real reason appeared now be here anyhow last sunday said because asked agnes to dine with in evening thought very odd thing to do declined of course why asked hugh rather thoughtlessly then so flattered remembered oh see evening church said brother in law again stiffened slightly replied with most scrupulous honesty must have have time to go after church said have wished indeed agnes guessed that dinner be at unusually late hour of half past eight to enable to do so be against principle to dine out sunday canon alington who seldom moved about garden without spud in hand neatly extracted dandelion from short velvet of lawn relaxed little of course say that be morally wrong to dine out on sunday said because must be narrow view of trust must not be guilty be of course also quite possible that a mr allbutt have only be here so short time did not know view on subject for be aware that many of clergy agree with in idea of observance of sunday let pas hope mr allbutt will be acquisition to parish must be acquisition to parish said hugh be quite entirely charming during last fortnight have often met at lady rye canon alington warmed to ah there be admirable woman said have truly serious sense of responsibility wealth position give if mr allbutt be like be indeed fortunate certainly agnes be favourably impressed with agness impression be not often erroneous have be very handsome in way of subscription already be also very handsome in way of feature said hugh with touch of flippancy planting of lupin seed hugh have upset be to have be part of what canon alington called horticultural curriculum for evening since be longer possible gardening operation be deferred in toto till morrow two walked over to adjoining golf link to play short round before dinner a have often done before canon alington having spun coin to decide who must drive first asked hugh if must have caput aut caud hugh having won have bright thought of replying habeo honorem dick however demurred to a being improper use of latin word honor meant not honour public office agnes alington be older than hugh by several year have married young at age of eighteen when girl character so to speak be in state of ingot of red hot iron fresh taken from furnace easily glowingly to be fashioned into shape that blacksmith desire blacksmith in case being canon alington be not difficult to forecast that in very short space of time must be hammered into shape on author have stamped own very distinct efficient personality be so to speak hall marked with formation of wife mind task dick have definitely set earnestly carried out be very soon accomplished with result a might have be expected that agnes became extraordinarily

quality quite different from anything else what mind andrew call andrew now because feel know so well must be how ive intrigued to find out who be perhaps after be gray wise old scotchman like people in kail yard school who really have thought out truth of thing alone up in inverness somewhere dreadful yet dont know there be thing in must have be written by woman on other hand there be thing must have be written by man also andrew robb must be quite young couldnt have seen into girl heart like must be quite old couldnt tell what saw for one moment edith felt a if have be overhearing remark about herself be in honour bound to make presence known simply must not felt unable to stop hugh so irresistible be desire to hear talk to so candidly with such huge appreciation while listening drinking in decking a be in phrase praise sat time secret oh must have heard brother in law on subject last night continued upper lip grew longer longer like alice when ate mushroom a talked about hadnt seen play may tell have read review of hugh stopped with amusement breaking from eye corner of mouth impulse grew irresistible threw back head gave great crack of laughter know can say thing to said because will understand if didnt tell somebody about laugh over must get angry must be pity nearly got angry last night then promised to tell morning so instead treasured up occasionally drawing on though didnt need much of that infection of hughs merriment must not capture too for hughs description of upper lip be gloriously apt havent told what said yet remarked know havent oh wish laughing did not hurt so well down came upper lip kindly sketched outline of play to to so must see when trapping embellishment of scenery character be removed what spirit of really be may not believe used that phrase did trapping embellishment of character just think over to proceed be quite unnecessary in case must be harmful to see play because must read what be about must also read between line moral of play be that wife must fall in love with other men than husband husband must commit suicide in order to allow to gratify passion said in very word because have extraordinary memory when attend mr allbutt frowned ludicrous said never heard anything so unfair malicious he not that said hugh be only very very much in character see be clergyman whereas judge isnt judging time can get off bench commit if like crime for sentence other people parliament rise for m p everybody else have saturday afternoon out sunday off clergyman go on time do know think being one thing quite time tends to make people little narrow dont really mean that asked edith with immense gravity do indeed up to point hadnt be able to get word in edgeways here plunged told went several time week oh havent told what andrew robb have done for what except make spend good deal of time at theatre well he made determine to spend more said hugh cant guess ediths face flushed stood quite still opera do mean asked yes sight of theatre crammed night with silent eager people made feel what hadnt ever really felt when spoke to once about at cookham namely what big wonderful thing must be to impress on other people also in small way began to see what reuss meant by not being fair on for suppose andrew capable of writing that play have not done so how rightly indignant must have be so perhaps in own little way have to do trick wrote to reuss three day ago heard from morning so have to go to frankfort early in october study there winter unless can induce reuss to come to london wish to heaven have voice like crow shant have time for anything winter except singing singing never satisfying reuss what doe come to compared to fact that month month will have gone will have nothing nothing out of except slightly better pronunciation of german rather more finished way of leaving off loud on top note in order to sing to lot of people who be merely waiting till end of act in order to see who be in box opposite with diamond mr allbutt do really think be worth while shook head at what foolish question said a if wasnt worth while spending one life to do anything well most people cant be incapable of excellence mr hugh assure there be mass of people who adore excellence only cant attain of course there be heap of foolish flippant creature who a say only wonder who be wearing diamond what do matter dont mind because cab horse in street dont know what artist be hugh sighed pulled down upper lip with ludicrous resemblance to brother in law london be very wicked place said make business of pleasure whereas here in mannington make pleasure of business oh forgot be sister who said that let talk about something else must like andrew robb to know what difference have made to how just because of be going to make fool of myself at covent garden havent done yet remarked edith will told dick sister by way about rather disapproved dont think that be serious career dick urged very strongly to send in name a candidate for education department in addition to taking engagement education department there be quiet humour about dont think hour a pointed out be only from eleven till five so must have plenty of time to keep up singing also a justly observed must not be singing more than couple of night week that only while wagner opera be being given be going to have talk about evening strongly advises education department dissuades from opera doesnt see why shouldnt be worked together lord how jaw about apologise only be so dreadfully interested in minute wheres cat woodshed edith sat down firmly on garden bench woodshed will wait said cat will fly at just same in ten minute from now want to tell how delighted be with decision indeed be not wholly selfish on part though anticipate most enormous pleasure from hearing sing in opera for other reason also see be peggys sister think be very much alike in way want people to screw utmost ounce out of seemed to that have mass of ounce be not being screwed out sang to divinely sang that shepherd lullaby just a divinely to daisy how did know sang asked hugh quickly edith be honest be a essential characteristic of a be absence of self consciousness in hugh because listened said also spied through chink of nursery door left open also apologise dont didnt do harm im not ashamed once again intimacy like flash of summer lightning broke cloud have moved nearer yes listened to singing that bad child to sleep continued saw through chink of door thought very nice of liked for have sat down on edge of grass when took garden seat at that looked up at quickly met dark kind eye thank said at moment also knew that flash of summer lightning be there knew that there be attraction fire in atmosphere behaved a one who wished to get home out of range of element before storm came nearer alone in house with blind drawn down must be secure with security that have sought in coming down to peaceful meadow encompassed house where nearest loudest sound of life be drowsy drone of folk in mannington who be so unabsorbingly busy over provincial interest here must be busy over garden writing wanting more quite content with calm sunrise on wreck yet even at moment when said to herself that wished just to pull blind down sit by solitary fireside knew that wanted to pull up look nothing more into open night in case did not show desire to yes be what peggy felt said wanted to use time of course people like to see ask to dinner to saturday till monday be so pleasant there be amusing talk plan party next tuesday week do feel that anybody who can do something ought to do not make mere distraction froth of life into life most people cant do anything particular well hugh have looked up again clearly with word on tongue said of course must do something one feel that moment that one be with have just a much force a peggy told to call peggy by way dont hate people who allude to others by christian name when dont use to yes loathe about have force understand be force if have got to do something why not set example dont even kill slug do said because gardening isnt plan hang ive have plan now for twenty four hour be in first head of missionary enterprise blind be not quite drawn down yet once again have to peer into night be fair question said answer that dont yet know hope may never know how great task be to forget there be year of life need to be forgotten before must begin to live again have occupied very completely forgiveness think be included in to forget implies hugh stared moment why in gambit began remember be phrased like in play amherst said that death must mean forgetting therefore forgiving seemed to very true have not slightest intention of committing suicide got up a spoke hugh from ground be standing before have risen from seat be sorry said did not mean ah know that even if have meant why not for great point of forgetting be that allusion though did not allude can not hurt one besides paused moment then looked at with level kindly eye then checked what be in mind before came to tongue besides have to see woodshed added instead thereafter time till lunch be very fully occupied vixen of cat flew at hugh who in spite of warning have entered dangerous woodshed retreated with cry of dismay leaving globe of spitting scowling motherhood in possession of doorway then unhusbanded hen yard gave rise to philosophic reflection arising from fact that if man practises polygamy death if be loved be polygamously painful in case must result in widow disputation of property on other hand in case of hen be easy in fact be going to be done afternoon to substitute husband for lately deceased nobody must know difference then kitchen garden be visited from thence gardener even in very act of nailing up peach tree be sent to look for tortoise shell slug on second slice of potato counting from far end for other slug pot of brine mr allbutt told be in middle of gravel walk must not be missed then skirted bramble grown chalk pit passed through beech wood went out of gate in wooden fence to walk little way up steep down side from where must get comprehensive view of house garden wood myriad wild flower of downland be in bloom fragrance cistus hairbell thyme dwarf meadow sweet company of low growing clover from where paused must see over pale green beech wood through have just come to where red house with just thin coil of blue smoke going up from one chimney soon vanishing in gold suffused blue of noon stood sunning looking from under sun blind of window a if from half shut eye on to jewelled flower garden level sea of vivid green bordered chalk stream white riband of road dusty sun grilled that passed by fence be quite cut off from by belt of tree grew within stood embowered in bough green alone with enchanting company of quiet living thing stopped when have climbed hundred foot so of down there said that be favourite view of dear home for though have be here so few week have become wonderfully homey to come up here day really envy fortunate person who life there though be so cut off feel sure can not be lonely ought indeed to be very busy find day much too short if take least pleasure in care for tree flower hugh moved step nearer ah go on said like hearing about tell more about well have be very busy time have be here out of door most of day leaving quantity of letter unanswered in consequence sometimes friend come see find very pleasant also sometimes go up to town fly about a if be quite young still rather tire confuses find be glad to get back when autumn come will see tree flame in sunset of year will still be busy putting flower to bed for winter tucking up seeing that be comfortable indoors too have garden of book when winter come day be short dark with weeping sky overhead fretful angry rain flung against window pane will be busy with indoor garden again find day too short there will be fine day a well hope to walk over down will be gray flowerless in crystal winter sun often too will have thing to do in mannington for really be friendly person doubt will find friend there perhaps day out of year have passed out of what have learned be still learning mind will put out little flower of own often too in winter hope friend will still come see consent to bury for day two now then in country again paused smiled at hugh who be looking at with eager boyish gaze since with rest of world must soon know what have in mind did not matter whether knew little earlier than rest not besides impulse to tell somehow be irresistible in way since what have written have indirectly anyhow decided career have certain right to know for moment interrupted oh what heavenly story be telling cried little flower of own what do mean be writing something painting what yes fortunate woman who life down there be hoping to make little flower of ink have already made one such a be friend even other people a well like little ink flower though of course taste differ others say be disgraceful horrid weed have heard several people talk about nobody except peggy know that came from own garden though be going to know minute dear mr hugh musnt tell anybody till give leave because at present everybody think that came from garden of andrew robb yes be called gambit hugh stood quite silent then gave long sigh let eye wander over down over tree house that lay below still sky reflecting streak of kennet through water meadow then still quite grave looked at again a if half dazed by news that felt instinctively be big with import for then took hand kissed ah dear andrew robb said at last have found at last can thank then suddenly huge wave of exultation swept over though did not at moment know significance from what fathomless mighty sea came threw hat high in air caught again never heard of anything so splendid in life cried chapter vi president of literific who be wonderfully well equipped for office for habitually spent week in london year during positively lived in gallery concert room theatre have be to venice no le than four distinct time be dining informally taking pot luck a canon alington expressed at vicarage night must not feel that be fortunate circumstance that mr owen must thus be dropping in while hugh be there for distinctly liked hugh to know though lived in province be not provincial that pulse of artistic intellectual life beat a strongly if not more strongly at mannington than in town last of mr alingtons fortnightly dinner have taken place only week before so that be impossible to parade intellect of mannington in cohort a husband dressed for dinner thought that one informal guest must be likely to give hugh better notion of high mental activity of mannington than even one of larger more formal party must have done for mr owen brightest star in intellectual constellation really shone best alone agnes often told husband that never talked half so well to a did to mr owen be quite true though sentiment have touch of resentment regret about for agnes be perfectly aware that be quite natural that must be so for have so identified with taste pursuit industry of husband life that thing a discussion except on such point a floral decoration outdoor relief must hardly exist between mr owen always have fresh topic of literary artistic interest a indeed person who be quite in set in london went to venice so frequently must not fail to have necessarily must talk about tintoret to canon alington strike out fresh light from in way that agnes be incapable of doing though in matter of actual familiarity with venice husband wife be exactly on par since neither have ever be there have so fine retentive memory that must from photograph knowledge only quite hold own in discussion indeed sometimes corrected a to locality of titian tintoret what be referred to by mr owen a being in s giorgio be sometimes allocated by canon to true position in scuola di san rocco accademia position baedeker when consulted confirmed in fact very fruitful discussion on subject of sixteenth century art sometimes rather narrowed down to point a to where particular picture be rather than what be merit when be there in matter of date canon alington readily recognised immense superiority of guest knowledge particularly in musical matter knew quite unerringly when wagner be born when schubert died how old mozart be when wrote jupiter symphony in what year faust be first presented be knowledge confined to bone so to speak of music have composed composition have be published sung so that on first page of daily telegraph one be liable to see that galahad good night word music to gladys owen must be sung at drill hall hastings on th song be mostly written in what be known a waltz time when taken andante be meltingly pathetic especially when there be change to minor in second middle part be with exception of galahad good night be markedly religious throughout based rather on one general plan people met long ago in first verse in orchard meadow in bower generally rhymed with flower be very loving light hearted tribulation sorrow in minor key overtook in second verse be slower in four time while in third to accompaniment of grave octave from left hand arpeggio from right resumption of slow waltz time tremulous hope be expressed that must meet again above be equally suitable for male female voice with exception again of galahad good night for sentiment expressed be perfectly creditable to of sex there be always alternative high note on word heaven above love at end of third verse where tenor must crack roof burst if felt inclined then arpeggio ceased two three loud thump over piano denoted accomplishment of desire mr owen be tall rather thin not exactly pretty a everybody said have very sweet expression have pale blue eye even when be talking on most grave serious subject mouth be generally smiling doubt be largely responsible for sweet expression when laughed often did quite closed eye sometimes clapped hand softly at have amused always dressed in pale soft colour cut in somewhat greek classical style wore a ornament necklace of greek silver coin couple of bracelet composed of same hair too be braided something in greek manner flower two that wore in be secured by venetian ducat of dogeship of one of mocenigos throughout dinner conversation have ranged over infinite variety of topic deep calling unto deep now toward end after royal academy new gallery opera for have only just returned from whole month in drama be being discussed yes adore theatre be saying london really have be whirl did not go a often a must have wished went to see gambit have seen gambit mr grainger oh yes have be more than once said mr owen leaned forward now wonder if agree about thought be beautiful so pathetic so teaching if may borrow one of word canon alington showed did not how from misery be born misery how wretchedness be result of mistake looked from hugh to canon whose upper lip have begun to lengthen little oh be sure be going to scold for being wee bit bohemian said well hugh agrees with said must have to scold mr owen looked down at plate moment have seen asked have read review of that a told hugh be enough mr owen hesitated now im going to be very brave said be going to ask to see there be something in be there not mr grainger somehow redeems painful character of plot be not wrong doing that one condones think be dreadful punishment that one pity surely one may pity everyone who be being punished however justly then canon alington made enormous concession wish to condemn play unheard said when be in town next will go to see dont think anybody must have persuaded to see hold very strong view on question of what be fit subject for art to treat of believe that object of art be to raise aspiration to make braver better than be pity allow be christian virtue confess have not thought of play in light from what read drew very different conclusion indeed inspired with subject be going to talk about on tuesday at literific mr owen clapped hand not having heard what be known in mannington a canon last portmanteau word literific cried how delightful what sweet portmanteau be paper written what be title be fair to ask agnes sent out card afternoon did not dear so be no longer secret call true test of literary artistic immortality mr owen face beamed at thought now said be going to be very brave again might dear canon alington hear little of just little if must not tire after dinner must be such treat ambrose a have be mentioned though did not dine sat with parent during dinner reading drawing simple object on table joining in conversation a rule went to bed at dessert time having be given two three strawberry be not reckoned among ration when mr owen dined be allowed to sit up hear sing one song here turned to father oh papa said may for great treat sit up little later to night hear read will have heard mr owen sing have heard read will make so happy wouldnt understand son said canon alington be interpreted by mr owen to mean that must read to clapped hand again how pay to be brave said oh thank dear canon alington ambrose never interrupted waited looking at father through spectacle till have finished must try papa said im sure must understand of because about book picture music being meant to make better understand when uncle hugh sings mr owen sings always feel that want to be good so do understand of will make happy asked father yes well a heard of little boy to day who gave away strawberry to make poor old woman happy will sit up till half past nine hugh have given slight groan at ambrose allusion to moral effect of singing even if heard be at once forgotten in boy cry of joy who ran galloping round table with very high action of small knickerbockered leg to kiss father while agnes having told mr owen in good firm french so that ambrose must not understand story of little boy who gave old woman strawberry rose to go mustnt sit long over cigarette dick said will never get through with be going to do wont be long said there heavy programme in front of eh mr owen im sure part of wont be heavy said dick passed port to hugh when lady have left room with ambrose prancing on ahead very charming cultivated woman said know venice a know parish must be far from asserting off hand that there be not something to be said of view of gambit be idea hadnt occurred to found valuable ally there eh hugh hugh poured out glass of port lit cigarette then drank off port merely with air of thirsty man tasting thinking about that sort of thing always rather annoyed canon who paid high price for sound wine though did not take oh dont know that one want ally if one be quite convinced of thing said in matter of conviction be perfectly content to stand alone if nobody agrees with hugh always spoke very quickly in speed of brother in law thought detected note of impatience rather imply that must sooner mr owen didnt agree with said yes think do im sure view of play be founded on reason be faculty perfectly incapable of judging work of art indeed what do judge by then why by impulse by instinct dont want to reason about beautiful thing find out why be beautiful want just to enjoy to lose in beauty rather dangerous view surely why dangerous asked hugh upper lip again lengthened because rather implies that exempt beauty from other standard such a of moral enlightenment of course be sure cant mean that will go hugh got up do mean that asked im not sure that dont dear fellow of course cant must like to discus with have received marching order have not indeed point be rather fully discussed in paper mr owen insists on reading mr owen always brought music with when went out to dine because be always quite certain that must be asked to sing always consented saying that did happen to have brought song two be in hall with cloak always said hall especially if happened to be very narrow passage with barometer on one side rack on other rich smell of cooking coming from kitchen stair at end for be incapable of sarcasm thus if hall happened to be artery of description merely made host think that entry be larger than have supposed canon alington however in commodious vicarage have hall almost immediately after joining lady in drawing room with ambrose again prancing in front of went to fetch music in ambrose asked to be allowed to carry boon be granted mr owen always played own accompaniment ambrose who be full of treat to night turned over for being already able to follow music if did not go too fast mr owen song did not at end of particular combination of orchard tribulation heaven above be terribly torn in half for on one hand mr owen be perfectly willing to sing again on other bedtime be inexorably fixed for half past nine so that longer mr owen sang le must hear of father paper for literific so with simplicity of childhood settled that mamma must choose mamma a must hardly fail to do chose song first there be time for hugh to sing after if test of immortality in literature art be to be really inquired into indeed have with adroitness protested that must be too hard to make sing after mr owen feeling quite sure that sarcastic intention must possibly be imputed to since sister dick considered that mr owen sang with more expression than anyone have ever heard professional amateur thus there be full half hour of reading for ambrose before half past nine sounded full half hour of reading for rest of afterwards for author suggestion that must leave out abridge work be strongly deprecated by mr owen if be quite sure did not hurt throat felt perfectly certain did not hugh went up to bed that night rather early though a matter of fact felt particularly wakeful for wanted somewhere deep down inside to get away alone to lie on bed think better still plan put into operation to get behind curtain of window lean out into night wanted to be alone to be in presence of very simple thing of world night large silent sky thing grew unconsciously did not improve anyone else added rather viciously to did not sing have passed evening with perfectly sincere unaffected people with exception of ambrose for with best will in world must not believe that ambrose really liked giving strawberry to old woman even if did child have right to be unselfish kind at age ought to be smacked for yet in spite of sincerity felt that whole evening have be unreal be sure that mr owen be genuine in musical taste be not real music that liked false sentiment be sure that brother in law be desperately in earnest on true test of immortality in art what really liked be writing about be certain that agnes be genuinely interested in parish work true test of immortality music topic of evening not of own self only because be of interest to husband sincerity felt be second hand none of cared for thing quite simply passionately with mere love of life for thing of life there have be too whole lump of knowledge flying about evening in direction have kept up perfect fusillade of fact what of wisdom where must wisdom be found have once compared brother in law mind to rich sort of cake consists entirely of other thing came upon almond one moment raisin next piece of spice sometimes large hard stone be except stone proper ingredient for making cake somehow there wasnt cake be ingredient there be golf gardening literary ability fragment of rock from nazareth motto knowledge of gallery of venice where be man personality deep time be aware that agnes dick felt that wanted deepening very likely mr owen ambrose thought so too felt injured inflamed at thought so that be moved to say out loud thank god dont want of deepening not at price a likely a not dick sister be talking over evening now feeling dear good soul amusement have be combined with instruction that sun of culture have shone on scene without intermission hugh felt rather better when have announced to night that did not wish to be subjected to process of deepening leaned further out into soft darkness moon be not yet risen behind gray square norman tower of church rose on right sky be dove coloured star burned with half quenched light showing that moon rise must not be long delayed just below window

drenched lawn beyond lay water meadow of kennet with wisp streamer of white mist lying here there like gauzy raiment of fairy hung out to dry while down centre wandered steel coloured stream again

dawn be coming swiftly surely have be for moment night have be heavy on wing of morning came joy canon alington a wife often told have great deal of tact how prodigious be amount with nature have endowed may be gathered from fact that never asked of guest who might happen to be staying at st olafs over sunday whether be going to church be such be liberal doctrine primarily host a such be bound to give religious a well a other liberty consequently when hugh at about ten minute to eleven came through hall where ambrose be prancing about in slightly subdued sabbatical manner with hymn book prayer book bible in hand threepenny bit in pocket met canon alington just coming out of study on way to church hughs appearance in gray flannel straw hat roused comment of disapprobation indeed canon alington said will be cool in garden ambrose tact be not equal to father looked up at hugh with light shining on spectacle arent coming to church uncle hugh asked not morning arent well uncle hugh im so sorry will stop behind a mamma doe when im not well read psalm lesson to will go to church tell about sermon afterward yes thanks awfully old boy said hugh think must be best plan now run after father else will be late canon alington have purposely walked on at beginning of colloquy into head there came word little child will lead be trifle disconcerted when found that little child be not leading anybody until ambrose explained plan about sermon there be for hugh coolness of garden not at rate of garden only waited for low thunder of organ to come booming out from open church door to set out at pace most unsuited to hot morning along road up have gone at much about same time yesterday doubt questioning of evening before be gone if not gone be invisible in flame consumed be perhaps stick fuel contributed to brightness of burning have to declare to love be part nothing else be part have spare emotion with to feel nervous afraid felt be seemed to be caught up into burning into

must shine before be sung to not burst into being though with incomparable splendour minute after wolfran have quite finished addressing italian opera of course must still look after since few song here there by melba caruso be utmost anybody in sens must possibly require german opera suddenly felt might perhaps gain little if everybody orchestra principal chorus alike studied little more tried to get kind of uniformity in consequence of laudable ideal have be necessary for hugh to go up to town constantly during last month two to be put through scene mere acting of with elsa isolde elisabeth under reusss direction often too have reuss be down here many have be evening when in big hall with chalked line for position of couch row of noble front of stage hugh with edith a mute

appreciation for believed le than edith that real wagner hero have come at last whom musical world have be waiting for so long who while yet young must have developed perfection maturity of voice be for very reason that be so hard on hugh so unremitting exacting in demand for there be so much to be got out of edith used always to be present at lesson ready to be heroine if action be needed of late since have got to know scene by heart instead of herr reuss shouting out cue from piano if more than usually carried away singing in high ridiculous falsetto have gone through whole act with husband speaking word for instance of love duet in tristan slowly rhythmically to music so that scene must go through exactly a must be played be then that reuss most felt what hugh be capable of acting no singing if worth anything be spontaneous gesture note word position have to be carefully learned when be done be great singer who must light with passion without blurring anything that have learned then must watch two a have watched last time have be down here couple of day ago still eager to criticise still on alert for fault of sort finding nothing at end have said bravo bravo wiped spectacle then got up held out hand to edith be who made sing cried not ach if only be isolde how must drive that fat london off head that fat london however have to be driven off head without ediths direct assistance though morning did indirectly what must by inducing hugh to go practise when have finished breakfast refusing to allow to sit with in room talk even though have declared to be shameful that last day in country must be so wet be extremely well content to think of privacy streaming gale must give canon alington be true have proposed to drop in to lunch since must be on way back from district visiting to cottage on confines of parish during morning that most conscientious of men felt certain must postpone even duty to slightly more propitious morning there be compact between hugh that when be doing lesson also must do lesson so that must not feel that everybody else meant be leading life of leisured ease while sang over over again faulty phrase arrived by endless repetition at smooth enunciation of half dozen note reuss have underlined morning with sense of heroic effort almost paralysing distaste saw that nature of lesson be clearly indicated for by very large pile of shiny american cloth volume be stacked on writing table be clearly what be known a most unattractive library book remembered also with fatal unerring distinctness be afraid that have be stacked there just month ago on morning of glorious sunny march weather daffodil weather a hugh called that have in moment of mortal weakness decreed that must run on just because on morning when

nonsense once again rain be flung against window time seemed to edith to sound different note just a one night last summer tapping of blind have be to imagination at one moment beckoning of lover at next warning of year be change like happened now be more nearly age than mine said once twice during month since marriage thought from sprang have stirred in ediths mind shown face to appearance be always momentary slept sound for most part yet just now then a at present hour peeped out at quick a lizard out of crevice in flowering wall in again up till now whenever shadow of found substance in speech hugh have hailed appearance with derision even a bird of day mock at absurd owl be so out of place in sunlight now did not quite do that did not instinctively mock at bird of night be so ridiculous so out of keeping with day sun yes be true though only just true said a measure of year go never thought of before how ridiculous sound just prof what always thought that year have nothing to do with essential age have hugh probably did not know that have taken more seriously than ever before edith knew now for first time instead of laughing at have troubled to give explanation to show perhaps a well that be wrong instead of treating merely to shout of derision question though disposed of have appeared to debatable thing worthy of pro con at for one half second in spite of wonderful happiness have be hers month in spite of completeness content felt a if somewhere deep inside there have come touch of pain be new pain be nothing in unless be warning if be not that be nothing then simultaneously almost joy of love life told must be nothing there be arrow bolt must touch in dwelling place where hugh love dwelt by very nature knew must be place impregnable if have wanted further assurance of that be ready for ah when will become ever so little fit for asked again leaning head back so that must see face sometimes seem to see standing radiant on far side of stream through have to swim to laid hand on head ah hugh hugh began be use protesting interrupted again here be alone with gale cutting off from everybody else since choose to talk about difference of age will talk about difference of age really matter there stand tell mind soul mein besseres ich struggle toward helping oh so long to reach isnt age separate then be timeless growth be wisdom fineness see shining above who have taught to be able to sing reuss do think not at isolde reuss know difference too told that have done be nailing up of fruit tree to wall be not who made flower bear fruit be sun work make soul sing whether sings in voice sings a sit here with when add up stable book dig in garden be one be always singing to edith seemed that love joy of year be gathered into word flamed there rose coloured be thrilled shaken dazzled with seemed that body must not bear for trembled covered eye with hand ah stop stop said be content leave like sat there for moment in silence then uncovered face again be round hugh said quietly be so safe again paused moment safety of have spoken again seemed so impregnable that must speak without fear of from time to time frightened that peggy have warned of blind one night have tapped to just now sounded against window in tattoo of maddened rain have lain like little coiled snake among flower man who loved like must trust to pull back flower show a must that there be snake there only phantom of hers peggys imagining for love be in word have spoken be surely infinitely stronger than fear yet have doubted wondered said have looked forward ten year twenty seen so old so young then doubted said hugh quickly be not that be doubted though have doubted le le now at moment dont doubt at will be arranged differently somehow something have long be fluid in hughs mind suddenly crystallised be peggy who suggested that to asked suggestion came from one night night after told who andrew be peggy confirmed asked hugh didnt want to marry believe have always felt that wondered whether be right not be sure be right have sat upright again wheeling half round on hearthrug so that faced with hand clasped round knee speaking in quick peremptory voice edith felt sudden very keen regret that have be spoken of for still recalled that struggle one sided foregone of conclusion though be when peggy have urged by argument in power not to marry hugh though sister love existed between be on own level so strong on level so true have put breach between out of question did not like being reminded of thought hugh also knew guessed what peggys attitude have be be also matter for regret made one effort to stop ah what doe matter if heart sings said hugh shook head of course doe not matter said want to know did not peggy do a say yes advised not to marry said hugh frowned thought so oh knew so said why for reason doubted dear because year must leave so old so young then sister love so true genuine pulled strong hugh cant bear that must harbour lay up against peggy said wanted happiness of of so much of be absolutely convinced thought must not find permanently together hugh gave little impatient click of tongue im glad told that didnt want remarked perhaps will faintly begin to understand that be tolerably happy yes hope so now tell wont let make difference to in feeling for hugh shook head cant promise said if person behaves differently from what expected becomes to extent different person peggy be different from what thought oh have be just until knew have honestly tried not to behave a if guess have be true now that know be true isnt quite same peggy ah be entirely desire for happiness that made try to dissuade said edith in distress must give credit for best of have out with will convince not that be right dont be so silly that be doing best must be can be asked of anybody hughs face cleared little yes if opportunity come said what nonsense be to try to look forward ten year how can one know what ten year will bring since one cant know that what be value of picture be purely imaginary probably untrue hugh looked up at wife then scrambled round again took up old place at knee besides please god there will be child will there not said calling mother father why will be nearly nine year old then did peggy put into picture if be to look forward ten year be silly in case let people picture with figure hope to find there edith leaned over peggy couldnt have known that year ago said exactly so shouldnt have talked like people have business to draw doleful picture scatter doleful image of thought about in world to imagine thing be to help to come true then again a looked up at face bent over love light leaped to eye besides what more doe think must be desired than what have said have not love crowned if dont take crown off ah dont hughie whispered for one last moment felt impulse to look again at peggys picture in word cold carefully chosen word to draw for to say to peggy have said that own thought have suggested to show snake among flower impulse passed perhaps a hugh have said be better not to scatter doleful image yet something of inevitable lacrim rerum something of sadness inseparable from human consciousness even when joy of life be most vivid be in next word clothed though be in golden raiment of love something still faintly twitched that mantle dont talk of discrowning even in jest said be doleful image though luckily impossible one year do pas hugh there be denying one come to end of chapter rose scented manuscript have to close be that peggy meant in nature of thing must close sooner for than for oh yes chapter come to end what pleasant one will finish to morrow winter spring here must like to tell just once have be to to have so much alone by to know that havent well be bored havent have liked enormously know have be happier in six month than ever before in happy life be crown stroked hair back from forehead oh give many of hughie said be greedy of love though chapter be over next be going to be even better if can compare thing be perfect oh how proud be going to be of voice acting cant help dont want to be part of yes know have helped share in so let read dear chapter just a come re reading what be past if like not sadly not thinking will not come again let not look forward too much let take thing a come to there what long speech if andrew robb have written that mr jervis must certainly have insisted on cutting of be not mr jervis said hugh paused moment must not spare of said more than must spare of yes darling agree let read on together not a suggested peep forward at end for who know day wind rain lasted though during night fury of blowing abated yet be gray streaming morning when left next day for town tree battered by wind of day before stood motionless in leaden stillness smoke from chimney ascended straight be soon lost in thick rain streaked air a carriage drove to gate passed over wreckage on branch bestrewn gravel edith a leaned out to catch last glimpse of house felt again irrevocable sense of beautiful day gone last of thought be most beautiful of hardest to part with yet be stored garnered within a imperishable a own spirit hidden germinating in inner life of chapter ix be nearly year since peggy sister have dined with early punctuality one night set off with hugh following in hansom to be in time for rise of momentous curtain once again at much same hour though hugh instead of following have long ago preceded be hurrying eastward in peggys electric broughham one possession may be remembered that desired other people to consider to be hers inside brougham too there be much similarity between moral atmosphere of two occasion for once again peggy be excited voluble edith with far more cause for mental unrest be outwardly a calm undisturbed a ever soon also even a have happened ten eleven month ago got into queue of interminable length to day however extended not to door of piccadilly theatre to large portal farther east in bow street yes education bill said peggy who be clearly talking for other reason except that edge of anxiety excitement be felt le in conversation than in silence how interesting instructive be to observe government standing in row industriously digging own graf so unnecessary a if opposition be not quite willing even desirous wishful a canon alington must say to do for why do clergyman say wishful oftentimes be merely in order to make lay brother chatter with rage oh dear saw poster with lohengrin quite large on edith dont think can bear dont really edith laughed dont think can either said for different reason cant bear because be too divine to be true why peggy before hour be over swan will have come down scheldt lohengrin will have stepped from said good bye to well will be hugh arent anxious even asked peggy how can help being that ah dont see how must be why hugh be anxious enough about own play confess at least got past anxiety merely despaired can be more anxious about hughs singing than must about sun rising in morning be one of perfectly certain thing paused moment even if werent even if impossible happened sang badly broke down do know peggy in very particular secret heart shouldnt be sorry see must have to comfort make happy again sometimes almost want hugh to be unhappy so must do for think must make happy again happened have given so much have given life have made see what life can be if person who be utterly content a be can long for anything be for have given there be in world think laughed remember telling not to be selfish said asked to spare hugh oh peggy what glorious mistake clever woman like can make peggy beamed delightedly passion for seeing other people happy be being hugely satisfied at moment just loved that telegram sent to say wasnt wanted said if there be one thing nicer than being immensely wanted be not to be wanted at for reason like do see yet how magnificently be mistaken last year asked edith for if do wish must tell hugh so know by way that tried to dissuade from marrying peggys radiance went behind cloud ah dont think must have told that said be sorry for too said edith there be way out peggy let down window looked out for moment still frowning so that be said knew something have come between hugh tell see be wrong then said edith again peggy did not answer silence be not in need of interpretation that did not think be wrong since be clearly meaning of failed now to reach edith must not at moment cloud sun even if be right said softly must willingly pay may be demanded for have received warned of long gray year what do matter to woman who have once have sunrise in heart peggy drew long breath felt in fibre of herself that edith did not look forward did not allow for limitation rule under life go on at moment felt must be like telling happy child that year brought heaviness of limb anxiety of heart bidding therefore cease from game prepare for adult life for ediths happiness seemed to have in mysterious way of human soul taken back to childhood again with unreflecting sensitive joy few month have wiped off misery bitterness of past perhaps spring be to follow summer a autumn have preceded sat up with quick imperative movement characteristic of dont let talk of said let say be sufficient that be happy now that hugh be be stupid to think unless one feel one have to think be anyhow divine gift to receive without question child can do can do too longed only dear a know for happiness have have of great shining piece of already why not many more shining piece have have le than by way what nonsense talked about giving nothing in return have given not only have made anyone can see that then took ediths hand one word more said in few month will give child oh dear when see husband looking at child why why hear morning star singing together there be more of intimate talk after indeed moment after turned out of long acre into bow street immediate excitement of evening again took possession of peggy oh be here half groaned matter so much to so little to people in street look at footman impassive back on box in minute will open door with set wooden face will say side entrance at twelve will touch hat go away oh edith what will have happened by twelve by way in case forget a probably will come down to cookham dont to morrow though be in such good time house be already half full be filling now with great rapidity so that alley gangway be choked by crowd evidently wanted to get into place for overture early a be in season be certainly going to be crowded house for box be already fuller than stall sure criterion that must be crammed before night be many minute older indescribable glitter be there subdued radiance of shimmer of silk harder more brilliant gleam of thousand of jewel round row of box made moving changing point of coloured light a if swarm of gem like firefly have settled all over house a peggy saw that while stood for moment two in front of box looking being looked at felt despite ediths triumphant confidence sudden sinking of heart world ediths hughs be here peer have come to judge must soon step on to vast stage have to please for have paid to be pleased struck suddenly that artist life be awful one whether sang to tiara wearer star garter whether in music hall did card trick be one have guaranteed to please if did not be swindler fraud while for only guinea be at stake for career be at stake true be question of bread butter for a might be for peckham conjurer whose failure to please might be step along road of starvation very fact that stake be not there made other success failure a artist appear more stupendous for moment wished with heart that have not be persuaded to appear be even at moment slight consolation to to know how completely personally have failed to influence edith be responsible edith be radiant two be alone in box in middle of grand tier peggy drew chair to front in order to occupy for dreadful minute took glass searched for friend acquaintance sometimes sight of so many familiar face gave pleasure at moment seemed to quite dreadful that everybody must have come like must sooner have be wet night that there be great counter attraction groaned dear have never seen so many people whom knew together before said have come to see hugh see hundred who never by chance come to opera at oh there be canon alington in stall with wife have got copy of lohengrin word music will probably follow instead of looking how precisely like wish must tell hugh that must cheer doesnt cheer edith dont want cheering forgot think be scarcely human of oh light be going out canon alington wont be able to read after house hushed darkened till sight sound be quenched only huge red curtain be visible then after dead silence faintest whisper of string began dreaming a be of must come like beautiful consciousness asleep dream grew more vivid though still dealing only with swan who must come on swan grew louder more distinct descending from remote altitude of sound to level of life then with full band with shouting of brazen throat ear filling vibration of hundred throbbing string poured out tidings of glorious knight beautiful consciousness have dreamed awoke to see dream come true music filled theatre like sunlight then hushed again repeating to that have dreamed of fulfilment be now coming a curtain rose tale of slander lying baseless be said elsa called on champion of whom too have dreamed once called there be answer to cry died into stillness again called still salvation be withheld when called third time sudden stir of excitement began to move in crowd have waited sorry incredulous most dramatic moment in dramatic art grew imminent one man pointed following finger whispered swan head after head turned wondering eye up winding scheldt spoke of knight who stood between folded wing buzz of excited multitude grew higher higher rising on wing of melody blown onward a be by rushing current of string wind of sonorous trumpet far away be seen on winding river then nearer then close at hand wonder died into silence for miracle be beyond speech hugh be there slowly with very even motion swan came to near shore of river on stood one in gleam of silver armour pale cloak of blue young slim tall stainless knight son of parsifal till moment edith have watched have felt in nerve of being growing excitement of crowded stage hurrying suspense amazement of music thought of elsa of lohengrin of play with perfection of great dramatic climax have occupied not to exclusion for must not be to subordination of that otherwise meant to for one moment a lohengrin stepped ashore be lohengrin no longer hugh lover beloved wifehood motherhood so stirred within that must look more dropped head on hand for wonder of be hers peggy with quick impulsive sympathy just laid hand on knee for second then edith looked up again just smiled at sister turned eye to stage there be dead silence a whisper of muted violin grew mute crowd in house be not le tense motionless than crowd on stage hugh raised arm holding out in gesture of farewell to swan standing sideways so that face be in profile on head be silver helmet with golden wing from beneath for once there drooped long yellow effeminate lock curled on to knight shoulder own dark close cropped hair short on neck crisp on forehead body leg arm be clad in close fitting silver mail from shoulder hung cloak of pale blue never before have lohengrin appeared thus youth not rouge painted age be be heavy chested pendulous body short legged middle aged stood there be simply young man rather tall long of thigh slender of calf rather brown handed with face of morning who raised arm in natural gracious gesture a if alone with feathered steed smooth too be chin with overlaying of paint with firm flesh of boyhood be with youth that eye be so bright with brisk beating blood that lip be red then sang seemed a if song be natural to even a speech be to others voice came quite soft sure straight a if silver spear have shot from between lip to corner of house nun sie bedankt mein lieber schwan london fat london just moved in stall box hushed again for be a if fairy tale have come true be surely real lohengrin who spoke in song must be lohengrin still in profile followed swan with eye a glided away at bidding then turned full face to house for one moment looked straight across to where edith sat hugh have promised to look once at if be all right a have said appeared to be right be not only grief of brain can be so full that can send to memory cell clear account of what feel knowing only that be stunned by violence of emotion rendered unable to do work joy can have same effect thus rest of evening passed for edith vaguely in point of detail few day ago only on last morning of gale at mannington have thought that life must hold of happiness be gathered together a if under ray collecting lens into one point of light now new light have be added further completion be piled on be already complete through act followed mind moved a if in dream at one time seemed to that world of men woman world even of angel spirit be round looking at absorbed in incarnation of spirit of music romance while sat very small quiet among one only among infinite multitude having nothing more to do with silver mailed knight than other of listener then again aspect changed altogether felt a if be quite alone in house that a in magic mirror saw real scene of human history passing in actuality before eye then again be best of mist cleared knew lohengrin that supreme artist nightingale throated to be hugh hugh be hers world be stranger in comparison in moment even peggy be acquaintance moonlit figure compared to one sunlit be only play after reality must begin again when waiting at side entrance in carriage for to come must see step across pavement call right to coachman before got in sit down by in interval however be pleasant that hugh be such success though felt surprise at fat london be clapping glove to riband at end of act stood up again again to welcome own darling boy be enjoying so enormously must see how a be recalled again again be set respectful smile be be smile of pure enjoyment often almost broadened into laugh a bowed way that between act people came in shoal to box talking at once in sort of whirl of enthusiastic congratulation too be dim felt a if scarcely knew who be there be little for to say be very kind friendly not one of understood in slightest degree how utterly vague be to how little mattered just now even to eager kindly soul what anybody thought said must only think of moment when hugh must step into carriage must be alone with driving through gleaming crowded street too must be so unreal remote once only did ordinary normal perception usurp usual place be when elderly banker who be famed for wealth musical party asked if husband must possibly be induced to sing at forthcoming concert at melba price must not help laughing at checked said must ask then at last at last be over be still quite unreal except just for moment when a peggy left in box where meant to sit for few minute till staircase gangway be emptier said hugh driving home together oh edith be real peggy understood so waited alone while theatre slowly emptied alone reality began to reassert lo wonderful dream of evening be true have seen heard ideal lohengrin in flesh blood voice acting lohengrin be whose wife be mother of whose child must be be not dream have to remind herself of that be true happening now here to people crowded round door exit must be witness too have seen heard be world side there be wonder hugh who have driven fat london off head to night be aspect turned to public to everybody who cared to pay come see that hugh loved what of other who loved be secret hugh crowd slowly melted away from round door of exit before many minute went downstairs have told carriage to wait at end of rank of going to side entrance so quickly in last minute two have rank gone off that be close to door when came out so walked yard two got in having arranged with hugh that must come out at entrance from time to time moved step two nearer door a carriage in front of drove off be not long before be drawn up opposite door waiting for moment when must appear step in meantime dreamlike sense of evening be passing rapidly away be film of mist that separated from reality already lohengrin be hugh to be left of dreamlike be ignorance be in about other actor did not really know what ortrud be like telramund still le did know elsa for a saw now have be elsa throughout be to that hugh whether a lohengrin in few moment of reality a have played have be in thought who have gone through play with a so often have done at mannington knew of elsa be that have not be conspicuously bad otherwise there must have be interruption in flow of own artistic delight there have be none there be never performance so smooth a exterior sense now recognised a have just witnessed then there came what have be waiting for boyish staccato voice said good night to man at door there be two quick step across pavement door of carriage be opened hugh said right to coachman sat down beside then carriage moved quick arm be thrown round shoulder kissed well said sat upright almost pushing from searched for found hand kissed hand know when be andrew robb said oh hugh dont be ridiculous give hand ah what nonsense said quickly not nonsense see be dear hand that dear hand oh not yours hugh lohengrins homage lohengrin then held big hand in hers be for lohengrin said cant cant say what have be to when kiss hand a lohengrin dear know time that be then leaned forward kissed face hughie hughie said again paused have more word than said gently have year to say in so let be sensible tell about hugh from beginning want to know how felt whole time what thought about while be waiting what thought about when swan came with what oh everything hugh leaned back there be very little to tell said when be dressing thought how frightfully cold silver mail be when have dressed dont think thought about anything be quite blank till call boy somebody tapped at door of dressing room then thought desperately thought what idiot have be ever to listen to argument thought how completely happy must be if be just going down to dinner at mannington with instead of being here then when went out saw swan waiting looked upon a man might look on cart be going to take to tyburn to be hanged with everybody looking on be going to happen be a incredible a death ediths hand still held felt that be trembling oh hugh guessed said wanted to come to so must not yes what then then quite suddenly caught sight of in huge looking glass thought have never seen such beautiful clothes in life wondered who be then remembered be be going to sing lohengrin to on real proper stage with band to play fast slow just exactly a wished real live conductor to follow lip tell band how felt why be biggest fun in world anything so heavenly have never happened except perhaps when told be andrew robb there be in beautiful clothes beautiful new swan ready a set off from wing just quivered over with pleasure said here go here go be real edith leaned back in carriage laughed for pleasure oh hughie how like said be so satisfactory be always never by chance anybody else go on darling beautiful sublime thought be gone be such fun well so out came into very middle of stage stopped without jerk at everybody be waiting for to begin a soon a said nun oh edith knew be absolutely in middle of note not anywhere else not on side of not slipping about on edge of knew too when have sung three note that have gone up into gallery to of stall into box that there wasnt slightest suspicion of tremolo not even aspen leaf quiver at when knew that somehow sense of fun here go ceased be hugely splendidly serious instead anyhow felt right so looked up at a said must do remember did see yes seemed to remember have said something of sort said oh well thought might have forgotten dont think did took up hand again yes fun ceased a sometimes suddenly when be playing fool together fun cease because big thing be to other pop out be same then fun of having band to play for london to listen ceased because suppose music popped out there be elsa looking at by jove wasnt perfectly splendid have be given treasure golden story with golden song to make real to make to live not only be going to take hundred of year back to pull up year have gone from deep cool well of past be going to show how wagner pulled up set in jewel hughs voice have risen in sudden excitement turned quickly now to wife be not miracle cried for again again be not elsa whom sang to be in love duel be like something ghostly if have not be so absorbed so intent on must have be frightened must have sworn that there be frau dimlich there be did know felt a if must have known be on stage with oh hugh how heart knew said hugh be silent for moment then gave great sigh immediately after great crack of laughter oh isnt fun cried here go andrew robb everybody have to have dinner early in order to see andrew robbs play to be in time to hear hugh robb sing here go together trotting along in beautiful carriage through fat london edith winced started natural to hugh a be sudden change thoroughly characteristic of felt jarred have be so far away at moment from thought of herself street of london standing with hugh in innermost temple sacred place of two soul that must not help that sudden revulsion of feeling came to lip in sharply taken breath have seemed to so wonderful that too a well a must have looked on elsa a herself very next moment have swum up out of deep be splashing again on surface of thing have be conscious too that be startled out of tune with boisterous mood turned to again why what be asked what be matter be not quite even yet oh hugh pulled away said be so deep down be so deep down saw face of innocent surprise in light of passing gas lamp heart went out to in exuberance of boyish spirit just a fully a before be hugh told expression of glorious youth loved so be quite ridiculous said dont know be matter with what splendid evening have be what fun be too just that here go robbs a say trotting along in beautiful carriage be hugh who be grave now there be something more said what about pulling away oh edith be instance be sure of what said to other day stand there shining above what be there in mind that didnt understand tell explain to there be nothing to explain said laughing be only that went off above head dear rocket before expected while lingered down below still thinking how wonderful be that felt have be elsa be only that didnt expect coloured star here be at home by way hugh sang quite nicely to night forgot to tell think that unless get very pleasant invitation for next wednesday will come hear sing tristan yet dont know doe begin so dreadfully early hate dining early wouldnt think of coming if be remarked hugh of course have not dined before opera flew ravenously to supper ediths remark have reassured be not quite sure that have reassured felt that something be just little wrong else must not have be so startled at transition into boyish spirit be after just a characteristic of a be perception with regard to elsa be that intense vividness of feeling sudden change of mood meant hugh to performance that night have be on top level le be top level made shout fun of naturally must have be unnatural if be not so nerve fibre have be screwed up perception whichever way looked be at concert

not more than ready to go to sleep at end of bad plan to have deposit of tiredness on board to one add day required great exertion of diplomacy on peggys part to secure quiet stroll with hugh after

thing have lot of tact said hugh confidently yes visible tact be a bad a none only tact worth having be tact that cant see invisible tact weather in london year be contrary to habit of june extraordinarily hot hugh made use of day two later with tact that for mere man showed sign of invisibility edith returning home from concert have be put down in park to walk up shaded alley by lady mile be waited for at end by carriage rhododendron be in full flower making up for fifty week sombreness of foliage by incredible brilliance of brief blossoming tree be pyramid of pink red blossom herbaceous bed too at corner of serpentine be flaming mass of colour hugh saw opportunity oh very well to say that be beautiful bed said in answer to ediths commendation out of place garden flower be out of place in london if be commissioner for gardening whoever doe must have made number of tin flower brilliantly painted so that must wash dust then must show execrable taste said wife why be just fact that can turn out of piccadilly in moment be in beautiful garden make london so perfect dont think perfect at said why when looked at bed other day positively felt home sick dont now because be here alone made feel home sick one ought never to come into park if one be living in town edith transferred eye from bed to face now be going to play truth game two question said ill begin oh always toss said hugh really invisibly tactful well be not going to question one must like to go down to mannington yes then dear why didnt say so be that second question asked edith thought wish id made three question instead of two said suppose maynt now certainly not well then isnt question question two did peggy tell that said be tired hugh nearly heaved sigh of relief just suppressed be tremendous piece of luck that question took form didnt said now turn have be wanting to go to mannington yes then why didnt say so be that question asked certainly well be because thought be enjoying so much wanted to stop here hugh nodded with moral purpose at a people nod at child then hope will be lesson to said here man with leather bag slung round neck book of ticket came up demanded twopence because have sat on two green chair hugh searched pocket in vain for coin edith be equally destitute so have to get up move on underneath searching scornful eye mewed hugh to sudden passionate expostulation dont look at like that said havent got money didnt know be chair edith laughed silently hopelessly at continued walk oh will be able to sit in own garden without paying penny to anybody said edith how heavenly will be looking do remember last day there how sky wept howled let go down at once evening be dining out arent yes so be to morrow next day for week im ill be ill be ill edith maintained that there be certain decency to be observed be not till three day later that left town if during three day hugh so abandoned to crowded festivity of june that sometimes almost wondered if must be home sick for country on other hand felt so inspirited by thought of getting away from same festivity that sometimes wondered whether peggy have be right when saw animation of enjoyment thus be acting part peggy that arch conspirator observed with extraordinary complacency result of machination arch conspirator in fact be delighted when left london fact that gathered only second hand because did not appear at big party gave that evening indeed from evidence showed on surface be more than half inclined to think that have be really wrong utterly astray in disapproving of marriage year later anyhow here be edith tiring out concealing fact with utmost success from husband so that must not be curtailed of london day enjoyed with exuberance of youth success while on other hand on first hint of wife fatigue went away merely with self cursing at own slowness of perception into country structure might be reared there be doubt about foundation be devoted to other have shown instantaneous instinctive necessity to sink self for others sake yes perhaps be altogether wrong year ago have peggy be compelled to forecast future a saw then must have be very different future to be now present to promise of present two have spent six month at mannington alone upshot be mutual devotion disruption of age according to measure of year existed between have shown sign of wider tearing indeed instead hugh have grown so much more manly so much le boyish while if anything edith have grown younger instead of acquiescence in minor joy of life pleasure of seed time flower pleasure in river down pleasure in microscopic intrigue of mannington year ago have be sufficient to enable to look forward to quiet uneventful future must still be full of appropriate enjoyment of middle age have recaptured youth tenderness for green living thing in class must be feared peggy put canon alington wife perpetua ambrose be still there love have come too fresh seething effervescent love on hughs side there be le too cursing at blind selfishness have gone down in mid season to mannington because edith be tired bless said peggy in same breath explained to serene transparency that brother in law be not going to sing unfortunately because among other reason did not happen to be present peggy have done sort of thing standing be to say at top of staircase while name be shouted out to so often that mere mechanism of receiving occupied thought very little real thinking self be left free to pursue winding of way unhindered there be many thing about hugh edith seemed to to be matter for pleasant smile be so often on face year allowed did not seem to have emphasised difference of age rather to have diminished be devoted to other please god before many week be over edith must see husband with first born in arm yet shrewdness be not quite content be like wise old hound of hearth be restless sometimes pricking uneasy ear sometimes looking out with whine at gathering dusk knew cause of uneasiness surely be very little thing for be only that edith have produced effect on hugh of being indefatigable whereas in reality be very tired be keeping up be feeling age while be ceaseless successful in effort to conceal from did then fear exactly what have prompted peggy to dissuade from marriage year have gone have brought great happiness to year to come might bring more must bring more of difficulty must grow greater with year hugh edith have gone down to mannington by motor even to confirmed cockney there appeared to be certain point about country in month of buttercup briar rose until after have passed goring road led through delectable lowland of thames with glimpse of silver wood embowered river sense of green liquidness so characteristic of peggys home at cookham soon after ascent began a car climbed on second speed big hill cast thames valley below breath of livelier air assailed for thick lush growth of valley more austere greenness welcomed home coming thick meadow golden with buttercup spired with meadow sweet no longer enframed flying riband of road copse elm pointed hedgerow be left behind seen a from eminence of balloon instead empty ball room of down where fairy dance in ring of emerald green yellowing grass of chalk hill bordered way now again with rest for racing engine must descend into country of briar rose dense hedgerow again a often with grate of low speed climbed higher yet till wiltshire down lay round held like interlacing of strong braced muscle of earth hill after hill huddled into sunset flock of sheep driven toward fold of eventide at last reached top of high ridge from descent began again into valley of upper water of kennet on side stretched great empty down over blew unbreathed untainted cool thin air of height edith with head thrown back let stream into lung so that seemed to be flowing through heart led eye onward there three hundred foot below dozen mile away must see happy valley of home heart where last winter have lived in indian summer there be loop of river outside mannington lying like silver thread in richer green of water meadow there be tree small a vegetation of child box of toy held house mannington nestling in wrinkle at base of hill be invisible must see own house standing outside town gray protective tower of st olafs at sight past surged bubbled in heart like wine just on top of ridge hugh who have be driving with chauffeur by while edith sat behind stopped car of course made usual remark oh what have gone wrong asked nothing running a sweet a barley sugar be at top will just toboggan way down look there be loop of river house hugh jumped out on to road through pleasure palace though may roam remarked there place like chalkpit im going to come sit behind with how clean empty be just think of wood dust smell crowd of piccadilly at hour yes dennison drive please hugh stepped over low door into body of car sat down by edith while car gathered speed again soon came to top of long incline led without break down to very gate driver stopped engine in silence slid down empty unhedged road like great bird dropping through viewless slope of air toward nest moment ediths content broadened deepened here in gentler activity of country in long garden hour in absence of crowd in day spent quietly night did not begin with dawn felt that there must be need of making continuous effort hugh must never know to be effort have so tired have tired body mind alike effort have be physically exhausting mental force willpower to make appear spontaneous natural expression of abundant vitality have be even more tiring now thought that need of be over unloosened from neck completely for first time finger of nightmare have touched on morning of gray dawn though lightly pressed have always be there often indeed touch have be scarcely perceptible have known tiring week of london have followed that at moment might tighten to strangling hold have fought wrestled with incessantly successfully in so far that have not yielded inch that hugh have never so much a suspected that be there now when have stopped at top of ridge when home came in sight hugh climbed in beside seemed that possession dropped off that left behind on road malignant little figure silent still watching a bowled down smooth incline unable to come further exorcised by sight of home in have never yet shown face a bend in road cut off from sight of ridge where seemed to have left turned to hugh with sigh of utter content oh hughie what home coming said like to think that tree be decked out in midsummer clothes to receive sun have be specially polished up to welcome oh there copse above climbed one morning when told who andrew robb be do remember said hugh gravely there be terrace where told something next morning cant remember what be here motor car in tell that there now sits silliest boy in world remarked wife be within week of midsummer after have dined strolled out again into garden to find that reflection of sunset still lingered in west in bar line of crimson cloud floating like burning island on lake of saffron yellow in solemn intense light everything seemed to glow with radiance of own huge sunburned shoulder of down above seemed lit from within by living flame smouldered in still evening air intenser green than ever direct sunlight kindled burned in tower of elm westward river lay in pool of crimson then gradually in throb layer of darkness night began to flow like clear incoming tide over scene drinking up colour a edith have seen once at cookham like shy wild beast star be lit in remote zenith again over water meadow below skein of mist spread diaphanous expanse in soft confidential dusk edith spoke of event be coming to father of child new secret of woman sweet soul be given one thing only kept back that peggy have guessed be even now thinking of a two walked gently up down garden path between fragrance of night scented bed will be then said that soul will be absolutely one think be that more than anything first born child mean to mother at least so seems to can not imagine two people being nearer to other than be dear know will be nearer yet hughie want to promise one thing be promised that wont be afraid wont be nervous about must just blunt edge of joy that few week of waiting hold for if thought that anxiety suspense be to be yours just when joy be being fulfilled ah how can help began be that have promised to help there be nothing to fear know in way cant explain to knowledge somehow be bone of bone must see with child in arm be god will want nobody to be here except not peggy even must tell peggy hope wont think very selfish unkind of dont want anybody else edith laughed perhaps will allow to stay at canon alingtons added stopped pointed at white garden seat glimmered in dusk sat down there that morning cried said be frightened think at happiness be coming to hughie must almost sit down there again now cry time arm must be round so must not cry long also be getting used to happiness be stranger to then well happiness be all right when know youve got to know first then turned faced took hand in hers man said chapter xi canon alington have just returned from ten day holiday have spent in yachting in calm pleasant water of solent have be in extreme health vigour before started when came back week after hugh edith have come down to mannington again felt have quite set up wife have written to day during absence giving news of ambrose perpetua sweet pea have mentioned arrival of grainger be propos of literific a be now quite generally called by member of society mr grainger who with husband have be unanimously elected in course of last winter have promised to read paper at june meeting to member looked forward very much since be of course widely known that be author of gambit something very advanced might be expected canon have arrived late on saturday evening wife have have great deal to talk about life on sea have made quite sailor of when sat in study after dinner have be distinctly nautical double herbaceous bed lying on side of path for instance have be under discussion when canon alington asked whether delphinium on left of path be getting on well alluded to left a port side corrected too about position of purple clematis whose health have be indifferent when went away there be several climbing up trellis work behind bower starboard clematis be one be anxious about just close to gate said forward on starboard will have lot of leeway to make up next week be everything low aloft drawing well agnes moved from sofa where sat to chair close at elbow ah thats more ship shape dear said canon alington now do know though look so smooth hasnt glass fallen with somehow agnes since went away skipper be ready dear give order be rather troubled said knew now what about about edith be going to read paper know next week at literific cant asked dick searching in mind for subject on might be able to knock up something to take place of ediths paper found even before agnes answered that literific need have anxiety a to postponed meeting for have enjoyed many hour of fruitful meditation on yacht yes can be just said agnes have told what subject of paper be to be oh dick canon alington held up hand to stop be rule of literific that subject of paper must not be public property until notice of meeting be sent out by secretary who be mr alington consequently until canon received card headed by facsimile of athenian coin with owl of pallas lithographed on bearing in wife neat handwriting date of meeting name of lecturer subject of lecture have business to know what be to be so held up hand have not sent out card yet asked then dont think must tell what subject be mr alington looked more troubled more like ambrose think agree said what be phrase two sunday ago about final test of what must do in difficulty how must put to lodestone of conscience dear touchstone touchstone yes well have put to touchstone of conscience conscience tell ought to consult about dont think be possible for literific to assemble hear mr grainger paper canon alington looked up in surprise wife instantly correctly interpreted look yes cant call edith on point said personally must not think of going to hear be sure must now notice must go out on monday if once go out dont see where will end mustnt go out mannington mustnt know subject on mr grainger proposes to read to besides discussion must be possible on subject discussion be one of main object of meeting be not canon alington rose in silence lit pipe of half awakened bird eye be very serious said take for granted be not overestimating unseaworthiness of paper for such thing have never happened before must find member of literific proposing to read on subject of must not like wife daughter to listen to must wife like husband to listen to said agnes with sudden energy canon alington did not reply for moment for be putting case to touchstone of conscience secretary position in society knew be confidential one yet if agnes with scrupulous sense of honour still wished to tell might not be choosing greater of two evil if refused to hear knew also that be a broad minded a be not in least likely that must feel like if there be adequate cause came sat down by again have made up mind said think be duty a husband a guardian of spiritual yet dont know be very difficult come to then said wife must resign secretaryship because will not send notice out will not sign must imply approval canon alington again paused tell then said at length take responsibility mr alington looked straight in front of spoke calmly lately discovered letter of lord nelson said be addressed chiefly to lady hamilton though heard quite clearly canon alington said what sharply be incredulousness of mind spoke did right to tell said after moment have to now what be to do must be very careful very tactful very broad minded must be firm of course paper can not be read oh laddie must manage said agnes be just that can be be priest too will recognise authority canon alington leaned head on hand thinking heavily did not feel quite certain in own mind that edith must recognise authority felt even in first moment of thought that there must not be need that must agnes seemed to imagine that must insist on reading paper to horrified literific unless absolutely forbade there will be need for said little tact above perfect simplicity directness will feel sure be be needed be wondering dear whether speaking to direct must be best plan cant tell how grieved disappointed be feel almost a if first impression about gambit before have seen be right after seems to be more of piece with in mannington too that must happen in mannington be little obscure seemed to imply that did not matter what be read to literifics in other place such thought really entered head did wife put interpretation on must speak to hugh about asked must think will see canon alington shook head dont wish to say indeed to think anything unkind hard said so neither in thought word do go further than confess that dont understand hugh have therefore confidence that will see point of view remember tristan mr alington sighed did remember tristan be filled with foreboding ever since read libretto said did not see how impression opera must produce must be other than painful shocking still since impression on reading gambit at least review of gambit be reversed when saw on stage felt bound to see other also left covent garden remember before end of second act in spite of inconvenience of finding way out in dark think certain that hugh will take view still one might try think be not sure think that hugh felt something of what said then canon alington have sat down again by wife chair took hand what do woman do who have galahad said felt so puzzled so distressed about have comforted see so clearly dear people be so strange unexpected to think that brother must have acted tristan before london to think that mr owen who be so nice who be so musical have such deep feeling must have stopped to end said enjoyed so apart from else there did not seem to to be single tune in whole opera ah mr owen said canon alington suddenly lunch with to morrow doe not yes dear what then canon alington attacked subject again with renewed briskness might do worse than consult said before take step at can not expect that everyone must take exactly same line a do be possible say be possible that may think that certain historical interest attache to opera like tristan even letter of nelson may over ride everything else of course agree with view if hold will perhaps enable to understand for others be tenable on other hand if agrees with will much strengthen hand in dealing with situation edith can hardly fail to have great respect for opinion then might sound hugh if take view also fancy will find way smooth without having seemed to apply pressure having aroused sense of antagonism have talked long over one subject what with leeway have to be made up on other topic owing to canon absence time went so fast that seemed almost incredible to eight bell must break in on talk further discussion therefore on secular subject be adjourned since be habit of house to spend sunday of first hour have just chimed with mind a well a deed dissociated from affair of week mr alington therefore hastily gathered up patience card have be set out earlier in evening husband knocked remains of latest pipe of half awakened bird eye into grate with scrupulous sense of honesty have just one more question to ask think edith understands about about lord nelson asked mr alington shook head pursed lip think may take for granted said canon alington lit two bedroom candle drank glass of water put out lamp habeo said bishop be holding confirmation to morrow must see in afternoon if mr owen disagrees with refer whole matter to wife though usually be so much of mind did not welcome suggestion one doe not want to tell more people about than be absolutely necessary said because one of chief object be to let nobody know let see anyhow what mr owen think first mr owen accordingly came to lunch after service next day for though canon alington wife made rule not to go out to meal on sunday did not cause breach of sunday observance that other people must take meal with for entailed extra work for household since on sunday ambrose perpetua did work of parlour maid at table handed everybody ration took away plate when have consumed possible view too that be only shifting of extra work on to shoulder of child have more than superficial semblance of truth about with foundation in real fact since to perform little service for parent mr owen be not love labour lost love pleasure found be custom for ambrose perpetua to sing hymn after lunch on sunday choosing one in turn to mother accompaniment until be so hoarse that must sing more be tea time to day have be privately instructed that ask mr owen to sing once to that must then take off to sing in nursery if chose to go for walk since parent desired private talk with more than anybody else in busy mannington have not be idle last year in addition to nearly six week spent in town since easter a well a memorable visit to venice in april have written two more galahad song contemplated whole galahad cycle indeed be galahad good morning that sang afternoon be to be first of galahad cycle must when finished be whole day in galahad life from time said good morning to time said good night in galahad song there be of course meeting in orchard although middle verse be full of temptation foe routed without slightest difficulty instantly returned to three two a good a new to day a mr owen sang agnes must not help eye growing little moist a looked across to galahad who be gently beating time while ambrose perpetua vied with other in turning over thought how pleasant little coincidence be that on very day when have to charge rout fell lady hamilton mr owen with sweet face voice so full of expression must be singing galahad good morning to once eye met of husband felt sure understood what be in mind be quite right did at end ambrose perpetua gave great gasp think loveliest song ever heard said perpetua do know mr owen mamma call papa galahad can see why now perpetua be great happiness to parent at moment happiness be almost embarrassing now child said father ordered aloft werent kissed mr owen loudly went out hand in hand mr owen be universally agreed have great tact perception closed piano left music stool dear agnes said dear canon see have got something to say to oh darling child parent tribute have to be added to hers be sweet song said agnes so full of morning be not of feeling thought place where church bell came in be quite quite perfect early service suppose mr owen looked rather timid for moment be brave again yes be motif for next song said be planning be not audacious whole cycle next will be galahad mass oh canon alington be not romish of be be called mass in england be not until reformation undoubtedly said canon alington can give offence except to narrow minded by using word then mr owen gave long gasping sigh ah what relief said felt bound to consult be afraid might think rather risky to call by name well after there be going to be galahad adventure be foreshadowed in second verse of good morning then there will be galahad matins adventure then dream thought composer word music laughed gently thought after two adventure might sleep little in afternoon very beautiful very poetical said canon alington then oh wonder if will say be borrowed from siegfried there will be little intermezzo for piano perhaps violin describing thought when wake mus by in forest really really be quite different from waldweben then come even song be just little hymn composed then at end galahad good night think sang to year ago oh agnes canon alington have bone to pick with mr hugh be there that night yes did encouraged to sing before how must how cruel never knew that sang at then must never have dared agnes think need fear rivalry said canon alington be quite completely true hugh have not faintest idea of rivalling ah what artist said yes remember about tristan then let agree to differ wagner after know one have to make allowance for great man think of napoleon of nelson there must not have be anything more apt seemed almost like omen yet idea of making allowance for great men be not promising a plunge have to be made canon alington felt that from here header board so to speak be not very high must slide with tact into subject without danger from abrupt transition have be thinking agnes good deal about nelson said mr owen sank down with air of indescribable interest into chair next touching lower lip with little finger of left hand yes said be best told in fewest word said mr grainger may know have promised very kindly to read paper at june meeting of literific at end of week mr owen took little finger away from mouth clasped with other finger in right hand put between knee be so looking forward to said canon alingtons face be adamant so be said told agnes subject proposed to read agnes of course felt duty to tell subject be lately discovered letter of lord nelson be written neednt say to whom be written there be dead silence while portentous news soaked into mr owen mind absorbed survived then sat upright in chair again have sunk down in before spoke dear canon alington agnes said perhaps be going to shock very much if paper be read will not be read while be secretary said agnes understand that if be read will go to hear there have said like galahad canon alington heard sound of hymn from nursery follow said feeling that must have to go to bishop ah please be patient with said mr owen a said must go to hear know lecture will never be heard must well think that one can not expect that everybody must agree with everybody else feel sure that dear mr grainger see impropriety in subject doubt think of of dreadful letter make doubt be dreadful a being only of historical interest one must judge of people action by motif paused put hand up toward canon alington a if be praying in first lesson in church do not read hear of thing must not allude to in private life asked formidable upper lip grew immense be sacred history said also discus one of great object of literific be discussion mr owen sank back again in chair discussion said never thought of oh impossible thought of bishop retreated toward horizon again then agree with said agnes on question of expediency of having paper read discussed here in mannington said do agree must not know way to look far le what to say discussion without mr owen said canon alington a if flinging challenge to universe to imagine thing possible hamlet without prince of denmark mr owen cast eye down at very handsome estimate of value a debater a did when chorus of thanks rose at end of one of song gather then be wrong that be trying to think of best way out of difficulty of course if poor little must be of assistance however slight need hardly say be exactly what canon alington wanted for in spite of immense tact that agnes often assured that possessed felt that mr owen have more besides saw felt mr grainger point of view did not indeed be rather afraid that if conducted interview there might be considerable danger of moral indignation carrying away can do everything dear lady said be very person to talk to mr grainger about if will be so kind tell what feel about what feel about have tact be woman of world broadminded cosmopolitan mr owen laughingly stopped ear with tapering finger tip gave little melodious laugh laugh be supposed to be like peal of bell fairy bell said please please cried be ready to sink into earth tell too continued canon alington unable now that burden of diplomacy have be removed from to refrain from dictating diplomacy of others tell that must eagerly go to hear paper read that must be historically interested in how true be historically interested in so be agnes be sure perhaps however need not dwell on to discus poor added in sudden flood of broadmindedness after mere adjustment of movement of what canon alington called squadron be easy be soon settled that mr owen must call at chalkpit very afternoon that while mr owen be tactful to edith canon alington must put view of matter rather more forcibly before hugh in order to range also on side of squadron though be almost passionately fond of directing affair of others be just to to say that have great relish for mission however a lady agreed that be clearly right person to do must not refuse felt little doubtful to what extent hugh must recognise authority mr owen on other hand be thoroughly pleased with task have so readily undertaken for though ediths relation with have always be quite cordial have also be quite slight felt that have not made at chalkpit impression that be accustomed to make in mannington two woman of world be most secret thought hardly admitted to herself even when be alone ought to gravitate to other in mannington where everybody almost be so very provincial even dear alingtons though appreciated song so much felt especially when have just returned from month in london be not quite of calibre be on equality with set have lately be with among whom be viscount must not help feeling when came back to mannington that be being little thrown away here now fresh prospect opened delicate mission be confident must manage tactfully successfully must hardly fail to bring at once into closer relation with edith husband must indeed not be fault from omission remissness be to say if did not ripen into intimacy then indeed life at mannington must be thing even set might envy for none must be blind to advantage of being hand glove with author of gambit of dropping in to hear hugh grainger who be already on gramophone sing scene out of tristan lohengrin wonderful lady rye too who swam in firmament high above even set be known to only through fashionable intelligence in daily paper charity bazaar be ediths sister be only natural that further friendship must follow canon be somewhat occupied in own thought a walked across meadow from st olaf to chalkpit mr owen daydream grew brighter more lifelike moment most extreme possibility rapidly assumed guise of probable what if morning post announced before long that lady rye be spending saturday till monday with mr owen at mannington thing more unlikely have occurred if mr owen be seen looking charming at opera in lady rye box when brother in law sang siegfried with such huge success what if mr hugh grainger at autumn concert sang galahad cycle word music by gladys owen to enraptured queen hall must never be determined however high be ladder might soon be climbing drop dear kind alingtons indeed must be through really that be brought into prospective intimacy with grainger must always remember continue singing galahad to just a before squadron started campaign at slight disadvantage for day be very hot walk up to chalkpit have be hot also though high moral purpose be motive power must have put at once in unassailable position be fact that people who be obviously hot be at disadvantage in dealing with who sit under tree lie in hammock be cool amount of moral purpose alone will cancel handicap of perspiring forehead tea be just going out to lawn when arrived butler saying that mr grainger be out there led through house across lawn edith be sitting with back to in large basket chair did not hear approach while by lay hugh in hammock reading aloud mad tea party from alice in wonderland edith heard first got up hughs voice still went on be in well said alice of course be said dormouse well in hugh gave great crack of laughter oh dear how nice doesnt mean anything at idea of kind creep in oh hullo dick how be mr owen edith be a always perfectly natural cordial delighted to see mr owen felt that entry be to have be so winning be little spoiled by heat five minute however be sufficient to restore set to work then without delay to make impression must have made on arrival yes always tell everybody that have perfect house perfect garden mr grainger said be afraid always break tenth commandment whenever come here be consolation to edith since must be held partly responsible for house garden mr owen have only broken tenth commandment once before then only with regard to imperfect view of front hall for have be out when mr owen called visitor have only left card replied that did think be pleasant situation mr owen continued yes tell set so said like be just back from town how delicious country be be not after whirl rush of london sometimes wonder why ever go to town at yet suppose one must get little rusty old fashioned if one didnt bring up to date occasionally perhaps be even duty always tell bury too much in country a be scold dreadfully about edith looked at with pleasant direct gaze wonder if environment have much to do with one getting rusty old fashioned said really think rust old fashionedness begin from within mr owen clasped hand together oh how responsible make feel said know how rusty old fashioned often get think be fault canon alington rose at with sort of clerical gallantry well well learn something new day ejaculated have learned from own lip too that mr owen be rusty mr owen nearly said naughty man rejected natural impulse a not being quite in tune with impression wished to make ah be true said one own consciousness be only judge in matter if accuse myself of being rusty be rusty intellect be own tribunal forget who said that know be sure mr grainger mr grainger have not slightest idea felt too that have very little notion what mr owen be talking about be a if desired to shine must not quite manage to light match struck rubbed struck did not flame other part of squadron however tea being over began manuvring canon alington with horrified glance at watch saw must be getting back for evening service be with view to manuvre going to suggest to hugh that must accompany when hugh made suggestion saying wanted walk then of course remained for mr owen to be unable to tear away just yet behold be in fighting line canon alington hugh set off briskly former opened fire at once be glad to have opportunity of talking to hugh said because have something to say to want agnes want indeed mr owen also want coperation help insensibly upper lip lengthened little hugh vaguely wondered if be going to be suggested that must beg opera syndicate not to present tristan again little trifle of sort key of situation painful one be in hand continued dick at least in capacity a ediths husband must be clearly be not tristan pray go on said hugh perhaps guess asked dick havent vaguest notion ah perhaps have not be told very proper quite in accordance with rule of literific though perhaps spirit of rule did not seek to ordain that member must not tell even wife husband rather husband subject of forthcoming paper oh ediths paper about lady hamilton letter said hugh guilelessly did know in fact have read paper didnt occur to in connection with possible painful situation be rather behindhand with be quite finished now if mean that even canon alington found momentary difficulty in getting on for did not mean that quite wished that mr owen have be left to manage business alone there be still charitable solution possible ah then be sure be a thought said edith can know story be current there be unhappily only too much reason to suppose be true about poor nelson that lady hugh have momentary impulse to shout with laughter checked for subtle method in spite of desire to laugh too be beginning to feel understanding a now did probable though scarcely credible purpose of conversation rather angry dick dont think be right especially for person in position to rake up old scandal said gravely then do know edith know asked dick be taught in elementary school said hugh upper lip lengthened further then to come to point do think be right to read here in mannington paper dealing with situation to discus discus afterward have come to stile leading into field by rectory hugh sat down on amusement have died away go on said quietly have desire to preach to said dick instantly beginning to do so last question be one one scarcely want answered because answer be foregone be willing to believe that edith overlooked real moral fact of case in attention to certain historical interest must always attach to life of great men for of course nelson considered a sailor indeed a one of maker of england be great man dear fellow doe not excuse dwelling a in private letter must dwell on darker side of character now for practical suggestion couldnt without much trouble extract from paper little essay about trafalgar disposal of fleet instead of letter believe deal with other thing may think with pride of trafalgar for rest be rest of private letter make doubt deal oh havent read then asked hugh gambit over again be know subject from review can pronounce on right ah be not unsupported judgment time said dick sublimely ignoring point of hughs question agnes agrees with mr owen agrees with stop moment said hugh thought rule of literific sought to ordain wasnt that subject of paper must be secret till notice be sent out how did mr owen know did agnes tell tell mr owen agnes felt duty to tell said dick looking rather white stern agreed with when told take responsibility thats right then said hugh can have out with a be responsible suppose felt duty to tell mr owen tom harry butcher baker be to understand that agnes woman have be talking over propriety of wife writing paper for tin pot literific impossibility of having read because of dreadful improper disgusting subject have have discussed matter have to please let pas hugh see be use talking over a hoped must quietly in friendly manner with hugh did not move im blessed if let pas said youve be spending happy holy sunday afternoon oh can imagine tone so well about have chosen to speak of subject to so im going to answer there be need see made mistake in speaking to at said dick hugh have completely lost usually imperturbable temper lost in violent blazing manner with good tempered people do on rare occasion when lose at all a if edith must write wish to write anything might not be read discussed in court of heaven that sister prig that woman must have talked over question together easily imagined too mental attitude toward thought prompted be prompted by what said thought of be perfectly intolerable yes made mistake said make in thinking be not going to answer because be youre too much accustomed to go jawing away in pulpit to people who cant answer from not being answered get to think that be always quite right arent im telling so what deuce do mean by supposing that wife must write if tried anything that wasnt fit to be read discussed why who arent fit to read discus more than be fit to go see tristan thats by way dont care what think say about for singing in what say about opera just laugh different matter when come to think say thing about edith dont laugh then im not laughing now how dare do canon alington have never in course of useful life be spoken to like be astonished into silence seemed incredible that must happen yet be happening hugh have not finished yet asked just now went on whether thought right for wife to read paper of hers in mannington may be surprised to hear that agree with think most undesirable that must reason will probably surprise just a much because if be to judge of mannington member of literific by people here must have most disgusting mind never heard of anything so narrow puritanical prurient be just same about tristan couldnt see beauty of because couldnt keep mind off moral question tell that edith havent horrid mind like dont even need to make effort not to think about dont want to doesnt to thing too bet that that woman came to call afternoon in order that must talk to about must talk to edith thats not very nice thing to do must have told to have told edith instead trapped into walking with in order that woman must talk to wife besides thought didnt approve of going out on sunday hugh paused moment so dont be under misapprehension said be entirely on side see about reading of paper though for rather different reason will do best to induce edith not to read other ever dont know if will succeed because have got soul mind of angel be perfectly incapable honestly believe of doing anything must be unpleasant for anybody good lord how will enjoy telling peggy about will roar if can make believe true by way also said up at house that must go because be church time looked at watch too must have known wasnt because there be bell just beginning thats ive got to say think hugh stepped down from stile held out hand there said ill apologise for anything have said that isnt true ive got more to forgive than know dick because ive said everything straight to whereas talked over with mr owen agnes attributed to edith nastiness of own mind thats what come to now propose that make up a boy say canon alington looked at icily never bear malice against anyone said a to making up in sense in understand word namely to resume cordial relation with will do so when express regret for word have said hugh stared at for moment will express when feel said walked straight back toward chalkpit chapter xii hughs hustle of indignation against brother in law carried in one burst like motor car on top speed to level of hill where chalkpit stood rattled hooted way into garden there found mr owen still talking to wife noticed that subject whatever be be broken off very short when appeared on lawn mr owen began with eager finger to appreciate beauty of herbaceous border beautiful pink rose over there said what be be so short sighted be mallow said hugh yes so be dont adore mallow mr grainger did dear canon say anything showed that thought ought to have gone to evening service be afraid be very naughty about evening service if preaches go if doesnt exercise free will free wont a said thought always preached said hugh with internal cackle of malicious delight at what implied ah wish did such wonderful eloquence be very eloquent on way down said hugh edith be watching hughs movement with anxiety seeing a be perfectly clear that be what mr owen must call rather upset easily conjecturing cause brilliant yellow flower continued mr owen what be like sunlight on bed be not surely be little sunflower coreopsis said hugh smartly cigarette edith perhaps mr owen will said mr owen looked round a if be afraid that literific be concealed in tree be watching occasionally smoked when be surrounded by set then london be so different well if will never never tell said do smoke sometimes though cant feel sure ought have cigarette remember after came back from tristan tristan mr grainger oh how enjoyed what wreck be next day sounded rather a if cigarette be wrecker took one blacked down one side with smoke from match leant back in chair with sense that be doing exactly right thing edith took one also here be a mr owen gleefully thought author of gambit new tristan smoking together felt that intimacy be indeed on wing if thought of alingtons at thought of a poor alingtons then edith turned to husband sit down hughie said with mr owen leave want to tell what have be talking about mr owen put up deprecating hand in attitude of prayer palm to palm finger outstretched promise shant scold said be very winsome called from hugh who be sitting little behind out of sight glare of concentrated hate edith noticed hate winsomeness why of course not said think did very friendly thing in telling be most grateful to think three have better talk over mr owen released hand from prayerful attitude shook impatiently in air oh how ego disagree with what believe to be wisest course said moral geography be not delicious expression of wife mr grainger must remember be in mannington how narrow stupid seems to now while sit quietly smoking here with at moment huge ember of burning matter dropped from mr owen cigarette on to dress quiet smoke be interrupted for moment contrast between edith woman of world quiet simplicity with woman who only succeeded in being worldly be wonderfully marked one be quiet kind other be fussy full of monkey plan between sat hugh angry young oh have be having talk about same subject said do think storm in in scullery be worth discussion have already said exactly what thought about edith frowned then laughed dear hugh said must remember that be in scullery that be kitchen maid who have prepared dish isnt fit to be eaten see that now must have seen all along again mr owen waved slim long fingered hand in protest ah mr grainger how naughty be cried be not dish be not fit be diner who be not fit that be view again ediths simplicity shone out in plain word hugh said paper of mine about nelson letter clearly wont do sister have feeling against so have canon alington mr owen agrees a regard inexpediency of reading to literific under protest oh such protest cried yes now that be so kindly pointed out to by mr owen have to consider what to do next oh have pronounced on said hugh be clearly not up to mark of literific must retire must tell peggy mr owen clapped hand how must love to see lady rye face when be told said in little ecstatic aside what laugh must have hugh in midst of irritation let eyelid of eye away from mr owen just quiver a if said dont oh hugh be serious said wife a if must do like huffy child now be keeping mr owen mr owen made so vigorous gesture of dissent that flower in hat swayed a if squall have passed over hugh got up matter be settled said have sent in resignation at least ive practically done so mr owen be absorbed inner life of distinguished person be being turned inside out before eye be a fascinated in a child be in internal mechanism of watch though looked on too be of be concerned in wheel cog yes weve got to think of something else said quietly have promised to read paper one have written clearly wont do so must do best before friday to write then turned to mr owen be so kind said that be sure may ask to tell either canon alington wife that quite see point of view will anyhow read something if be not giving too much trouble must be most good of to undertake dont want to see about because must be much better to avoid possibility of discussion between whereas have already consulted since husband doe not entirely feel with on subject be best that must not be intermediary will say also that by to morrow night will send subject of so that notice can go out early next day sister lady rye come down to morrow if cant think of anything to night be sure will be able to need hardly say that dont want whole thing to go further must be tiresome to know that mannington be talking about word be quite courteous sincere have note of finality about a edith have intended produced effect of making mr owen get up for edith did not propose since hugh be so clearly on edge to sit discus further will be pleasure said mr owen with perfect truth will catch after church may take paper with a so kindly let read be typewritten in manuscript hope manuscript be so psychical manuscript must convey so much more to edith turned to hugh hugh must please get for mr owen asked be on table be afraid be typewritten hugh must not resist one more shot at brother in law might tell canon alington that must avoid next number of nineteenth century like poison said because wife paper appears in might give few word of warning in church mr owen wrinkled up eye with bewitching smile clapped hand oh how naughty of cried how delicious hugh sped parting guest to door came back again rather lingering on way into garden because felt slightly guilty slightly ashamed of though when thought of canon alingtons exasperating upper lip steeled again into anger felt sure that somehow other there be process of climbing down perhaps expression of regret in front of for there be edith again a have said once before shining above have to get there must have to give up anger before must join join must even in what have called storm in scullery must be together edith welcomed back with serene quiet smile sit down hughie said because have got to have quite talk oh one thing dear before begin do know be rather rude to mr owen be dreadful pity to be rude to people be guest see though perhaps of like very much must be polite rather snapped at snapped hollyhock when admired rose snapped coreopsis when asked if be sunflower what fool cried hugh called naughty again at door naughty shouted asked to come meet peggy forgive though a be so unsuccessful then sat down by wife chair yes be rude said suddenly be sorry be so angry when came in oh lord didnt give hugh flared up again at thought if that want to talk about said dont see that use feel be perfectly right be only ludicrous when came told that tristan be not fit opera to put on stage be devoting voice god sent gift called in horrid canting way because toenail be just a god sent to evil end telling that paper wasnt fit to be read discussed at holy sacred literific be not ludicrous didnt amuse didnt amuse hughs voice rose shrilly hadnt even read not even review of time said what doe man mean doe think that because wear round collar have gift of divination so that can pronounce on thing have never set eye on did say asked edith did quarrel with yes of course when id finished asked to shake hand didnt say word that wasnt true refused said must shake hand when expressed regret for have said couldnt answer back there be nothing to say thats what couldnt forgive tell exactly what happened said to said edith gravely hugh be so worked up again by now that be to be feared recounted interview with gusto completeness with seemed to have expressed rather appalled wife if ask if im sorry concluded im not have nasty mind have be privilege to tell so agnes have got nasty mind too used not to have used to have quite nice one like mine have corrupted bother wish id told that thought of forgot again will send postcard about edith must not help laughing at ah do write hugh said then tear up be such excellent plan if feel very angry with anyone do that dont know that particularly christian thing to do be such relief gravely write down nasty thing can think of state in most cutting manner wont try hugh shook head wouldnt do said because must certainly send will with pleasure if like be silent moment what be to do said see have said that will do utmost to make leave literific while have sent grovelling message by mr owen to say will read paper situation be impossible a stand too be dead cut with brother in law thats impossible too so be remarked hugh edith pulled hughs hair gently hugh im going to talk for quite long time without stopping said in fact mustnt consider have stopped till tell so now first of just love for having said thing to canon alington because first reason be that be sticking up for thank most awfully dear then do know hughie reason came in lost temper because thought be insulting continued to let be lost because have time without number got on nerve though told laughed at what said about tristan told that in order to vex to hurt be what used to call pi jaw at school remarked hugh yes can call one now if like be really irritated by attitude about tristan about gambit though perhaps laughed at time afternoon be not laughing at at told that peggy must roar about for same reason in order to vex sent that message by mr owen about nineteenth century for same reason didnt ask not to then because must have looked to a if be at discord wish hadnt be quite quite tactless enough to give now darling mustnt do thing to vex people isnt when do that wasnt afternoon be anger on account left door open devil got in be so cheap easy vulgar to be angry to try to vex people believe never doe good at anger be one of two absolutely indefensible useless emotion other be fear oh hughie what dreadful twin hugh moved impatiently with shrug of shoulder have shifted seat on grass so that sat sideways to must look at saw that mouth be trembling little anger frightens said make afraid be why fear seem to like twin atmosphere of be so dreadful be heavy close a before thunderstorm cant breathe in whether be angry with with with anyone else be only question of degree there be poison about be such waste of time too one enjoys nothing when one be angry hour just shrivel up die instead of putting out flower cant help being proud of loving first motive put anger into heart dear be quite inconsistent quite wrong of for rest oh be wrong said hugh enjoyed being angry afternoon put out beautiful flower what part of enjoyed asked not part love be so proud of leaned forward to spoke more gently oh hugh let be kind said dont let try to improve people tell that be wrong narrow bigoted puritanical let be if wish really be business not ours do let be kind for beyond doubt be business leave to others to be good for be so frightfully easy to be good for other people to speak sharply to when think be behaving absurdly generally motif for doing be little mixed do because be sour angry ourselves rather enjoy spoiling pleasure spell be beginning to work hugh have ceased fidgeting looked at with quiver of smile on mouth besides be such fun being kind not bitter said being big not small yes small for angry people be always small narrow for angry man to call one narrow be for pot to call kettle black hugh have slight relapse for moment groaned think what state of holy exultation will be in said if meekly say will write paper well suppose mean to express regret for what said edith dont think can bear thought of will feel that be being instrument for good that effort bravery determination to speak out at personal cost be being blessed arent arent be not be hugh rolled over on ground in sort of agony at thought agnes will call galahad more than ever went on mr owen will dedicate galahad cycle to ambrose will feel that early christian martyr couldnt hold candle to blessed father wish have will sit in row with seraphic smile know how noble holy happy be especially that as be as prig oh dear edith how dreadfully funny be must absolutely must tell peggy about supposing happened to find out how dreadfully unkind must think for not having told edith have highest opinion of value of sense of humour often so appeared to must solve situation restore cheerful equanimity even more to sufferer from situation whereas appeal to higher motif for tolerance might have be made in vain whether be word hughs own innate sense of ludicrous have thus restored did not care at something anyhow have dissipated anger given back genial though amused outlook that little while ago have be shrouded from laughter rolling on grass be kindly again kindliness a have said reckoned a master key to conduct might laugh at canon alington a much a liked might laugh probably must at pi jaw provided only laughed not bitterly desire too to tell peggy a expressed just now be whole world away from what desire have be when suggested same thing to mr owen be kind again edith felt a if blot stain have be taken off own character though kind again hugh immediately got grave again after agonised roll on grass sat up clasping knee with hand leaned chin on looked at with kindled eye be david said be david reincarnated that expel evil spirit then edith knew that did matter whether be hughs own sense of humour have restored have told did not indeed in abstract did mattered so much to oh hugh did help asked be so glad go on said evil spirit be only half exorcised yet ah have said protested be afraid be very lengthy about think be true hughie oh know be smiled at waiting entreating ah there be shining shining said cant reach tell what feel like inside make what be want to get at cant isnt that keep back oh know that be not tall enough for one moment tried to laugh off see want to make talk like ambrose said yes darling do so naturally said hugh so go on again leaned forward toward radiant face there be impulse can teach dear said can only teach let year teach rest be practice have have so much more practice than simply because be so much older be only that for one requires same situation to be presented to one hundred thousand of time before one really draw moral have so often seen own anger making misery not only for others for at last began really to connect two one be like puppy for so many year take one lot of beating being tied up to realise that be not good plan to gnaw other people shoe to snap at other people hand slowly oh hugh so slowly have learned sort of patience sort of toleration for other people opinion have actually begun to believe that there be other people in world beside that have just a good right to opinion a have to mine that when happen to disagree with may be just possible a oliver cromwell said that may be mistaken sometimes a about unfortunate paper of mine reasonable self tell that be right be wrong yes will concede that now what then may be mistaken at rate at point law of kindness come in dont want paper in fact sister said must resign now be kind rather than send out notice why why because disagree must make fuss cause unpleasantness do let be a happy pleasant a can know perfectly well that of be acting up to best motif really think that subject chose be not fit one so must be acting on very worst motive if tried to embarrass vex lose none of happiness pleasure if write something else even if did perhaps wouldnt matter very much have got plenty left havent sat upright again for moment let eye wander over lawn quiet tree gray back of down green water meadow below then came back to hugh be silly to talk about paper said for whole thing be so infinitesimal did happen to be text when bade discourse after nothing be infinitesimal else everything be oh dear if think of thousand generation came before will come after who laugh love hate be angry what do matter matter to god have chosen to put infinite within because be human have to make finite thing of let make a big a can rose with shining eye stretched out two hand to be getting damp said let pull up have said in gathering dusk walked for while without speech something have come home to hugh there be fresh inmate at secret hearth word mere word be falsely supposed to be so ineffectual have brought there word have be winged with sincerity tiny though now whole scullery storm appeared saw how big be woman who have made appear tiny moved naturally on wonderful level be just because be so big that have treated little thing like have brought fineness of nature to bear on have not disproved with indulgent impatience merely saying that since ridiculous people have such ridiculous feeling must humour rather than cause unpleasantness have turned on to situation kindliness wisdom that possessed small though occasion be have be to part of life in detail be piece of design waited further instruction about detail what be to do asked laughed humble pie dear said yes suppose so oh lord why did lose temper for reason love said for other reason must go absolutely say so asked oh hughie question of must unless know be must said took arm out of hers then ill go now said there will be time before dinner see im sorry just now yes go now said may tell peggy to morrow asked hugh left at once went quickly down through field below house struck into footpath led across to st olafs a got near church saw congregation beginning to stream out knew that if waited by door from vestry must catch brother in law after have taken off surplice counted offertory gift of alexander coppersmith a have once said when appeal for foreign mission have provoked too great proportion of coin of low denomination from within with congregation there poured out melodious din of organ that with effect of stained glass window lit from within reminded hugh irresistibly of church scene in faust when mephistopheles wait outside for marguerite exactly a be doing in case canon alington must be marguerite shook with internal spasm of laughter at thought for moment made forget humiliating errand be standing in shadow close to porch by faust congregation be coming out with one eye on one on vestry door from small choir boy occasionally popped out like rabbit ran across grave yard with swift reaction toward ordinary life after two long service of day ambrose who have lately be admitted to choir father have compiled short service for induction of cantator came out among without racing leaping for always have bad accession of virtuous musing on sunday evening walked round to main door to meet mother with boot creaking starlight shining on spectacle humming to in husky treble hymn have just be sung mother always came out last from vicarage pew ambrose have to wait while remainder of congregation dispersed hugh have turned back on door for really must not bear that nephew must recognise just then when strangely dreadfully familiar voice

must offer concealment lohengrin have not quite finished content of slop basin when slowly sank out of sight behind tea table whispered mutual enemy to other pirate for carriage be coming up drive might be caller who must come out to have tea from there by crawling on hand knee be possible to get behind elm without leaving cover to get from there behind box hedge separated lawn from kitchen garden without being seen be child play to proper pirate carriage whatever be only drove to front door left card departed edith thought of calling to pirate to tell coast be clear on second thought did not for be a matter of fact not sorry to have little cessation of riot have be going on since lunch hot day of mid september to so languid enervating seemed to have strung up to highest pitch of activity other child among whom included husband though not two month old baby peggy be with too people have come to lunch frankly felt that little truce from high spirit with be surrounded might tend to raise own wanted to sit think wanted to examine cause of depression under have be suffering for last week two assure that be groundless at rate have root merely in physical soil be not concerned with essential thing told knew that must be so at present moment did not realise in at convincing manner son have be born in middle of july from day to have grown thriven in most satisfactory way even in midst of present tiredness unexplained depression glow of retrospective happiness kindled in face when thought of moment when have seen child in hughs arm from day to miracle of motherhood have to lost whit of wonder have gone excellently well with also recovery have be rapid sound until one day in august when have caught little chill soon however recovered from too letting dwell for moment on purely physical side of thing knew that have not felt quite well since yet did not think that discomfort be anything more than be easily accounted for by birth of baby chill following very hot oppressive weather have continued right up till to day must look further than for cause large hopping figure in silver mail crossed opening in yew hedge led into kitchen garden pursued by diminutive one in scarlet be visible only for second immediately afterward there came passionate cry of protest in tenor voice shrill treble scream of exultation that well knew contained deeper cause for disquietude than have thought of yet once last spring have reminded hugh that be in actual year nearer daisy age than own hugh unconscious be now demonstrating to truth of own statement deep abiding a have need to tell a be love for thoroughly a satisfied need of spirit yet so told now be not all wanted at age must want somebody to play with not only a regard riotous activity of pirate in corresponding play of mind everyone age be wanted perhaps most of society of contemporary abandonment with romped with peggys child be more than superficial bodily example of sort of thing needed with lightness activity of youth be more nearly natural mode of progression to jump flower bed than to walk slowly a have done so often so delightedly by bathchair mind told be more like child in process manner of progress than be like hers be not only in body that be beginning to feel difference of age between be rather dreadful thought edith must not help thinking that daisy in childish unformulated manner of eleven year old be conscious of month ago now have told hugh that daisy did not like be jealous of considering that have taken hugh away to day seemed to that daisy understood position better that knew now that hugh very largely remained to a indeed so edith felt did not that daisy for moment felt anything of malicious precocious pleasure in merely childish instinct realised that though in way aunt have taken hugh yet appropriation have not caused change in idol still played a beautifully a ever took exactly same comprehending interest in affair a always have done trait in daisy experience not very common among grown up people who merely played a if be playing not a if be real to hugh be real that made line of demarcation between mother aunt in other word be young indeed only morning daisy have said be busy for be going to amuse hugh be found playing tom tiddler ground immediately afterward hugh be quite certainly being amused then poor edith have very bad quarter of hour indeed suddenly saw that in moment in hugh have seemed to to be most utterly absorbed in to be in own phrase searching after a shone above be in truth feeling most keenly difference in year have said too to have told in talk have with regard to question of nelson letter that there be impulse of kindness must give be merely question of practice in deed of kindness until habit be formed practice in rejection of anger till root of anger in soul have withered be a if word have be steeped in bitter brine of truth have be sent back to on innumerable occasion when have besought to teach to show to loving pupil word feeling interpreted looked at by dry light of truth meant simply make older be powerless to do even if have not be dearly a prized love companionship must not have done so selfish thing be possible indeed to get old in mind soul quickly a at one time have be in danger of doing in heat airlessness of sorrow bitterness knew well how unremitting struggle have be to to get back into kindly way again one must desire for one loved forcing heat so to speak of pain instead of slower maturity be arrived at through joy of living in case must not be applied at will god have bitter drug in huge pharmacy be true none might use baby be to have made union perfect be to have fused so that there be joint visible what of there again have made mistake for a saw now have construed fatherhood by word motherhood what have be to have underrated be a well to say have overrated what have be to a peggy have said morning star shouted together when woman saw child in father arm music of sphere sounded louder in ear than in hugh have be delighted overjoyed at event even month afterwards have taken persuasion to get to go away up to scotland for few week shooting from have returned only couple of day ago have gone letter so frequent so long so full of affection have unconsciously reeked of own immense enjoyment have read over over again pleased at pleasure thrilled at excitement of heavy fish have played so long almost stunned by tragic loss revelling in good time be having yet now then like faint internal pain have come thought can be absorbed in thing yet fact that pained contradicted feeling of best self have required great persuasion to make go required persuasion also to make stay away not curtail visit be best in wished to see friend wished to enjoy immensely for very simple reason that pleasure be hers at age be natural proper right for to be active sociable must not really have have tied to apron string nothing be so selfish unwomanly a nothing also so worldly wisdom have taught be so unwise woman be old banal simile felt be applicable be like ivy a long a must clasp oak wanted more how different be oak bird built in threw out strong unsupported branch into sky liked wind to sing in rain to cleanse sun to lighten must not grow without thing ivy wanted to cling only there be difference older grew instinct be to cling more tightly yet woman a have proved a crowded playhouse tear laughter rained over play have proved must do more than cling until marriage have be busy happy never day passed did not seem too short for occupation have be used to weed to garden to plan procession of flower so that bed must always have torch of flower life burning yet time planned busy current of mental life must be flowing on still so again again must stop in manual employment in exercise of more superficial ingenuity that bed demanded to register dramatic conclusion outcome of life of imaginary folk how intensely have be absorbed in ordering of vegetable life around how much more intensely absorbed in creation of mind how happy have be in then came much larger happiness one infinitely more absorbing more possessing be from mere indolence what have suffered other to wither have let light go out in theatre of mind leaving dark tenantless hugh have called out into true sunshine often often during last year have gone indoors so to speak to look after theatre of mind construct plan fresh adventure for puppet have not be able to attend to with conscious enthusiasm alone a well knew be able to make creation of brain alive to creator world if propped one up let fall down left lying if made one speak let yawn felt not really believing in at best be only part of herself even with be alone still be that be matter with at word very gate of hell began to swing open hell of flame burning hell of cold darkness be always ready to be called into being by soul who belief in at moment felt hideously alone in spite of hugh in spite of child there be nothing must really bear company soul be alone then almost at first touch of cold unpierceable darkness dear gallant soul a be refused to believe in sat up quickly a man scare away by rapid movement bird be eating ripe fruit that have tended to maturity so in mind scattered penetrating claw digging beak be preying on legitimate harvest again again flapped clapped hand at have spoiled in past must spoil more depredation have be own fault too have gone to sleep in sun instead of being active busy who planned garden now hugh who planned delved in garden of brain nobody have be indolent letting mind rest doze wonder a drowsed dreamed preying flock have descended for of enemy to happiness laziness indolence be most aggressive wonder very door of hell darkness have swung ajar making believe for moment in loneliness of soul here a if in reward for own gallant rejection of execrable creed came beautiful interruption to further consideration of in shape of peggy who have just returned from mother meeting at st olafs where at earnest entreaty of agnes canon alington have consented to give address of kind there be going to be garden party for mother who included sister father in moment of mental weakness have promised to talk to on importance so have said at lunch of thing in general just at moment be exactly what edith wanted to hear about for doctrine of lonely soul excludes thing in general very creed in fact includes negation of existence be eager to hear what peggy have found to say on subject also wanted to confess to beloved confessor to whom life have confessed so much also to make spoken audible resolution for to a to everybody who life much in imagination spoken word have almost authenticity of deed to say thing meant that doing of be made real tea die said peggy seizing tea pot where be child hugh added clearly a afterthought how be edith look slightly melodramatic sitting on brocade sofa very beautiful quite alone in midst of opulent surroundings there be abundant topic to choose from out of edith began at first struck child hugh be unnecessary said three child be playing mixture of lohengrin red riding hood alice in wonderland pirate hugh may only hop darling said peggy enthusiastically have really dressed up a intended want to dress up too oh what fortunate people be be already cheering of course be said edith why did say that then yes one with sugar on top be excellent added a peggys finger hovered indecisively over tea table peggy took one spoke with mouth full why by contrast of course said so many prosperous people arent fortunate because havent got mind be so important mind really became text of thing in general be enormous success oh edith there be shorthand writer there who took down going to appear in st olafs parish magazine there fame for tell about thing in general said edith fully intended to there will probably be parenthesis there one now in fact do know never understood canon alingtons mind till to day then flashed on explanation be that hasnt got one be mosaic of thing in general golf history motto apostolic succession literific hugh ambrose not wife by way be mosaic bit of thing doesnt make up be thing in general be life with can pick piece out arent fused together bit be alone if picked out so that there be nothing left must go on buzzing still like motor car throb wont start be rather difficult to follow for anybody who have not heard address on thing in general edith be on right tack called mosaic of thing in general said isnt that something worse than nothing said peggy dont see think did mother wasnt fault whole point of thing in general be that thing be part of must no more pick out of life go on working just same a before than must pick out of life gospel of thing in general be that be fused into can never be alone cut off isolated be mind ego what like to call fuse mustnt stick about like jewel clothes wig do must be part of yourself be of use doing anything unless be edith be listening now attending like child a if have be fairy story to child be true asked question be do then part of yes if be always being wise said peggy unfortunately be not perfectly wise person good gracious be becoming like dr emil reich perfectly sincere person almost think be same always express in act what be more never doe never think anything not expressive of of course arent like of make dreadful mistake do thing utterly uncharacteristic inexpressive of ourselves be parenthesis by way never must arrange thought well go on with said edith what be one to do then why darling who know better than live down mistake forget about dont blame god other people for if possible dont be sorry even for very long even if have be quite clearly fault because to continue being sorry be vain repetition waste of time though have of got time there be there happens to be such very little of wasnt so metaphysical to mother father of st olafs by way what come to a regard thing in general be that everybody ought to make external thing sewing gardening reading friend part of so that when have little time on hand can go really be instead of sitting down brooding over how much pleasanter must be if how much happier must be if how much anything so long a only end in if hate if if always implies regret that something happened didnt happen oh surely if may belong to future said edith be great mistake at least be great mistake ever to regard existence of if future be really a certain a past of have built future yet man woman be surprised when see rising up exactly what have planned be rather delphic utterance observed edith yes feel delphic there again thing in general come in dont see idea want to help think out be only stupid people who havent really made thing of life own part of who can be shocked dismayed knocked down have to fuse pursuit friend into very soul so that be part of have to grow into world yet not so that becomes become be what mean by life be fusion of other thing thing in general with lacking that one be dead one soul be alone be coming very near seat of ediths disquietude then what be trouble of lonely soul said be imperfect sympathy isnt there be certain change in voice when asked peggy noticed be no longer voice of enquirer into abstract problem external to have ring of personal question personal anxiety about did not regret have meant to make confession to peggy have a good a told now yes peggy went on ive be having little attack of lonely soul afternoon perhaps can prescribe for peggy laughed darling said imperfect sympathy be so selfish arent so self centred tell about now how did come on edith hesitated moment wondering whether be wiser to speak of even to peggy not yet there be such excellent dispeller of phantom a sister be convinced be phantom to be silent about too must imply that be not sure whether be real not wanted to be sure one way other sat up on sofa came on said by sight of hugh child playing together made feel old lonely wondered whether did not feel young lonely ah dont interrupt peggy let get through with think honestly think that be thought of being lonely with that hurt most so perhaps wasnt imperfect sympathy be trouble truth may have be trouble now know peggy warned dissuaded told be too old to marry now to day do think be right if do will find edith paused moment will find more ready to listen to now that be too late tragic a word be edith must scarcely help smiling for opposite peggy be sitting with mouth wide open in order to begin to speak moment sister left off pooh said very loud ought to have told before by way couldnt bring to here to day then confess a far a can see a far a trained eye of pessimist can see there be cloud on shining heaven whether have be happiest cant say know of nobody in world more happy than have matured too grown older yet without losing youth in most wonderful way did that took in dear hand made man of didnt occur to that must be done have given son a for attack of lonely soul starting with seeing play fool with child good gracious what be thinking about that let start do want not to must like definite answer edith gave long sigh ah know love doing said then lonely soul probably started not with seeing with something at lunch remarked peggy oh peggy be good for said edith there more lonely soul to come well hope more sensible than last said peggy at least dont see what mean out with well since marriage have cared le about other thing in general except hugh used to spend delightful day alone here always busy busy with garden busy with book busy with writing ive dropped used to be friend feel ungrateful because good heaven how helped in other year pulled out of mire clay be so absorbed in writing now creature of brain be dead gave touch of lonely soul gambit for instance used to be part of fused into now only bit of mosaic a said im sure if anybody picked out shouldnt even know be gone peggy did not say pooh to instead nodded head quite gravely yes can quite understand how give twinge of lonely soul said only have once said edith in self defence that time be started by something else may be do think there be material for lonely soul there quite true have dropped friend edith music be to say be part of hugh how did happen tell oh dear so naturally last winter down here used to try when hugh be practising to go on with new play seemed remote be good think working creating at rate unless for time be more important to than anything else couldnt be that longer love happiness came between brain winter spring till came up to town never for moment got used to happiness never grew le wonderful never must think of anything else oh of course wrote little wrote act half believe wasnt what will call wasnt intimate stuff be puppet marionette instead of flesh bone brain then in london after first tremendous excitement of hughs singing be over thought must begin again yet couldnt be tired think then came month of waiting here for what july be going to bring now two month more have gone havent touched a for garden ive forgotten name of thing almost said pointing to rose bed peggy felt nearly a strongly on point a did on other well dear time sat up began again said doesnt conscience tell so must be great pity if simply because be happily married become cow know just grazed really think be being rather indolent odd unlike for moment occurred to edith to tell sister that there be perhaps explanation for a knew that have not felt well for last month have be easily tired when ought day to have be gaining in vigour growing robust again must lead to further question very likely end in promising to see doctor thing have not slightest intention of doing at present at rate for be one of splendid shining light in hypochondriacal world who naturally of serene health refuse to admit illness till be on point of dropping besides more important than be going to munich with hugh in fortnight time to hear cycle of ring that fully intended to do if necessary must see doctor after pause have somehow aroused peggys perception to supernormal acuteness be well dear arent asked a if following ediths unspoken thought do look ill said edith in voice of earnest enquiry cant say do so do take up other thing in general again hugh be only thing in particular ought to have yes what be to be done if one work seems dull asked edith one cant go on hammering at thing if seems dull at least only effect must be to produce something dull read through what have written other day seemed lifeless to dont really care what happens to people paused moment again yes here come again to imperfect sympathy said seems to that perhaps after be sorrow bitterness need of fighting that awoke perception let see say what after did go home to people be that do think be that god plan be happiness such a afterward be mine so embracing divine gift that be sufficient in so that other faculty be dulled rendered sleepy must be bitter choice to be obliged to make to be happy for one own sake to feel sting of misery in order that one might comprehend sorrow of world must choose know must must always choose to be happy be afraid yet perhaps other lot be nobler be that wee bit ambrosian peggy laughed from lip only be rather disquieting question oh cant believe that said quickly cant believe that god give misery to quicken doe not give happiness to do same must fulfil through joy surely must mean to be happy else world becomes very tragic thing supposing be asked edith ah be supposing impossible said peggy quickly world isnt tragic not in main at rate weve got to go on from strength to strength not from misery to misery of people in world have proved that came out of hell into sunlight dont tell that wasnt intended of course be for rest of difficulty think have be rather indolent have be own fault use happiness a used misery hate letting thing go to waste why know agree about that have gift have shown really be behaving rather in way hugh behaved about singing be well again dear have have huge stimulus of bearing son to husband really do think that time for to begin again im going to munich almost at once said edith yes in fortnight get through something first have idea how much more will enjoy if have rather tired first suggest also that read play a far a have gone after dinner to night if think dull why will tell so if trust judgment can begin over again what nice plan make for have read to hugh said edith in moment well hugh have got great deal of perception know comment be that wasnt really by andrew robb at seems to to be case see andrew robb be lonely old gentleman who be forever fighting against bitterness within trying to be reasonable kind in spite of expect that struggling to be kind make one sympathise with struggler be too sleek now too contented ah be sorry said peggy andrew robb be such dear do think be really dead edith got up with little shudder of goose flesh one can never tell said people like often have little private resurrection hope be dead if in order that must dictate play must have to go through sort of thing again for lived just little too near hell shudder of goose flesh repeated drew cloak about shoulder sunset have ceased to flare in sky with withdrawal of light have grown little chilly come peggy said let walk little be very grateful to have stirred up expect be getting indolent well see if cant raise ghost of andrew robb anyhow want to write again hugh want to say be absurd that must go toiling away at singing if dont toil see darling boy have very high opinion of andrew robb want to see more of didnt see in act of new play read will make effort be time did suppose have got stupefied with happiness left lawn went up broad gravel walk by herbaceous bed at far end of be doorway in box hedge into kitchen garden still flamed in wonderful warm september indian summer be still coaxing into fresh flower bidding forget frost be soon coming sight of what suggested perhaps made dead andrew robb to stir in tomb of rose love isnt duma who say that if hesitate in artistic choice between one course only hesitate because be really good asked edith be trouble over play cant decide one development seems reasonable then becomes just a reasonable oh peggy be pain that need again dont want to be quickened more want to have few more year like year have just have god how content must be with peggy entirely disapproved of attitude oh hate talking about few more year said darling dont be so graveyard why of course weve got to die for heaven sake dont let contemplate that depressing fact when be rare with even begin to think about latter end always get up do something doesnt matter what do go do before die supplement that by small dose of kind because though death be real thought of be almost invariably liver consider what great girl be a somebody said in divine alice in wonderland only dont cry dont resuscitate that dear andrew be dead peace be with resuscitate mr grainger edith turned enquiring face be that be matter with asked there be nothing matter with cried peggy get on get on get on wild shriek arose tore quiet of evening into shred other way jim screamed daisy youll catch at corner yell took up oh saw walk shrieked jim might only hop tall figure in silver armour bounded across lawn fell at ediths foot home said aunt edith be home happens to have moved o lord edith what godsend be red riding hood came flying up path remnant of gentleman in paper closed in from other side of lawn aunt ediths moved shrieked daisy must have caught long before got to tree there be rule panted hugh aunt edith be home wasnt peggy be inflamed at yes hugh be home said let have one more tom tiddler ground aunt edith be still one home tea table be other hugh still lay on steep grass bank up from lawn to path by flower bed touching ediths shoe very well ive won then said if aunt

silver gold on tom tiddler ground for little while caution be shown on side while jim darted to left right trying to catch cautious figure did not venture far out then edith started to run in earnest jim flew after ran up bank trying to dodge just a felt touch felt sudden warm choking sensation in throat that made cough hurrah screamed jim touched aunt edith yes jim im caught said then put up handkerchief to mouth looked at a withdrew again there be little stain on very bright red chapter xiv there be big ribbed looking glass outside window of doctor consulting room tilted in warm reddish sunlight of september morning while through open sash there stole in aromatic smell of fresh laid asphalt there be not much traffic going on only occasionally clip clop of horse hoof sounded staccato on wooden pavement of harley street edith must hear without effort sir thomas be saying hardly led up to for have come there that morning simply to know what result of examination have be merely asked question two a to health since birth of baby then without preparing for knew that there be breaking such news told quite quietly in word two edith have be sitting opposite window looking at with pleasant direct gaze a if giving very courteous attention to story did not particularly entertain in be bound for politeness sake to appear interested when finished smiled at a if tale have have slightly humorous conclusion did not feel in least stunned have consciousness of having received shock only for moment little trivial circumstance of hour place grew more vivid noticed that clock on chimney piece have stopped odd in consulting room of great doctor sir thomas have scar running across back of left hand that one of own glove have fallen on to floor then attention to triviality

clung to thank god for people like said hugh be to arrive did so next day for wife be starting from town morning after for munich arrived rather in manner of loquacious whirlwind in middle of lunch greeted peggy edith waved telegraphic form at ive got to say yes at once cried be handed to at station at mannington couldnt reply before saw edith a munich be treat burgmann be ill ask if will sing tristan on monday week in place yes at munich of course said so heaven do grasp inwardness of sacred fact englishman asked to sing tristan in germany to high ge born tedeschi lord what fun will go mad

prepaid form hugh have be waving about with other dont settle said settle of course sing please have sent at once will peggy oh thats rather sudden said hugh dont consider will have more fun now until over cigarette anything scale may be awfully nice for say that sound so gloriously conceited wont alter will absolutely spoil munich for oh hughie crown for of said travelled up with mr owen said hugh eating very rapidly think shes going to dog if so influence edith smoked cigarette in train dont think influence be very good one domineer too domineer most frightfully that sending of telegram be mere brute force told to settle did so why hugh be most gorgeous thing that ever happened best birthday present ever received hugh dropped knife fork with crash jumped up why remembered morning said that silly telegram drove out of head again edith darling many many happy return bent over to kiss forgetful for moment raised face to then be like stab to remembered hughs face be close to hers lip touched ah cried quickly mustnt kiss ive ive got cold if gave might not be able to sing thank dear thousand time for good wish hugh looked at for moment in mild astonishment a if cared said ah do said edith catch cold so easily too hugh went back to seat dont like having cold said independently of fact that maynt kiss on birthday have one in august now youve got ive good mind then stopped hugh very rude to begin sentence not finish said peggy yes isnt by way music be down at mannington must go get copy of tristan afternoon a will have to begin learning up again at once what be lady going to do peggy appeared be at leisure offered to drive where wanted in motor edith have thing so comprehensively expressed be at nobody disposal till tea a matter of fact suited hughs good mind very well soon after lunch set out with peggy sooner be alone than announced strangely disconcerting manuvre yes let go get tristan first said then want to drop at sir thomas ransom ediths got business to have cold will get to come see ive several time thought wasnt very well always said be do think shes well peggy be awkward after extremely rapid consideration peggy concluded that have prior engagement of secrecy to edith entailed what be elegantly called diplomacy in dealing with hugh since ask dont began then why didnt tell after diplomatic truth must serve purpose proceeded to use extremely misleading accuracy because edith know said a matter of fact went to see sir thomas yesterday so there be need for to go in case hugh cant spring doctor on grown up person a if be child know saw sir thomas yesterday in fact peggy paused moment wondering how far astray truth telling must lead in fact went with what did say asked hugh with inconvenient abruptness peggy looked firmly out of window oh what doctor always say avoid over excitement curried prawn hot room fatigue then did know be going to munich yes oh yes be certain of that encouraged to go peggy be beginning to feel slightly feverish with strain of there be heartache in word have promised secrecy secrecy implied that must do best that hugh must suspect nothing be rather hard work for hugh showed sign of being tired of questioning diplomatic truth too having served turn be discarded diplomatic inexactitude have become necessary needed encouragement then said hugh felt not quite up to not at wanted to go very much encouraged a said motor stopped at moment by music shop where hugh be to buy tristan got out shant be minute said will wait for drive to harley street for moment after hugh have left peggy seriously considered propriety of telling worse lie breaking previous engagement knew quite well that what sir thomas have be unable to do hugh must do with utmost ease in moment edith must consent to go to davos at once if hugh wished hugh in order to wish have to know what peggy knew be bound not to tell yet mind hesitated between two course for first minute of waiting have idea whether must break faith to edith really lie properly lie to hugh have seen that be already more than half way toward suspicion have to quiet that by really magnificent lying by lying quite a magnificent break faith with sister tell then too be determined to see sir thomas perhaps sir thomas might not see way to lying if hugh asked a probably must more of direct question if sir thomas be to tell be clearly much better that must do so first if anybody be to tell truth have much better be first to tell then determining factor came into mind be freedom individuality of person when vital matter matter of life death love came on to stage ordering of stage ordering of crowd light whole arrangement must be made to fit chief actor edith on half tragic half triumphant stage be set for have chosen manner of enactment peggy be figure in crowd edith ordered to stand thus to do thus to say thus be ediths show have ordered hugh also into place that place where heart be lover beloved have to obey le than peggy week of munich be ordained edith knew risk ran chose to run after be business might be expensive be fine be young too gloriously unwisely young so young that made peggy feel dreadfully old there be calculation about counting of cost edith be willing to risk anything to have week wanted week of boisterous unsuspecting hugh oh passionate enjoyment of pleasure of somebody else seven veil of sanctuary lift there be abandonment of love whether tragedy to be paid for be long week of lingering illness other supreme torture price be cheap peggy divined that edith knew mentally peggy abased when light of vision shone upon a did while waited in berners street for hugh did not keep waiting long peggy at once began to weave web of deceit be forced on few people have have le practice in difficult art than a conducted piece of diplomacy felt that really must have great natural gift way at same time remembered having be diplomatic to hugh over question of going to mannington in summer diplomacy have be blessed with singular success now have two object in view one hugh must not go to sir thomas other that vague uneasiness be certainly rising mist like from mind must be dispelled edith must have sunny week that soul desired for unanxious unsuspecting hugh be necessary must have if peggy must procure wise idea of yours to go see sir thomas said with extraordinary craft because will certainly laugh at perhaps will set mind at ease most important that must be at rest really matter more than anything else why how be that asked hugh oh dear how stupid men be cant see that edith be looking forward to munich with keenest most vivid anticipation well at risk of making more conceited than be already will tell why because be going to be alone with enjoyment there be nothing in world love a much a seeing have good time will spoil for if be uneasy causelessly anxious thats why urge to see sir thomas have very distinct effect on hugh seeing sir thomas be nothing said felt a if be keeping something back cant tell what said cant go into medical detail said peggy can tell when edith called in after have consulted told what have said simply sat roared with laughter rather think joined hugh gave great sigh of relief peggy ejaculated god forgive below breath oh why didnt tell that said because thought so much better that must see sir thomas said peggy quite glibly hugh turned on have making of diplomatist said whats use of seeing sir thomas now have told that edith really look forward to munich will spoil if im not in tearing spirit lord wont spoil where will go instead zoo said peggy without hesitation hugh called changed direction out of window to chauffeur sat silent awhile after be absurd of to think there must be anything wrong said of course must have told peggy sighed elaborate effective sigh be wondering when must occur to observed hugh let pas so ive just got to to shout sing asked yes if want edith to have good time can tell too have never seen look forward with such pleasure to anything a munich trip taken fancy im man then said hugh peggy thought incumbent on to tell edith what have occurred feeling that might view deliberate deception in different light to mere concealment be that have contemplated edith poured scorn on scruple peggy be true friend said how easily seem to have well told truth quite bismarckian have be practising lately peggy be slowly pulling off glove dont think have said oh be diplomatic with hugh once in summer remember rather enjoyed oh edith gave heartache afternoon what will hugh think of when know will think that have be true friend to said sister will love for when when understands ah be on forbidden ground again edith paused remember once talking to about hughs first appearance in town said told then that if failed be impossible must not be sorry because must have to comfort again make happy well be closer to now when tell what sir thomas told yesterday will want that comfort now will really want for be more to than art edith gently smoothed sofa cushion beside be really be said dressing gong sounded sonorously echo died into silence will see said edith chapter xv edith finished writing word gigantic success then laid down pen having filled very small space allotted to correspondence on picture postcard bore on back highly coloured view of opera house in munich on space allotted to address name of peggy then tore up wanted to say more than to peggy though be tired felt must write letter must give in le meagre quantity in quality thing more private than must be sent face upward through europe little impression of week have elapsed since left england in order to do that found that must arrange sound thought memory for have lived simply from minute to minute enjoying to uttermost yet somehow not grudging passage for be sufficient in window be wide open sun have slanted westward so that balcony outside be in shade though ever so little way beyond white glare fell on road with avenue of dusty tree though september be near to end during first three day of stay here there have be cold frosty night seemed a if sun have repented of winter heralding withdrawal have come back to give few hour more of summer day at moment struck edith yet with touch of sadness how like to beneficent return of june like heat be own case in london ten day ago forerunning foot of winter have struck yet now in life le than in ordering of season of year summer with shout banner renewed for moment miracle outside be hot windless dry a moved to window drew in long breath of eternal unfading air there even sensitive leaf of white poplar be still there be little traffic in street awning below room above balcony stirred flapped in blazing tranquillity calm omnipotent summer reigned to night hugh be to sing in tristan be not in munich so felt be not on cornish coast be not by bank of scheldt pegnitz even in giant built tower of walhalla that have lived during week must come to close to night have lived far away from human place yet in place that lover music lover have felt to be own more familiar dear than other home heart treasure lay there even walhalla be league immeasurable league below trouble anxiety fear be stranger to at most that only for one of lay a thunderstorm in alpine valley lie far below foot eye of who have climbed above into clear passionate altitude be domed in sky floored by ice week long have mounted mounted through fine austere air life knew of life have be put in crucible distilled for drinking be to be be have for day be expunged from memory from anticipation have be to sit on rose coloured peak hand entwined without seeing troubled cloud below without hearing thunder voice cried out of have determined not to think of descent not to conjecture about danger misty passage of journey till time for descent have come must come to night before came there must come divinest hour of rosiest flame of sunset when must sit in hushed house hear week have be treat to hugh compact have be that must ask question possibly be child like possibly be barbaric notion of hospitality have given enormous pleasure to throw money about for to take most expensive suite of room to have mass of fresh flower in day after day to have really smart carriage always waiting to have meal in private dining room somehow on material plane infinitesimal though be wanted to express so filled flooded must have liked to furnish room afresh to have railing of gold for balcony fresco for wall then at end of week to burn destroy have in fact gone a far a be consistent with sanity not being insane have not gone farther tired oh how tired have be again again how indomitably have spurned fatigue glory jest of too again again hugh have said that really must if didnt mind lie down rest if be to keep awake during opera have beaten at own game at youth time again have confessed a much have even confided to projected errand to sir thomas on last day in london in order to satisfy that be up to munich now be who have wondered if be time have clung to supposed cold have insisted that have really bad one that must not permit hugh least risk of catching at such moment cloud came over sun there be echo of heart breaking thing from valley below hunger on height yes fear have be there knew that ear have heard that echo heart have felt that hunger though for stray moment two only a quick a hand must move finger have stopped ear nimbly have put before heart feast be spread for now be only of perfection of present hour that wrote to peggy hint of coming winter be there though measured by actual lapse of minute be hour two before summer must cease before summer ceased must see tristan once more tristan by time letter to peggy be finished be time for to dress for opera hugh have already gone down to house have little soup cutlet only for a usual be going to have supper together after opera to night however since hugh be going to sing have eaten nothing for hour before supper be to be of substantial nature have planned have ordered dish that liked a well a be going to have cold soup dish of blue trout partridge savoury be bathed in setting ray of last day of summer sun must illumine too coffee cigarette hugh must smoke with during cigarette so determined summer be to cease be then must tell for moment a dressed for opera wondered how must take be worse for than whole attitude toward life instinct told that with same certainty with knew that be easier vastly easier for to know that have consumption than must have be to learn that hugh have be what love meant just that one simple fact that to woman who love husband be more truly than be news to have known ever since have known hugh must not have be true of if have not be true of also oh poor hugh poor hugh then with complete erasure banished thought of what that hour round about midnight evening must bring be still in love with life with huge exultant happiness be birthright of clean normal soul who love such happiness highest best of earthly bliss be niggardly distillation of human life to produce hundred myriad soul have not to be boiled down in torment of fire refined through starvation of joy so basil like may put forth flower from root have be enriched with life blood tear of many be rare recondite only to be perceived by olian harp of world instead be common common bliss none seek strain after there be few who find sweet simple soul loved hugh hugh a simple a loved if shadow of dark valley be near must be sufficing lamp must dissipate then crowning crown be hers be further gem like circlet to supreme gift of song have be given to supremacy of appreciation be time to go downstairs drive to opera to hear tristan have be arranged that since opera house be so close to hotel must not wait for hugh when be over come straight home waited there time before joined in exultation of happiness ceasing of summer be now so close in measure of minute not hour longer be banished from consciousness hugh tristan inextricably intermingled usurped tried to reconstruct event of evening found misty only knew that audience german instinctively opposed to english artist critical lancet like after when emotion be roused fair have lost head fat london have be moved over hughs lohengrin germany not fat like london in matter of perception appreciation have be much more than moved what have happened exactly end of first act yes hugh have be nervous quite obviously nervous have not done justice have done justice to glorious rle for be cast then edith have sent round note to saying darling be playing isolde dont find isolde isolde note have come back to im so nervous cant do anything ill try isolde appeared that have tried a curtain went down on second act theatre rose a if emperor have entered be hugh be hugh in third act hugh critical germany during third act committed unique fault of taste have be foreshadowed in way because once again a tristan yearned for coming of ship sort of under breathed groan have gone through packed house then when tristan have sung last note interruption occurred play be stopped orchestra inaudible beneath shout be stopped also huge roar of applause went up damning artistic reputation of munich for year to come tristan tristan be cry to edith cry be hugh ah how proud be of then not for have done for did not do have fallen loose jointed lay with face toward house not quiver of eyelash not movement of nightingale throat not curl of mouth answered thunder of applause edith have not even when thunder rose to highest be afraid that must respond be glorious to to see how still lay almost irresistible appeal have come from thousand throat artist since be personal since be to voice personality to be made be utterly unconscious of tristan who be lay dead soon after isolde sang liebestod death song thought edith what if sing oh hugh hugh be then that hugh came in a sat in window while table laid for supper stood ready munich have gone mad about from where sat in window have heard distant roar have greeted a came out of theatre have grown gradually louder louder till now square outside be packed with music mad have guessed at once what that distant roar meant guess have grown into certainty a grew louder nearer hugh came in ah note to said be that oh isnt fun told must be took horse out dragged darling agitated proprietor tapped entered short conference ensued upshot be that if high born must of graciousness show sing on balcony must be well otherwise inhabitant of hotel might have night began very late if high born gave permission proprietor must announce fact im so hungry said hugh proprietor have be present at opera beseech said yes hugh said edith then will come with asked hugh ah how summer sun blazed then nodded to with reverence of extraordinary amplitude to proprietor shouted few guttural word from balcony then bowed came back into room hugh took ediths arm together said together went out on to balcony night be windless flame of gas lamp burned without wavering whole square be packed with face full of low hubbub of talk when two appeared hubbub ceased silence like incoming tide spread everywhere then hugh turned quickly to proprietor hi did say be going to sing asked said be possible thousand pardon said perfidious man manuvring into better place hugh drew long breath with arm in ediths stepped on to edge of balcony then turned side face to crowd unlinked arm from hers took hand in did not look out over crowd looked at sang du meine seele du mein herz at end there be dead silence for unloosed one of hand held to crowd good night friend said in good firm german be going to sleep hush thank then took ediths arm again went back to waiting supper window through have entered again have left wide open only sound came in be movement of foot dispersing be best of hughie said edith must not quite rise to superficial height of gaiety during supper be even more impossible for to rise sink to tragic level equable level be there feared what have to tell did rise to by exaltation of spirit commanded to think that nothing mattered when happiness shone like life death sickness health in mind took natural level of be to commonplace of soul lived to soul thing happened be on same plane because be so big just a have anticipated hugh took cigarette with coffee watched burning ash get nearer to finger when got quite close must speak at present be inch off so still talked of of have talked why tristan did not come to life when liebestod be sung over said be what can not imagine surely be enough to make dead live sing over then said hugh when watch by corpse will come to life promise be more than did to night what vandal to interrupt like yes vandal said didnt feel surprised o thats rot said hugh how loved interruption how longed to open one eyelid didnt didnt hugh leaned forward over table eye hand toward wife life said how stupid sort of phrase used to sound until one knew that be true life yes look at life have become literally true oh true in big way small way alike cigarette be getting shorter hugh took long inhalation of flipped off piece of charred paper yes big way small way repeated big way because gave be small way because sang to night in silly opera house on silly balcony because be dont understand sometimes think dont be so odd that shouldnt still edith be silent for must have to speak very soon now without pause hugh went on considering that be who made begin to understand said be odd that shouldnt know what have done dont know who what be who what be do know that be life call what please how be cold asked suddenly placing cigarette end in coffeecup burning ash hissed in protest be still then edith answered isnt better hughie said wont be better for long time be comfortable there if not let move because have to talk to once before remembered having said to peggy that almost wanted hugh to be unhappy so that might comfort for knew thought knew that must always do have to make unhappy first strike dreadful blow already so to speak have seen arm raised against in few word have just spoken knew that blow impended though face be still eager vivid expression on seemed suddenly fixed waited tense rigid while hand have just dropped cigarette end into cup turned over at wrist like dead hand dropped on to table cloth then spoke below breath quick tell quickly said can bear anything except waiting took hand lay on table cloth in of hers still lay a if dead not responding to pressure have got consumption said hugh drew back head moment blinking wincing a if from physical blow summer stopped moved spoke edith having struck inevitable blow laid down weapon soul stood waiting so to speak listening eagerly for hugh to call to in pain so that might go to comfort bind up wound have made there be nothing nearer to heart than nothing that so desired nothing of have be must be so exquisite summer might have stopped on winter day there be splendour of sun snow have not foreseen that just yet hugh must not call to must not even need yet for be dizzy reeling with blow have power to move very fact that moment before depth of nature strength of love for have be so dominant so triumphant made paralysis more complete in stunning of true essential self surface perception mere habitual work of eye ear touch seemed suddenly quickened just a ediths have be when sir thomas told same thing little odour a of caramel came from cup where have dropped cigarette end from sugar doubt have be burned before sweet dreg quenched red hot ash a hand turned over on to table cloth have knocked spoon out of saucer clink of a fell sounded in ear more clearly than even four word edith have spoken lace curtain by window out of so short time ago edith have stepped on to balcony just stirred in little breeze have arisen during last half hour on mantelpiece striking clock jarred to show hour be approaching touch of ediths hand on meant more to than must touch of other hand have meant hand touched anybodys hand eye looked at too from beloved face opposite be anybodys eye be anybodys face then sensitiveness of surface perception grew little deadened a paralysis of internal perception began very slowly starting from surface working gradually inward to pas off be so happy said so be beginning to need yes thank god darling said let often think how happy have be must not receive assimilate more than at once be for moment use so felt to speak hopefully determinedly of future of unquenchable resolve to get well must be ready for soon not quite yet poor darling so waited when did know asked quietly just before left london must not do without beautiful week have just have hughie so did not tell till be over then then having cold meant that asked yes hugh pushed back chair with sudden vehemence got up roughly strongly so that be hurt startled flung arm round pinioning hers kissed devoured face with kiss eye mouth forehead hair neck be sealed with redness fervour of lip be vain for to struggle with almost savage outburst of love be in vain for to remonstrate for stopped breath with yet tried oh how sweet be to find struggle remonstrance useless how during last ten day have missed yearned for caress of eager breath roughness smoothness of face eye burning close to hers a burned now for physical contact tumult of love demanded shook off paralysis stunning be a if man struck by apoplexy have have blood let a in primitive surgery of old day be strong flow of restored to oh soul soul whispered to think that have borne alone thank god be over cut to heart in not telling didnt deserve that from lip quivered eye be brimming with tear soon ran over be who kissed away just for moment must not help be sensible not kiss anybody word of doctor sounded like gibberish hugh be cry doctor did not allow for contingency nothing in world mattered at moment that must comfort have never cried before a far a knew sob came from so deep within oh if be selfish forgive said be not thus that meant did want one week more so much darling one week to crown others have told peggy that meant quite distinctly to lie to hugh to tell that sir thomas have recommended to go to munich quite suddenly found must not lie to question arose in mind a to morality of telling truth immorality of falsehood be not moral choice be now flashed before be mere question of what be possible what be not have crowned others said be exultant that have got oh hughie have captured week snatched from foolish physician who forbade yes dear selfishness went a far a that told not to come so came be more glad than can say told also to be sensible not to kiss anybody have disobeyed there too so forgive for hugh have drawn chair close to hers oh forgive forgive said what word be that between be foolish word from to said understand then cant understand just now wondered at for not understanding what said have done wonder at now for not understanding what joy joy have be to why be mine more mine because be yours hughie though asked just now to forgive tell that be delighted with what have done be like dog have stolen bone look deprecating time lick lip have have tasted so good though may be beaten subsequently mouth still water at remembrance mine doe there must have be shadow over week if have known there must never have be week at broke in oh dont be too sure be very obstinate when want thing yes be comforting already though did not know did thought that spoke of past knew that be already bracing for future smile assured gently cunningly continued to build out of past oh hughie said be funniest scene dear old sir thomas told then called peggy in said oh peggy ive got consumption then burst out laughing peggy laughed too sat roared hugh frowned at peggy knew asked lied to then be what come to told that laughed when told what sir thomas said be matter with so that might think be nothing yes dear said edith have already promised not to interfere if have well not equivocated to must have lied to be very awkward for did best be conspiracy directed against yes darling directed against have already asked forgiveness know hugh looked round room with mute appealing eye be real asked be horror real edith said nothing be not facing yet with best self hugh have better than to give knew must come for be there infinite pity of love waited for when came must prove to have be worth waiting for soon must speak word came from own heart must say what felt more what sought to feel there be more in hugh than be so to speak accessible unlocked in own soul love key must open wordless sensation impression striving of week when have be alone with secret knowledge be in winter sun of comfort must bring to must be blinded by brighter light be who be going to unveil often often so almost hoped in week month that lay before must have to light candle of patience hope time sun must light path at moment poor hugh wanted candle what did what did sir thomas tell asked brokenly that have excellent chance be sort of person who got well that be going to get well that when got well must be younger better than now liked that hugh will be more of age so say oh silly joke said yes will be knocked on head will put cold cream on venerable nose give gruel then go downstairs again to play with child when have tucked up in bed shut window for fear must catch cold will be fun dont dont said hugh be comforting will not be in immediate future dear said want to tell now about immediate future now dont gasp to morrow must go to davos have looked out train already go because be coming too go to place

aloud while pressing master hip forward hullo peggy say be master hip be hip of unemployed other seem to be in pain have hurt more than anybody be ever hurt said peggy fell on knee know doe shake one up doesnt said hugh with odious calmness wish must just look at unemployed moment be going to do asked peggy a if couldnt see said hugh scornfully be going to make turn just opposite want to watch left leg hugh skated distance away with glorious disregard of limb if not of life put on to inside back while travelling at express speed made desperate attempt to turn sat on ice for little while after left leg went over head said peggy who owed one otherwise if hadnt fallen down must have be beauty get up hugh come sit here for little oh must like to sing dont let stop said hugh politely wont will sing inside so that wont hear be there ever such morning oh thank god for davos amen to said hugh peggy in spite of fact that only few minute ago nobody have ever be hurt so much gave huge sigh of content breathing in gallon of frozen sunny air giving out again in great puff a of smoke round rose white snow clad hill rising from shoulder to peak of glistening dazzling surface just opposite above stretched long single street of davos with row of big hotel tailing off to right into scattered house chalet among must just see house where be staying now with edith hugh daisy standing high above davos platz with broad wooden balcony front turned southward toward blaze of sun above village hung little thin blue streamer of smoke from fire be scarcely visible for seemed a if nothing smoky foggy must live long in miraculous air above village stretched black blot clump of pine wood from off snow have melted fallen a leaf be warmed with in striking of sun above again rose peak spur of heaven seeking hill over stretched incredible sky bluer than mind must otherwise conceive have not seen more crystalline than glass a untainted a snow looked upon shining there be keynote of whole huge golden sun divinity made visible enough to turn sourest puritan into parsee sun hot unveiled sun cleanness purity of frost be davos davos meant great deal to peggy just now meant to hugh edith have come straight here after munich before snow fell privately hugh thought have never seen so dreadful dingy place summer have be very hot where now ineffable whiteness of snow be spread making eye to dance heart to be glad there stretched long weary space of faded green worst of be that reminded in distorted homesick manner of down above chalkpit down above chalkpit be to even a hugh have said first act of love duet where edith have told who be andrew robb whereas gray yellow stretch of mountainside here be so to speak wall window of sickroom then have come rain dreary unremitting rain when heaven be shrouded tiring enervating wind called fhn blew out of southwest very interesting fact that word fhn be undoubtedly corruption of latin favonius did not seem to make better also must not find suitable house there be worse than that invalid life that edith have to lead be iron hand upon who have be so active so indefatigable have to lie down most of day out in slightly leaky balcony watch cloud shroud over hill thick ruled streak of rain have to take temperature enter on chart have to adopt nameless little device of illness from suffered to be hateful to pride to be degradation that must have to suffer in mean little way always splendid always rebellious against surrender to ailment must scarcely bear that hugh must see thus slowly by patience by habit first fruit of patience have grown used to yet felt at end of first three week that if have known how horrible be going to be must almost have refused to come here at have died standing defiant rather than fight foe by mean submission also for first fortnight disease certainly attacked more fiercely than before often have felt tired at munich not till now did really know what mere tiredness must mean went to bed tired awoke to infinitely greater degree of fatigue physical pain have known before never have pain so undermined a then once have return of hmorrhage hugh have sat by while servant ran for doctor sponging wiping longed to tell to go to tell that must so infinitely sooner be alone must not have borne also must not speak yet in spite of fiercer onslaught of disease in spite of hmorrhage in spite of dreadful fatigue felt that deep down somewhere so deep that showed a yet surface sign be better at end of first three week must not tell how indeed have never felt so ill yet there be so to speak little raft of recovery beginning to form through hour of helplessness felt forming in spite of bad report gently told knew to be so foundation have to be dug so that house may arise mason builder have to go down may build up be thus that felt then came change rain ceased snow began for four day snowed without cessation still lay out on balcony hugh sitting by rising now again to shake fallen flake off rug covered gradually through four day began to be conscious of change be very distant at first very faint be through nostril even more than through eye now saw though veiled in falling curtain of changed aspect that revealed something cold clean be coming stale odour of dried grass have gone there be filtering into air odour of nothing at absence of odour negative smell of absence of smelling thing during four day too edith lost temper at picquet game occupied much of evening hugh hailed secretly privately a must have hailed angel from heaven have be utterly apathetic before have played to pas hour then still while clean sweet snow be falling found house might suit for day before have constantly talked over sort of house wanted for day appeared to be matter of absolute indifference to edith to night however did not oh how stupid of hughie have said why of course ought to have gone to see kitchen house be uninhabitable unless servant be comfortable have far better be in hotel than in house where kitchen be coal cellar im sorry said hugh ill go look at again to morrow yes probably dont know good kitchen from bad one said edith sharply be that sort of thing so often during week made heart bleed knew how well knew that be not who spoke only hideous disease never confused one with other for knew edith too well for week have be fighting battle desperately splendidly week have be constantly impatient with irritated by quietly proudly wore that like decoration be just because loved that be like with with nurse whom detested be studiously evenly polite thanking for sort of infinitesimal service hoping be not tired fearing to disturb hugh divined cause of impatience with knew that divined too then swiftly came rest of heavenly change edith utterly weary have gone to bed one night while snow still fell hugh not long after though be still early have followed drowsiness of snow be on slept heavily expecting even in sleep to awaken to numb torpid pain of soul have be week did not wake thus be new heaven new earth sun frost have entered blue weather trouble have passed joy came with morning came in manner big small kitchen of possible house proved to be palatial peggy by morning post announced that jim daisy must come out for christmas edith so said when went to felt different oh hughie sun have come said a entered how good air smell dont feel nearly so tired be top of morning said looked at then avoided eye have be horrible to week said quietly knew perfectly well have hurt hughie be one of bad moment how must hurt asked have never hurt still did not look at lay with cheek on pillow felt that have more to say though word ceased yes said go on whenever thought hurt knew at once be not said then looked at darling be not said do try to remember that there be trying remembering said be on morning golden day began again week by week edith have steadily improved few little set back have come still tide flowed determination to get well have come back to will be no longer apathetic watching course of event active directing to day for first time by permission be to come down to rink where hugh peggy sat see attempt to pas skating test must admit on to english rink be impossible to say to whom edith english community in general passing seemed most important probably to daisy be coming up for judgment too be quite certain that must pas case of mother uncle however be far more open to doubt peggy sycophantically have induced edith to ask two amiable gentleman who be going to judge capacity to dinner last night have be almost loathsomely fulsome to door of rye house have really given to understand starved for presence must unemployed leg be absolutely still if moved ever so little must make turn too beautifully oh yes be sure that hugh must be only too honoured to sing at concert at belvedere in aid of oh quite so colonial chaplaincy fund hugh mr simpkins who be going to judge to morrow want to sing at belvedere of course will tuesday night yes be not doing anything will judge at half past twelve will suit beautifully can practise first half past twelve hugh bring flask of brandy so now on momentous morning in spite of ordeal must have to be gone through at twelve thirty peggy drew in gave out long breath of content there be doubt that edith be much better week ago even be still in lying down regime to day be going to walk to rink observe antic lunch with there be driven home peggy have interviewed doctor morning be all a good a must be be better even than doctor have hoped weight have gone up general health have improved vigour health be marching on high road toward one thing that have to be careful about did not at moment trouble peggy ediths heart be not strong no there be nothing organically wrong be possible that lower place than davos might be a good for lung not so trying so stimulating to heart did not for moment suggest leaving davos place have already done so much good be not to be lightly abandoned peggy breathed long sigh fell to talking of skating again when hugh have recovered from rather complicated fall oh doe matter so much said edith feel matter so much want dreadfully to pas test oh hugh how very big quite little thing be will really make happier if can do thing will make happier too do do be serious be going to do outside edge back quite slowly smoothly be only way hugh be content to sit still little longer watch peggy skating in only way whole face figure altered so radically when be skating a to be almost unrecognisable naturally stood erect upright on skate in pursuance of form became stiffer than life guard be cast in iron heroic mould her face too pleasant humorous in affair of everyday life became thing portentous grim determined inexorable have be told to look up to hold head back when be skating in pursuance of fixed savage unrelenting eye on unoffending belvedere hotel a if be going to command instant demolition then when crisis approached when turn have to be made aspect changed again relentless expression be relaxed pity terror usurped face crisis being successfully surmounted look of fathomless idiotic joy beamed from then faded like regretful sunset grim determination inexorableness of rhadamanthus again reigned watched peggy little while receded into crowd be growing thick on rink cutting rather not being able to recognise friend while employed in majestic backward manuvres casting glance of deep withering reproach on who came near sacred person with recession of peggy other matter receded too till be left alone with only matter really have value in eye morning for first time felt safe in letting go in abandoning to ecstasy that removal of anxiety brought again again after first three dreadful week be passed doctor have given excellent report be going on a well a possible not till to day have hugh felt be comforted have always be prepared at back of mind for bad news for information that be not making progress none knew what dreadful uphill task have be in performing promise have made to edith on night at munich when told in being gay being foolish natural sometimes have seemed to that must guess how hideously hollow apparent high spirit be letter wrote to peggy shortly before latter came out peggy have told of be reward in edith have expressed removal of own great anxiety that hugh must find nothing to do feel that place be intolerable so wrote be not so hugh have gone quite mad about winter sport spent ecstatic day in trying to break limb over apparatus for sliding whether over ski toboggan skate seemed to make difference point clearly be to cripple in way be keeping up singing too with really commendable diligence decent steinway have at length arrived be wonderfully cheerful too did end of good peggy have stopped there not told what letter went on about ediths bitter pathetic reproach against for unfathomable depression that so often suffered under made often so cross irritable to hugh think darling know isnt have finished be not for hugh to hear to day for first time in week felt must be cheerful uproarious even out of own self because spirit wished to laugh sing immense almost incredible improvement have be report to endorse that be allowed to walk down to rink matter of nearly mile many month a well knew given that went well must lie between complete recovery be to day for first time that hugh have let even look forward to to contemplate at even now must not look at long have to look at so to speak with half closed eye for dazzled be within field of vision remote perhaps shining how different made everything else look everything be enlightened even ambrose who approached at moment on skate about four size too large black goggles perched on inquiring nose be welcome came down to see aunt peggy daisy skate for english club said incomparable youth do so hope will get in will make so happy uncle hugh be happy already because papa told that aunt edith be ever so much better arent pleased too yes old boy said hugh why dont practise get in english club too daisy be sure to pas shes younger than isnt ambrose put head little sideways a did when be saying catechism when thought of exceptional nobility occurred to well have thought about said see be sure have be great expense to papa to bring out here never must have come out if hadnt be ill must have to pay subscription shouldnt if passed papa isnt going in for of course must pas a easy a anything if tried couldnt oh thats right then said hugh neglecting last topic ill pay subscription for if get through ambrose clapped hand together have caught from mr owen forgetting that be on skate tried to jump in air to show joy fell down instead even at moment of contact continued to talk in penetrating treble oh thank uncle hugh cried how kind everybody be to will go practise at once oh spectacle have fallen off must please give a promised papa never to look at anything out of door without so must shut eye till have on again canon alington ambrose have be here fortnight for canon have long wanted to spend winter in switzerland fact that ambrose who have be good deal pulled down by attack of scarlatina be advised to go to bracing place made duty of what have only thought of a pleasure too so agnes assured have be much tried by incessant work very rainy autumn in england reminding how fortnight yachting in summer have set up urged to go be set up again in fact idea of being pleasure at have long faded from memory agnes recommended for just a doctor recommended for ambrose be necessary expense heavy doubt unavoidable have come out second class lived on fifth floor also really seemed providential resident chaplain at davos have be taken ill fortnight ago canon alington saying that have gone back to own curate day have taken place at current stipend have preached last sunday taking for text oh ye ice snow bless ye lord hugh to own malicious satisfaction have guessed what text must be indeed betted on subject with peggy have bet on oh ye mountain hill before be given out won five franc put in offertory so ambrose retired into corner to practise for test soon peggy returned on majestic outside back too saw difference in hugh morning almost solemn joy over ambrose conversation rang true for cream of be said hugh that for year year admirable dick have swaggered to about skating because see there have be frost in england oh perhaps be unfair because first day came out here paraded rink doing what think called dutch roll anyhow foot be on ice simultaneously nobody be very much struck here prefer skating on one foot at time see so foolish peggy gave long sigh oh ice snow exclaimed beg pardon go on well since then ice snow have be practising for he worth in sequestered corner doubt if think about parish affair at dream of life be to get into english club will come up a soon a have slightest chance of passing if not before feel convinced that have conveyed to ambrose that be unnecessary expense ambrose have told that thought of arent divine peggy got up at once will go talk to ambrose instantly said find out whether father did convey impression know can be diplomatic remarked hugh returned in few minute yes be so said ice snow alluded to expense said that english rink be not so good a public one oh hugh if only go up for test after at moment hugh forgot forgot peggy forgot fatal hour of half past twelve for somebody waved to from snow bank bounded rink clambered awkwardly up wooden step stamped way along frozen snow ah be good cried be very best youve walked way be not tired be sure be not tired not bit ive enjoyed oh nearly half past twelve be so agitated must get through wheres peggy peggy have followed hugh to edge of ice oh edith how splendid cried be just in time to see ploughed get chair hugh on edge of rink oh here daisy daisy little fiend if pas dont will stop allowance for month agitating half hour followed daisy to do justice be if possible more anxious that mother must pas than be peggy having acquitted triumphantly before judge sailed through test endured agony of anxiety a peggy wobbled when must have be firm grim determination of face never varied still looked skyward eventually effort of week perseverance robert bruce spider might have envied be crowned hugh emerged victorious ah how good be edith felt to see others really taking wild interest in little thing again how good also to take vitally eagerly constituted a be be like moment good news came about be nearest heart must behave in perfectly childish manner treat skating episode for very reason have be given at length a if eternal salvation be on tap at english rink to through much tribulation peggy hugh have be admitted there be make believe about to day if before peggy hugh while rested aching limb found rest for ache of heart to day there be ache neither in heart limb be forgotten in sun of ediths improvement immense incredible improvement hugh whispered to over over again a waited for lunch to arrive from house in same breath a be natural to youth told about deep machination of dick assumption of ambrose then there founded ambrose club far away too at corner of public common lower rink canon manly form must be discerned diligently circling till hugh must bear no longer left edith ostensibly to ask to join at lunch in reality to patronise ambrose be looking at father in deepest admiration latter just a hugh came up having made sudden involuntary change of edge thing have be trying to do voluntarily for day exclaimed ah thats ambrose thats what be asking to show why here hugh well hugh joining again down here not quite fit for olympian yet hugh must not resist little swagger be exalted oh got through quite quite easily said of in fact peggy daisy expect ambrose will get through next be deep be almost fiendish hugh knew brother in law be practising till sleep forsook at night dick thought that be equally aware that hugh must have notion of since ambrose so properly have mentioned to conversation about expense that child have already held with hugh canon alington showed eager interest in ambrose tell have be good enough to promise to pay subscription if pass said come ambrose show hugh what can do ambrose must not do anything at father knew so dick with eye on hugh showed what have to be done displayed completely accurate knowledge of what test be be strange since did not contemplate going in for practical idea how to skate in fact be rather sketchy hugh hugged in silence so often have dick told exactly how sort of complicated manuvres have to be done so often have wished that frost might hold in order that must have day skating with hugh just put in way of hugh liked brother in law better for have humbugged beautiful word about skating be human ambrose have humbugged too about originality of idea that question of expense only stood between dick higher rink hugh did not feel marked sympathy with humbug be much in sympathy with anything proved that ambrose be human too back cross roll now continued dick still addressing son must cross foot well began to illustrate ah toe caught then said see idea foot well behind well across hm must have bit taken off toe there thats better isnt hugh must do for olympian wouldnt think be hardest part of test hugh have not yet asked brother in law to lunch with simply must not interrupt yet did not know dick must be so gorgeous led on yes thats ripping said why didnt come be judged with morning oh forgot dont want to join english rink yes awfully good that be dick walked straight into trap then there be three isnt there on foot asked left foot bother rather will just look executed in slightly diffuse manner must pas do think asked trap closed behind think want little more practice said hugh when be going to come up thought about tuesday next said dick completely off guard oh must think must be right by then by way do come lunch with edith ambrose too of course sort of festal occasion see a peggy have passed daisy said ambrose hated people to not think of other people oh everyone knew that daisy must pas said hugh thank offering be for aunt peggy let go think peggy have asked whole population to lunch know have there probably wont be enough to eat dick suddenly started forward on left foot just look moment hugh said made beautiful turn severe unbending edge after will go up for test on monday said with noble courage ah by way slip slide gloom glance how must do for motto of skating club will certainly form skating club when get back to mannington will be there to coach beginner hope think frequent fall must be better motto said hugh festal occasion be extraordinarily festive whole population a hugh have said appeared to have be invited whole population came spring origin of enjoyment of everyone be huge enjoyment of peggy hugh spring of enjoyment sat at head of table be better better much better incredibly better be wonder that mirth abounded for mirth be more infectious than disease hugh peggy scattered have passed test sun shone be hotter now than have ever be great frost be coming to night made day so beautiful edith be better incredibly better always came back to that be from that that mirth sprang edith there sat pleasant fine le boisterous than husband sister happy beyond word saw now difference have come to hugh for day day have be uniformly cheerful uniformly boyish with pleasure in snow with pleasure in contrivance for limb breaking never have be like when be silent be rare sparkled when spoke shone knew well what have caused that not skating not anything else how well have acted too through week again again a when wrote to peggy have believed be enjoying not making best of exile here actively taking real pleasure in to day there be huge difference be glad because be glad not because wished to appear glad peggy too making sea sick passenger out of orange to day amused yesterday have done must have be to amuse other people what difference there above beneficent sun round for lunched in little island of shelter clean powdery snow frozen hard just on surface millimetre below not wet slushy a be manner of more temperate stuff like sawdust dry from cold there be heat of summer too in sun ray blaze of tropic blueness of south italy yet round be untainted purity of frost blood brain have here ideal environment be hot frosty shakespeare paradox be literally fulfilled everyone be swift pleased animated fog of brain temper be thing a far a forgotten a atmospheric counterpart anything clogged confused sens be non existent incredible one must mix with element breathe be edith looked round table a finished coffee everyone be pleased happy tragic mask in life even a in greek ba relief be strung side by side with mask of comedy seemed to have slipped from place kind warm world showed only smiling shining side have come out of very dark lonely valley in spite of hugh have be lonely though knew well there lay many mile of valley in front of still yet ground be mounting at place in journey at have arrived to day there be so to speak cleft in wall of rock have shut in for week huge beam of dusty sunlight came in warming gladdening went back alone to house when lunch be over in sledge have come for forbidding hugh peggy to accompany even refusing with thanks ambrose offer to come up with for wanted to be alone just a when sir thomas have first told sentence have to be alone to think that over to scrutinise face of future till became familiar part of so quietly so honestly have done that that news have reached to day much better incredibly better have got to be made familiar too lay down on sofa in balcony where up till now more than half of life at davos have be passed be little tired little excited by first long outing for while lay very quiet closing eye of mind a be resting round be innumerable contrivance of invalid life electric bell on arm of chair so that must summon nurse without moving adjustable shutter on side of balcony so that wind sun must be screened from small cross over table must be balanced on arm of couch so that must write elbowed bookstand must be pushed away brought in front of slowly a let mind dwell on great news of to day thing so familiar from long continuous use somehow seemed to fade become meaningless portion of past even a when see first snowdrop so bravely so weakly aspiring piercing cold brown earth promising spring dead leaf of last autumn suddenly become without significance to death of winter that foreboded be over winter be forgotten be just so with now invalid contrivance suddenly turned to leaf have be shed before winter real summer be coming now nearly two year ago indian summer have come to crown early wreck autumn of life what must be revivification after winter of week have succeeded edith suddenly felt pulse leap quiver in wrist in throat with wonder excitement of with faculty invalid develop took mind off went back to past instead of peering further into tremulous luminous future on first day that knew of disease have intended determined to live to put thought of death away to set mind on recovery now when have gone so far incredibly better on road must look back see how far how often have fallen short of purpose shook head over misdeed have always intended well how often best have be sorry performance have so often lain like mere log under fatigue despondency yet indeed have only lain like log when felt absolutely incapable of doing otherwise be use arguing about excusing like have failed often often there be one who have never failed hugh have often be odious detestable to fretful indeed have never ceased trying to be otherwise except when so seemed power of volition have failed have always understood in mind have never be who be fretful be only insect suddenly hammering pulse have grown quieter still did not look toward future again be business indeed have none other immediate to get well through week have encouraged always to occupy in quiet way rather than lie here without employment except when be definitely resting in addition to innumerable book have read endless game of picquet have played with hugh played nominally for sovereign point being understood money be to pas have lost nine thousand seven hundred pound on balance have worked at play with extreme content have despaired of ever bringing to birth hugh have said be not by andrew robb at have agreed with so when invalid life began have destroyed what be done of have set to work again two act have be re written now instead of indulging in further speculation took up read have not touched play at since peggy now three week ago have come out to switzerland hoped to be able to read with detachment from feeling of authorship only lapse of time can give mere reading reminded too acutely of circumstance under wrote reminded too much of sway of insect must not manage alone hugh peggy if cared must read aloud after dinner be insecticide insecticide fell in with suggestion that evening hugh read to peggy sometimes found rather hard to control voice sometimes peggy blew nose after last page be turned sat silent little andrew robb again said hugh at length genuine andrew robb only have improved oh edith now be so much better do be diligent do other act have plenty of time know peggy turned to edith hope youll never finish said hugh doesnt understand andrew robb be born out of misery oh let play that silly game where mustnt take knave chapter xvii spire of davos church so steep in pitch that even in mid winter snowflake must cling to even for moment space in must lie there give consolidation to next flake be to day grayer than surroundings for week past annual thaw have set in now village couple of hundred foot of hillside above be quite clear of snow spring be not behaving so hugh thought a sat on pine bole above valley in tennysonian manner when last long streak of snow fade maze of quick ought to bourgeon what maze of quick in term of flower leaf be did not accurately know be safe in saying that nothing of description be bourgeoning nothing looked like bourgeoning unless to bourgeon be to look flat stale dead three month have gone since glorious day when peggy daisy have passed test for english rink be now mid april have be down morning to get little skating until week ago when short grass below last little patch of ice have begun to show through surface intended to skate on when happened be no longer use to pretend to edith that be going to skate must be on rink whole morning for time excuse of enjoyable occupation have served often have sat there since ice be unskateable being decaying slush merely in order to spend few hour away from house in order to make believe that be still occupied when ice finally vanished have to make other reason for absence there be heart break here longed only to be with on other hand longed only that must be amusing taking up long hour of increasing day in congenial pursuit in pursuance of rgime have to stop at davos take slow walk still lie out on balcony looking no longer at exhilarating field of snow at brown drowsy landscape of spring have often entreated to go back to england for few week to see friend to hear music to take little jaunt little holiday a called a often have clung to fact that really cared more about skating than anything else have done well enough till about week ago then have observed that rink be more than brown pasturage for abstemiously minded cattle other thing big thing troubled also doctor report continued to be fairly satisfactory told that be quite unreasonable to expect that immensely rapid improvement edith have recorded in winter must possibly keep up at rate must not be did not say that have gone back be satisfactory during last three four week have not frankly gone forward be quite normal consumptive behaved like also must remember that spring even for in good health be always trying season of year who be not in good health felt much more acutely there have be great deal of south wind too lately moist relaxing tiring be reasonable to hope to expect that when weather improved must continue to improve also be not bad news anything like hugh realised a sat on red bole of fallen pine watching blue smoke of cigarette hang in relaxed air even a below smoke from chimney of village stood in layer line above house unable to disperse that fault have be in expecting too rapid improvement indeed have secret cause for disquiet though disease so be professionally assured have made further inroad physically be becoming daily more trying to edith for two month more in past winter have be extraordinarily serene happy content even hugh must have said for last week fibre nerve of told so have be engaged in mental conflict fiercer than physical struggle must be more wearing more incessant have hardly ever spoken of to once twice have said oh hughie be so hard to behave decently very reticence showed how mortal struggle be have be le fierce must have spoken of be bitterly disappointed at cessation in own improvement have come to believe that be going to have miraculously rapid cure now pendulum have swung other way instead of looking forward eagerly into future be must do to bear present hugh must guess how dreadful too be disappointment despair felt at being unable to rise above discomfort fatigue of hour have hoped so gallantly that mind soul must remain thing apart from body superior to looking down on a from mountain top one look incuriously on wreath snake of fog below can not cloud upper sunshine have expected impossible gallant womanhood must do have done a said to peggy must always do best hugh knew how excellent best have be poor soul mourned over upbraiding in be not perfect again be found that davos did not at suit baby couple of month ago boy have be sent back to england to be in peggys care have be ailing too be nothing serious edith be not in state to be saddled with extra weight oh be hard be not lightest part of burden have to be borne fell on hugh though did not know that often again a in first week presence seemed merely to irritate edith must see with swelling throat nearly choked how great effort be to sometimes to be courteous even to hugh be christian scientist in general term believed that disease be work of devil devil stupid fellow not hit upon extraordinarily ingenious device have in fact hit upon one just because edith so loved husband found that be of world who tried most time real self be longing even while tongue perhaps be being acidly courteous simply to weep out heart on breast saying hughie hughie understand dont find perfection crown of life there did understand there lay helpless pathos of non existent barrier separated time too be hughs business to be cheerful to be natural foolish boyish again be not easy when did said appeared to be wrong there be respite cheerful contented spirit a mr micawber said have to be kept up then oasis in wilderness sometimes golden day fluttered down edith must be better more than once contrite humbled to dust a viewed last week from le tortured standpoint must only mutely plead forgiveness there be nothing to forgive nothing at least except little insect hugh have more intention of forgiving than of forgiving devil for trouble have made in world must have be so pleasant if have only died before be born in rift in cloud one have come yesterday

be sort of person who be happy whistling everywhere have be extraordinarily cheerful month cheerfulness have seemed so effortless too that now in blackest hour have ever known told be effortless did not really care saw that now for one moment edith turned off flow of meditation asked if be going mad have gone mad decided however that be only being clear sighted making discovery yet somewhere deep down in in spite of darkness of wave of misery be going over head deep water be drowning there burned little flame by saw at least infinitesimal fraction of saw that be thinking wild wicked nonsense rest of tired tortured brain told that be thinking sense then little flame went out too for moment believed be true authentic hell more real than theologian have invented for be quite alone there be nobody here except balcony where have be lying ran round two side of house drawing room dining room on side hughs bedroom on other opened on to got up alone in hell walked quietly up down once twice

straight through be not alone more there be hell more then scalding tear rose to eye tear from self be banished be utterly for whom loved so whom in thought have wronged so soon doubt there must be shame humiliation in not yet just said oh hughie hughie fell on knee by bedside like two child who have lost other in dismal dark forest when night be coming on found other again there be need of word at first edith did not ask why be cry for knew did not ask why have come to for knew that needed be why came then soon still kneeling there confessed to blackness of thought heard tell that be not be true too hugh anyhow utterly believed be absolutely that mattered there be more still to tell though morning edith have planned not to tell hugh yet now knew to be impossible not to tell for have known then knew now be not only care solicitude for bade be silent also pride what came nearest that same thing that ever again through week have made gateless barrier between same thing have made say that must bear anything pity be consistent with be fine high about that must be intolerant of pity of world of pity of friend even of peggy even that must hold head up even when worst hour be on must be polite considerate of nurse of servant of who did not matter there be one pity must not hurt hughs be right to know knew have better tell now there must never more be concealment between have gone out on balcony again for must not stop long in room then told gray still world be round gray still sky overhead everything spoke of moment of stagnation when life languid with winter halt unable yet to make first effort of regeneration in effort of regeneration be made a told knew content knew that have happened might happen own shortcoming lapse of courage be nothing be unable to live exist on plane where love dwelt where hugh dwelt have thought though now have only incredulous smile for thought that there have even be barrier between there be more have to say to dear said have nothing to be ashamed of in for indeed be not fault hughie there be thing doctor told morning asked not to tell will tell just heart be weak doe not recommend to stop much longer here air be too stimulating hugh looked imploringly at be worse said told be rather weak yet winter seemed to suit so well be use concealing thing then deliberately of purpose turned round on sofa looked straight in front of away from by unerring instinct knew that must be left alone with little while till became familiar to a looked out over gray brown field below across to black pine of hillside opposite there be nothing sad in face be more than patient be content even for nothing must stand against alchemy of love turned to gold already have turned own meanness smallness to gold to be far easier then felt hughs head rest on hers looked at smiled at though smile be tremulous quivered be there yes said well hughie be difficulty said stupid lung of mine want dry exhilarating air will strike absurd heart of mine want slack languid air where doesnt feel compelled to work so hard one doesnt quite know where such air be to be found a will suit again waited till sank in purposely told worst first what followed be rather better now there be chance said that before winter come again when air here be most stimulating lung may be so much better can safely go to much lower place go to england even lead very out door life so give heart chance stopping here depends on how behaves if go from from bad to worse will have to go on other hand perhaps wont perhaps lung will begin to get better again so that can go without hurting thats situation be rather like flying fish be supposed to die in water cant live on land isnt nuisance isnt fault darling asked said have be model patient there respect please oh edith real edith have come back to have not known how dreadful absence of serenity big outlook have be till came back now bigger serener than ever be scarcely possible to be sad in presence of sunlit calm heart bowed down not in grief regret in adoration bitter tear doubt must come sorrow to heartrending not just now edith paused moment in autumn have strung up to highest optimism have be determined to get well looked in other direction still wanted to still must leave undone effort must conduce to situation have changed have to regard possibility hugh have to regard too bitterness of be already past if looked there together supposing heart doe get worse hughie said in interval lung dont get better what will do asked dr harris what recommended talked quite openly about see be one thing to be cured be quite just to prolong life said something about long sea voyage asked if be cure prolongation be prolongation now hate sea hate ship be sea sick cant bear being cooped up do think be worth while personally dont if do say so will voyage madly round earth for a long a wish if meant cure must insist on doing for sake make mistake about if one be not going to get better be worth be so dreadfully uncomfortable must sit in dentist chair for minute if knew that be going to die a soon a got up wouldnt wouldnt wish to think be cowardly to cling to life under outrageous condition hugh hid face in hand moment glory of great calm still encompassed no said at length dont think ah heart what do think about indeed how can settle do see what be asking settle welcome because wish edith gave great sigh of relief ah then if have to leave davos said let go home down to mannington lie there wait with thing round have become part of may said might settle hugh so will edith knew there be more to say that in fact have charged peggy to tell hugh in case did not now though opportunity be there though be actually talking of aspect of illness did not now that barrier fictitious seeming solid have be withdrawn hugh be so much own again none others must not see in other setting possessing possessed by other hers be hers by inalienable right of love once once again tried to speak of must not since must not asked leave for subject to withdraw have nothing else to say about dear hughie said because there be very little ever to say about anything really matter like like just wanted to know whether must let go home quietly live little le long perhaps not want to drag wearily about world living life be life be so feeble mere continuance of life if life mean nothing except mere

if not do let leave side of future until such time come a make necessary for to look at closer hope wont come dont be no longer use to pretend may not so will count up to ten slowly if dont say anything till have finished must hold peace until until thing be much more serious looking at counted at six paused for must not get on be not long before seven be said other three number followed by immutable law seem to govern fiction ought to have have series of pathetic heart breaking soul inspiring scene during next week impossible hero heroine have nothing of kind instead of culminating poetry of sunset evening star have prose be good prose of midday what have happened what knew might happen did not make in least melodramatic instead expunged possibility of melodrama for melodramatist be self conscious see a wish to appear hugh edith wished to appear at did not wish to take part like plain simple people stood there hand in hand to take what god be sending simply plainly be happy too be not implied that must not have wished thing to be utterly different from what be faced thing be must have be much more strange if have not be happy for have refused to admit life mere continuance of death into chamber of love little flower like joy of world small pleasure of sense common thing of day be admitted there be still good to be hungry have dinner to be sleepy go to bed to smell odour of pine to hear whisper of sea to mark timid uprising of first crocus of spring little thing found easy access to hall of love while death mere death chattered impotently on threshold be told be not at home best of wearing transitional day between winter spring passed romance perennial wonder of renewal of nature began to unfold before enchanted eye spirit of life have lain dormant hibernating through winter like soft furry bright eyed creature of wood began to stir wake million crocus be opening of eye smile on mouth be flush of green came up in point of tender grass through gray rubbish of withered autumn bird knew that life be waking again preened thinking of mating time nest in safe swaying tree by night in shadow of wood shy beast began to prowl again stir whisper of spring broke long silence of winter in very sky after frozen brilliance of frost white fleecy cloud seemed to rustle a sailed across blue even a shadow whispered a passed over earth spring entered into heart brain of men scheme new hope awoke went more briskly about business a golden day succeeded golden day edith again made progress fought more vigorously with foe again did more than stay advance making retreat hughs birthday came on last day of month for past fortnight during have be progressing favourably have racked brain to think of suitable present for have also racked brain to find reason must make go to england for few week see friend refresh generally have tried many such without bringing conviction to have told that selfishly for own sake longed for to go to mannington see how looked nobody else must bring real report of for only besides knew what mannington meant peggy sometimes wrote of peggy said looked charming that river be full that beech be beginning to come out be futile did not mean anything then again one day hugh have toothache implored just to run over to london get teeth looked at instead with rueful face indeed went down to village have offending tooth pulled out by cabinet maker with strong wrist eventually hit on plan combining birthday present with lure to lead home wrote to messrs thomas cook from whom day before birthday received small packet in neat green cloth cover went through content yes be right first class davos to sargans to zurich to ble to paris to calais boulogne how thoughtful of mr cook to dover folkestone to london also london to mannington return available for thirty day from date of issue only thirty have meant to say forty five must start without delay slipped packet into envelope sealed

in with hard convincing sight of ticket before evening before must not help alluding to fact that have present for couldnt think of one for ever so long said thought at last of one thing really wanted oh want to guess may guess yes a long a like will say whether guess right wrong will like asked hugh edith considered yes very much indeed said will also be extremely good for anything to do with england asked hugh with horrible acuteness edith have said before that trip to england must do good also that must like nothing whatever said with unconcern put off scent with really solid lie to credit in book of doom retreated from subject masking retreat by continued appeal to to go away even if only for week two until from persistence on subject be no longer possible to suspect that present have anything to do with england before edith went to bed after picquet be finished hugh always have little good night talk during week of estrangement for seemed now no le than have come to so abrupt end few week ago be absence if attempted complete failure of good night talk that have missed almost more than anything edith now alluded to day with great frankness a devil day exactly expressed what meant to night announced that good night talk must be few word only for be gloriously sleepy without being tired ideal state of thing few word however be carefully directed toward morrow if thing went on a hoped conceivably might there must be no good night talk to morrow oh ive have such good day hughie said that make three week of good day now have lasted longer than devil day do know devil day seemed longer think april be over oh to be in england next april perhaps think daffodil weather daffodil in copse looking like sparkle of sun on green water oh why be so selfish in stopping here when might go back look at tell about poor peggy once said that liked double daffodil best prayed for especially that night hugh laughed like best said be why ought to go back since wish said leave alone asked not very likely im afraid isnt think do know have soured nature dont want to have anybody else here want to have pleasure of getting better again in way be doing to myself even if peggy be here even peggy must have to share with there depth of depravity dont want to share with wish must go away let give surprise when came back thats what really want want to walk up path after absence say hullo who be blooming young person why wife hugh must be such awful fun now be going to bed subject be closed if wont go wont good night darling yes hand only please at respectful distance edith be delighted with diplomacy thought how clever be a went to bed be clear to at once that fact that have said subject be definitely dismissed have effect on hugh hitherto have always dismissed feeling certain that must re open have evidently made impression on to know that must not to morrow must receive present oh be good chance received letter next morning a usual man dumped down on bed said be half past eight a usual hugh said oh rot felt for there happened to be only one rather fat in lazy morning manner looked at address before opening there be for dear hugh on birthday with best wish to be taken immediately tore open envelope have sealed with ingenious completeness still not guessing then saw neat little green cover servant be pouring out bath oh just leave said hugh ask mr grainger maid to ask if can see moment be ungrammatical intelligible ediths plan have have only one defect that on safe side have thought that must think over only thought that instantaneously of good night talk here be present put on big fur coat did duty a dressinggown went to room breakfast be already come be sitting up in bed bright eyed refreshed with sleep oh hughie how nice of to come to see early on birthday said wicked woman said hugh why for instance because hit below belt because appealed to sentiment last night because knocked down with kick morning isnt

have made birthday present to thanks thanks most awfully chapter xviii canon alington be sitting opposite wife telling mr owen about outside edge ambrose perpetua have be reading book while elder dined at mention of outside edge looked up keeping thin little forefinger in place ambrose knew about outside edge too from davos have repeatedly written to perpetua about form form said dick anyone can do thing difficulty be to do rightly have much to learn yet sentiment be humble true tone be bitter canon alington have not got over recollection of morning at davos when attempted to gain admittance to english skating club since fatal day there have be severe frost in wiltshire have started mannington skating club have be assiduous instructor aspirant who wished to skate in particular roped off piece of ice have to pas test ambrose have passed there be need for to pas since be judge who decided whether others must do so be rather strict judge insisted on form ambrose chipped in oh mr owen said papa skated better than anybody at davos used to watch rather than skate wasnt shame canon alington interrupted son be better that disclosure must come from olympian must have none of said hugh passed lady rye passed even daisy passed ambrose be poor relation have have dont think that damage skate still davos be rather cliquey place given return of good old english winter can see mannington rivalling swiss resort once back forward forward inside eh ambrose mr owen wrung hand be in manner of peal of bell that did pulled finger in turn will never never forget seeing skate canon alington said so swift so commanding doe mr hugh skate well too making of skater said canon want perhaps little more coaching freedom perhaps little freedom be lacking thought didnt skate nearly so well a papa said ambrose shrilly thought nobody skated so well a papa door underneath motto sat down to eat drink opened hugh supposed to be at davos came in apologise said found hadnt received telegram at chalkpit there be nothing to eat wanted something how be agnes do give cold beef made salutation mr grainger edith asked brother in law have always alluded to like since dreadful day of nelson letter mr grainger marked moral difference that there be between edith showed that blood though there wasnt be thicker than water hugh however be not trained to nicety oh didnt know said though after how must shes at davos still getting on awfully well again came away for jaunt ambrose never went wrong according to true standard oh uncle hugh said did leave aunt edith there alone even light on spectacle looked incredulous hugh became flippant yes want to go out to keep company said a ran away canon alington a be so often told have infinite tact saw at once that something dreadful must have happened everyone indeed except perhaps perpetua saw changed subject with great address be advantage of being man of world for there be situation in did not feel equal to grappling with if necessary throwing subject have to be changed easily naturally changed ought to have come back two month ago hugh said have instructed in davos style borrowed reflected light from have three week skating after returned think may say that standard form in part be improved mr owen be thrilled to acute active mind whole situation be apparent hugh have appeared suddenly in mannington without wife without having let even sister know be coming said be better be going on excellently something disagreeable rejoiced to think must have happened might only be temporary affair quarrel of importance in case hugh must hardly have come back suddenly like without word to anybody agnes too be looking awkward distressed how full of bitterness be hughs remark to ambrose that edith wanted to go out keep company evidently also canon alington have come to same conclusion for there be mistaking point of masterly way in changed conversation what tact if everyone behaved so beautifully there must never be scandal at felt that imperfection of world have consoling point dinner be already far advanced plate of something have be brought for hugh be eating with what seemed like appetite mr owen knew better be pretence of appetite probably have heard of before besides people who be going to be hung at be often ate excellent breakfast hugh so to speak have be hung forty eight hour ago so be le remarkable feat for life of must not guess for certain to own satisfaction what have happened month ago when canon alington have returned have announced incredibly swift recovery of sister in law meaning agness sister in law have expressed grave cheerful doubt whether have ever suffered from consumption at will be well by may have said be may now oh yes there be something below card poisonous provincial mind promised treat of kind already be saying to herself that never have liked grainger there be limitation clause here might still be devoted to grainger if estrangement whatever be be not disgraceful especially if be confided in if knew first determined to do very best to know first that made lot of difference perhaps hugh must confide in if showed how understanding how sympathetic how womanly in best sense of word be dear mr hugh said how have missed dear wife mannington have not be mannington without will soon rejoin here trust oh said hugh will be at davos at least hope so summer to mind of real scandal monger remark be innocent trained vision can find concealment equivocation everywhere at least hope so what did mean looked a if did not know wife movement did not care perhaps hughs innocence appeared probable to poisonous mind case began to look grave against edith mr owen began to recollect also that have never liked that mr grainger who have always held so much aloof wonder to broad minded view innocent must never suffer with guilty hugh must not lose friend a far a be concerned be here for time hugh asked sister hardly know said depends on other people on circumstance will ask people to come down here if wont if wont echoed mr owen to herself will go away cant live at chalkpit alone same must be very busy must fish ride have to practise too a have long engagement at covent garden in summer edith begged not to give up of course may have to mr owen suspicion grew darker be sure edith have done something dreadful how gallant hugh be about be sure must have behaved just like if opportunity have come in way never have thought that hugh be almost certain to confide in after dinner usual curriculum be to be expected ambrose perpetua since mr owen be here be to sit up to hear sing one song after must go to bed when since there be four present others must play bridge for usual stake be bean four player be given little bag of dried bean two hundred in number at end of rubber canon alington always said now for reckoning day paid opponent dividing point by ten bean have won paid bean have lost at end of play counted up bean announced total there be congratulation to fortunate winner condolence for loser bean be then recounted put away in bag out of have be taken bridge be far too good game such be pronouncement of canon alington to make necessary to play for stake to night added might a well skate for stake eh hugh hugh privately thought that brother in law have much better not so only said quite so to night however there be little delay in beginning curriculum for mr owen at first positively refused to sing at unless hugh stopped ear for darent abated hard condition consented to give bit of galahad diary if hugh must sing afterward so sang famous second adventure while agnes closed eye because listened best so canon beat time with paper knife ambrose perpetua turned over face glued to music after though marching order have be issued for be allowed to stop hear uncle hugh perform be rather handicap in house to sing after mr owen bridge be unusually exciting that night because of wonderful winning power of mr owen have not be that revoked once in trump probably rest of world must have be bankrupt what canon alington called gold reserve meaning bag of bean must have have to be put into circulation in order to enable game to proceed made too quite right remark when on finding be four hundred twenty eight to good said how dreadful if have be playing for money then since inexorable hour of half past ten have arrived gathered up music put on golosh for little walk be so pleasant after exciting game started home under hughs escort for house lay between chalkpit vicarage be exactly what wanted must see if womanliness must not lead to confidence treat to hear sing mr hugh said a set off such pleasure to know that perhaps may hear in town again think there be still chance of course must depend on wife said mr owen gave great sigh said nothing for moment then star gave inspiration have given same to galahad when said good night how peaceful starlight be observed make one see how infinitesimal own trouble be when one see immensity of space hughs reply be bitter oh be sure be bitter oh do think make much difference to toothache if remember that sirius be billion billion of mile away asked mr owen nearly laid touch of fairy hand on arm probably must quite have done so if be not holding up dress poor mr hugh said softly hugh be rather touched did not like companion there be something genuine in simplicity of thanks said have come to mr owen gate by time stopped moment if can do anything will tell will not said if people ask why have come back alone what will say why have come back for few week to see friend said yes see yes good night hugh walked on hundred yard pondering little over rather cryptic sentence thinking mainly of davos then sudden thought struck moment really took shape laughed at there be limit to absurdity even of people who have thought ediths paper on newly discovered nelson letter unfit for digestion of literific be daffodil weather next day spent delightful morning noting down what knew edith must care to hear about seeing with eye a far a must hearing with delicate sense till mid day thereabout prowled round garden up on to down where have

thanks dreadful silence mr owen told that errand have not be in vain a matter of fact did not know what seed be did be determined however that must begin be only right began how did think hugh grainger be looking asked be most surprised at suddenly appearing like did look to well happy mr owen be nothing if not simple said canon alington put on coat can give ten minute asked can never forget agnes service did about dreadful nelson letter if people do one service one turn to again so consult turn to why have hugh come back like why have left wife in davos mr owen be at davos be one of sad thing of life a poet gray have remarked that so many flower blush unseen waste sweetness on desert air be much sadder to think how many flower of humour do same owing to lack of subtle quality in audience mr owen saw nothing in least humorous in fact that canon alington agnes have on bare fact of hughs return built whole tragedy have conception how ludicrous pompous companion be being only thought be striving to be helpful never entered head even that be following up with sort of ghoulish gusto for scandal that if surmise proved to be completely unwarranted must heave sigh of relief in reality be much disappointed instead of realising only clasped hand together turned eye upward will sacrifice day if can help in dreadful business said tacitly answering canon alingtons question feeling already quite sure that mr grainger be no longer at davos remembered too position of davos on map of europe be not so very far from italian lake where sort of dreadful thing constantly occurred for one fleeting moment glimmering of common sense flashed across canon alington do think be drawing conclusion from insufficient data asked thought have never entered mr owen head said so then there be one thing to be done said canon alington be to go straight to poor hugh put at disposal to help in way can perhaps if convince that be only object will tell what mean may be only passing misunderstanding in case ought to go back to wife at once may be worse than be culprit be agreed on sole purpose to help joint action before in case of nelson letter have be crowned with such marvellous success that be soon agreed that must act in concert again canon alington be true have not quite forgotten yet few stinging moment when hugh sat on stile on way back to church have withdrawn word apologised very evening in truly christian spirit brother in law therefore considered now that word have not be said be agreed too agnes at present at rate need not be mixed up in painful business without further delay two set off for chalkpit arrived soon after hugh have posted letter to edith from window saw approach saw solemn purpose on face time misguided interference if errand must prove to be excited in only wild hilarious merriment for moment hid face in sofa cushion shook then composed how right edith have be before how infinitely better be to be amused fully intended to extract utmost possible amusement out of must tell peggy time be shown in received very gravely hair be little disordered from explosion in sofa cushion mr owen thought looked very wild be kind of to come said sat down together a if by machinery very kind of to come repeated hugh devil must not have suggested to more fiendishly ingenious word be quite clear to visitor that knew why have come be true did mr owen writhed undulated toward have be settled that must speak first womanly touch be thing to begin with church must advise console dear mr hugh said only want to help be object if there be anything can do hugh bit tongue to stop sudden convulsion that nearly broke from be done so successfully that sounded like sob tell about dear fellow said canon alington take time must rather speak to alone to mr owen alone of said hugh know nothing yet said dick except there be something wrong so just relieve mind of worst anxiety first be still at davos hugh sat quite still moment have no longer slightest desire to laugh have imagined only that two idiot have thought that edith have have quarrel slowly meaning of question dawned on turned very red then very white just explain question little more said quickly where else must be why must be anywhere else then luckily for everybody sense of humour came to aid be most glorious thing that ever happened voice trembled over next question answer quickly said will burst did question imply that thought have run away left canon alington got up have better be going said to mr owen only came to try to help oh wait minute said hugh there be plenty of time occurred to then take be worst anxiety will remove at once that being disposed of suppose thought have quarrelled edith quarrelled dick never try to make joke a long a live will never never beat that reputation a humourist be secure dont spoil oh christmas then recollected sort of manner turned to mr owen be quite sure that meant most kindly said sacrificing vestige of truth have to stop in order to control voice dont think be rather hasty conclusion thanks awfully same thanks then must no longer check there came breaking point turned face to wall tried to bury in hand shriek of laughter burst forth through chink in finger be very sorry about manner have again gone to wind be perfectly powerless if people made such wonderful joke what be to do then after moment controlled turned to room again be empty so sat down laughed properly window be wide open a step of visitor crunched over gravel maniac yell cry besieged ear be rather red in face walked little way without speech then canon alington spoke ex cathedr be deeply thankful said that have cleared up with usual tact spoke at once of decoration in church for festival of easter still hughs laughter came to once mr owen whose hearing be remarkably acute thought heard shrill falsetto word be at davos oh h h have taken so much trouble to get intimate at chalkpit felt be thrown away now conclusion be perfectly just logical irrefutable that conclusion ought to be determined that must be grainger what pity though felt sure that there be so much in common between perhaps be premature to think of a grainger just yet what blessing anyhow that have be canon alington who have be spokesman have really done very stupidly perhaps with care might only result in being alingtons even before have reached home infinitesimal mind be a busy a bee over infinitesimal intrigue edith be under contract to telegraph to hugh at least once day to write a often a felt inclined for next week with peggy daisy in house day lacking presence that made day perfect came a near to perfection a might be telegram came with more than daily frequency thoroughly satisfactory content letter be daily also not long very often always happy always giving good account always bursting with satisfaction at success of writer diplomacy with regard to birthday present to day be full of mirth also for peggy have taken helpfulness of mannington in humorous spirit bade hugh look at postmark to make certain that edith be still at davos have insisted also on absurdity of there being breach between st olafs chalkpit with sweeping good nature inability to harbour resentment malice be so characteristic of have insisted on hughs at once asking mr mr owen vicar wife to dinner simultaneously must hold responsible for success of youve only got to be natural with people said theyll be natural too oh natural to mr owen to be affected to dick to be prig said hugh oh isnt thats only veneer will play beggar neighbour will see came peggy conquered mr owen a walked home in golosh thought that perhaps must be grainger alingtons dear grainger alingtons fishing have begun peggy at once saw that nothing else mattered fact that be dry fly work at present hardly knew one end of rod from other did not interfere at with determination to fish a matter of fact hooked trout who must have be mad on third day agitated so much that fell into river have to go home hugh however went on daisy stopped down with peggy toiled up to house wet skirt clinging to with almost touching fidelity impeding movement a only wet skirt can going through hall dropping shower of blessing a passed saw that mid day post have just come in there be pile for nothing for hugh except telegram so there be letter from edith to to day unless indeed have come by morning post be unusual however always arrived by second delivery yet there be telegram then quite suddenly causelessly peggy felt anxious became necessary to send telegram down to by river so that if there be bad news must get at once felt certain that did contain bad news longed for moment to open must not do so merely scribbled on outside send back to to read then went upstairs to change quarter of hour afterward be laughing at fear for have back opened to be given to contained word merely time to write yesterday lovely weather very busy so well peggy remained in room till lunch time answering post by degree grew troubled again what be edith so busy with there be nothing must make busy except play be andrew robb back again hugh a often happened when be fishing did not appear at luncheon hour peggy according to custom began alone still vague misgiving obsessed have in case to laugh at fear showed that fear though did not know what be be there through dining room window looking out on to gravel in front of house saw telegraph boy arrive on bicycle felt sure be second telegram for hugh again for sake of peace of mind must have to send down to at once again be completely wrong telegram be for be of importance whatever be easier to laugh at fear after still have to laugh at if did not reappeared finished lunch alone about now sun after cloudy morning dispersed encumbrance shone vigorously must make fishing impossible for afternoon hugh must soon be up from river with daisy ravenous for food then just a strolled out to have coffee outside in sun something further crunched gravel again be bicycle of telegraph boy took telegram from hand at front door feeling certain now after experience of false alarm in morning that be for again be wrong be for hugh so put on hall table inside merely waited for to come up from river be foreign telegram peggy sat down drank coffee wondering what have so upset true have fallen into river lost trout in consequence got very wet sense of calamity be over then suddenly be immensely reassured for figure of hugh daisy appeared coming up steep bank from water meadow oh mummy three fish shrieked daisy one be bigger than ever saw did landing net hugh too be grave be there letter from edith asked telegram have just come for didnt send down because expected to come immediately hugh paused beside three fish said isnt big one beauty peggy why be busy met eye saw causeless trouble in face on hall table said hugh went inside leaving landing net with three fish in on step in moment reappeared again with telegram in hand open said tell be wave of inexplicable communication have reached whatever be be borne here on wing of love love turned to so there be nothing to be frightened at took from opened read then leaned little forward toward put hand on arm yes dear said must go back to davos now mean oh hughie face be very bad not worst be very ill handed telegram go eat something hugh said will make arrangement will come with say what think be best will be ready a soon a be sensible dear go eat while look out train only must rather came with not took telegram read saw what be said will stop

in london at victoria station must be construed one way at dover must be construed way waiting at probability inclined toward victoria interpretation with wheel going swiftly round again thought dover interpretation might be right when in dim frosty hour before dawn awoke after short sleep just a train came into basle knew that two interpretation be one what came to be edith have attack of syncope failure of heart have rallied a soon a must be moved must be moved down to lower le stimulating air attack have taken place on morning must have written to when recovered sent telegram saying have not written because be so busy then second attack have come on second telegram be sent by doctor wheel of train made continuous throbbing punctuated beat a sped on between flower strewn pasture be conscious of little else pulsation just occasionally vivid flash of consciousness came over so that for moment sword of suspense pierced hot hand of sorrow lay heavy on head again for moment only be conscious of exquisite beauty of blossoming spring for most part mind be inert dull feeling no more than droning of wheel merely have to sit still be taken to davos must feel again when got there just now be no more than parcel sometimes for space wheel seemed like voice knew peggys for instance saying in staccato ridiculous sentence for ten minute at time must say tel e gram on hall table tel e gram on hall table daisy in childish treble must repeat did land ing net did land ing net sentence have heard just before reading of telegram again sometimes still to beat of labouring train very distant voice sang wheel never tuned to ediths voice time too below numbness apathy there be something of horror of own smallness of sense a under ansthetic of infinite distance kindly lovely thing of world be withdrawn landquart already must scarcely believe that have be more than hour two in train since basle journey have not seemed interminably long have seemed on contrary incredibly short have to change here get into light mountain railway must take up up home where be be home languor of spring hung heavy in valley before long a mounted cooler more vivid air began to stream down from austere height then be that magnet of home began to pull apathy dropped from felt realised on what journey have come patiently slowly train climbed up pas to wolf gang with own momentum dropped down into valley of davos there lay lake still reflecting without pine of hillside there lay quiet sunshine brooding serene luminous in dawn youth of year there above village stood roof wooden wall deep balcony of home be ten minute walk there from upper station left servant to look after luggage walked up little path between field that knew so well in serene peace came back to even a hurrying foot be taking back to did not know what expected except that be waiting for to come then while be yet couple of hundred yard from house saw figure of man coming down toward in moment saw be doctor meant to meet train dear boy said couldnt leave yes be better little better know be coming looked at hugh moment with quiet pitiful eye have be getting little stronger day said when left be asleep be best chance hugh nodded just to show understood may live said doctor mean may get over attack think will certainly live till see think that desire be stronger than death sometimes happens so will will know asked hugh thank forgot for coming to meet be very kind of held head high what wine be word to will certainly know said other be quite herself come in quietly entered hushed house by back door so that must not have to pas by room came on to balcony outside drawing room there be tea laid there two cup two plate wife ordered said doctor said to morning please have tea ready for hugh when come yes sit there quietly will come back soon hugh have bowed forward with face buried in hand freezing of grief anxiety apathy numbness passed from at little thing tiny intimate touch frost of sorrow be melted a tear rained sob choked kissed little cake be there be who dwelt in little sugared thing then that passed too reality of life together strengthened exalted edith have thought of poured out tea drank be a if sat by a if be one of dear ordinary day when have come in found a have so often found waiting to begin have often said to do begin tea if be late a often said oh like tea better when be there triviality of memory triviality of such incident be brought to level of to day did naturally what have done so often little thing be associated with lost littleness like golden thread ran through little big thing alike before very long doctor came out again to join told more for week before have be very much depressed to remedy that there be doubt that have unduly tired chiefly with writing that be doing play said finished four day ago be inside in drawing room wished to read morning after have finished have fainting fit not very serious in insisted on stopping in bed next day that day sent telegram must not write few hour afterward have worse attack telegraphed to then know that by way knew be coming doe know be here asked hugh be not sure about ten minute before met on path while be still with said suddenly oh have come then fell asleep hugh turned round in chair what do expect said what be best expect what be worst want to know doctor looked at silently moment mean what must wish for one loved in such case what must fear exactly that best be that may see talk to die be what think must be right to choose worst be that may get little better drag on for week perhaps even go back to england then there must be that long unwilling struggle to cling to life struggle be instinctive only doe not represent will desire then there be hope of real recovery hugh got up from chair walked across to window be drawing near to sunset snowpeaks opposite be already beginning to flame while down in valley below across to height opposite lay transparent darkening shadow of evening breeze stirred windless calm lay over meadow pine cloudless sky within too there be calm despair hopelessness might be in heart there be other bigger thing love imperishable memory of beautiful day after moment doctor rose too be going now said will be back later if must do good by waiting must of course wait know there be to be known if wake asks for may of course go to may go look at moment a sleep asked hugh yes go very quietly take shoe off hugh went up passage to where at far end bedroom door stood wide open so that might have air must be got yet though heart be inside room paused moment at door fearing what might be going to see dreading to look on what cruel hand of suffering mortal weakness have done next moment have conquered that went in fear be so groundless that no longer remembered that have feared lay without pillow so that head be level with body arm lay outside sheet a looked at face seemed to for moment that illness have gone through since autumn be dream so untroubled be sleep so calm natural whole look did not look ill even mouth smiled little with parted lip yet nurse be there apparatus of illness be there faint sweet smell of ether still hung little in room soon went back to sitting room at far end of house where have gone first with doctor there on table be lying manuscript have finished wished to read evening deep into night read be edith shining above doctor came went again immediately be still sleeping soon after night nurse have come on duty hugh went to bed for still slept there through calm starlit hour lay dozing little from time to time for most part lying with open eye looking out into night not restless very quiet room be on other side of house did not seem very long to before little change came over darkness high on mountain to west came little flush of colour top grew rosy down here in valley be still dark in heaven dawn have come have touched topmost snow then before mind told why have done so got out of bed next moment heard soft step outside tap at door felt have be waiting for be at door in moment in dressing gown have just woke said nurse want to see have rung up dr harris ought to come at once couple of candle be burning on table in room shielded from bed dawn be coming quickly there be scarce need for face be turned toward door a entered smiled at little rosy light be beginning to steal in through uncurtained window eye shone with oh hughie whispered knew have come thank god knelt down by bed taking hand in kissing kissing meine seele said meine seele yes darling oh hughie how beautiful have be how then wonderful change began to come over face dawn new life understood raised in bed triumphant radiant soul heart said aloud speaking quickly thank god for ah good bye hugh morning be
