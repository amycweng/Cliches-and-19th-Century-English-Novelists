serious never silent made periodical attempt to take tom in hand like most people who have tried to do so effort be not very successful tom have loafing in blood ambition did not run in line of tripos at same time be owing to that tom have not at present failed very signally in college examination for ted have succeeded in making work if not steadily at least intermittently tom fit of intermittent work have not be true occurred very often when did occur lasted sometimes for week of eight hour day left idler than ever from ted point of view widely supported seemingly rational one men came up to university partly at least to work that examination be criterion whereby success of nine term of residence be judged intermittent fit be better than nothing when be induced just before examination led to result though superficial be according to standard measured by tolerably satisfactory tom never professed to feel least interest in what be working at pressure must sometimes make work very vivid memory though one of short range enabled to reproduce result of week cramming tom influence over friend be of much more personal vital kind ted looked on to time when tom must go down leave a hoped to permanent university life with blankness formed few friendship have never be intimate with one before tom healthy out of door sort of mind coupled with artistic picturesque ability personal charm have

head over herodotus sat on cane backed chair at table while tom lolled in window seat poured out flood of desultory criticism on subject under sun at time markham gathered up book impatiently left room declaring that be impossible to do anything if tom be there after quarter of hour so always wished that tom must follow at end of hour usually went back finding that wish to be with be stronger than wish to get on with work tom apparently be quite unconscious of be always very fond of other in breezy out of door manner must always have preferred playing cricket with without friend to undivided company at home while markham have be conscious on several occasion of being glad when rained making cricket impossible making natural for tom to come to to be supplied with other amusement

conviction to other conviction in life two conviction be large allowance for average man be belief in classic ted have be brought up in same conviction at present have shown sign outward inward of departing from of nearest approach have have to abandoning be due to tom frank inability to find amusement interest in classic for markham recognizing undoubted ability must not quite dismiss opinion off hand father wish for son be that must be great christian apologist in order a matter of course fellow of college at time markham suspected that tom religion have greater place in interest than classic of knew nothing for nine young men out of ten talk about religion even if know about tom be emphatically not tenth ted left cambridge to go home two day before end of term for chesterford be

of being nice to people in railway carriage bus always go in bus in london dont even though only see for two minute want to be nice to everybody care immensely what one think of how can matter said ted people whom meet just for two minute have opportunity of judging form impression on perfectly superficial thing ah see sister formed unfavourable impression of excuse by saying be superficial ive

why did think just remember saying that talked about early celebration covering book for parish library a if be one same thing maud stood still for moment longer recalling scene then broke out into light laugh oh see see cried oh dear how funny have excuse for thinking be so wrong hasnt got picturesque mind im afraid saw whole picture of in life there so clearly can talk of madonna little italian landscape behind chair in one breath cant thought regarded a equally essential im so glad told that never take offence only profit by such thing if be true forget if be not there be atom of truth in although a say be wrong shooter be waiting when got up to for long narrow valley of stubble to be driven down ted maud got under shelter of same tall hedge separated field waited with markham went up to where tom be standing latter at once began talking in whisper about artistic beauty of drive if shoot be called barbarian explained thats so silly why drive be most beautiful thing there be first wait hearing nothing then hear little far away sound know be off then there come that flight of stupid sparrow small bird then silence again then there sudden rush through hedge perhaps out come hare then then mark over hear whistling of wing sound a if wanted oiling best of extraordinary ceasing of voluntary motion bird wing clap down to side know still go on a if be alive killed bird once be coming towards fell slap on knocked down neednt believe unless like there theyve started keep quiet teddy will happen just a said tom stepped little way back from hedge in order to get longer view

grinned maliciously missed eight bird morning in succession whispered then said to bob wrexham must see play lawn tennis look out there covey coming big lot approached tall hedge like stream caught sight of tom wheeled rapidly to centre two however turned little somersault in air fell thirty yard behind in stubble there did see asked tom reloading thats of thing like dropping match in cam came blazing over then there little pause thud im afraid poor uncle have missed again markham meditated yes see that really be rather nice there must be satisfaction in doing that of course pleasure lie in not being certain whether be going to hit not if always hit dont think must care about not so much at rate like gambling with enormous proportion of chance in favour if play well miss wrexham took almost a much interest in proceeding a shooter showed wish to go back until went home lord ramsden met with greater success towards end of afternoon returned in excellent spirit tom miss wrexham be walking little in front of others in answer to question of hers be saying what be going to do when left cambridge must be such blessing said to know for certain a do exactly what want to be to be able to be most people never know what want to be bob be going into army simply because cant think of anything else worst of most profession be that be only way of making money said tom artist clergyman be

naturally honest mean that when man doesnt owe compliment be use trying to pay one compliment be cheap way of paying debt be like apology always apologize if will do good maud walked on in silence little way if wasnt woman said at length very slowly must choose to be man not such nonsense a sound what really mean be that men have great advantage over in way woman can hardly ever become anything else than amateur want to be professional artist musician clergyman living in country wouldnt give up being woman woman have much more self than men else must have taken to profession long ago if men hadnt profession must bore to death be why take to stock exchange politics do anything to make forget own self dont say that woman be better find more interesting than men do men have to make money

living a be woman chief object be to marry rich man so that cant possibly work thats new idea said tom what be going to do with how do mean ought to marry poor man help to earn living unfortunately

of thing want refuse to buy have reached front door stood waiting for others one ought to be allowed to change circumstance with one friend said tom must choose ted markhams circumstance be poor be working at what like best just think how happy one must be success to mean fullest possible success position mean opportunity what do mean by opportunity why university press will consent to publish edition of classical author thats narrow remarked miss wrexham providence have spared that limitation thats what im always telling must be very comfortable to be narrow until know be narrow oh then become broad said tom thats nice too be pair of blighted being said miss wrexham solemnly have be made rich broad whereas only want to be poor narrow must like to be narrow if couldnt be broad said

after dinner before fire for october have started with early frost mr carlingford loathed cold weather often stopped indoors for two three week at time in winter dear boy replied dont object to anything about at present really find only satisfactory spot in satisfactory life there be only one thing must object to be if made fool of dont do tom many people when make fool of think that be being original whereas be doing what nine tenth of human race have done since beginning of world more than nine tenth probably adam eve made fool of so did cain abel abel particularly sculptor have such unlimited opportunity for making fool of in what way asked tom falling in love with model still worse marrying if be going to devil go to like gentleman then sculptor often wear long hair liberty fabric tie with gold ring round knew sculptor once who wore cameo ring if wear cameo ring will cut throat oh shant do of thing said tom confidently think be most probable that wont otherwise must make objection to being sculptor cant tell havent have many opportunity yet one can make fool of one self at cambridge if come to said tom not very easily public opinion be against whereas in most place fool constitute public opinion im glad of though be only putting off evil day little longer when be at cambridge boy made fool of earlier than do now for instance people get drunk much le change for better suppose dont know that generation will have gone through le dirt when be forty than did there come time to one when must decide definitely whether be going to make fool of not ive got very strong view about morality clever wrinkled old face beamed with amusement morality be just synonym for wisdom went on immorality be folly dont know anything about religious side of leave that to others professional know little about folly worst investment can make dont know that ever thought about at said tom frankly dont mean to be brute if can help there be such thing a brute said father there be only wise men fool chiefly fool man have to settle question for a to will be one go through life scot free of necessity of fighting inclination havent ever talked to before about because be use giving advice to young men worst thing of be to tell to think about such thing have to think about when time come till then best not to know best preparation be to lead healthy life think about cricket not to read white cross tract go to purity meeting tom rose from chair knocked out ash of pipe against chimney piece think youre wrong father said if one have aim in life everything give way to if one have principle one can not disregard sometimes principle interfere with interest remarked mr carlingford tom laughed idle men be vicious men said havent done stroke of work for ten year remarked father with amusement same havent be idle find plenty to do in watching other people there be one piece of advice must really like to give if find fall in love with unsuitable young person model probably send about business if too far gone for cut throat be probably fault probably wanted to fall in love with if see objection to cut mine cut own perhaps own be best be unpleasant doubt for moment be better than wishing moment for rest of life that have done one can always cut one throat besides isnt that making fool of one not at be consequence of having made fool of one tom frowned ah dont like people talking about consequence be talk of coward father laughed never mind tom said dont expect to agree with be vicious coward be not what mean be that can make best worst of bad job said tom when people talk of consequence seem to mean worst consequence when man have made mistake be stupid of to sit down say well be done now for consequence there be almost always choice of consequence very often there be consequence remarked father dont think ever did anything have consequence then never remember doing anything except making money when be going to marry tom asked suddenly tom looked startled when fall in love suppose said roundly thats man answer well boy im going to bed go to cambridge to morrow dont be going to do well in tripos must think very unlikely said tom seems that im fool thats reason why shouldnt do well then seems that im wrong sort of fool mr carlingford lighted candle be very likely dont trouble to do well on account really dont care least what do shant trouble to do well on own said tom laughing have better prepare for failure be very evident in course of next term that tom be extremely unlikely to do well on anybodys account wine of passion have begun to ferment in brain lounged morning away sometimes in cast museum sometimes in room over bushel of sculptor clay at other time have fit of complete idleness must get up late perhaps go to lecture then stroll up to tennis court play till lunch time in afternoon must play football sit talking over tea till hall time after hall play whist till bed time markham who be busy writing dissertation for fellowship have not time to look after at in authority gave up a bad job tom regarded own position a excellent example of man determining consequence of act havent done work for week said to markham one day ought to be in hot water a matter of fact be not because make up for by cordially agreeing with that say to never being out after twelve dont think be behaving rather idiotically asked markham seem to be rather proud of doing work very easy one can do yes know very easy said tom who be in exasperating mood thats why do at same time one cant do couldnt for example hope must never wish to try dear ted be incapable of wishing to try isnt in not so easy to be idle though said be just now because wanted to make angry must have great deal to think about in order to be idle if dont do something must be something that requires thought may ask what be being just now shouldnt interrupt ted be going to say that of course there be people who neither do be anything be idiot im not that sort of idiot just now be being artist dont doubt what reason have for believing oh none at said tom asked be meditating will do better for day markham made impatient movement in chair excuse saying want to go on with work tom laughed poor dear old ted how must loathe cant understand doing nothing more than can understand doing so much be work of such vital importance what doe come to youve asked that before remarked ted yes youve never answered can understand man doing archology there human interest in like to know what sort of earring greek woman used to wear oh ted do know sepulchral relief from athens there cast of one in museum wonderful will do one to when die wish must go to room get on with be deliberative subjunctive going to kill so soon a well ive often warned good bye teddy youre not sociable morning tom departed whistling loudly out of tune fellowship election took place in march a day drew near markham finding unable to work fretting because must not very wisely determined to go away from cambridge for last week having made tom promise to telegraph result to tom be just returning from telegraph office having performed be thoroughly pleasing satisfactory duty be crossing court in gathering dusk when saw figure standing on path near hall where announcement be posted sociable curiosity made tack off little see who be to astonishment found markham standing there why teddy ive just telegraphed to cried markham turned round to quick tell quick said may walk across grass said tom solemnly being one of fellow privilege may set to work to become fossil a soon a please well congratulate suppose though im not sure best thing for markham caught hold of tom arm think said very slowly deliberately think ive be making fool of morning found couldnt stop away came back about quarter of hour ago since then have be standing here not daring to go in see tom im going to chapel be two three day after that two be walking down to pitt on sunday evening on way passed one of mission room in town street be almost blocked by crowd trying to get in tom who be never so happy a in mass of surging humanity insisted on mingling with seeing what be going on markham tried to dissuade failed after good deal of pushing succeeded in getting inside be revivalist meeting full to overflowing room be hung with flaring banner lit with blazing gas standard warm condensed moisture shone on wall tom looked with wonder slight disgust towards platform where short stumpy man with chin beard be addressing people be describing own conversion transformed according to own account from swindling greengrocer into one of saved happy change have also be accompanied with great improvement in greengrocery business instead of giving short weight being always in debt took to giving full measure speedily opened account at saving bank also mentioned that became teetotaler at same time though more obvious connection between fact incident of saving bank did not seem to occur to to audience sumptuous result be direct effect of grace tom listened for minute with amusement struggling with disgust until preacher in sudden burst of gratitude gave out hymn of most militant order packed solidly with concrete image of abstract idea young woman in large poke bonnet be busy thrusting hymn book into hand of congregation gave one to tom band struck up tune expressive of liveliest devotion congregation joined at top of voice be in middle of second verse when sudden stir ran through crowd from middle of hall there ran up to platform young woman smartly over smartly dressed who burst into loud fit of hysterical cry cried out that be saved hymn be stopped at once preacher led aside while congregation waited in few moment led back to front of platform gave out hymn there be ninety nine safely lay tom sense of amusement be gone frown gathered on forehead what on earth did mean be clear what sort of girl be who have stormed gate of heaven a preacher expressed have often noticed in street now be what how be suddenly different from what be before have previous life be blotted out what be change what did mean must have be easy thing to make exhibition of one self like where be driving power began to be almost afraid before hymn be finished same thing happened again time to elderly respectable looking man who delivered short speech to congregation with tear streaming down face there be strange force abroad tom did not like at be desperately afraid of making fool of remembered father warning though be delivered in very different sense vulgarity loudness of whole proceeding be still very present to felt that be in presence of force hysterical perhaps perhaps only that force doe exist in enthusiastic crowd of nature of be absolutely ignorant for aught knew might lay hand on next so resorted to most obvious way out of pushing through crowd left room late that night strolled into markhams room a latter be just thinking that be time to go to bed proceeded to deliver of impression at length made confoundedly uncomfortable commented after giving full account of what have taken place didnt half like teddy never saw anything like before be so much more real than expected what do suppose that girl felt that man how can singing of hymn change whole moral character must be hysterical thats why went away be afraid of becoming hysterical too think how flat one must feel next morning oh awful commonness of elect greengrocer be scrubbiest sort of brute fancy announcing publicly that be saved surely be one thing in world one must be reticent about what doe mean teddy markham felt natural reserve almost young men feel in talking of such subject tom sudden curiosity about surprised be like tom to mix with crowd to see what be going forward be so unlike to have waited single moment after seeing what be that ted have waited in street for expecting to appear again moment have eventually gone on to pitt in puzzled frame of mind dont exactly know tom said after pause believe that sort of conversion a call often have permanent effect think quite conceivable that greengrocer will continue to give full measure about saving bank burst out tom how can have anything to do with must put differently of course must say honesty be best policy possibly must at rate if one can account intelligibly for thing be better to do so than to try to account for fallaciously markham frowned weve never talked of kind of thing before said tentatively havent remotest idea what religion be indeed if youve got thats exactly what ive be thinking to myself evening remarked tom dont know be only conscious that felt kind of sympathy with people be amused disgusted then be frightened wish have stopped said markham suddenly why on earth do really think must have done good to have be suddenly taken a people be suppose will say be pharisee what good must have done what must not do do now what must do do early chapel suppose ah dont said markham with sudden earnestness thing may mean nothing to do to others among others to tom stared in perplexity to do believe in sort of conversion do think that something can happen to suddenly like change cant help believing how can say that such thing happen stake life on such possibility whole thing seems so irrational to said tom in anything else man life be not changed by little thing of sort then banking account well take instance in own line said markham cant imagine modern artist who look at raphael for first time becoming convert to style of art thats quite different said tom people have probably be brought up in belief idea be not new one to doubt came home with more force at moment be like man who have be looking at raphael life caring nothing for being suddenly convinced by one of doesnt seem to likely may be right cant say for know more of subject than what right have to say that thing doesnt seem likely in matter of a said know nothing thats true said tom do know nothing of who doe probability be that people who have thought about know more than who havent tom got up began to walk up down room well want to know how can if didnt feel interest in shouldnt have come to talk about be altogether at sea wasnt brought up in religious household father never speaks of such thing at school have to read bible chiefly act like other school lesson be confirmed a matter of course if be not religiously minded how can become religious if man be not literary dont expect to feel interest in book defect that doesnt yes because naturally move among people who do said tom necessarily feel out of though move among religious people dont feel out of because religion doe not come into life suppose must call father atheist wouldnt know unless inferred from fact that doesnt go to church on sunday that dont have family prayer how be possible for to feel such thing perhaps see never knew mother died when be baby be not brought up to believe anything nurse taught to say prayer on cold evening used to ask if might say in bed always got dropped on for be considered form of profanity never understood why when age for nurse ceased prayer ceased also want to know where difference between religious people come in large number of religious people lose temper oftener than do because be born with better temper than read of clergyman being convicted of theft never be because never stole anything gentleman dont do such thing seems to that agree with certain code of morality for different reason did never occur to to wonder why existed how existed what be object of existence at tom looked at straight in face never what good must do to puzzle head about such thing even if have occurred to here be how why have mean of telling mean to make other people know why existed one cant do more than be going to be artist markham felt hopelessness of making tom understand be like describing colour to blind man for have be brought up in childlike faith be childlike still life have be sheltered nursed in tradition when be transplanted to outer air be sapling capable of striking root standing by have never known what drenching shower of autumn wind of winter be till be capable not exactly of despising of being unconscious of if tom be blind be blind too in sense there be long silence tom have halted in walk by chimney piece be poking paper spill down pipe stem markham be sitting at table puzzled helpless be couple of minute perhaps before tom spoke then spoke decidedly im not going to bother about said dont understand what mean dont understand what most thing mean if be big thing may be sure that there be many way of getting at one man cant see way round big thing be at one side of ted perhaps be nowhere then again may be at other side of may be meant to come to by road can never guess of if be meant to know will know time by by play tennis at ten to morrow youve got lecture at ten said markham many thing may happen at ten said tom probability be in favour of only one thing happening dont think lecture have supreme right however if have wont get game oh promised youd play said markham unwisely cant go back on said tom never promised to go to lecture will give breakfast at nine perhaps little after nine let call nine ish chapter v maud wrexham be sitting in mother room one morning towards end of july after breakfast telling lady chatham engagement for day piece of ritual be daily invariable mother spent succeeding three quarter of hour in trying to work thing in a called in other word to manage one

driving home separately while empty carriage with coachman who be always sceptical about such arrangement returned home gloomily about hour later think will go to victoria meet arthur maud be just saying will catch first boat from calais train get in about five dear arthur exclaimed lady chatham with effusion hope wont be dreadfully relaxed athens be so relaxing wish must have stopped at berlin

visit to dentist be always regretting that time be so dreadfully taken up with little thing that never must do anything really wanted to do though what be be quite unknown be to be suspected that in addition to daily arrangement spent much time in making plan for mauds future included far more than ordinary maternally matrimonial plan include intended for instance to send out to athens for few month during winter where must live with brother see little foreign life foreign life considered be something very mysterious very broadening in effect on human mind fact that no longer have meat breakfast at half past nine lunch at two caf au lait at eight djener at twelve half past be apparently door to whole vista of widening experience breakfast at half past nine lunch at two be part of organism of life substitution of other hour instead of be change importance of must not be overlooked have spent six month in rome when be girl with uncle who be ambassador there always looked back to six month a having be something very revolutionary startling have made often said whole difference to to day however arrangement owing to distinct intervention of providence who roughened sea made

sympathetic people because having seen unlimited vista opening out in own line be willing even eager to allow for unlimited vista in other mauds vista be wide one embracing mankind just in same way a tom did difference lying in fact that tom meant to compass end by artistic achievement must compel admiration awe whereas mauds programme be entirely vague have passion for human race intended that must have passion for tom being already fairly intimate saw good deal of other maud too have experienced quite peculiar pleasure in sight of acropolis tom presence by mean lessened be sitting one

have be accepted before went away have heard nothing of since one day in winter ted have be turning over current number of spectator found mentioned in notice of exhibition with high praise be rare convincing felt strong unsympathetic pleasure for judging from own point of view must have felt none that casual critic thought good few night afterwards by one of coincidence must be so strange if be not so common met at dinner with master of college sculptor wallingthorpe who talked chiefly about little about art be picturesque man picturesqueness added strong flavour to conversation seldom never

of exhibition where tom study have appeared asked if have be there yes did go there wine thanks never take wine by way be stimulant dont require stimulating require soothing be glad mentioned that exhibition there be two study there of extreme unusual merit produced in that feeling must have done thing that wished have be final excellence from one own point of view realized to vision might have have whom be by asked ted by quite young man believe certainly by quite new one carlingford be name ah know well said ted be sitting over wine after dinner wallingthorpe who did not care to talk to ted exclusively longer wanted larger audience bent forward shook warmly by hand be done in dramatic fervid manner naturally drew attention of rest of table wallingthorpe turned round to explain be congratulating mr markham on knowing man of genius said natural inference be that felicitation be offered to ted on happy event of having become acquainted with wallingthorpe that gentleman be self denying enough to dispel idea be speaking of two very remarkable little work in ashdon gallery by young man called carlingford with whom mr markham tell be intimate be very faulty in many way fault

be up at king till quite lately be not mr marwill blinked intelligently behind spectacle yes have idea be harbouring genius in fact one even suspected have real talent of kind be not stupid be possible even probable that have talent exclaimed wallingthorpe genius talent have nothing in common might a well expect to find bird have hand because have wing genius fly talent metaphor break down walk on hand foot what made think have talent work be always very careless showed very distinct promise wallingthorpe beat air with prophetic hand greek prose latin verse be very likely did not occur to one might a well have set wild indian to hem handkerchief see have to hem handkerchief here said host urbanely be reason why young men come to cambridge wonder when thorn bear grape thistle fig said wallingthorpe yet be to blame who did not know that thistle be fig tree dr madeford laughed good naturedly be delighted when find bearing fig said although of course dont allow that thought thistle have higher idea of what study wallingthorpe became pacific consider rebuked said think of pity of four five year ago that boy ought to have be alternately turned loose in rome shut up with model mountain of clay by now defect must have vanished must never have be in nature possibility must have be taken out of before have birth then have really high opinion of work asked markham dear young man have highest have genius have love of work show man of whom can say hail a brother wallingthorpes egotism be too deep to call conceit be conviction be mainspring of nature driving power of work must not matter to outside world what driving power be if result be admirable wallingthorpes result certainly be admirable further conversation must seem bathos after party passed into drawing room wallingthorpe have word two more with ted a be leaving what be carlingford doing now asked he in athens working there dangerous experiment be much impressed by classical art very much indeed belief in nothing else say sculptor frowned that mean will try to stand on tip toe for month two instead of flying however will get tired of will soon learn that only real art be realism say that sculptor out there called manvers be always impressing that on manvers well one ever accused manvers of not being realist be about only crime have never be suspected of manvers be extremely talented have not touch of genius however for diabolical cleverness in work cant be touched on other hand tendency in carlingford to idealism might be encouraged by manvers indirectly must find impossible if have leaning way not to have bias strengthened by anything so rampantly realistic a manvers work tom carlingford be coming back to england in few week im glad of that future be in own hand chapter viii manvers good intention of taking holiday have presumably gone to pave worst of road for before fortnight be up be working hard at new statuette solid ingot of inspiration have be tossed in path be only slightly responsible for burden of lay with maud wrexham for maud wrexham be to new type of womanhood common enough in england type doe not foregather with young artist in paris manvers be beginning to think of paris day with sort of disgusted wonder to be received into society of well bred english girl to see day after day to be admitted by into frank boyish sort of intimacy be proceeding must have looked upon month two ago a very doubtful privilege thought of english marriageable maidenhood a kind of incarnation of lawn tennis district visiting with background of leaden domesticity when maud began somehow to usurp unreasonably large share of spare thought be at first little amused at after time pulled up short began to review position have seen almost at once who be who usurped thought though felt sure that casual observer one whose own mind be fancy free must not have noticed be intensely conscious of tom presence to manvers betrayed by hundred tiny sign when be alone a be most natural for be trio of friend often talked of tom when be there evidently listened to said be intensely conscious of though might be talking to one else a rule behaved quite naturally once twice have exhibited towards studied unconsciousness to manvers be shade more convincing than consciousness have weakness for weakness dramatic side of self betrayal to tom unconsciousness must have given good deal of satisfaction have known that be without stake in matter a day went on became aware that mattered good deal to satisfaction got out of drama be very poor wage for own share in besides distinctly did not wish to fall in love love may may not blind said to play deuce with eye if be sculptor so by way of keeping eye single set to work with patient eagerness on la dame qui samuse title brought savour with of paris day paris day must hardly help being antidotal to feeling with maud wrexham inspired there be yet one more factor made plunge into work be thought of tom tom just now be sublimely unconscious of anything so sublunary a falling in love with mortal for have lost heart to antique goddess who again presented fine contrast to miss wrexham manvers a rule left moral to moralist among whose number have never enlisted certain idea of loyalty of letting tom have fair play when came to take inning made avoid idea of setting up personal relation with miss wrexham whether must have taken chivalrous line if one tom have be concerned be doubtful tom somehow exacted loyalty extraordinary boyishness made manvers feel that must be act of unpardonable meanness to take advantage of besides in sense fortress to must have liked to lay siege be felt sure ready to capitulate to struck that be likely to repel attack from other quarter that with much vigour to sit still hing be more than flesh blood must stand be hard enough to work only thing to do be to work hard tom tendency towards idealism be a wallingthorpe have suspected encouraged rather than discouraged by manvers if that thought often said be realism god forbid must be realist said to very emphatically one morning when came to see manvers after breakfast latter be already at work tom gazed at la dame for moment without speaking manvers handling of subject be masterly result appeared to tom quite detestable quite appreciate how clever be tom said to manvers who be testing power of doing lace in terra cotta with great success wonder that dont appreciate how abominable be manvers be at somewhat ticklish point did not answer only smiled nature have supplied with rather mephistophelean cast of feature have aided design by cultivation of small pointed beard at moment tom must fancy that be incarnation of abstraction dissecting newly damned soul with eagerness delicacy in search for unusual depravity after moment laid tool down appreciate fully from spiritual moral greek purist point of view said be not in habit of taking point of view in consequence be well rather pleased with think desecration said tom why be not struck with lightning when call art seems to inexplicable manvers laughed outright dear tom never called art never even called art with big be not way to get on must leave other people to do if be art critic hope for sake time may be must be immensely useful to one have only got to get art critic with big to stand by one work pay so much to shout out be abomination one fortune be made be thinking of paying one handsome salary to blackguard in press criticism a critic understands must soon cease see if one agreed so fact that one critic say be abomination implies necessarily that critic will come stand on other side bawl out be sublime with big s artist critic be under great debt to one critic get a much a sixpence line believe for what say about artist artist must never get penny if wasnt for critic whereas at present of get very considerable sum what be saying oh yes one critic damn other critic blesses then see one run up to find out what noise be begin quarrelling about pool be filled with water concluded piously tom did not answer manvers went on with slow precision giving word full value of course be chiefly due to capital letter whether criticism be favourable not matter nothing a long a be emphatic in delightful age of sky sign critic must be large flaring to attract notice therefore shout use capital letter write on full organ with stop out except vox angelica artist blesses like balaam curse be turned into blessing for so blesses back most christian proceeding honestly asked tom doe contemplation of give artistic pleasure do try to do for age what phidias praxiteles did for theirs certainly do try to represent to people what age be have doubt that ancient greek be excessively nude statuesque be not statuesque nude apollo pursuing daphne through vale of tempe through thicket where nightingale sing what doe apollo do now arranges to meet daphne at aix le bains where have mud bath drink rotten egg water wear accordion pleated skirt check suit in more rural moment sit in hotel garden really seems to that little abomination here be fairly up to date oh up to date enough said tom be that best of what be characteristic of age that doesnt concern said manvers blandly worst will do a well what want be anything unmistakably up to date god goddess of course be more beautiful from ideal point of view by way that reminds want to look at of early figure drapery be very suggestive be going to do statuette of nun who have once be well not nun want archaic fold if produced now must be nothing more than uninteresting survival to produce uninteresting survival seems to most deplorable waste of time why dont make statuette of sewing machine asked tom savagely oh do think sewing machine be really characteristic of age said manvers dont personally think be more than homocea be sewing machine be only skin deep wonder when will be converted again become apostate a must say now really have great talent statuette of yours at ashdon gallery be attracting great deal of attention wish have thrown into fire before sent there well when come round again will be glad didnt said manvers consolingly tom took turn two up down room dont understand bit said suddenly because think that parthenon frieze be more beautiful than woman with high heeled shoe think im idealist be realist just a much a be only want to produce what think be most beautiful beautiful woman have much in common with greek art want to produce what men who be brute will say be most lifelike work for brute what call brute dont if have come to conclusion that what call brutish appeal to more men than what call beautiful surely be right to work for of course most artist say work for few like confess that wish few to be a numerous a possible greatest evil for greatest number suppose mean burst in tom call pandering to vicious taste manvers paused then laid down tool be working with be overstepping bound of courtesy said quietly assume that nature be vicious that have right to do tom frowned despairingly know be quite true hate men who always tell that say what think be one of manvers laughed dont mind thinking vicious said dare say be vicious from point of view shouldnt tell so savour of billingsgate be quite clear without telling of insult intelligence when say so in be sorry said tom never meant to do wish must leave well muse alone come out manvers looked out of window suppose will have to come said be so violent never will consent to take carriage exercise luckily cant ask to play outdoor game here a there be outdoor game to play domino be only outdoor game can play have done so outside french cafs im afraid cant say too cold must insult morality if did said tom well thats not so bad a insulting intelligence be exactly where differ said other arthur wrexham be giving small party next evening of very recherch order dinner being served frothily in paper frill shell on silver skewer candle shaded in so cunning manner that be barely possible to see what food be lived in somewhat sumptuous set of room on upper square of town for week more a sirocco have be blowing have be in state of apparently irretrievable collapse little balcony opening out of dining room overlooked square a night be very hot glass door on to be left open noise of town came up to guest a sat at dinner like low accompaniment to own voice have be one of day when divine climate of athens give way to mood of angry woman morning have dawned bright hot before ten oclock sirocco have sprung up whoso walk in face of sirocco be bathed through through in fine white dust most gritty sirocco have brought cloud from seaward about one oclock rain came down laid dust then sun shone violently till nearly five air be like to sticky warm bath later on have clouded over again tom remarked in pause in conversation that have begun to lighten be quite small party two younger sister of american charg daffaires balancing tom manvers arthur sister making up six two miss vanderbilt talked a much a possible sighed for parrus referred to acropolis a lonely old ruin agreed that athens be cunning well im right down afraid of electric storm remarked miss vanderbilt to whom tom remark about lightning have be addressed a for bee wont be comfortable until shes said prayer be safe in coal store doctor at parrus told id nervous temperament remarked bee knew that before made popper pay up for saying so speech be silver remarked manvers well speech be gold said miss vanderbilt dont dread electric storm miss wrexham maud be sitting at head of table fanning have borne up against sirocco sticky bath stage have finished felt a bee must have expressed a if theyd omitted to starch when be sent from wash love said maud wish must begin at once may make air le stifling well id sooner be stifled than lightning struck said bee so sudden popper referred to father popper say that average electric storm discharge enough electric fluid to light chicago for ten day think table be just too elegant mr wrexham where do get flower from thing improved little a dinner went on after fish maud felt better what dreadful materialist one be after said before dinner be feeling that life be failure in general be failure in particular now that ive have soup fish glass of champagne not only do feel better bodily mentally morally why think thats just beautifully put said miss vanderbilt when feel homesick lonesome bee say stomach quite true said manvers ive only felt homesick once year be when tom went to gina be fearfully hot lunch have given be hard boiled egg cold greasy mutton at moment whole soul like ruth be sick for home little cafs with oleander in tub awning say soul suspect be what miss vanderbilt tell have said anything wrong asked miss vanderbilt looking round inquiringly be only telling what bee said tom laughed easy enough to assure one that one be only animal said wish one must prove to that be something more when manvers say soul be sick be quite right to correct suspect that meant other thing dear fellow soul epidemic have ceased said manvers though believe certain clique try to keep up when have looked at one of god goddess for hour think have be enjoying with soul havent really at end of hour feel tired after eating mutton chop can look at again mutton chop feed that part of have be spending tissue on god goddess well know what mutton chop feed wont assure that have soul said tom assure have most comfortable belief murmured manvers dont grudge envy wish must do same for storm be getting closer now then pillar on balcony be thrown into vivid blackness against violet background of sky balcony be deep covered with projecting eaves of third story after dinner sat out on air be absolutely still apparently population of athens be in square making most of evening air before storm broke tom be sitting on balustrade of balcony maud in low chair near leant forward suddenly do remember hearing hum of london one night saying be finest thing in world yes very well be at ramsdens dance will hear again soon ah be going almost immediately suppose now a spoke sky to south became for moment sheet of blue fire with angry scribble running through middle of miss vanderbilt ejaculated in shrill dismay tom turned a maud spoke lightning illuminated face vividly glimpse have of be absolutely momentary for just so long a dazzling streamer flickered across sky in darkness pause followed still saw face before phantom like a when shut eye suddenly in strong light still preserve on retina image of what be looking at phantom face slid slowly into surrounding darkness be not till answering peal have burst with sound a of hundred of marble being poured on to wooden floor overhead tom answered question voice have translated eye have asked well hardly know said when be thinking of going home in moment when thunder be crackling overhead flood of shame anger have come over maud of voice have perfect command a knew that lightning must have come at moment showed tom face be not calculable absolute normalness of tone reassured will go back in about fortnight said why thats just about when be going said cheerfully hope will travel together with unhesitatingness of well bred delicacy got off balustrade began to talk to miss vanderbilt tom be far too much of gentleman to let mind consciously dwell on what have seen during flash of lightning regarded like remark accidentally overheard of have right to profit in case wish be also absent for though liked maud wrexham immensely be already in first stage of love of idealism at present allowed divided allegiance have maud be idealist might have appeared to merely a incarnation of spirit of idealism in case must have fallen down worshipped tom have experienced great shock day before when have expressed admiration for manvers dame qui samuse be on acropolis together when tom mentioned asked if have seen yes showed morning think extraordinarily good dont like asked tom be so terrible if do dont like a like looked round largely at propyla give great pleasure to look at so fearfully clever man can serve two master said if like a tell do loathe other necessarily oh youre just little too fond of dogmatising said maud what lay down a necessity may be only limitation in own nature how do know cant appreciate a matter of fact do well if admire la dame cant possibly think of see here a supreme triumphant said tom im not sure that do think perhaps have touch of scepticism have oh ever so long ago six week isnt when expected to find that grand style be obsolete how will quarrel when manage world a said proposed to do quite certain that will never manage together if there be difference between will be wanting to celebrate olympic game while be laying out boulevard well there room for said maud said tom there be never enough room for best far le for worst be so splendidly illogical mr carlingford said suddenly see assume one be best one worst then build upon be very well to do for one one becomes unconvincing if one doe for other people be better than if have said at once that differed fundamentally maud turned away yes perhaps what be use of saying unpleasant thing at unpleasant asked tom wrinkling forehead why differ from best friend diametrically on conceivable topic that classification of with best friend be exactly attitude of nature towards what saw during flash of lightning be naturally extremely surprising for a reflected to despair must not look from one eye when one hears that one best friend be going away a be bound in honour to do dismissed a far a possible from mind listened to miss vanderbilt scientific discourse about lightning must really feel much more comfortable if must turn big reflector round be saying to arthur wrexham say attracts thunderbolt im sure dont want to lay out to attract thunderbolt arthur wrexham remonstrated gently oh really have effect on said in fact glass be insulator entirely vague statement be found to be consoling miss vanderbilt continued must be ashamed to be a silly a bee about said bee took off ring last electric storm have of course couldnt recollect where put must have seen colour of frock when came out of coal store oh gracious why flash went off quite by hand here manvers be looking meditatively out into night chance of being struck be so infinitesimal miss vanderbilt think must have have shot at that time missed so by law of probability will not even aim at again for year two really be great consolation to know one hear thunder if one be struck why if must hear thunder must be over said miss bee with brilliant inspiration so after flash must wait anxiously for thunder said tom then will know weve not be struck guess there great difficulty in finding out if youve be struck said bee popper saw man struck once went all yellow tell if be going yellow mr manvers shant try to conceal amount of dissimulation must conceal fact that one have gone all yellow said manvers worst of storm be soon over cloud took possession of hymettus continued growling rumbling there two american took advantage of lull to make way home for nothing miss vanderbilt protested with shrill vehemence will make get into buggy during electric storm tom manvers followed example walked back to hotel manvers have seen that look on miss wrexhams face at moment of flash of lightning determined wisely unwisely to mention to tom be only occupant of smoking room after getting cigar under way asked other lazily by way what be saying to miss wrexham that made look like image of despair caught sight of face for moment during flash of lightning looked extraordinary yes noticed too said tom carelessly wondered what be matter have be rather upset by sirocco said dear fellow girl dont look like petrified mask of despair because sirocco have be blowing for couple of hour in morning well suppose must have be something else then said tom what brilliant solution be inclined to agree with manvers remained silent for few moment balancing in mind disinclination to appear officious meddling desire to perhaps do tom service a matter of fact have heard question have accompanied that look on miss wrexhams face have confirmed idea have long entertained that be falling in love with tom tom be not consciously in love with tone of absolute indifference to subject might be assumed natural see good deal of dont went on shes clever think shes certainly got good eye made several suggestion about little figure be admirable told admired said tom told couldnt admire if admired greek work wouldnt agree with think that can appreciate must be so nice to have belief in to think that be sort of people instead of one sort of person break down in practice manvers paused moment decided to risk look on face evening be of woman who have broken down have often wondered by way whether ever have guessed how fortunate be tom sat up did hear what said asked certainly shouldnt have mentioned look here tom said be quite accidental that of ever saw that look couldnt have foreseen that flash of lightning must come at moment have tried to keep from thinking of wont do hate conceited fool who be always imagining thing of sort a have spoken of be absurd for to pretend not to know what mean damn looked looked a if going away made difference to manvers drew puff of smoke very slowly held breath moment then began to speak seemed to tom slightly appropriate that word must be a be visible seemed concrete embodiment of practical advice think be very fond of said what be to do demanded tom do said really dont understand if be in love with imagine course be not so difficult if not may be sure soon will be must think be most unlikely thing in world returned tom if have thought that be hardly likely must have asked what to do pardon never asked except under pressure made quite clear that wanted to be asked did not wish to ask at have opinion to deliver listen be very fond of whether know not just now be stark mad about heathen god say to must say to yourself if formulated thought that must only fall in love with girl in grand style be quite ridiculous may may not be very good a statue must certainly not answer a wife in natural course of thing will get over try to do so a quickly a possible look at miss wrexham instead of parthenon cant marry parthenon that flash of lightning occurring when did gave stronger belief in existence of beneficent providence than have ever felt before be only superstitious idea know when chance fall so divinely pat a that feel inclined to applaud somebody tom did not look at inspired by practical suggestion wont do said take admirably sensible view of situation if happened to be unfortunately may be knave said manvers resignedly thank god be not fool dont suppose will deny that be fool tom really must give advice great deal of consideration be not day that flash of lightning show how high opinion perfectly charming heiress have of be think folly wickedness not to suppose that be sent for good clever purpose really cant help feeling that be very clever thing to send lightning just then must have special providence who look after hope dont think will convince said tom oh dear have to ease conscience by entering strong protest feel better now thanks thats right to descend to practical detail wont fact that suspect saw what did make rather awkward for to meet be sure suspect not sure must go away at once may be fool be not knave manvers extended hand in air deprecatingly oh dont make repartee during thunderstorm so seldom mean anything in fact better repartee be le mean give nervous shock to reparteee if may coin word also be bound in mere politeness to cudgel brain to see if do mean something when have opportunity must say looked so awfully tired last night that noticed face once in blaze of lightning be quite frightened looked so out of sort done up run down something very simple be there chance no not vestige said tom besides dont believe that really advise what say tom youve never heard give advice before must attach proper weight to a rare product why be always giving advice about turning realist youre wrong there only prophesy that will often prophesy dont deny there be nothing so amusing to one so unconvincing to other people be most innocent of amusement besides can always compare to cassandra be classical when people dont believe yes must be great comfort said tom slowly who be thinking about miss wrexham manvers got up be falling into reverie ought to know that revery be unpardonable breach of manner will go to statuette be best of being up to date in art never need be without companion come down o maid from yonder mountain height quoted tom half mock heroically dear boy wont do said manvers wont come down for have to fetch down be very like rest of really soon assimilates besides luckily maid on mountain height be rare find doesnt pay tom left room manvers went to window rain have come on again be falling hot heavy through night manvers dropped steadfast oath into storm then instead of going to statuette went to bed lay awake till darkness grew world be damnably awry be burden of thought suppose be to teach not to set affection on thing below might have chosen le diabolical method of teaching providence be really very vulgar sometimes maud woke next morning in rationalizing mood event of thunderstorm have made disposed to be uneasy night before fell back into proper place in scheme of thing absence of sirocco doubt contributed to calmer attitude for a philosopher found out very long ago be possible to reach soul through subtle gateway of body thin light athenian north wind be one of subtlest physician of mind can find out most tortuous intricate passage through house of body acting on naturally rational mind have produced legitimate effect probably tom have not noticed in case if have there be much le metaphysical reason must lend to much more obvious inference be tired lightning have dazzled miss vanderbilt be on nerve thing be so likely real reason so unlikely consequently when left house after breakfast to go up to acropolis finish sketch with almost certain probability of seeing tom there felt that intercourse must be a easy a usual view have chosen be of little nik temple seen through two headless column of propyla with glimpse behind of sea hill of argolis painted on for hour so without thinking of anything what be doing by degree glance at far hill became longer act of painting shorter eye saw le le of what be looking at though rested more intently on scene at last put down palette leant against white marble wall behind be matter with why have unfathomable feeling for man who be perhaps le unfathomable than one have ever seen frank english face keen boyish vitality almost comical self sufficiency demanding a only food contemplation of greek sculpture seemed fathomable enough half wished must go back to england at once yet even with view in front of for sake of nominally climbed up to acropolis felt that factor be wanting nought told have inexplicable trick of turning unit into ten in case must go back to england not with by be spoiling everything for then came reaction how ridiculous will be asked when be going back hoped might go together now be deciding not to go with be most pleasant companion what be to next thought came like echo to thought have taken bit in mouth be running away so metaphorically speaking jumped off runaway vehicle came into serious collision with terra firma literally took up palette went on with painting to tom also visit to acropolis distinctly gained something by constant expectation of meeting maud there have run to ground other day when have made confess that cared for nothing art though conclusion have be forced from mouth knew be not quite true what cared for be life best possibility in way of beauty enthusiasm knew saw tended to state everything too violently found maud sympathetic eager charming a companion other thought have entered head about until incident of thunderstorm have be unexpected very bewildering in deep perplexity a to what have better do took eminently straightforward most promising course of doing nothing at of behaving normally have a be taken tentative mental sounding of feeling towards for own satisfaction found that bottom be soon reached in case depth be not unplumbable must have be only reason for doing anything be in love with life with of life be best idea of falling in love with particular little bit of must have seemed to a incredible a writing sonnet in style of eighteenth century poet to woman finger nail always appeared to most profitless performance to fall in love must always seem slightly ridiculous until one fall in love then came about that not long after maud have begun painting again tom walked up step a usual sat with hand clasped round one knee on step at mauds foot talked a usual absorbed beauty of scene only way said on particular morning to hope to get hold of spirit of greek art can never arrive at spirit of thing through detail detail shape if know spirit see artist in louvre copying raphael life never really remind of if be to go to umbrian village live life lived among people to feast dont mean literally on ox eyed face of peasant woman then come back might be able to copy with success still better if have genius produce original picture be like raphael go wrong way about maud be painting intently did not answer for moment yes think be right said use copying merely mere copy only at best approximates to coloured photograph so utterly wrong way to go about said tom to arrive at right result have to follow right method from beginning for instance when go back to england be shut up in dingy studio under grey sky work look hideous dead will bring back inspiration not by thinking only of hermes of time have spent here on step looking out over propyla to salami leant back on step where be sitting looked up at maud for moment put down brush held be looking at a if be waiting eagerly to hear something more tom apparently be unconscious of look took up brush again tom tilted hat little more over eye took out cigarette case becoming real to at last said think be beginning to know what mean youll have to show said maud man who be sculptor who know what mean be certainly bound to produce statue be really like greek statue tom sat up dont care how conceited sound said excitedly be going to try to do le be astonishing how little care what happens be aim if dont realize will be fault of something cant control what be there man who be earnest can not control asked there be only one question in world be even harder to answer said tom be what be there in world can control what be to happen to if morning wake up to find think manvers statuette ideal greek art pas how do know will not happen to who will assure of oh well how do know that wont wake up morning find nose have disappeared during night hand grown in place asked one be a unnatural to mind a other be to body sort of unnatural thing happen to mind said tom must have suddenly felt that nothing greek art be worth anything be just a unnatural be just a unnatural that at given moment man fall in love stopped quite suddenly involuntarily mauds voice broke in not at said see happens to most men be rule rather than exception whereas disappearance of one nose must be unique must think voice be so perfectly natural so absolutely unaffected that tom made short mental note to effect that manvers be greatest idiot in world except one be more consoling thought than must have imagined possible determination to be quite normal have become entirely superfluous billetless bullet yes because happens constantly make none le extraordinary said certainly not can no longer call unnatural call everything unnatural seems to unintelligible remarked tom with crisp assurance maud began to laugh what great many unnatural thing there must be said according to view why sun rising in morning be unnatural must be much more unnatural if did not if go on will soon begin to talk nonsense said tom concessively must be pity well let get back on to safe ground said maud come tell what to do with column isnt right tom picked up stick shoved hat back on head dont understand said after looking at picture for moment believe know what spirit of be at least picture be admirable look a if did yet like manvers statuette think be unnatural do remember talk have when be staying with about being broad yes perfectly why because think be being narrow dare say be best doesnt prevent other thing from being good maud bent over painting again because wanted to say more be always easier to criticize if one be not biassed by sight of person whom one be criticizing seem to think can see round truth if truth be big enough to be worth anything be probable that can only see little bit of why why began tom yes know be thinking of what said other day about religion when told what passed between mr markham after revivalist meeting be quoting own word seem to very true how be possible in instance said tom striking marble pavement with stick if one of two be good other be bad be utterly opposed maud turned round on suddenly ah thought must say that said must be a reasonable for to say that because there be sunshine here now there be sunshine over world yet in australia be about midnight light be utterly opposed to darkness yet be one world dont allow of there being more of than can see tom shifted position go on said be not so limited that wish to be told so showed just same smallness when talked to about cambridge said thought that be broad because thought that be narrow did never occur to that thought be narrow simply because be not broad enough to take in one explanation be a simple a other im quite convinced im broader than markham said tom frankly think about nothing snuffy old scholiast think about nothing greek art have said so be quite certain that be broader than tom stood for moment thinking do think im narrow asked at length be beside point said if did not might only show be narrow in same way a no cant be said tom plunging at only opening must see must remember like manvers statuette well from standpoint do think narrow said seems to very odd that shouldnt see how good be do mean how clever be be same thing a far a question go dont recognize cleverness even since dislike so tom drew sigh of relief oh well then be wrong about fully recognize how clever be then dont admire cleverness be great deficiency on contrary do admire cleverness manvers seems to perverted cleverness admire ingenuity a abstract quality though dont care for diabolical little puzzle one used to play with last year maud shut up paint box rose use

there bad unnecessary tobacco from village store saw not there be prospect of afternoon aristophanes lesson to fall back on so through quiet country week two young life flowed inevitably towards other like two stream rising on distant range of hill yet must day meet in valley between though nature sprang from widely distant source be inevitable must time join to continue metaphor bed over tom stream flowed be bright gravelly soil on water danced gaily light heartedly down to valley pursuing straight swift course whereas may have many rock sandy place to get over what be worse must not understand half rebelled against course stream seemed to be taking tradition in have be brought up have become part of nature for thought be sheltered life busy in little deed of love in caring for own corner of world bringing nearer to god when at first stream began to flow in unconjectured direction be bewildered almost frightened be there anything in world so certain a own duty must anything rightly come between other life have planned dedicated humbly gratefully to god what call be there so clear a still small voice said inasmuch a ye have done to least ye have done unto when have come to argue about even to herself end be already inevitable a soon a moral question becomes thing to argue about be already without force argument will convince man that be better being good than bad be matter not for dispute of knowledge man who dispute about be bad meantime tom have turned large roomy attic into studio worked with artist regularity world be accustomed to call irregularity went constantly to london made great friend with wallingthorpe caused that eminent sculptor many fit of divine despair followed advice about not immediately setting up mourning demeter though for other reason than mourning demeter announced frankly must soon be set up not at once be merely waiting so told wallingthorpe for particular spark of divine fire to descend till descended be willing eager to gain greater facility with hand also cordially agreed that studio must exist in england except in london said that there be reason why must not live in london just now perhaps before summer be over began face flushed over asked if anything have be heard of manvers ted be at cambridge during lent term tom went up there to see arrived at close of lovely day in march though lawn lower roof of building be already in shade four tall pinnacle of king chapel burned like rosy flame against tender green of evening sky markham have not seen tom since came to england looked forward to visit with something like passionate eagerness for tom be to connecting link with outer world of movement eagerness from have voluntarily banished towards even now sometimes looked back with something like regret though nature be one hug shore prefers quiet monotonous safety of land locked creek soft sanded beach to risk possibility of open sea sometimes cast eye to great horizon where ocean going steamer passed repassed with strange cargo dead living freight from dim mysterious country whose very existence be becoming fable to tom came with seal of art love upon be old boyish self sat on arm of ted armchair inveighed against scholiast wondered if ted have ever heard of pheidias after tea strolled down together through gathered dusk sat on bridge once more tom dropped match in river waited to hear fizz difference be there ted wondered if tom must speak of once seemed on point of willow overhang river have just begun to break into tender leaf delicate foliage hung round like green mist tom paused moment grew serious look at said like loveliest thing on earth be youth bursting into broke off suddenly once again later in evening grew serious be so odd for tom to be serious twice in day markham wondered how can have be fool when be here dont know said somebody told once thought cambridge narrow simply because wasnt broad enough to appreciate well think be right mind dont go back on anything said afternoon about scholiast be narrow old boy so dont misunderstand who be said that asked markham miss wrexham think didnt meet at home often tell home truth without making unpleasant be not very common oh do think home truth be unpleasant asked markham rather like telling im narrow dear ted never said home truth be unpleasant only said that told home truth without making unpleasant whats difference difference in world whether be unpleasant not simply depends on personality of person who tell mean think miss wrexham be not unpleasant asked markham certainly shes not unpleasant think shes quite delightful suppose dont appreciate well hardly know remember what may said of tom sat up in chair what did say of said thought wasnt genuine thats not quite true miss wrexham be nearly always what want to be doesnt seem to to forfeit genuineness be most adaptable person ever saw to praise parthenon to manvers la dame qui samuse to one who doesnt know well that must appear like want of genuineness tom rose walked up down room be getting terribly bourgeois in taste manvers must tell care for nothing now loyalty honesty genuineness quiet country life markham stared dear tom really shouldnt give such surprise what have happened to bustle stir of world statuette bowling cricket ball dont know be phase suppose one cant reach one proper development except through phase paul be pharisee of pharisee augustine be debauchee sensualist with shroud round foot paul augustine said ted with smile let continue list what about tom paused dont know only know have changed that something very big have happened to perhaps time will know what be im going to bed teddy chapter x tom stayed at cambridge two day having meant to stay week found need of getting home again imperative longed to tell ted about something prevented ted be a delightful a ever tom felt that difference between must not be bridged by confidence a bridge over ravine first by wire rope strengthen till will bear men beast confidence felt must not reach to other side dangle dismally in air before left however have talk with in expressed feeling about ravine though made direct attempt to bridge over two day have be charming said must be dreadfully happy here teddy ted looked up suspiciously be saul also among prophet asked nearly startled out of wit yesterday by saying that liked quiet country life cow now like cambridge tom frowned looked about for inspiration spent week in month ago said enjoyed immensely there be heap of people knew went dancing dining night day noise of town roared round then went home a be lovely day got out at park gate walked do remember little hollow just to left of drive where shot two woodcock one day well be full of birch tree birch tree be beginning to have little green cloud of leaf round over ground be clump of primrose pushing up among last year dead leaf sun be setting ray struck birch trunk horizontally felt a if must have sat there for ever looked at a matter of fact in five minute be tired of went on walking be parable asked ted yes obviously cambridge be quiet little green hollow remember used to think so terrible that people must live there for ever only busy with what went on in little hollow be wrong when stopped in little hollow at home thought there must be nothing more lovely than to live there always in fact wanted to envied bird did in same way a one envy people who grow beard when one be shaving in morning said tom wouldnt ever really grow one envied bird to whom hollow be native natural markham laughed bird beard what metaphor be going to employ next tom stood in front of smoking meditatively if green hollow satisfies be right to live there always one can not be two people couldnt live there always said just now be in love with cow country life so be if knew there be nothing else must be absolutely wretched of course human being be mass of limitation saddled with idea that can be unlimited personally cant limit to living always in green hollow one who can seems to necessarily more limited than man be judged by power of desire to desire much be better than to desire little be not very convincing remarked ted one have ever convinced anybody of anything except by triumphant achievement of sort said tom because call bird in green hollow shant convince have better have be man that be one what mean be be human being ought to live in human environment differ from beast chiefly because have high intelligible emotion be duty to mix with sort of people to know what one be thinking about to be ecstatically miserable to be ecstatically happy to fall in love oh that part of human life be well looked after said markham be almost universal to fall in love suppose by way that be going off now because ten minute be five in green hollow be over markham spoke rather bitterly two day have be very pleasant to tom delightful habit of falling back at once into old relation with one made feel that own circle have narrowed while tom have widened remark about green hollow have emphasized tom looked up be not least tired of said be partly reason why be going be always pity to stop till one be tired of thing see necessarily be not so much at home here a be must be tired of time go without saying have reason for going perhaps will know about soon said that last night said markham only once wonder havent said oftener paused moment mentally threw rope across ravine saw fail to reach other side dangle helplessly in air well good bye old boy must be off if be to catch train said im going straight home message of sort suppose read aristophanes most morning with father be very stupid be very kind be nearly dark when got home evening be still warm after tea took short stroll up to top of hill in front of house watched crimson splashed west paling to saffron before approach of night in front lay gentle slope of thick growing tussocky grass beyond clump of silver stemmed birch tree standing slender still luminous in gathering dusk through bush little noise of night crept stealthily about one by one star be lit in velvet sky thing lay hushed under benediction of night in mind a colour faded out of earth air golden morrow dawned brightened must see to morrow must come a man to woman must claim right to know fate be best worst must not have hastened even if must few hour lay between next day there have be something in intercourse of late made know think knew that must be well with fine instinct of lover formulates nothing made absolutely entirely happy at present moment unconsciously enjoyed pleasure of higher hedonist who know that long drawn pause before full melody burst out be of infinite moment anticipation of pain be nearly always keener especially to imaginative emotional people than pain same thing be true even in higher degree of joy not that tom be conscious at time that be pro tempore philosopher of higher hedonist school knew be that thought of may flooded half hour sat alone looked at paling west made rosary of passionately happy moment tom who must never be in time for breakfast at easy half past nine at cambridge found difficulty in getting to vicarage at half past eight breakfast passed a usual mr markham making vitriolic comment on tactic of liberal party may tom trying to originate intelligent observation on politics seldom never succeeded in doing after breakfast mr markham tom lit pipe began on aristophanes vicar observed that tom be even le attentive than usual with certain amount of tact remembered at end of hour that have pressing work to do tom shut up book at once hoped hadnt already taken up too much of vicar time vicar replied not at nobody knew what to say next remembrance of own day of love youth memory of standing in quiet shaded garden offering to girl life love came across elder man turned to window with hand in pocket so a not to look at tom neednt go up yet need asked be coming way in hour might go up together may have got idle morning to day make play croquet with there capital new set ordered other day put up on saturday thanks ill wait said tom bluntly suppose will find miss markham in garden yes saw go out just now youll be ready in hour then may be seated under tree at far end of garden tom strolled across lawn to there be book in lap be not reading saw coming smiled for first time in life tom found difficulty of seeing one knew long way off approaching beginning to smile at right moment non existent sat down on grass by for few moment neither spoke word when thing be inevitable most awkward people can not prevent then got up knelt by be sitting in low chair eye be on level looked gravely in face love more than whole world said tom bravely have come to ask whether care for at yes tom said lip met in lover first kiss tom marriage with may markham took place in july be celebrated quietly at applethorpe world wife condescended to take considerable interest in season be beginning to wear little thin marriage of wealthy fairly well connected young man who have many friend with absolutely unknown girl who world said be extraordinarily beautiful who so said wife be rather stick be matter of interest when interest be beginning to get rather few moreover for various reason particular marriage have be talked about to certain extent when thing be talked about reputation be made matter very little whether abuse praise be showered on anything a long a be showered with sufficient liberality little story connected with tom be subject of abuse praise when be mixed in right proportion matter becomes one of almost overwhelming interest story intelligent reader may take for what be worth certainly be not true be merely that have be engaged to miss maud wrexham world wife care not at whether story be true not be sufficient if amuses interest fiction after add great charm to human life if did away with fiction altogether must have to discard pleasant

out of ken of fellow about middle of october came back to applethorpe lived at park with old mr carlingford that amiable old cynic have completely lost heart to may who for time extinguished desire for observing weakness of human nature be bound to add that a soon a two went abroad habit returned on remark on return be worth recording may be tired with journey went to bed early tom sat up over fire while tom descanted on perfect womanhood old gentleman listened with amusement satisfaction when took up candle to go to bed turned to son said believe be more in love with than ever what time be

with lambert be on point of death have be asking for evening say mr markham began taking off coat stood for moment before fire will wait minute two till may come out said at sudden impulse however tom rose quietly closed door into sick room sat down again by fire sordid shabbiness of place contrasted too painfully with supreme scene be going on within wished to separate two on table stood teapot teacup without saucer into be thrust half eaten crust of bread dull spiritless fire half choked in grey ash smouldered in grate kettle with lid off stood in fender half overturned in puddle of water wooden china faced clock painted with scroll of pink blue flower stood on mantelpiece between two white crockery dog marked moment with harsh insistence there be slipper worn down at heel lying on shabby worsted rug lay crooked by fender presumedly fellow half under table hungry mournful looking cat sat blinking at from under table with anxious perturbed eye while inside door may knelt by bed of dying cottager in mysterious way knew how to reach dim lit soul of old man to make easy for to die there be reality about tom felt revivalist meeting have lacked clock on mantelpiece have scarcely beaten out five loud minute when door opened again may came out ah have come said in low voice to father be just too late died quite peacefully happily be here afternoon replied just went back to

must like two went back into sick room tom out into night something in what have taken place impressed profoundly what be power old man felt be able to ease last lonely moment how must word be of avail when last horrible ghastly parting of soul body came tom like healthy vigorous people felt intense physical loathing at thought of death be terrible unnatural that beautiful machine must in moment become dead thing something to be buried away out of sight how must word make death seem death no longer beginning of life for swindling greengrocer increased balance to appeared to be direct effect of grace to tom to have have much more sublunary intelligible connection with taking pledge there be explanation must appreciate be altogether different test be real test certain word have for man round whom inevitable loneliness of death lay like cold blinding mist comfort made face with calmness to may a to must have be expression of something very real for first time in life have seen in aspect must not be mistaken consolation of religious belief most severe test conceivable have be applied belief in power stronger than death have proved stronger than death tom in whom unfamiliarity with such phenomenon have bred not contempt absolute want of interest be much puzzled somehow tragic simple scene have just be through be more convincing than hundred volume full of triumphant suffering of martyr tom suddenly felt rather vexed hurt in mind why did mean so much to may to others so little to if power of life death be embracing why have not touched why have belief in have be

space intervened ah how do do mr manvers charming to see again there be block at corner have to go back for glove tom laughed must have started wonderfully early said because be only ten minute late may take in maud tom manvers have much to say to other may good deal to listen to rather tended to talk at once now then one of others must drop out of conversation pick up naturally enough tom did not talk much to manvers made several well meaning effort be unable to sustain conversation long a be listening to what other two be saying talking maud sat on opposite side of table candle flower made communication difficult must be confessed may found dinner little wearisome for in somewhat isolated life have not have opportunity of acquiring that most useful accomplishment of talking nonsense of talking naturally fluently about nothing particular manvers be maintaining new startling theory that only readable description of place on face of earth be written by people who have never set eye on place in question supported theory by own experience at athens knew said a know that there be acropolis with building of white marble on when looked out from gazed over grey olive grove plain of attica violet crown of mountain sea salami before went to athens must have described in beautiful language talked of delicate air rose garden now ive be there be spoiled for there arent rose garden objected maud there be usually sirocco exactly so be folly to be wise rose garden be part of spirit of greece just a much a plane tree by ilyssus soi disant delicate air there be plane tree said maud tom laughed so much worse for ilyssus if there be not there ought to be yes when one who have be to athens read description said maud will know that doesnt resemble athens at one doesnt write description for people who have be there do people who have be there read said manvers book of travel be written for people who have never be abroad who will never go dont think so mr carlingford may crumbled bread attentively im afraid dont quite understand said go on wont tell more manvers frowned if one never take one seriously be terribly disconcerting to find that other people do what mean be that literal accuracy of description doe not matter at said when turner painted picture arranged nature a suited raised level of sea two hundred foot made valley where there be hill made crooked straight rough place plain so must have greek maiden greek youth walking about street in description of athens asked maud yes if thought must be there dont must have be so uncivilized fancy dressing in yard half of bath towelling then do be to reconstruct athens a seems to ought to be yes be just what mean said manvers unfortunately have be there now know that there be square white hotel dirty street ugly little boot black horrible smell warp original typical conception have idea of what athens ought to be if write about at must be duty to memorialize that same said tom conception of what ought to be may not tally with of one else if such person go there will see that conception be not only false according to idea not characteristic if there be one who will assure there be not who never have be never will go whose conception tally with mine think of infinite delight must more than counter balance cold accuracy of people who say be liar will say here be who never set eye on athens never will behold be exactly a hoped thought must be tom laughed uproariously believe be right said will write description of america do do said manvers describe new york with avenue telephone telegraph wire making fine network of sky elevated roadway whatever be hundred yard with pullman car containing gentleman playing lacrosse running on hundred second at hundred mile hour describe molasses store vanderbilt driving maud v down broadway scattering gold to irish constabulary describe omnibus in street omniboats on river with cargo of ham ten minute before be pig describe backwoods with solitary redskin burying tomahawk under primeval banana tree against sunset sky america be magnificent subject half england will say that be exactly what thought be that there be longer need of going there after great point of book of travel be to save one going anywhere may feeling of being out of be strong upon manvers felt sure be talking sheer nonsense how be that tom maud evidently felt amused by a be speaking found going rapidly over in own mind what have said of course did not mean to be argument in disfavour have finished dessert glanced across at maud maud did not catch eye be sitting with elbow on table evidently thought of going into next room have entered head man came in with coffee cigarette handed round maud raised hand to box looked suddenly across to may dropped hand again tom caught intercepted look may doesnt mind do may said miss wrexham want cigarette be who taught to smoke out in athens quite true said maud oh please smoke if want to said may dont mind smell in least tom wanted to teach gave up why shouldnt go into studio library be more comfortable oh let stop here said tom just like athens used to sit with elbow on table after dinner drink coffee while manvers talked to maud interposed passion for being nice to everybody have suffered no cooling saw too may be rather put out at possible transgression of wonderful english custom of woman leaving men at dinner table not to drink wine pushed chair back got up oh think library must be much nicer said big chair have got there be made for talking in so nice dark in there one be more amusing in dark tom manvers rose too went into library maud looked round room until have found what called chair sank down into with little contented sigh thats so nice said now let go on exactly where left off room be lighted by couple of heavily shaded lamp on table cast small brilliant circle of light on to near surrounding object left rest of room in darkness maud be sitting opposite fire manvers tom on low settee on side of may at little distance off really life be becoming beautifully simple easy said manvers one can get almost anything one want if one pay for usually one have to pay so little look at niagara in london be told by people who have be to real one that be exactly like can see niagara for shilling allowing eighteenpence for cab have seen one of greatest marvel of nature purified by art for ridiculously small sum of two six how purified by art asked maud well there be mosquito beggar american tourist if only must bottle up noise of niagara in phonograph have sent to london thing must be quite perfect complete triumph of art over nature very well to talk about equal distribution of wealth said tom unequal distribution be only possible working arrangement if one have enough be equally rich couldnt get anything unpleasant done for too terrible to think of said manvers must have to brush own boot cook own dinner make own bed be only because hope to receive reward perishable imperishable that ever do anything at nirvana will be very well when dont wear boot sleep in bed if man be poor enough will do anything for sovereign so nice that pauper class must be so numerous there plenty of room for improvement yet said maud one cant give man sovereign to go to dentist for one have one hair cut be really unpleasant thing manvers stared pensively at fire of course one body be most rough ill made machine said oculist told other day that lens of eye be very imperfect instrument that must make much better lens nowadays body be only natural thing there be left see in how very inferior nature be may sat silent whole tone of conversation especially manvers last speech grated on longed to get up say what thought somehow felt awkward uncultivated manvers glib tongue easy sentence seemed to like buzzing of mosquito in dark little thing doubt sufficient to make one very uncomfortable be life with hope fear aim possibility limitation just food for epigram paradox spoken between two cigarette cup of coffee be poor drudge unhappy of world no more to of three than peg on to hang idle joke about convenience of modern life if manvers did not mean what said be terrible enough if did be more terrible still why did not tom say something stop unseemly jesting feeling have have at dinner that be talking about thing did not understand care for have given place to keener more poignant indignation that be talking of thing of knew nothing loved cared for with soul be poor poor simply in order to administer to pleasure of rich be there mighty merciful plan working behind through misery poverty wealth happiness at last must bear no longer got up out of chair walked slowly up to fireplace manvers instantly rose drew chair up for be afraid must find cold over there said thanks please dont get up said may stood warming hand for moment then turned to think be terrible to talk like said turning frightful suffering poverty see around into mere jest of course did not mean what said be subject for jesting manvers be vexed angry to take thing seriously appeared to almost unpardonable breach of social etiquette really be not decent assure meant said replied though of course be quite right about terrible misery poverty round dont deny tragic side of for moment be optimist prefer to look on brighter side of thing instead of dwelling on tragedy horror of poverty like to dwell on more cheerful aspect namely immense convenience affords to people who be not poor in be bound to say find certain consolation room be dark maud did not see how grave may face be listened to what manvers said laughed then for moment there be dead silence until may spoke again then do really think that three quarter of world be poor in order that one quarter may be able to make do distasteful work for oh dont go a far a said manvers dont attempt to account for poverty misery only notice perfectly obvious effect of unequal distribution of wealth namely that rich can get almost unpleasant thing done for by proxy in exchange for varying quantity of gold silver can never have seen real misery of poverty if can talk about like said may manvers lit cigarette ah there be wrong said have known real grinding poverty when dont know how where will get next meal dont ever speak of because a said prefer cheerful side of life be unpleasant confess did not make martyr of dont like martyr so why must look on others in same state a martyr tom have left room moment before came back during last speech knew what manvers early history have be be surprised to hear mention regarded knew a sensitive people regard slight deformity may looked up at manvers be sorry said of course didnt know feel very deeply about thing then will spare little pity for early year too said laughing be charming of good heaven after ten tom must go at once if will lend latchkey neednt wake anybody up maud got up ive got to go down to house said father be making statistical speech there will be division be so tiresome speaking to night must have liked to sit in armchair for ever good night mr carlingford do know cant call mr carlingford longer good night may do come see again soon tom went to see maud off came back to library may be sitting in one of big chair with hand idle on lap tom threw down on sofa near stared at ceiling london suit said to night

awfully fond of be nearly always amusing yes seems clever said may tom be silent moment really be lucky devil said have everything want have first of life interest amuses ive just paid annual visit to dentist will go to applethorpe for sunday asked may oh think not said tom at least unless want to think applethorpe must seem little dull dont well there be not so many thing to do there a here

saturday saturday before tom gave answer for moment ill do exactly a like said well go on saturday if wish let go said may mr manvers can come with go to chathams know want to stay there day two why

retreating serenity must be delightful if must come said with effort ill write note to to night chapter xii easter be late when tom may left london to spend week two with old mr carlingford at applethorpe spring have already burst out into freshest greenest leaf a drove along avenue from lodge gate may thought have never seen anything so beautiful ground sloped sharply from road up on side russet of last year dead bracken be mingled with milky green of fresh new shoot here there ash tree with black bud lime on little fan of green leaf be beginning to burst from red sheath stood firmly among young yearly plant experienced guarantee to steadfast kindness of varying season now then white scutted rabbit bundled across road squirrel whisked up to safer eminence scolded violently from among branch a passed lake moorhen half swam half flew to seek shelter of rhododendron bush leaving widening ripple behind sudden gust of wind arose shaking dozen catkin from listless birch tree whole air be redolent of spring country promise of fresh life tom be driving may sat beside have not be very well for week two a wind struck thought shivered slightly youre not cold be darling said tom only very happy laughed well so be dont shiver put that cloak round do remember giving coat one night tom asked yes be so obstinate too refused to put on for long time drove on in silence for little way be

line perfectly say that scribe be terrible fellow for scamping work making stupid mistake must be shown up there be bigger thing in world than scribe scholiast tom said may half timidly yes dear what be man to do can not work passionately at thing doe not feel passionately there be one thing be one duty to feel passionately when man go into church seems to sort of visible sign that doe feel passionately there be other thing in world said tom what be beauty made for love anything lovely surely be worth giving one life for if there be only meant to be one thing in world be right for men to strive after mean personal direct relation with god why be wonderful beautiful thing given not just to look at wonder go by to help to realize personal direct relation with god must look on a sign of love for do remember first present gave that little diamond ring be awfully pretty loved because gave tom be silent use talking of darling even with said at last be passion have passion neither of can really conceive that there be standpoint besides own acquiesce in there being others unless one experience thing one can not feel be not afraid tom said will teach in way be best for to be taught if be willing to receive will give knowledge of when be good that receive there be at one said tom that believe with whole soul reached home just a evening be falling night came on warm cloudless tom helped may very tenderly out of carriage after tea walked little up down gravel path above long terrace bed be already odorous with spring blossom white winged moth hovered noiselessly over flower glided silently away again like ghost into surrounding dusk mist be rising little from low lying field towards village across two country lad be walking home one with empty milk pail in hand other with spade over shoulder whistling loudly in dusk husband wife spoke together of dear event be coming in human love longing soul met mingled may thought more of barrier still stood between even in almost perfect love confidence in clear unquestioning faith be apt to lose sight too much of use value of beauty love life be a directly gift from god a faith to wonder with something like anguish when thought how completely have possession of husband what end must be now that fulness perfection of woman life be promised too for little felt sweetness strength of living be woman crown of womanhood be coming to divine miracle be near fulfilment be alone in hush of evening beneath opening star with husband thing human divine seemed so mingled together that failed of completeness next few day passed very peaceably may who have be rather languid out of spirit in london soon regained serene health tom strolled together in wood drove out for hour two day ted father be with good deal tom who have rather overworked in last few week found new pleasure in hanging about doing nothing may insisted on going long ride walk in must not join after spending morning quietly in wood with tom paddling about on lake exploring little creek island must send tom ted off together in afternoon for long tramp ride over surrey down have spent one of afternoon about week after have come to applethorpe in manner about four oclock have descended on to little red backed village standing in hollow of down surrounded by hop garden strawberry field having have tea in country inn proceeded homewards way lay through village street with neat white cottage long strip of garden fronting road in one be flowering clump of primrose border of merry daffodil lay underneath window in more ambitious show have be planned sundry little wooden label stuck about in bed of young fresh green not yet in flower promised crop of annual in box hedge cut into fantastic shape gave genteel privacy marked off from neighbour little norman church stood at bottom of street just a passed gate group of mourner came away from grave sexton be filling in tom waited for to pas stood moment watching ascend street went in noticed at house with box hedge moment afterwards clergyman who knew tom came out a stopped to speak to tom asked what funeral have be poor woman here said who died in childbed two day ago poor thing leaf husband nice young fellow quite alone have only be married nine month tom turned angrily round on astonished young man how can say such horrible thing said walked off followed by ted at five mile hour ted caught up in few moment made abate pace poor old boy said dont get in such state about walked on few moment in silence too horrible broke out tom at length how can such thing be poor darling have be brute to life be lived apart really think passion of life be more than plaything sent to amuse passion of hers be unintelligible to be more than beautiful unconvincing fable what if fable be true asked ted may be true how can tell know be that isnt convincing to may be so may not if doesnt convince what be to do must give world to be convinced of be very happy in love said ted be best sweetest woman on earth said tom love more more day do love art too life must be incomplete impossible without either ted sighed be very fortunate circle of completeness be widening day be in love with love life teddy do leave place said tom earnestly be changing always be narrow know a often told be getting narrower only care about dead thing have better care about worst of living thing than best of dead so tell one can realize one el conviction a have also told be playing symphony to deaf may be so may not be so how can tell know be so said tom sometimes think must be so know at rate that for instance get more keen active happiness out of life than do best emendation doesnt give quality of pleasure smell of spring morning hundred other thing give told so do know said tom why dont act on cant there be other reason be use to say to myself will care for spring morning more than care for zenobius dont care passionately for zenobius dont care at for spring morning agree with to certain extent know said tom more at rate than used to at cambridge think scholiast ought to be studied be leaf line in book of ultimate perfection have got out of focus be too close to eye conceal everything else well here be at vicarage good bye teddy must go home quickly tom passed along village street at church suddenly word of clergyman came back to with sickening sense of revulsion paused at door moment then by sudden impulse went in knelt down in nearest seat be not aware of conscious thought only of overmastering need why be here thought to who have right here then like overwhelming wave thought of may came upon may love of strong young life soon to be in pain perhaps in danger of death like woman in cottage with box hedge with yet unborn

chapter xv be probably true that when thing be at worst begin to mend little complication common to man sometimes exhibit ghastly ingenuity of contrivance before most desirable point be reached a manvers said be wonderful creature beautifully adapted for bearing thing nature have be merciful enough to give most of weak point when weak point be touched be privileged to break down maud whose moral nature be very robust be not physically strong that night fainted incontinently in middle of dinner doctor came doctor whose word be literally word of gold said worry overstrain change of air out of door sunshine mauds determination to leave london be made easy for lady ramsden have managed to survive husband be continuing to enjoy unagitated widowhood usual ill health in house on norfolk coast have grown little stouter shade duller trifle more monosyllabic otherwise time seemed to have let be replied to lady chathams letter that must be delighted to see maud that health be indifferent maud must probably be rather lonely if wanted sea air sunshine must not do better than come must be charmed to have must say day hour of arrival whether be going to bring maid lady ramsdens house stood on edge of short turfed norfolk down within hundred yard of sea sand cliff nibbled off short by wave rose thirty foot from beach grass fine smooth covered to edge fitting mound hollow so exactly that looked a if have be measured for green baize billiard cloth mile to north red roofed little town of cromer went trooping down to shore with tall grave tower seeming to confer air of safety to whole not checking terrible tendency in town to run to seed a be on side in row of jerry built villa at time of year villa be still unoccupied for most part town be fishing village once more maud arrived in afternoon drew in long breath of fresh sea air with sense of relief of struggle over be tired overdone tired of life of worry of sensation thought that here perhaps must stay still being cut off from thought of agitating impossibility of fruitless self restraint of thrice fruitless desire there be air of complete contented repose about big landscape wide flat sea tide be up sea looked full prosperous little curling ripple washed up over sand now then one more energetic than fellow thrust out sharp tongue to very base of sandy cliff then drew back again with louder murmur of content round house be rambling uneven lawn only half broken in a be retaining something of freedom of grass clad sandhills satisfying medley of flower bed full of great hardy plant cared nothing for brisk salt air nasturtium great flaring double poppy velvet tassel of love lie bleeding thick leaved stone crop sturdy health seemed key note of place at tea saw lady ramsden who strove to convey to that be glad to see that niece be also staying with coming have be very sudden upsetting that have gone over to cromer for tennis party must be back before dinner a soon a tea be over maud went out again struck for edge of sandy cliff ah relief of getting away from london away from possibility of seeing tom from possibility of torturing herself of leading into temptation surely be possible here with great shining sea on one side firm landscape on other to regain belief in serenity to recapture uncomplicated outlook took off hat let bracing air from sea blow hair about mile off little fleet of herring boat be tacking with full stiff sail down coast to begin strange adventure of casting net into shifting immensity beneath deep fathomless sky above deep fathomless sea how did morning look to a broke in thin red line on horizon how interesting must be to be able to see world just for moment with other eye to be rid for one deep drawn breath of weight of one own stale identity be in direction salvation lay meant to cease focussing eye on own microscopic trouble to gain wider outlook how much more attainable such idea seemed here where there be breadth of vision horizon not bounded by house roof london be mere warren full of silly gossiping rabbit must never see beyond street corner through smoke light in west flamed paled maud began to retrace step felt better already oh how right miss vanderbilt have be about seat of emotion must dose with sea air must bathe in sun sea must get back old serenity interest in thing uncomplicated outlook how pretty house looked standing out against still ruddy sky with light in window there be one standing in porch girl must be lady ramsdens niece maud felt quite pleased to have companion must walk ride bathe together lady ramsdens niece on side carlingford ramsden door be opened just before maud got up to girl be standing by lamp in hall opening note when entered a looked at mauds heart suddenly stood still then jumped up into throat poised hammering there be need to ask on side be lady ramsdens niece for a maud came in turned for moment came on like horrible dream almost thought stood face to face with tom girl looked up with little raising of eyebrow maud have so often seen in tom greeted be surely miss wrexham be not said coming forward with boyish frankness be too delightful to meet think know cousin tom have have tea yes wonder where aunt be violet carlingford led way to drawing room where lady ramsden be lying on sofa by carefully shaded lamp wheezy asthmatic pug lay snoring at foot looked incarnation of incompetence so have met said introduced yourselves violet laughed dont think introduced much said said arent miss wrexham how be aunty not very well dear said flo isnt very well either listen to breathing violet smiled two dimple came into face be hardly so deep a tom in exactly same place there need to listen said will not come to dinner went on lady ramsden in thin voice two will dine alone what time do like dinner maud usually have at eight will suit oh yes what be maid name lady ramsden got bell rung for got taken out of room pug be hoisted on to velvet cushion be carried before in such manner did greek carry emblem of god before image a maud looked at violet saw that likeness be even more extraordinary went deeper than have noticed at first violet must hardly have be more than twenty feature be still unsexed be tall for girl slightly built walk way of sitting rather lolling a be lolling now reminded maud exactly of what tom have be when came to stay with once while be at eton sat laughing talking with at end of five minute a naturally a if have known life have tom short square tipped nose clear open brown eye with long fine eyelash thin straight eyebrow mouth like be rather full lipped often even when be not speaking white of teeth showed between lip in straight narrow line manner be even more fundamentally have tom trick of wrinkling nose up slightly when be amused of putting head slightly on one side when be listening considering in speaking of just perceptibly slurring r of separating word one from other more like foreigner with perfect command of english than englishman violet strolled about room just a did putting book two straight making little face at pug saucer of tea with cream in lay untasted in corner violet disliked that pug be fat lazy wheezy selfish gave little sketch of character soon sat down near began on more personal topic be delightful to have here said hope will make great friend always want to be doing something day if like playing golf tennis bathing riding im sure will get on maud be leaning back in chair feeling somehow unaccountably shy be quite startled when came in said be so extraordinarily like cousin violet crossed one leg over other clasped hand behind head havent seen tom for age said when be younger be exactly alike tom be wicked of once dressed up in skirt cloak hat of mine went into mother room asked if wanted anything in town a be going there with governess mother gave sort of feminine commission never suspected till burst out laughing mother mine be sister father brother know have changed much be still exactly like said maud who be beginning to feel more at ease tom getting quite famous isnt girl went on will serve to differentiate he got baby how funny seems always said must never grow up hasnt grown up much said maud be just like boy still in many way such pity one have to get older remarked violet im sure will never enjoy so much when be old will get stuffy think about complication worry at present never worry maud smiled be afraid must be getting old said in fact came here in order to forget complication worry violet sat up with air of surprise oh please dont worry said will spoil can have such charming time if like maud rose will do best to worry more said will help voice have wonderful sweetness tenderness about violet got up too stood close to why thats charming of said dont think must ever help anybody will promise never to worry if be use miss wrexham utmost use said maud be not miss wrexham have left miss wrexham in london have done with may never see be wicked little fool well maud then said girl maud woke next morning slowly blissfully conscious of new interest in life of step taken to be quit of london fuss worry be step taken new interest be more vital of two violet have sat up late night before talking maud found something exquisitely sweet in being able to look at almost facsimile of have made life bitter to to be able to talk almost hear tom answering to be able to see eye looking into hers with affection tenderness for maud have told violet without of course mentioning name story of worry break down have loved man that have married that desire of meeting strain of doing so have made london unbearable have affected health maud be one of people who often make friend of own sex relief merely of telling one about be great when felt be almost telling to tom a violet sat opposite bitterness struggle have be enduring so many month seemed quenched at last already perplexity seemed capable of solution must not have anticipated new interest be violet felt a if manvers have be wrong when remarked cynically that nature did not happen to have given two people to love in case one got married felt a if have almost cheated fate a if substitute have be provided for to love will be with day thought maud a watched maid moving about room must will make fond of if can do will feel a if at last tom cared indeed seemed very hard task maud have great power of attraction when cared to attract have already won violet heart by confidence of night before there be nothing so exquisite a to feel that one be trusted friendship man may have for man woman for woman be often closer more intimate than even between husband wife however close man may be to woman there still stand between barrier of sex one have yet succeeded in annihilating member of two different sex must look at thing with different eye attempt of woman to become like man seems only to emphasize difference certainly violet must do for maud what man must possibly do girl can say to girl what wife must say to husband for there be certain thing man can never understand simply because be not woman woman because be woman must have be impossible for maud to tell story of trouble to one girl seemed to that very telling of have taken away burden burden removed body be able to recuperate for when body be hurt through soul can not be cured until soul be convalescent living day in open air drinking in fresh saltness of sea returning to first principle of healing began to have legitimate effect if air be bracing violet be still more bracing convalescence of body soul kept pace with other have be playing tennis one morning have gone down to bathe afterwards two be sitting on edge of beach violet with hat off trying to persuade hair to behave reasonably maud have already dried hers be absorbed in attempting to hit pug who have accompanied down to sea absolutely refused to wash with small pebble shell hate that dog remarked violet wish must hit wish must said maud there went over think can forgive one anything said violet except laziness want of interest not to be interested in thing not to be thoroughly alive be only unpardonable sin ive be sinning unpardonably for last six month what fool have be making of violet wrinkled nose poor darling didnt refer to same be foolish of world be so hard said maud violet held up forefinger warningly now know be one of thing be not allowed to say how old be twenty five for how many year did say have be completely happy twenty three half violet flicked warm sea scented air with end of towel well then must be ashamed maud must be ashamed especially when know be beginning to be happy again thats doing be talking about not violet voice came out of middle of towel youll please keep to subject just fancy ever being good for anybody how funny seems maud lay back on rug tilting hat over eye very nice warm kind world just now added oh violet will last man be creature of mood especially woman especially mean never have mood in life what must do supposing something went wrong supposing something happened to like what happened to must send for to come stay with at aunt julias said violet must throw pebble at loathsome dog must hit too violet towel flapped through air descended on flos head maud laughed a dog got up shook free of towel then lay down pathetically on top of seriously went on if wanted something very badly couldnt get must do violet rescued towel resumed seat havent got many want know said so cant tell hope must be reasonable hope must make real effort to cease to want then know one get over thing take time doubt everything worth doing take time ah thats so terrible said maud just show how limited be if be only stronger must never get used to being without thing want be because be weak feeble that begin to forget want to know how be to be strong yet to forget violet stared absently at sea understand what mean said think be wrong after be human cant get over think woman who cant make effort to forget who go on nursing sorrow be feebler than one who can of course time help oh yes of course be right be very old fashioned know dont care about dissecting analyzing tendency thinking about limitation aspiration seems to that if be inexperienced a be may kill a be in analysis blind altogether by peering too closely go on said maud be so healthy violet turned to lay down close beside yes want to be healthy anyhow said be main point think way people dissect own morbid self put in three volumed pickle jar so to speak for friend to look at be simply indecent if have decayed tooth dont show to friend say be much worse since last week go to dentist have stopped dear dentist said maud im so glad came to to tell that life be hard complicated continued violet be to make so because one always belief one self to say that be simple simplifies of course people like complicated so suppose be right to tell that be to tell that be complicated then be sorry for be foolishness hate complication said maud hate a much a hate that pug supposing find simple thing dull at least supposing after complication find simple thing liked before bore complication change one know dont know remarked violet do mean that be bored with place mean nothing of sort said maud be only speculating bell for lunch went ten minute ago simplest lunch wouldnt bore to day said violet violet whistled to pug stood for moment with head little on one side looking at disgustedly be most astonishingly like tom said maud looked just like when be examining mr manvers statuette how did mr manvers look when looked at tom statue asked looked a pug look rather hurt able to do without tom appreciation how utterly different must be difference in world said maud then to herself one be man who love other pulled up man used to love chapter xvi may be driving home one afternoon towards end of june with sense of great well being baby be thriving a heartily a fondest mother must wish tom be a lovable a ever have got rather tired of going out to dine dance of late have more frequently spent evening alone with may two day before saw opening note obviously be invitation before have read said may if be for dinner time in next week be engaged to dine with at home guess have be correct be going to spend evening alone at home there be always certain piece of ritual connected with baby cult to be gone through though tom expressed impatience sometimes at length of service knew that sight of may bending over first born be very pretty one often wished be painter a well a sculptor demeter have passed through hand of pointer tom be at work again on for meant to finish day after day spent chisel in hand working down whole surface till found statue various people remembering two statuette tom have exhibited eighteen month ago wanted to know if there be more to be have for two have sold at once for high price though tom have after conversion expressed unmercenary intention of throwing cheque into fire when asked whether be working at anything be shown demeter became thoughtful said good morning altogether may be more than satisfied went quickly up step into house thinking how terrible be that have not set eye on tom baby since half past eleven that morning there be note for on hall table saw with sudden spasm of anxiety that be from husband tore open quickly read father business have failed heard morning have have stroke have gone down there at once have better follow may read note through twice before thoroughly grasped meaning waited only one moment to steady then went quickly upstairs to give order for small trunk to be packed for to say good bye to baby tom have received news just after lunch be quite unable to remember where may have gone have come in to tell that must not be in till six that be lunching somewhere then going somewhere else tom be finishing vein on back of demeter drooping hand have only said yes dear yes without looking up may felt one moment of slight pique have not repeated message saying to herself that if did not care to know did not care to tell have arrived at applethorpe two hour afterwards there learned that there be probably hope father be lying quite unconscious thought perhaps might rally for few minute before end so tom sat waited sun moved slowly round to west be not till golden light have begun to be tinged with red that father moved opened eye saw tom sitting by snapped finger in face of king of terror im stone broke tom said lucky for that learned to break stone with jest on lip went out without hope fear into valley of shadow suddenness of what have happened for time stunned obliterated thought in tom mind though father be old blurring decay have touched with forewarning hand be in half dream tom went down from death chamber into library telegram announced failure have fluttered down on to floor warm garden scented breeze streamed in through open window stirred now then a if be twitched by unseen hand book father have be reading be still standing open on desk of reading chair where have be sitting when news came everything be pitilessly unchanged servant have come in to draw down blind tom stopped be use of unmeaning decorum tom have be very fond of father thought of may baby must not make picture in mind father like many very rich men seldom never spoke of money tom wondered vaguely with growing anxiety how complete smash be delight of poverty of being out at elbow working passionately for living at work loved presented in rather different colour to man with wife infant son from glowing difficulty have painted for a ardent bachelor of twenty two what if worst feared be true if be absolute pauper thought went back again to father lying dead upstairs tom remembered so vividly last time have seen standing with may baby in porch when went up to london have taken extraordinary interest in baby used to hazard cynical speculation a to future used to allude to a mr thomas in order to differentiate from tom mr thomas solemnity be overpowering said once make feel a if be small boy talking to wise old gentleman juvenile offender waiting for awful judge to pronounce sentence on make realize what be meant by rich silence mr thomas at moment broke into own rich silence by very creditable howl grandfather added mark how opulently cry tom met may at door went together up to room where father lay did not tell what old man last word have be found mr markham waiting for below when came down three talked together till grew late stopped to dinner afterwards when may have gone to bed tom mentioned subject of smash mr markham shook head gravely do either london house applethorpe belong to asked rent poor boy be sure be right in telling to prepare for worst remember from talk have with father once that greater part of money be in business rest in two australian bank broke last year tom stood up frowned never told that never spoke about money know have not idea of probably thought be unnecessary for believe have most utter confidence in partner have seen evening paper appears that there have never be so complete smash except perhaps argentine have got paper asked tom not with dont look at paper about why not because there be very unjust thing said about father of course know quite well that have nothing to do with management of company what infernal slander said tom hotly do mean think have nothing literally nothing be possible may mean that what be to happen to bill havent paid demanded tom

be not kind of venture fit for steady going house have turned out well have lost head little when saw six month profit safely harvested in two have be led on by prospect of making fortune by few successful coup into speculation be on far side of risky luck have be against have attempted to get back loss by even more adventurous mean appeared that for two year mr carlingfords income have be paid not out of profit out of capital then came coup de grce younger partner have got into hand of money lender have sunk deeper deeper when found that own signature be considered valueless have signed note of hand in name of house father trying to shield son have speculated wildly in certain south american security have failed inasmuch a mr carlingford be still partner be liable for debt of house be feared that even complete sale of furniture stable must hardly cover liability even after other stock share held have be disposed of to tom nothing remained left by godmother must not be touched by father creditor against that have to set own outstanding bill about felt unpleasantly vague anxiety secretly felt must scarcely confess even to have full belief in own power must have be faithless thing to doubt at very moment when test be to be applied talked matter out fully frankly with may if have private anxiety at rate have not will be awfully poor dear said dont know what there

wallingthorpe have not touch of artist proverbial jealousy if saw suspected talent did utmost to foster encourage in tom suspected something more boy persistence in working at heathen goddess really have filled with genuine pain ventured to touch on subject one night when tom be sitting together after dinner what will work at next began demeter be lady name be not be nearly finished believe yes

alike have sacrificed to demeter persephone hierarchy of olympus may call apostate on day cease to said tom will be not just yet chapter xvii must be acknowledged tom heart have sunk little when saw flat in bloomsbury thought of may with queenly madonna like beauty moving through low room sitting by small paned window seemed dreadfully incongruous when may came a did few day later tom found that effect be that room be glorified be characteristic of that before settling into new narrow house made clean sweep of everything be unnecessary marketable argued that have better start with little capital rather than few bibelots that couple of piece of dresden china valuable terra cotta from tanagra must only look absurdly out of place among appurtenance of cheap lodging may have small tussle over few picture old mr carlingford have given during lifetime be not good picture argued tom dont in case see what want with besides appears that there half year rent owing for grosvenor square house must sell everything may only hope there will be something over blue blood of carlingfords ought to be up a far a be concerned isnt think might keep picture two said may dear may impossible cant think what must do if have nothing over suppose one must lend something may frowned idea grated on cant do tom thats impossible besides who be there perhaps lady ramsden might said tom certainly must if occurred to dont think thing occur to much quite feel with about borrowing outstanding debt when added together made total rather appalled tom be with anxiety that awaited result of sale upshot be that be possessor of capital tom drew rather long face when thought of rapidity with money used to melt in old day demeter must be finished in few week have settled in during first week of july a sat together after dinner talked matter over to of appeared rather amusing than otherwise to dine off leg of mutton rice pudding at top of house in bloomsbury may with view to being useful have have interview with cook retailed to tom will have poached egg for breakfast said at lunch rest of mutton a hash think hash be delicious tom be looking over figure s d be exact amount may said isnt that awful lot said may why ted used to live on at cambridge know said be possible to get on on much le tom grinned wonder what used to spend at cambridge said wish have of now may sat down by tom think

learned must have have to hire two of italian fellow must have be end of expense six week from now will see done may be difficult to realize unless one have tried how hard be for man who have be accustomed to live if not luxuriously at least extremely comfortably to maintain cheerfulness when have to make shilling go a far a can tom who have be always very extravagant simply because have never be obliged to learn value of money be suddenly brought face to face with widely known fact that wanting thing be not same a getting may have least realized what be to live in atmosphere of slight discomfort to have smell of dinner steal up hour before dinner time invade corner of house to be waited upon by slatternly girl who breathed very hard have dirty hand to sit on horse hair sofa to have cracked mirror over fireplace to be obliged to consider relative price of beef mutton to banish once for ever idea of eating well cooked food detail seem small enough when detail of life be slightly disagreeable however trifling be in make up ensemble be slightly disagreeable too before lost money tom may must have declared that must not possibly make difference to of provided be together that house must smell of dinner that a soon a one castor of table be repaired broke even a water will wear away stone little thing wore away edge of serenity july be broiling hot that year day by day sun baked studio where tom worked till be like oven blind of skylight be tattered ray of light came hotly down a if through magnifying glass making little bright spot on dingy wall tom got rather exasperated one morning because in adjusting blind have torn further long jagged slit of light fell on face a worked must have to be mended in evening something must be done at once with brilliant inspiration got blacking pot painted offending glass with then brush slipped from hand fell on top of demeter head took tom ten minute to get sponge clean be certainly more comfortable in grosvenor square tried to persuade that thing be detail a indeed be soon blacking caked off with heat of sun came filtering down in tiny flake gash of light fell down into studio again tom lost temper

progress have be regal dignified have congested traffic of house for three quarter of hour so may used often to take baby into british museum where god goddess seem to live in perpetually equable atmosphere be here that mr thomas made first piece of deductive reasoning pointed one day with little pink fist to horse head in parthenon pediment distinctly said gee gee tom be delighted considered manvers entirely refuted in belief that elgin marble be unintelligible even baby must understand two day later mr thomas conferred similar distinction on tom own work when after prolonged wide eyed inspection said lady tom worked a much a must without model copying exactly clay sketch for lady arm one be necessary too helped to melt certainly have superb arm stood splendidly also added contribution not unimportant one to little jar sometimes occurred between tom may be young woman of unquestionably fine physique tongue be rather unruly member spoke freely tom used to tell to be quiet stand sometimes came out with something very breezy sudden once made particularly breezy remark when may be there may turned to tom flushing asked in french to tell to be quiet tom who have great sympathy with life in form model remark be not particularly vicious form smiled told to be silent may left room girl eye followed out of room then without moving spoke to tom well aynt perticler

to have girl like in house tom crumbled bread attentively think take rather exaggerated view of dear said of course that class of young woman be not very particular in language what have to do with be wicked said may really seem to to build good deal on one remark of course be sorry heard expected to be allowed to talk a much a pleased at first stopped that tom how can condone sort of thing oh dont condone dont allow to talk besides one doesnt select model for moral for muscle do refuse to dismiss tom looked up in surprise surely cant expect to send away spend perhaps week perhaps more in getting in addition to have engaged for week more pay money let go said may dear may cant afford to throw model money about in manner have most beautiful hand wallingthorpe told have never seen lovely piece of modelling from elbow to finger tip ah said may suddenly dont know dont understand will never understand cant see what mean to tom must be very patient gentle think youve worked up about may

be really unable to understand wife seemed to wholly unreasonable girl be one of ordinary class wallingthorpe have often employed a tom knew be rather particular fanciful in choice have once told tom in florid manner that made unable to work if knew that woman whom be using to help out idea of what thing must be did not live up to splendid possibility just so model have made improper remark remark by way must have passed with laugh if made by man among men be seriously expected to dismiss to pay for extra week lose time in hunting for who must not possibly be a good tom have begun to get in fever to have demeter finished felt be to be challenge if demeter be not good be not of best have be wrong have done what wallingthorpe have told be doing trying to fly only succeeding in standing on tiptoe sort of scene have be through with may threw out of gear dimmed eye unnerved hand why must not be more tolerant le apt to judge of course tom confessed be right in principle if must get two identical model one of whom be breezy other not must choose unbreezy one have model character to do with muscle besides may be building absurd superstructure on very slight foundation be ridiculous

fear thirty pound be solid fraction of capital what must happen next must not pay surely must wait tom thought with regretful sigh of patient tradesman who have so often waited till must bother to draw cheque somehow by strange unreasonableness now that be in want of money be almost eager to pay debt whereas when never thought about money at never felt slightest inclination to do so fate be playing with frightening have horrible dread of surprise felt that inner knowledge of sum owing must be poison besides must be necessary to keep from may thought of concealing thing from may be untenable answer came back from agent no bill have not be sent in before tom went on working with mechanical accuracy thinking of horrible thirty pound after why pay at once of course there must be kind of difficulty with tradesman remembered ordering block with price be large one have not dealt at shop before man have hesitated wondering if master must wish to send before have be paid for when tom gave grosvenor square address be perfectly satisfied what wanted be to gain time thirty pound represented so many day work why cut off demeter must be finished must show world what meant artist

have said well thats right at rate thought to will tell may filled pipe sat in window elbow on sash forty foot below lay hot street down sun shone pitilessly soon sank below house roof merciful little breeze sprang up from west tom leant out to enjoy more let ruffle hair be tired weary brain went back to same old incessant question what next what next supposing demeter be success not in sense of

next what next there be may baby there be nurse there be left out of reckoning others have to be reckoned for must get money somehow if demeter brought none where be to come from thought of horrible little statuette may kept on mantelpiece went to look at be not finished must not take long to finish must come to be that shrunken reality to dream of art be going to awake for felt conclusively

bill stand over when demeter be finished asked may when be finished will have done best if others think best good tom left sentence unfinished chapter xviii maud spent month with lady ramsden four epoch making week note of change have be struck in when met violet have expanded into harmonious chord just a healthy physical surroundings produce physical health so intimacy with healthy minded people produce corresponding well being in soul thus recuperated be able to make effort have be unable to make before when returned to london at end of july congratulated on change that alone knew of a much a friend congratulated on change must see parliament be not to rise before th of august chathams be to remain in london till then during fortnight maud saw tom constantly often going to see may in bloomsbury tom with without may more than once coming to see old camaraderie day of athens seemed to be renewing tom found maud stimulating in way may must not be partly because loved wife partly although loved with may responsibility asserted be always aware of increasing anxiety a to what must happen to crouching in mind ready to spring knew must not help knowing may did not really understand how essential art be to how inexorable be inner need of producing best must how bad how immoral statuette of boy with rifle seemed to have not artistic nature have never except in known man who served that most exacting of mistress whose service be passion to slave for manvers a often said be not like poet who sing because must who sing because choose to sing be clever diabolically clever liked to exercise intelligence with maud then tom must both throw off at least not be scourged by responsibility also knew that understood how terrible struggle might have to go through must be there be always possibility ahead that one must want to posse of shining god goddess if so be financially impossible for to go on producing three be sitting on balcony where manvers maud have sat alone one night only month two ago a usual in presence tom promethean eagle have ceased pecking at for time have hopped away out of sight may be feeling little out of little neglected for tom be talking to maud in way did not talk to be never anything kind considerate to hurried luncheon ate together in grilling little flat be often rather silent affair if morning work have be satisfactory tom be only eager to finish get to work again if have got on badly promethean eagle always seemed aware of applied claw beak to tenderest place with accuracy of experience with maud be altogether different partly doubt for reason stated above partly also because most well mannered loving husband trouble to talk if be not inclined to talk in privacy of domestic luncheon table thirdly a may knew be not a maud expressed dialogist be of dialogists tom be talking now incidentally be behaving like dialogists think maud be saying that im about best sort of dialogist not only can talk quite intelligently agreeably cant may im first rate listener good listening be not necessary for dialogist said tom dialogists enjoy most when talk together a used to do at athens oh youre wrong said maud dialogist must know that other be sympathique easiest way of conveying be by listening well yes know be sympathique to said tom so dont care whether listen not besides listening be rather despicable quality dont think youve got know so im not being rude may got up well must go said said id be back by three to take mr thomas out oh dont go yet said maud why youve only just finished lunch must tom can stop here may be conscious that required little magnanimity to say at same time that threw pinch of bitterness into magnanimity wished maud to know that knew that be tom not maud wanted to talk to though have not spoken with idea of word conveying be not sorry that might bear such interpretation tom did not dive into such feminine subtlety though maud suspected will stop bit if im not in way said meant to take holiday afternoon will take here maud stood drumming with finger on balustrade for moment two after may have gone be first time have be alone with tom since stay in norfolk revelled in sense of security for felt old camaraderie feeling touch of more disturbing result from companionship be with air word of comrade that spoke think ought to have gone with may said can say that to for know how glad be personally that stayed tom looked up why because wanted to go be sure of dont think so do said maud dont be banal say ought to know because be husband thats argument be man be impossible for to understand woman a woman can unreasonable again be argument oh good heaven tom if be reasonable what simple world must be how dull im not sure dont prefer dulness to excitement said tom wait till youve have fright then see how appreciate uneventfulness ah dulness be not synonym for content said maud speaking from new experience be great mistake to suppose that tom flicked off end of cigarette ash for last few week have deliberately stifled certain thought with maud there be need to stifle be not sure said of course one aim at content one aim at nothing else one aim at think because one know be unattainable there be such thing a content for people who be alive know what mean by alive think have talked about before for human being to be content be to be limited yes to be human be to be limited be talking like maiden aunt know tom looked up smiling have distinction of having invented least applicable definition possible of whats opposite to maiden aunt married niece suppose there be label be not married unite quality be rarely united be experienced be fresh how do do might much more reasonably ask that not at at present feel like blas baby tom suddenly became overwhelmingly conscious of have stifled so long anxiety over petty money matter sordidness of life in little flat in bloomsbury be trifle there be other thing be not trifle may loved other that believed apart from love to other passion lay a far sundered a two pole be invisible incomprehensible to other be said have felt feel passion for something will be afraid have to abandon be telling thing have told to one hardly to myself a know art be passion to there be one art so think be trying to realize have to face probability that will not be appreciated already call probability if so will have to abandon because have other tie need for bread butter rightly outweighs else not that be le enthusiastic one can neither live triumph by enthusiasm there be claim outweigh enthusiasm artistic conviction oh two must not actually come in conflict said maud be absurd to suppose that will have to abandon idea of art at very outset because be not marketable besides most purchaser be philistine be exactly what fear said tom of course dont say for moment can produce good thing have idea of beauty must work for a long a can perhaps great encouragement from one must mend case world regard with disconcerting indifference manvers think delver after uninteresting survival may be right again may be that majority of purchaser think manvers right be of course indisputable need not make blas said maud tom be silent what hungered for be active sincere sympathy from may be not to be have seemed to regard possible abandonment of practice of art a must regard other change of employment a if for instance tom be butcher found necessary to become baker have a acknowledged to taken impossible view of might be to be in love with still a much a even more than when married have realized that did not must not sympathize fully with aim at first have seemed a if there be nothing must not do for a if two be wholly inevitably one without loving le have learned that be not so have one passion have to support passion singly most rudimentary code of loyalty forbade saying anything of kind to maud be right said have great many illusion left one cant be blas if one have illusion of course still have illusion that demeter be going to be masterpiece necessity of wondering whether masterpiece be marketable cloud illusion little oh be certainly not blas said maud with conviction how can man married to woman love working at what love not only for sake to supply actual need be blas ought to keep young for ever be quarter of century old said tom must like to live till hundred good thing to be alive do know line of whitman cant quote exactly let take hand help other to day because be alive together mauds eye kindled like great big common idea like said mr manvers must think be sign of approaching bourgeoisie old age after be alive who be to help except except other added with fine superiority to grammar holding out hand to tom tom smiled dimple came just now struck maud that be so like cousin instead of other way about believe understand said to understand one be greatest benefit can do lady chatham returned before long from unnecessary call undertaken chiefly because carriage have to go way be most convenient thing in world urged tom to stop for tea be consequently nearly six when left house way lay across park from albert gate to marble arch loitered for maud have replenished serenity when be serene be not in hurry be hot afternoon by time got to serpentine bank be crowded with bather grass underneath big elm tree on side of row be covered with heap of clothes multitude of boy young men be standing about on bank swimming soft persuasive colour of english evening be there warm languor of south tom stood watching for time feeling rather a if gallery of antique statue have come to life of bather be very well made one particularly boy of about eighteen who be standing on bank resting on foremost foot other just touching ground with toe hand clasped behind head be long in leg short slight in body hair curled crisply on forehead a in greek bronze tom told that be lysippian went on way thinking what fine subject for statue isaac must make isaac waiting with faggot of wood on shoulder standing gracefully unthinkingly like boy have just seen not knowing who victim must be may meanwhile have taken mr thomas out for airing have have tea alone be feeling little ill used maud have be quite right tom thought ought to have come away with why well for reason except very important one wanted to stop then occurred to that candid enemy might say be in danger of becoming jealous of maud thought of made quite angry one have suggested except in tom mind vision of isaac be supplanted by other thought wondered whether have said too much whether by chance maud must guess trouble for knew be skilful at reading between line on way down oxford street determined to write line in order to counteract such undesirable possibility may be not in drawing room when got in taking up postcard for there be nothing private in what meant to say wrote be not blas at dont think be directed leaving with two three others for post went to see if may be in yet found with mr thomas who be little fractious who on tom entrance began yelling in way shouted volume for lung larynx tom bore for minute two a did not subside shouted out to may across

in bloomsbury may be out tom be in despair because breezy model have taken into head to demand higher wage for standing tom must not afford to pay more to part with have engaged till end of week at higher rate knew must not continue to do so indefinitely be walking up down studio when maud be sloppily announced by slip shod maid wondering what on earth be to be done may not here said be thunder clouded whats matter tom related woe of afternoon commented bitterly on rapacity of human race really dont know what to do said cant possibly keep her on at rate hard enough a be maud flushed suddenly seemed to have something to say be old friend began at length dont think will be offended at what be going to say will do favour will let lend money tom stopped suddenly in walk how must be offended asked be awfully kind of for must say yes at once why not there be may maud be silent moment vague impatience came over for have understood rather more than tom have meant to understand week ago why must know asked at length be matter between know people must refuse such thing at once be such comfort that be sensible have too much money have too little there can be reason why must not lend despite felt great anxiety tom must acquiesce thing be of importance must not help longing that tom must take offer not let may know feeling in mind be too undefined to lend to analysis be conscious of desiring in subtle manner beyond control tom answered at once must tell may must be out of question not to tell see that surely thank again for offer will tell to night perhaps will not object on other hand be afraid may have such feeling about of course can go on for month so what be to happen then if must get demeter finished clay sketch of other done will have done best if one buy maud

about how near be to actual want lie awake at night wondering if ought to tell be worried confess thought be so sure of aim at what believe to be best must sooner have produced that pointed to demeter than manvers thing for get what asks will be finished next week two three dealer be coming here to look at bought miserable statuette of mine readily enough of course cant make more of said maud understand tom flushed with pleasure believe do said though dont think one else doe manvers wallingthorpe think be half out of sheer perversity make what call heathen goddess be wrong do because must may be quite wrong about believe be artist if didnt think must have taken to statuette again moment lost money might a well tell to make plush bracket must probably do tolerably well if be not artist of course be wasting time when might be earning money cant sterilize that possibility just yet when have passion for thing be not easy to give up because have bank note hard said maud can not serve two master continued tom earnestly can not use gift believe may posse in other way than way believe to be best if worst come to worst if can not get living by oh impossible impossible cried before maud have time to reply door opened may came in too saw by tom face that something have happened why whats matter tom asked quickly nothing dear said getting up recovering with effort have have row with model say wont sit for more at present term so parted may give tea dear will want tea badly so doe miss wrexham may looked little vexed felt have not be told shook hand with maud remarked little curtly that did not know chathams be still in london only few day more said maud how splendidly demeter have got on may be little mollified yes tom be working very hard too hard think doesnt take

have model say have to pay unfortunately have very little to pay with must make little have last a long a possible what did maud wrexham say offered to lend may got up from where have be sitting next to with cheek blazing idea of borrowing at have be distasteful to idea that maud must have offered be intolerable offered to lend money what did say to may dear dont behave like said of course must ask may be on fire with indignation offer appeared to insult smarted under a horse under lash felt that vague disquietude for last week so be explained justified what business have tom to be on such term with anger included tom too have not rejected with surprise scorn said must consult asked what answer did suppose must give did think must say take tom know very little may do be reasonable said tom perhaps ought to have told sooner state be if one offer to buy demeter have to face fact that in limited time will have money left what be to do may hardly seemed to hear what said accepted offer

wrexham be old great friend of mine be unreasonable be unreasonable be not like have given answer of course accept decision dont let discus more be manner of use walked to door paused looking at made sign left room tom stood still for moment on narrow landing outside room patch of ruddy sunlight came through window lit stair struck on narrow strip of oilcloth did duty for carpet window be bordered with hideous orange coloured glass ray through fell on tom foot a stood there orange on blacking made abhorrent tone felt beaten dispirited whole place suddenly seemed intolerably sordid narrow strip of oilcloth be continued along landing be bordered on side by foot two of imperfectly stained board banister be of particularly flimsy build be characteristic of cheap lodging there be two bad print on wall one of king alfred cake other of duke of wellington with impressionist background of battle of waterloo to tom in present mood whole scene seemed to to be sort of spectre reflected on to space from own mind everything be unlovely impossible felt sore angry with may did not understand what art be to did not understand maud wrexhams offer did not understand more than once impulse came on to go back into room try to explain seemed useless be angry indignant anger be bandage over eye knew be honest enough to confess that be angry too disappointed chiefly also angry mauds offer have come to like manna for must a soon have thought of not drinking of spring that suddenly welled up in desert when be dying of thirst a of not accepting may must not understand that felt a insult to to herself to disregard may feeling be impossible took hat went downstairs be broiling august afternoon world seemed dying of heat apoplexy street be breathless baked sky be brass at corner of street watercart have just passed tom stood still moment inhaling whiff of air have certain freshness in reminded of smell of morning in country after rainy night knew that ought to go back work be not to be done heart be heavy eye be dull well there be british museum only hundred yard off man must be in very bad state reflected if elgin marble have nothing to say to place be nearly empty sat down in front of eternal figure from parthenon pediment with little sigh of relief have made up account that morning with infinite difficulty for be operation to be not accustomed rapidity with two three added up into ten twenty seemed to simply amazing really be absurd that there must only be twenty shilling in pound there ought to have be at least twenty five thirty net result have be that at present rate of living must go on for three week more still leaving bill for piece of carrara unpaid have faced situation manfully have determined to go on for three week more giving heart soul to what thought best in art at end of three week there stood blank wall separating completely irrevocably from shining god goddess who be of golden age may five hundred pound have determined quite definitely must not touch more than once have wanted to let sell out though have thrilled over with pleasure that must make offer be impossible to say yes there be too much at stake might die leave alone with baby mr markhams tithe have be falling off lately if went to live with a must have to do must be able to help in household expense for half hour that sat before marble forgot what did matter after if produced beautiful thing not beautiful thing have be produced high water mark of art have be touched race of men have produced race of god felt becoming sanely healthily small in own eye meantime may be at home have parted in anger indignation poor darling perhaps be unhappy perhaps thought did not care that be angry with tom smiled inwardly at absurdity of thought half unconsciously took off hat a looked last at still marble figure thanked for what have taught into may mind there have definitely entered that afternoon certain subtle poison for poison there be one unfailing antidote tom held be pure love when poison be a minute in dose a drop of morphia injected from silver syringe have once entered system however plentifully antidote be administered body be never quite a healthy again a be before where syringe have pricked skin there be little sore spot now again nerve shrink instinctively at thought perhaps may be introduced again clear drop hold be called jealousy for last week once before one night soon after have come up to london for first time when maud manvers tom have dined together have seen little green eyed fiend hovering round be vaguely disquieted at thought that tom felt more interest in maud than did in must not talk smartly must not say rather amusing thing meant nothing with maud be so glib tom apparently enjoyed hearing after that baby have be born little green eyed fiend have put syringe in pocket gone away for last week have be about afternoon have come again have said allow must rather do for have just pricked with fine point poison be coursing through vein anger be blinding jealousy be blind must not be reasonable must not tom have disgraced degraded step be on stair anger must have allowed to throw into arm say forgive tom be angry jealousy forbade so stood where be with back to window so that face be in shadow when came in spoke gave sign sat down near after moment silence held out hand to may have long white finger often sat together talking twining finger into action be common with stood quite still hand dropped again to side at length spoke may how can treat like said what have not done can do be not very pleasant to have speak to a spoke afternoon accepted decision at once did not attempt to persuade must not have be much use trying said may in high cool voice must not have tried in case said only wished to know what thought be content to abide absolutely by decision why did open subject again then said with sudden spasm of jealousy unless be to try to persuade tom thought of marble figure have be looking at remembered what have taught may dear please dont speak to like that said quietly know know be not reason then what be reason look of face tone of voice be reason be not generous to will not meet halfway go step towards be right do expect to come towards on road on what road asked tom wonderingly then quite suddenly for first time real reason for wife attitude struck got up stood before at moment be desperately afraid of anger have possessed seemed to have transferred to may how dare think that asked be not ashamed of least tremor passed through stood there not daring to meet eye next moment have turned from be walking towards door once tried to find voice failed before have left room managed to speak tom wait minute said turned at once have be longing with soul that must say just one word have be horribly wounded by yet felt that have never cared for before a cared now crossed room sat down where have sat before waited next moment have flung on knee by face be buried on shoulder poor darling what be whispered tom dear dont tell yet wait moment yes wait so come closer to may closer place be here in few minute wild sobbing have become le passionate raised face to want
