run for home david reach home chapter ever since be four year old have begun to think seriously a boy must david blaize have be aware that there be real world lying somewhere just below ordinary old thing in father mother nurse rest of fast asleep grown up people lived boy began to get drowsy knew about time that be ten though might still have occasional waking moment soon after that went sound asleep lost chance of ever seeing real world if asked grown ups tremendously important question such a why do leaf fall off tree when there be glass on lake a likely a not must begin talking in sleep about frost sap just a if have got anything to do with real reason might point out that wasnt real glass on lake ice if be more than usually sound asleep take piece of lake glass let hold in finger till became water be to show that what have called glass be really frozen water word for be ice thought that be very wonderful of to explain so nicely tell at great length real glass did not become water if held in finger must remember to wash before dinner perhaps must take to nursery window when came in from walk encourage to put finger on pane in order to see that glass did not become water sort of thing must make david impatient asked then why dont put ice in window then must boil for tea in kettle if nurse wanted to go to sleep again must say now youre talking nonsense master david now be ridiculous thing of course be talking nonsense just to humour nannie be helping with nonsense about difference between ice glass have be wanting to talk sense time learn something about real world in fish put glass roof on house for winter a soon a have collected enough red fire leaf to keep warm until hot weather came round again that might not be precise way in happened be something of sort instead of pinching awake poor sleepy nannie went babbling on about ice glass sap spring in way be truly tedious quite beside real point yet when sleepy thing tried to awake to real world must not get grown up dream out of head sometimes mother must come up to nursery before went to bed take on knee be soft comfortable place tell story often began quite well seriously david always asked that electric light must be put out first because then flame cat must come out of hole play pus in corner over nursery always helped story to seem true serious for be real only electric light must be put out first because gave shock naturally must not play when be being shocked knew that to be true even in sleepy grown up world because once when mother be playing with have put out tongue at nannie when came to say be bed time mother couldnt play more because be shocked that be why flame cat must have electric light put out well there be flame cat dancing sometimes have ball instead of pus in corner here be very comfortable wide awake sometimes a have said story began quite well with air of truth reality about there be little green man with whisker who lived in pear tree washed hand with pear soap there be red faced old woman who lived in apple tree kept sharp look out for dumpling coming round corner for be deadliest enemy pulled piece off made into apple dumpling sometimes pulled nose off when caught finger two never grew again till next spring often if spring be late from going to sleep again after nannie equinox have called there be practically nothing left of so when regiment of dumpling came round corner grandmamma apple tree hid in grass pretended be mr tailor who have made david new sailor clothes then colonel dumpling must stumble over sometimes did not know whether be grandmamma appletree mr winfall so began very politely like subscription paper with half penny stamp in case proved to be mr winfall who have habit of eating colonel dumpling whenever saw often private a well cleared throat said in best suetty voice dear sir madam never got further than because if proved to be mr winfall mr winfall ate whether have apple inside not if be grandmamma apple tree be so indignant a proper female must be at being taken for man that began abusing colonel dumpling in red voice if be ripe green one if wasnt gave whole show away so lost arm leg if there be many people in house finger two if father mother be alone colonel dumpling said to regiment attention slow fatigue march right about kitchen turn now sort of thing be clearly true belonged to real world too often unfortunately david mother got grown up sleepy again began talking most dreadful nonsense little girl with golden hair blue eye made unwelcome presence known by singing baby must be found underneath gooseberry bush david always hoped that got frightfully pricked sweet lovely fairy must fly in just when everything be getting on so nicely make rubbish out of be too polite to let mother know how boring have become so whenever golden haired little girl sweet fairy appeared must try to go on with colonel dumpling part of story in own mind watch flame cat getting tired a fire burned low nannie be not so good at story have flash of sense a when one night when david preferred to sit up in bed instead of lying down to go to sleep hinted that black man might possibly come down chimney unless put head properly on pillow david knew that be not likely for must have to be very small man indeed fireproof there be glimmering of real idea in so be not least frightened asked with interest if must be like bacon beef before got through fire exploded sense there might have be in nanny original idea at once because threatened to go downstairs tell mother if wouldnt lie down very poor ending to black man coming down chimney nannie clearly knew nothing about really if so quickly got sleepy talked about fetching mother nobody grown up ever woke to real world for more than minute two at time except perhaps father who spent so many hour in big room called laboratory there seemed to dabble in reality for must put fragment of something on water began to blaze must mix powder out of certain bottle when be lit burned with so red flame that father looked a if be illuminated inside like turnip ghost must by mixture produce smell that said be tincture of rotten egg be really made of ghost of bad egg ground up exorcised then poor man got grown up when subsequently david wanted to know what ghost of bad egg looked like when be exercised muttered in sleep something about sulphuretted hydrogen david be now just turned six a nannie expressed knew that have only about four year more in front of before began to lapse into drowsy state of grown uppishness begin when boy be ten thereabouts last getting worse worse till be twenty seventy anything else if be going to find real world of caught glimpse now then must do so without losing much time there be probably door into for long time have hoped that be door in ground by lake one day have found that door open be awful disappointment to see that only contained tap round opening to presently gardener fixed long curly pipe when turned tap pipe gave jolly chuckling noise began to stream with water at far end be very delightful consoled david little for disappointment then one night have clue have just lain down in bed when heard door beginning to behave a door do when think be quite alone nobody be looking then a know unlatch begin walking to fro on hinge hitting against frame often happened to nursery door when came downstairs in morning after be quite sure have shut mother therefore sent up to shut again sure enough door be always open having undone to go for walk on hinge on night thought that sound of door came from under pillow very carelessly fell asleep just a be listening in order to make sure next thing knew be that nannie be telling be morning again on very next night have only just put head on pillow when door began banging sounded muffled there be doubt time that came from under pillow sat up in bed broad awake pulled pillow away by light of flame cat who be dancing to night must see smooth white surface of bolster ala there be door there david be now quite sure that somewhere under pillow be door be looking for one time have allowed to go to sleep before finding other time have got too much awake so on third night took pin partridge to bed with in hope that must keep just awake enough by pricking with head of pin leg pin partridge have of course come out of noah ark in course of terrible adventure have lost leg so nannie have taken pin driven into stump so that must stand again pin leg be rather longer than wooden one made partridge lean little to one side a if be listening to agreeable conversation of animal next illustration david find blue door sure enough on third night david have only just lain down with pin partridge in one hand pin ready to scratch leg to keep just awake enough when door began banging again just below pillow listened little while pressing pin head against calf so that hurt little not enough to wake up hopelessly moved head about till be sure that ear be directly above door then very quietly pushed pillow aside there in middle of bolster be beautiful shining blue door with gold handle swinging gently to fro a if be alone got up pushed open entered for fear of dreadful misfortune happening like finding mother on other side of who might send back to shut closed very carefully softly found that there be key hanging up on wall beside to great joy fitted keyhole locked put key back on nail so when came back must let out in meantime nobody must possibly reach chapter ii passage into blue door opened be very like nursery passage at home be certainly night because flame cat be dancing on wall only happened after dark yet there be fire burning anywhere be rather puzzling soon david saw that be real cat not just sort of unreal one demanded fire to make dance at be red be yellow be emerald green with purple patch instead of having band piano to dance to squealed purred growled making such noise david must not hear speak so stamped foot said shoo at dance suddenly came to end cat sat down put one hind leg in air began licking if please said david will tell where to go next cat stopped licking looked at cat behind said lor boy from nursery david turned round cat have begun licking again except large tabby only instead of being black brown be colour of apricot jam poppy be who spoke said david set to partner said tabby began dancing again shoo silly thing said david stamping again dont want to stop dancing except just to be told where im to go what im to do if im hungry dancing stopped again there be pot of mouse marmalade somewhere said tabby only mustnt take more than very little bit got to last till february dont like mouse marmalade said david never said did said tabby wheres cook gone to buy new whisker said put too close to fire account for smell of burning then can be done be to set to partner hope for best said tabby if one dance again said david before tell way where will find shop with proper food in not mousey will turn on electric light fiddle de dee said tabby began singing hey diddle diddle cat fiddle at top of voice david be getting vexed with looked about for electric light there be switch by door a there ought to have be only row of bottle knew came out of father laboratory stopper in one of be loose fizzing noise came out of listened to minute with ear close to heard whispering when he got doesnt know what to do with said tabby contemptuously david hadnt slightest idea be only sure that bottle have something to do with electric light took up began shaking a nannie did to medicine bottle to great delight saw that a shook cat grew fainter fainter passage lighter lighter tabby spoke to in tremulous voice youre shocking frightfully said please dont may have mouse marmalade a soon a cook come back with whisker shes be gone long time if dont like really know where everything else be there garden outside then lake then village just a usual except everything be real here do dont shock more illustration david shake bottle at cat passage have grown quite bright by now there be only few of very strongest cat left so a be kind boy put down bottle again began fizzing whispering pleased to have met pleased to have met pleased to have met dont know why couldnt have told that at first said david to tabby do be poor head dancing get into make turn round square one after other may go on cat began to recover a stopped shaking bottle walked on round corner where game cupboard stood against wall game be kept there noah ark spillikin badminton happy family oak brick lead soldier a usual door of be slightly open because when game be put away even nannie must not shut tight to night there be extraordinary stir going on in everything be slipping about inside a david paused to see what be happening couple of marble rolled out instead of stopping on carpet continued rolling faster faster heard hopping downstairs in direction of garden door dont want to play game just yet said to when there be so much to explore must see what be doing opened door little wider heard encouraging voice knew must be noah come from inside thats right said now can see what be doing be ulster buttoned properly time missus last night when buttoned for did wrong did caught cold in ankle did be sneezing day have never saw such trouble a men be said mr noah get up silly dont sit on shem ive be looking for everywhere david stooped down looked in have sort of idea that be invisible wouldnt disturb anybody there be ark with window open family be dressing consisted of two compartment in second of lived animal one on top of other right up to roof there be door in roof lifted off at present be tightly closed latched confused noise of lion roaring elephant trumpeting cow mooing dog barking bird singing came from inside sometimes there be ordinary talk too for animal have learned english from david a well a knowing own animal tongue indian elephant spoke hindustanee in addition be slim light blue be known a elegant elephant in contrast to stout black one who never spoke at david thought that nannie have made up now knew that be perfectly true stood waiting to see what must happen next hubbub increased if great lamb must get off chest said elegant elephant must be able to get up why dont come open roof not time yet said cow family be still dressing tight fit to night im glad pin partridge isnt here scratching wheres gone said elephant david took to bed more fool said cow couldnt be much more of fool than be grunted pig know nothing about really at moment david irregular kind of hopping noise coming down passage just a turned to look pin partridge ran between leg flew on to roof of ark began pecking at let in shouted believe first of september what cad fellow be not to let in always think first of september said cow now look at im milked day must hurt much more than being shot once not if properly done said partridge know lot of cow who like improperly done said cow david know le about milking than anybody since flood wait till catch alone see if cant teach something about tossing sounded very awful threat david who knew that be best to take cow a well a bull by horn determined on bold policy if hear one word more about tossing shant let of out said there be dead silence who said cow in trembling voice for be coward a well a cow said david there be confused whispering within cant stop here night say wont toss cant anyhow because horn be broken le noise in there said noah suddenly from next compartment cow began whimpering im poor old woman said everybodys very hard on considering milk butter ive given chalk water margarine said pin partridge who have be listening with ear to roof do say wont toss cant see he somewhere close to very well wont toss open roof boy david be not sure that noah must like a be ark master felt that having said that must keep roof shut unless cow promised meant that must open if did so lifted roof about inch at moment noah head appeared be standing on shem head who be standing on ham head who be standing on japheth head who be standing on mother head always came out of room in way partly in order to get plenty of practice in case of fire partly because couldnt be certain that flood have gone down be afraid that if opened door be usual way of leaving room water might come in when noah have climbed on to top of wall pulled shem after who pulled ham who pulled japheth who pulled mr noah there stood like row of sparrow on telegraph wire balancing with great difficulty who be meddling with roof asked noah in angry voice believe pin partridge pin partridge trembled so violently at that fell off roof altogether quite forgetting that must fly moment touched ground became full sized partridge didnt said there boy somewhere about cant see got through blue door to night david now knew that be invisible though have always seemed to that must be most delicious thing in world to be able to be visible invisible whenever chose found that be not quite so jolly to have become invisible without choosing not to have slightest idea how to become visible again gave empty kind of feeling like when be hungry long before proper time cat saw said joining in for knew if couldnt be seen must be heard of course did said noah because can see in dark when everything be invisible thats why saw neednt think that youre only thing be invisible suppose think grand to be invisible when be little boy said ham be told that little boy must be seen not heard one be heard not seen call that very poor imitation of boy dare say isnt real one ive be quite ordinary up to now said david seems to have come on of sudden dont think at grand to be invisible must be visible minute if knew how want to get down said mr noah swaying backwards forward because stand be broken youll get down whether want to not ma said shem irritably if go swaying about like dont catch hold of now ive got quite enough to do with keeping balance why dont get down asked david who wanted to see what must happen next havent seen crow fly yet said noah cant get down till crow have flown did crow do asked david didnt thats why be still here said japheth people said noah want everything explained to when cock crow show morning when crow fly show night cant get down until what must happen if did get down said david nobody know said noah knew once tied knot in handkerchief about so must remember handkerchief went to wash took out knot so forgot if tied knot in handkerchief wouldnt remember again asked david must not be same knot must remember something quite different might not like at must never do one two three said mr noah beating time began to sing never do never do never never never do most of animal in ark joined in sang to quantity of different tune david found singing too only tune must remember be rule britannia didnt fit word very well by degree others stopped singing david be left quite alone to finish verse feeling rather shy knowing that have to finish happened when have done noah heaved deep sigh be loveliest thing ever heard in life said be open to engagement to sing in ark evening matines of course a well for must have to pay extra be very gratifying proposal david did not quite understand about paying must have to pay asked why of course youd have to pay great deal for voice like mustnt dream of singing like for nothing must fill ark must say must empty said mr noah snappishly dont know if im rich enough said david not taking notice of rude woman go away at once then said mr noah never give to beggar just then there be tremendous rattle from ark a if somebody be shaking crow shouted crow just going to fly get out of way boy crow forced way through other animal balanced for moment on edge of ark flew off down passage squawking moment left ark became ordinary crow size again at same moment david suddenly saw one hand still holding up lid of ark knew that have become visible be great relief have time to think about now for so many interesting thing began happening at once noah family jumped from edge of ark moment stand touched ground shot up into full sized human being with hat ulster on large flat face with two dot for eye one dot for nose line for mouth glided swiftly about on stand like people skating seemed to be rather bad at guiding for kept running into other with loud wooden crash into animal be pouring out of ark in such number that really be difficult to avoid everybody occasionally be knocked down then lay on back with eye winking very quickly mouth opening shutting like fish out of water till somebody picked up illustration game cupboard come to life david got behind cupboard door to be out of way of animal other thing came trooping from shelf luckily nursery passage seemed to have grown much bigger must never have held everybody for animal also shot up to full size a soon a left ark kept colour varnish though david have be several time to zoological garden there be nothing there half so remarkable a pale blue elephant spotted pig to take only few example animal here be so much brighter in colour of course conversation made more interesting on trooped with noah whirling in out towards step to garden door when be finished with happy family life size too followed there be mr dose doctor wife with bottle miss bone butcher daughter gnawing bone in very greedy manner master chip carpenter son with head supported in pincer have body will remember walked in twisty manner very upright soldier like on handle of lead soldier followed with band playing cannon shooting pea in direction only pea be a big a cannon ball shot down whole regiment of own men many of hindmost of happy family nobody seemed to mind picked up again at once often whole band be lying on back together never ceased playing for moment battledore shuttlecock came next shuttlecock hitting battledore in front of flew down passage high over head of soldier waited there standing on handle till shuttlecock came up hit again after came david clockwork train charged into everything be in way cut lane for through soldier happy family animal alike have cow catcher in front of engine occasionally picked people up instead of running over when david saw last before plunged down stair have mr chimney sweep duke of wellington llama lying on jumbled up together kicking furiously while be watching extraordinary scene cupboard door banged to again saw that there be large label on one of admittance except by presenting calling card very little then on other be bottle follower anything else ring also david studied for minute two did not want to go in wanted to know how hadnt got calling cardat least never

where did learn to talk asked elephant in faint voice didnt learn anywhere particular said david happened dreadfully hard to say that six time dont believe must do elephant looked round in frightened manner change subject said hurriedly change object change place change partner change money change sock change weather change everything do change subject be so distressed at thought of having to say david felt must be very bad manner to insist upon be going to dance with giraffe said must tell how to do where im to begin elephant grew blue again thats good boy said begin a high up a can take one leg first let band play a loud a possible didnt seem very promising david did a be told put arm round foreleg of giraffe be began revolving about have hardly begun when found that must shift hand higher up leg still higher for be growing in most extraordinary manner soon head began going up through staircase felt arm round giraffe waist still grew head passed second storey came up to third where went into attic where partner head be one foreleg of giraffe own arm stuck out of window kept slowly revolving to sound of piano be getting fearfully tangled up with banister of stair presently began to reverse unwound again dear creature said giraffe thought youd grow though wasnt sure about illustration david dance with giraffe dont feel very comfortable said david im so afraid be treading

high street have be decorated with banner on be written david blaize fireman son be sort of invitation from happy family to become one of also be tired with growing ungrowing thought must be very pleasant to sit down listen to little music so though be not sign of great cordiality to be greeted at door by huge mutton bone thrown at head thought better to ring bellthough wasnt bell coal scuttle hung on chain underneath be instruction knock also so first rang coal scuttle then knocked sounded a if dinner bell in world have be pealed postman in world have come with letter felt quite ashamed of

accompany dance have david heard such deafening noise quantity of steam appeared to come out of instrument also soon whole room be filled with whistling then steam began to clear again little though

earthly use at thought david doesnt tell where im going how did get so much luggage illustration david cow porter on pile of luggage began climbing up wall of luggage be made of more solid piece when heard somebody climbing up other side hurrah probably porter said to hi porter im coming said slow placid voice moo im coming first thing came over edge of wall of luggage be cap of flying man then two broken horn then mild hairy sort of face mouth of went round round oh be cow other pilot asked david hush said cow im incognito disguised a porter collecting evidence what about asked david

of pile heard cow retreat few step breathe heavily now im coming said next moment charged through weak part of wall consisted only of lighter article like dressing case gun case bag of golf club lunch basket have stuck on horn shook head till fell off with great clatter of tin plate knife fork be good bit of evidence said panting what train be going by think said david cow looked at label thats right then said thats one go anywhere whistling loud still so youve got heap of time there more time than luggage doesnt whistling mean that just going off asked david have firm idea in mind that must catch whole plan must go wrong not bit of dearie said cow whistle loudest when going to stop longest whistle faintest when going to stop shortest now if be whistling soft must have to hurry moment stop whistling altogether then off have to wait for next usually there isnt next then trouble begin then do whistle time stand still asked david naturally when go there something else to think about looked at with mild milky sort of eye be dressed in large jacket pair of trouser covered completely face tail to think that ever thought of tossing said well bye gones be gone bye now feel like mother to let get going with bit of luggage train youre going to get will get gone took up four five bag on horn put of lighter stuff like gun case golf club over ear then turned back to david just sling rest on tail said stick through cord through handle just put on moved backwards forward in most obliging manner while david put tail through handle of box portmanteau just a must string bead on to thread tail have surprising sort of spring in when have put through cord handle gave little jerk box hopped along very soon heavy stuff be neatly strung on tail took up stick umbrella that lay about on platform in mouth now youve got to do be to hold on to end of tail said off go to there more evidence about here threaded way down mile of crowded platform past train after train be puffing whistling to show that wasnt going yet occasionally one stopped whistling on door slammed next moment there wasnt train there at there be tremendous lot of people travelling now then in crowd got glimpse of one knew like miss muffet shoemaker member of happy family for most part be stranger cow head wreathed in luggage seemed mile away very soon david found there be sort of telephone in tail talked to end of asking whatever wanted to know then put to ear when wished to speak to bell rang at end of illustration david us telephone in cow porter tail havent got ticket yet said david of course not dont know where youre going yet said traveller by anywhere express take ticket when theyve got there otherwise might take ticket say for france find at fiji ticket wouldnt be use be

followed cow when have finished sticking in door into carriage be large bare room with quantity of hook on wall small three legged stool standing in middle of now ill get rid of luggage said cow began tossing piece on horn in neatest manner on to hook then switched tail portmanteau dress basket wine case heavier thing flew way on to hook piled in corner david looked round sweet little house with dismay if get very sleepy cant go to bed asked why of course can said cow can go to bed anywhere like over floor can hang up to hook get inside portmanteau motion will never disturb a empty speed express whats asked david why full speed express go a fast a can doesnt empty speed express go a slow a can hullo stopped whistling cow jumped out of door immediately slammed to after disappeared among crowd on platform train started at great speed so seemed to david a got going went slower slower until must scarcely believe that be moving at felt rather lonely at idea of spending five six year in train after if moved so slowly must not be difficult to jump out unless found cow porter didnt seem likely must have to leave luggage behind must not really miss much since have never have before have not slightest idea what contained pecking noise at window attracted attention saw crow sitting on ledge outside let in said time to rest will stop flying for present david let down window crow fluttered on to floor if stop flying will become invisible asked yes of course youre getting dim now pop now youve gone david held up hand in front of must see nothing at of must have be there because when touched end of nose with felt quite solid have certainly vanished for present for there be nothing whatever of to be seen wish wouldnt interfere with like that said wouldnt like if made invisible crow have put head under wing tucked up one leg voice sounded muffled seem to think said that everything be to be managed a want if imagine im going to go on flying night without rest just in order to keep visible make mistake arent so pretty a that young fellah youll fly again before long wont asked david answer got be haugh rumph haugh rumph rumph for crow have gone fast asleep be snoring david poked with place where finger usually be to wake only snored louder louder then picked up shook only result be that snoring became perfectly deafening ill drop out of window said to then must fly be good for crow didnt even take head from under wing put leg down fell quietly on to ground below window without waking just then there came bend in line though train be scarcely moving at be soon out of sight well there help for thought david so may a well go to sleep too seems to make one sleepy to be invisible then so supposed must have gone completely to sleep for when next thing happened be quite light a have be travelling since pm be perfectly obvious that be now morning for reason felt inclined to lick hand rub behind ear remembered that only cat did that instead drew three legged stool to window looked out found be visible again supposed crow must have begun flying train seemed to be running very slowly round round field occasionally stopped dead began to whistle usually splashed quietly along into puddle out of puddle without line in front of sometimes curved little to avoid tree crushed way through ordinary hedge bird flew out scolding saying wish must look where be going then voice from engine said sorry have be troubled just like young lady in telephone exchange country seemed familiar to david presently saw that train be in field just beyond high street of village have left at be slowly going back to again to spot fifty yard away from place have started from then began to make very sharp curve in order to avoid horse be lying down in field engine came just opposite window rare good run david shouted engine driver will stop at hairdresser in minute now if want to have anything done david have not have hair cut lately so seemed rather good opportunity how long do stop there shouted two three week youll just have time in spite of slowness with be moving there be tremendous rattle of wheel somewhere noise seemed to come from overhead then looking up saw that there be hundred of wheel turning round there be long band hanging from just then engine began whistling to show have stopped cloud of steam poured in through carriage window a cleared away david saw that be standing in hairdresser shop that underneath wheel be sitting row of old gentleman having head brushed with circular brush others be being shampooed others be apparently having head painted others be having breakfast be without exception absolutely bald there be looking glass in front of of david saw face of kind old gentleman in looking glass be of sort stood on mother dressing table showed left hand side where bruise be came when fell out of tree right hand side where tooth have be taken out full face where thing happened in looking glass be reflection of bald old gentleman nodding smiling at after solitary night in train david longed for little conversation again went to nearest old gentleman who be eating egg bacon while hairdresser scrubbed head with circular brush good morning david said have have good journey hard brush please added to hairdresser doesnt do good aha aha thats better now ill have shampoo david thought rather odd way of doing thing since usually have shampoo first brushing afterwards hairdresser didnt seem to mind old gentleman bent over basin with egg bacon on knee continued breakfasting boiling freezing sir asked hairdresser boiling first then freezing said old gentleman with mouth full freezing first boiling afterwards where did come from asked david from house next bank think said david came by

top of elm tree see whats going on there illustration how canon mr rook quarrelled over stick have calculated distance pretty well for beginner few downward kick in air brought brushing against topmost bough of elm stood on far side of lake beyond garden seemed to be spring time for there be great commotion among rook a pushed young green leaf aside looked in pair of be quarrelling a to way particular stick ought to be laid one wanting laid crossway other straight have lived for year before came here in cathedral close be always known a canon mr rook when saw stopped arguing why bless

have just come up here to try for flying certificate if committee will kindly attend urgentcaw caw caw repeated instantly there be chirping calling of bird on side from other elm from field below bush lake pair of brown owl be first to arrive from ivy in church tower with spectacle without can not see by day then came cloud of finch bull finch green finch haw finch chaf finch wood pigeon came cooing in couple of jackdaw who tried to talk to david in own tongue thought must do very well indeed though must say be jack jay came screaming out of wood with nice fresh paint on blue streak on wing woodpecker tapped to know if have come to right elm there be nightingale learning new tune for year blackbird already getting little hoarse singing february tune heron came clattering up from lake teal wild duck moorhen tried to join couldnt fly a high a only flapped about lake saying hear hear hear hear pheasant with burnished copper plate on back rocketed up woodcock two flying flip flap flip flap swift marten cut circle loop in air there be nightjar who opened mouth very wide made sort of gargling noise instead of singing linnet robin hadnt finished dressing be still buttoning red waistcoat like jewel flung through early morning sunlight kingfisher came perched on david shoulder lark left tussock of grass in meadow below carolled way upwards wild eyed hawk sat little apart for fear must be too much tempted at sight of so many plump bird assembled together so sat on branch shut mouth very tight a if be eating caramel remembering that when flying committee be assembled be considered very bad form to eat fellow member there be freshly varnished starling speckled thrush hundred of rude noisy sparrow long before committee be assembled elm in rookery be crowded with bird for passing of human candidate be very unusual event indeed nobody wanted to miss david felt rather frightened when test for bird flying certificate be explained to for of course be much stiffer examination than anything happens to young gentleman in flying corp not only have got to do clumsy man trick perform with aeroplane in dont really fly be only flown with bird trick a well to get certificate have to satisfy single one of committee now consisted of several thousand people canon rook who a have summoned committee be chairman of told not to be afraid can remember right said besides bird who set question will show first what youve got to do caw silence please took long time to get silence morning for nesting be going on lady be talking about different lining for nest best way of stitching hemming said mud said feather said bit of thing kingfisher said give fish bone however bird round canon rook began calling silence too by degree spread until whole committee be calling silence at top of voice making far more noise than ever be step in right direction soon hubbub died down canon rook spoke again candidate be david blaize boy still quite unfledged except on top of head said age be six rather old cooed wood pigeon yes better late than never said canon rook im sure be very pleased that have remembered how to fly at last hell probably be bit stiff from age mustnt expect too much will now please jump off loop loop twice return to seat caw david have often seen airman doing jumped off bough made two very neat loop without difficulty returned again brushing hair out of eye right o screamed whole of committee spinning nose dive said canon rook david remembered that too have to put head down spin like dead leaf on windless day made little giddy committee be pleased with only owl said that conscience must not allow to pas since did not call flying at falling so rest chattered screamed sang at till spectacle fell off made conscience get quite confused forget what wouldnt allow to do then followed tail slip in david stretched out leg in front of held toe in finger so that sat down in air slid backwards just a if there wasnt chair there when have expected one finished first part then committee began talking at once in order to settle what bird trick must have to do be inclined to let off rather easily because be considered sporting thing for boy to attempt bird test at made up three thousand mind that if did one bird trick perfectly must be enough then when bird have shouted silence until be quite hoarse canon rook cleared throat spoke bird test be a followscaw said candidate will attempt to do lark trick starting from ground returning to again show what he got to do one of lark lark dropped from tree crouched in tussock of grass then jumped off ground began mounting in perpendicular line rising very slowly singing a went when have got to top of flight hovered there slowly descended still singing about ten foot from ground stopped singing dropped plump into tussock from have risen candidate please said canon rook must sing too asked david of course thats part of said lark still rather breathless one must do without singing strictly speaking not singing competition said canon rook can sing asked david david remembered how noah have offered post to sing in opera in ark evening matines though doubt bird be more musical audience felt that must be untrue after to say couldnt sing yes can sing said at least noah thought so think hed better have try first said nightingale must be awful if sang very badly time have to bear till got down again a committee maynt interrupt candidate in middle of test sing few bar david said canon rook have be tune of rule britannia sung to word never do never do never never never do have pleased noah so much david began to sing again have hardly sung first line before nightingale blackbird thrush other professional musician turned quite pale swooned be gradually restored by being fanned with friend wing still trembled be floppity other bird be merely in shriek of laughter david felt very much confused till corncrake perched on knee said sang excellently quite excellently dont mind be unanimously decided that david must not sing while did lark flight jumped off bough stood in privet bush be to do duty for tussock of grass a be too big for tussock in order to make performance more life like be settled that lark must sing together a mounted descended stopping when be three foot from ground for be too heavy to drop from ten foot one two caw three off said canon rook david gave little spring in air a have seen lark do began treading air with foot beating gently downwards with outspread finger a took flight sounded in still bright air a if lark in world have begun to sing found mounted rather too quickly at first so ceased treading air using hand alone slowly mounted music of lark entered heart made feel happier than have known be possible to be gasped with pleasure a rose like when sit in bath on cold evening pour first spongeful of hot water down back only now be spring singing flying that tingled over hung high above tree top in blue earth be like one flower beneath long hovered there then with sigh began slowly to descend there be dead silence in tree top where committee sat except for singing of lark knew that hundred of bright eye be watching to see if be really flying a lark fly illustration david doe lark flight at length topmost twig of privet tree hit foot folded hand across chest dropped instantly most tremendous hubbub of bird voice broke out clapping of thousand of wing thatll do shouted silly to have more examination especially since be so busy he real lark a lark bird he bird boy can fly just a lark fly so give certificate well done david whole cloud of bird began settling over lift up chirped dont fly david be going to carry keep leg arm still well peck carry up one two threeaway go lord what weight boy be took hold of hair with beak others grasped clothes in claw others took hold of bootlace with david lying back laughing partly from joy partly because tickled hoisted up into top bough of elm again canon rook have already got out flying certificate be signing name to when have signed flapped wing over till ink be dry david blaize said have pleasure of presenting with first class bird flying certificate meeting be adjourned hurrah hurrah hurrah sang committee rose in air together with noise a of gale blowing good bye david blaize bird boy dont forget flying practise day old man cawabout that stick said mr rook want crossway crossway ill have ill knock down whole thing caw caw caw illustration bird carry up david to get flying certificate david saw be not wanted more besides belonged to now understood how busy be so put precious certificate in pocket flew off like swift without moving arm leg only balancing turning in air just have to move head first rest followed thought what wanted to do be doing spent hour two in air then a arm be getting little stiff with new sort of exercise be thirsty swooped down to edge of lake to get drink have rest a touched ground moorhen came out from under bank in awful fright at boy being there whom hadnt seen coming then opened red mouth laughed came splashing flying back again only new bird boy dear said to wife didnt recognise at first tired of flying david david laughed only just for minute said oh im having nicest time ever have since came through blue door be so thirsty too lay down on bank with head over edge be scarcely surprised to find that lake tasted like most delicious lemonade with ice plenty of sugar then lay back in long grass listened to bird talking sap humming in growing herb just in front of be lake beyond that garden of own home house be no longer afraid that be back in ordinary world again though be in ordinary place have gone through blue door eye ear be opened to thousand of thing have never seen before in familiar place colour be infinitely brighter than have ever be there be new sound in air new scent be puzzling to know what time of year be not that mattered bird be building so must be spring yet sun be a hot a summer sun have ever known of tree have turned red a happened in autumn steep hill beyond house be covered with dazzling white snow so that must toboggan if liked seemed a if nicest thing of season be gathered together into one morning wanted to look at explore place knew so well looked so much more lovely than have ever known so presently when have rested flew across lake in manner of moorhen with foot dabbling in water landed on lawn at other side flower bed be absolutely covered with blossom not trace of dull brown earth be to be seen then breeze came up from lake set flower swinging on stalk did not swing quite in ordinary way for stalk stopped still only flower swung farther farther swung way then sound of bell began to come out of canterbury bell campanula began because be professional bell by degree everything else joined in lily rose hollyhock lupin love lie bleeding other flower that can imagine for be in blossom together morning little tiny chime like note of musical box came from violet so soft that david have to put ear among leaf to hear loudest note of seemed to come from sunflower be more like clashing of big golden cymbal david listened long time in sort of ecstasy of pleasure then pealing got somehow into bone have to do something joyful too a must not make bell of must throw into air poise like hawk hovering flapping arm time stopping in same place then skimmed away with arm quite still stretched taut flew over roof of house so close that tip of finger touched one of chimney stack then for long while made eagle flight going in wide circle without moving arm mounting higher higher till earth grew small dim below sound of bell flower died away seemed to be only thing existed in great blue desert of air of adventure since came through blue door be most delightful sun have got low when descended to earth again flower have ceased ringing in garden bed bird be still moving in bush none be flying now for be getting quite dark david felt that desire power of flying be leaving a be only natural when night came on once twice ran jumped off ground must no longer tread air properly be a if foot broke through when tried to mount slowly like lark just dabbling air down with hand hand went through instead of pressing below be sure that remembered way to do still though didnt seem quite a easy a have morning however if be bird boy have to fly at bird time not at night after falling rather heavily on gravel path when tried to do swift trick thought better to give up till morning be not in least sleepy be sure that there be plenty of other adventure awaiting only question be in direction must go to look for flying have made thirsty again a lake be so close be worth while going down to to have drink of delicious lemonade before got absolutely dark so again lay down on bank be just going to drink when heard tramp of foot looking round saw that long gravel walk just behind be entirely lined with soldier at least be standing in two line like soldier looked a if have be put there on purpose a soldier like queue of people taking ticket who look a if have come there by accident then again in front of at end of line be standing very stout man in khaki with lot of riband across so that if be not brigadier general certainly ought to have be one furthermore on lawn behind be row row of tent band be playing so david came to conclusion that be soldier that must be something didnt at present know what be began to get clearer in minute brigadier general saluted came down bank towards david who got up at once tried to forget be thirsty be evident that something be going to happen without having to go in search of way down bank brigadier general suddenly tripped over own spur be on toe of boot began rolling down into lake fell into with loud splash soldier behind began laughing silence in rank said david very grandly turning round for knew that must be somebody tremendous to have brigadier general salute there be loud coughing sound from lake water logged voice spluttered out if grace must have kindness to extend to tip of field marshal baton must easily be able to get to land without least risk of pulling grace in shed fresh light on situation for david now knew that be duke archbishop be also field marshal couldnt think of archbishop who be field marshal name of duke of marlborough duke of wellington instantly occurred to a fitting situation suppose must be one of thought david unless im just field marshal duke of blaize if be must surely have known before let get poor brigadier general out first found that have under arm long pole like fishing rod be almost certainly baton so tied handkerchief to end of began fishing for brigadier general have got quite dark by now must only just see line of foam where brigadier general be splashing about then there came tug at handkerchief bent baton nearly double oh got bite then said david excitedly so did grace said brigadier general fish be biting toe something awful there be spur on think ive caught pike david fished again with renewed vigour for now there be chance of catching brigadier general pike at one go be very sumptuous fishing look here called out if catch youve caught pike who caught pike isnt thatll be settled by court martial grace said voice from darkness do put baton little lower david felt very much inclined to say that wouldnt go on fishing for at unless brigadier general promised that david must be considered to have caught not only brigadier general also that david must be allowed to claim capture of pike brigadier general said that brigadier general have caught be so difficult to express in terse soldierly language that decided to catch brigadier general first settle rest of afterwards besides if brigadier general sank david must have caught must very likely be court martialled so lowered point of baton soon got better bite began towing to land will gaff grace asked officer saluting david with hand at once im going to catch by myself said david remembering how footman have helped to catch pike once how hadnt be at same thing a having caught unassisted get back into barrack at once david brought brigadier general alongside caught hold of something slippery wriggled thats pike said choking voice from other end of brigadier general lend hand grace to drowning soldier david kept tight hold of pike with one hand put baton over shoulder began walking up bank brigadier general came up out of water with loud pop just a if cork have be drawn thats ginger beer grace said be be lemonade morning said david be awfully strong pike turn up light somebody illustration david rescue brigadier general thats very well said discontented voice from rank where be blooming light be darkest guard of honour ever honoured there door in ground said david being jumped about by pike water light cant remember ive have enough water for present said brigadier general shaking like dog began with head shook down body finished up with sword there be good deal of conversation going on in rank david determined to show iron disciplinarian when pike have finished bouncing about kept tripping up in sword cocked hat knew have on head kept coming forward over eye row on row of medal jingled on breast pike of be resolved not to let go have dragged away into flower bed now then bell jingled from sleeping flower oh do let go said whisper near im not pike at how can be so silly im miss muffets spider be just skating along over water when stupid spur caught im keeping waiting hate keeping lady waiting david let go at once heard spider canter away at same moment stream of light shot up from door in ground putting cocked hat straight marched back to guard of honour with baton on end of fluttered handkerchief over shoulder certainly have sailor trouser on be so covered with medal that must not see what sort of coat be wearing buttoned close round neck have awful fear that be coat have worn when errand boy to bank there be time to attend to now for guard of honour be yawning looking bored brigadier general be saluting propping elbow up with other hand if will please grace to inspect guard of honour said can get to work on plan of campaign for there isnt moment to waste attention said brigadier general poked in side be at attention whispered must have much more attention than said david beginning inspection whats man doing with toasting fork instead of rifle for instance if please grace be cooking sausage for grace supper when be ordered out hadnt time to put down toasting fork nothing cruel hard if poor soldier silence in rank said david illustration field marshal david inspects guard of next one have got croquet mallet on shoulder next golf club on shoulder of next be sitting grey parrot who pretended to sneeze loudly a david passed next have umbrella next pair of tongs then came judge in wig newspaper man who have folded copy of time into sort of lance altogether be oddest kind of guard of honour that david must imagine reminded of new sort of happy family then might all be thinking that be equally curious sort of field marshal so be best for present to pretend that everything be in order came to end of very extraordinary line didnt know what to do next brigadier general whispered to say something nice grace dismiss know what to do extremely nice said david in loud firm voice congratulate on fit soldierly appearance be dismissed good night brigadier general gave little sob will remember grace beautiful word till dying day said a men fell out dare say wont have long to wait for added oh do expect battle soon asked david grace will see map show movement of enemy for yourself said brigadier general time be threading way through tent on lawn tripping over rope stepping into saucepan hitting toe against shell for light from door in ground have gone out be impossible to see what there be where be going brigadier general spur got constantly caught in tent rope when happened cut rope with sword tent fell down flat david thought be rather high handed hasty proceeding darent say much for fear of betraying desperate ignorance for might be privilege of brigadier general to cut rope pleased presently came to large square tent brilliantly lit inside so that david must read notice board outside said head tail quarter of grace so knew that be entered tent smelled strongly of sausage wonder for one of two table be covered with other be covered with map rest of furniture consisted of small camp bed dressing table on sword tooth brush medal soap bootlace cocked hat be lying about in utmost confusion fire be burning brightly against wall of tent looked rather dangerous to david have already burned hole right through canvas behind think that fire have better be put out said to brigadier general cant be very safe brigadier general blew at a must blow at candle went out instantly now well study movement of enemy said david going to map table took up first map lay there found very clear for represented on large scale house garden lake village there be direction at top stating route of enemy marked in red david began to follow started from house be odd since have never seen trace of enemy there went down nursery passage till came to square marked game cupboard alias miss muffets then there be gap note printed enemy movement hard to trace here possibly flew red line began again in village street close to bank went into bank out again crossed road into shoemaker then went down village street to bridge from there returned to bank again terrible idea entered david head be precisely route have taken after going through blue door felt turn pale bent over map again to make certain from bank enemy have gone to house next door be labelled happy family institute alias miss milligans school for young lady alias station here enemy entrained from there route passed through field two came to hairdresser be labelled hairdresser junction after that came to end with note enemy seen flying here at be david have longer slightest doubt that be enemy be now completely cut off in middle of camp of foe then puzzled to know why have made own field marshal perhaps didnt know be enemy perhaps have made field marshal in order to lure into tent in very middle of camp seemed far most likely explanation accounted for guard of honour being so weird collection of people be mocking perhaps just putting to test seeing whether knew anything whatever about soldier must have be quite clear to that did not must have kicked to think that have gone wrestling with miss muffets spider in garden bed when ought to have be inspecting have thought wonderfully grand to fly day be field marshal a soon a got dark now seemed that there be penalty attached to greatness never have other field marshal be in so precarious position clearly have to escape to escape have to be alone folded up map have studied that thoroughly said want to be called at half past seven in morning will arrange battle a soon a have breakfasted brigadier general meantime have be eating sausage a hard a must rapidly swallowed be in mouth very good grace said will have barbed wire put up round grace headquarters david reflected rapidly be far more likely that barbed wire be intended to keep in rather than keep other people out of course must get away by flyingat least must have morning didnt feel quite so certain about now still must never do to let brigadier general think suspected anything though wished have let brigadier general drown make usual arrangement said a soon a have gone david sat down to think felt heart beating very quickly whole thing be so exciting that must not be called really beastly plan be said to to make believe ive gone to bed dont know that know that im enemy must go to bed without going to bed be not so hard to manage took off field marshal tunic with medal found to great relief that have sailor clothes on below so stuffed pillow into tunic buttoned way down put in bed then turned sponge bag inside out so that have grey side outermost put sponge back in laid at neck of tunic with field marshal cocked hat on top must not spare trouser for leg so rolled up two map placed in bed below tunic covered figure up to waist with bed clothes anyhow there be field marshal in bed in clothes ready to spring up at call of duty thatll convince if look in ive gone to bed said only wont convince so much if see a well quite certain must hide until go away crept under map table have cloth on nearly coming to ground thought of thing to make believe be unsuspicious asleep ill snore thought david remembering how crow have snored haw caw haw rumph humph haw haw haw w w w w rumph have hardly stopped when heard whispering outside tent yes peeped in said one voice there be lying in bed dont need to peep in to know he lying there still sleeping last sleep hell ever sleep on earth barbed wire in place asked voice yes couldnt get through if be fifty field marshal isnt one who be then asked first voice why he little whipper snapper a take out of box put back again without with leave by leave anything well put in box to morrow tight screwed down too just like impudence to think field marshal said second be going to hang first shoot next behead last t other way about make odds said second eight oclock to morrow morning then mate turn off light in tent will david under table shook with rage beastly fellow whispered ive treated very kindly too see if dont melt down over nursery fire be very well be still possible that must be hung shot beheaded buried first be business have to attend to now be not anywhere near being able to get to nursery fire in meantime be in tent in middle of hostile camp with amount of barbed wire round nothing to cut with except baton sausage oh horrid position thought david very seriously must say exciting when whisper have died away went very cautiously to door flap peeped out moon have risen by light must see lump chunk of barbed wire piled up high right across entrance like thicket of blackberry bush without leaf on there be possibility of getting out way walked round tent pressing quietly with finger against canvas always getting pricked by barbed wire evidently have be heaped up round then came to fire place where fire have burned hole in canvas before brigadier general blew out looking cautiously out saw that there be gap here between hedge of barbed wire for have never occurred to anybody that must get out right through middle of fire thats only chance thought david eye sparkling with excitement made quantity of awful snore noise again after then very cautiously put leg through hole that fire have burned in canvas nobody interfered with so put other leg through too presently stood outside tent in narrow alley between other tent david have often sent to sleep by imagining escaping from position of horrible danger now that be necessary to escape without imagining anything felt extremely wide awake probably there must be sentry guarding camp past whom must somehow slip here in camp there be sign of life once twice ran few step in hope that might remember how to fly have no longer idea now in middle of night how to tread air paddle with hand made up mind that must escape on two foot ground be encumbered with tent rope guard of honour appeared to have dropped accoutrement about for golf club toasting fork other irregular weapon lay around among trench mortar machine gun more usual apparatus of battle then came across grey parrot who looked at with suspicion immediately began walking away with toe crossed sneezing continuously david went on more quickly cautiously after that be more than possible that horrid bird be spying on never have considered parrot to be real bird else must not for ever be trying to make sound like cat dog mabel kitchenmaid have come close to gravel path by lake where have held foolish inspection of guard of honour where camp ended without seeing anybody when suddenly came upon large letter propped up against rope addressed to knew quite well that might be trap that might explode in face when opened on other hand might be valuable communication from bird so bent down to pick up hardly have touched when thousand thousand of electric bell gong watchman rattle went off over camp out of tent there came noise of people getting up washing face brushing teeth there be not moment to lose without attempt at concealing more rushed across gravel path dodged sentry ran down bank to edge of lake since brigadier general have fallen into water indeed probably in consequence of that fish have put up glass roof over lake below saw glimmer of fire of red leaf oh let in shouted feeling like pin partridge on ark awful soldier be going to hang behead already sentry be close upon when trap door opened in roof david jumped down into heard clang to behind knew be safe chapter vii be cold wet below glass roof of lake for a david already knew when be completely in water from head to heel never think of saying oh how wet be be only when piece of be wet like when be washing hand snowball go down neck that think of wetness certainly also be not cold because there be so many red leaf fire burning up overhead moon shone very brightly through what david knew be ice to ordinary world be much more correct to call fish glass made most lovely light in just a if diamond tiara emerald ruby necklace have be mashed up in fish glass thats something to know said to when there fish glass on lake will make hole in get underneath what nonsense grown up people talk say dangerous to get under icefish glass be only safe thing to do suppose id better call on fish thank for rescuing began walking towards one of red fire round there be lot of fish collected looked so very uninterested solemn just a if be hearing sermon in church not attending thought david that decided that must explore little first turned quickly off in direction at once felt be not walking more for foot have come off ground be lying flat few foot from floor sensation be rather like losing balance made sort of wriggle with foot in order to recover again instead of recovering footing merely darted off at great speed in perfectly unexpected direction why sort of mad flying in water said to o oh see swimming fish fashion be great discovery flicked foot again plunged into great thicket of water tree waved swayed round once more kicked instead of darting forward again came to dead stop though couldnt understand how have kicked differently from before kick made spin round once again kicked a have kicked first time flew out into open take care where youre going said thick bored voice near turning round very cautiously lest must fly off again saw old brown trout not looking at exactly not looking anywhere else one eyethe only one david must see in factseemed to be turned towards rather than towards anything else merely stared vacantly at a if be painted there beg pardon said david dont seem to go where want trout opened shut mouth once twice without saying anything then slewed round turned other eye upon then turned back on altogether took further notice of be rather unpromising beginning david be so eager to learn how to swim fish fashion that risked being snubbed must spare time just to show sort of way go asked wave said trout then go sooner go better will be pleased david waved ran into trout tail dont do said trout not least angrily in same bored manner bad manner to hit anybodys tail youre very ill bred sort of creature im very sorry said david didnt mean to hit then did without meaning said trout with back to be worse because there sense in if doesnt mean anything wish must go away right away mean none of hanging about here get low coarse fish to teach im busy david felt rather discouraged didnt know what adventure might happen next how soon might happen wanted to learn how to swim fish fashion before something else took place felt must not face more dull eye just yet looked at a if didnt mean anything so moved very cautiously away from stupid old thing for fear of butting again began practising by found be not so difficult a seemed to be at first be case with most thing great point be to make up mind first where wanted to go to then look at place wave found that usually went in sort of direction just a if there be something inside that knew how to do if only told what wanted passed fish now then took notice whatever of presently found be getting on so well that wished to show off to somebody so returned in direction of trout be so busy there be precisely a david have left doing nothing except slowly opening shutting mouth staring at nothing at so david gave tremendous kick in order to dash up to in real fish boy like manner miscalculating direction ran violently into nose dont go on doing said trout butt here butt there youve got self control very boring of better go away neednt bother to come back more for ever shant miss at only wish have missed wish have too said david be getting on so nicely wanted to show somebody youre mudding everything up said trout so youd better show somebody else not dont care what do where go so long a dont do go here david felt annoyed at be trout a rude a asked trout opened mouth two three time time david thought be going to speak illustration david trout yes said at length must think must get rather tired of others company then said david again seemed a if trout be going to speak time david counted that opened shut mouth eleven time before answered be said be of tired of everybody else im most tired of hate being interrupted when im busy hate people running into face never have liked dont mean to begin now well ive apologised for said david cant do more time trout opened shut mouth only nine time before answered yes can said can go away cant think why dont david be naturally polite boy when one be rude to must easily be rude back forgot about swimming fish fashion dont believe youre bit busy said havent done thing since be here before youve just waved stared trout looked at david with one eye then moved head looked at with other thats two thing then said yes that doesnt make busy said david couldnt possibly be idler that doesnt count faint gleam of intelligence came into foolish face can count said trout onetwofourthreenine halfa hundred there youre quite wrong said david go onetwosixfour let see what doe come after four added suddenly forgetting how to count nothing thats end said trout neednt wait longer weve finished may get down never mind about wiping mouth anything onetwosixfourteen began david again determined to get right when suddenly be blown sideways a be by tremendous draught of water trout tail whisked by face a for trout that one swish of tail have carried ten yard away be drifting back again with enormous worm hanging out of mouth cheek bulged with eye stared so that david thought must drop out in two three gulp managed to swallow rest of worm to david great surprise looked almost

shut mouth so often without saying anything at david felt that there be use in waiting longer for to speak even when did speak too be almost stupider than when didnt since have come through blue door have met nobody so completely uninteresting group round fire looked just a hopeless felt that be only wasting time must not resist saying what thought youre much stupidest thing ever saw said will go away thats what always wanted to do said trout mind dont come back david wondered whether fish might not be little brighter at top end of lake where stream flowed into waved way up there even swimming fish fashion have ceased to amuse for did not want to do anything that fish did if learned to swim like said to must grow like perhaps must be awful will get out of water altogether when come to end of roof never put up over stream by by roof got thinner when came into stream found a have expected that there be roof at put head up very cautiously for fear be not far enough away from camp that might be pursued again found that mist have come up quite covering lawn though bugle be still sounding there felt safe in landing on far side of stream underneath shelter of bridge moonlight felt very warm comfortable after water moment stepped on to land be quite dry again if have ever really be wet at have hardly taken second foot out of water when there be great swirl in stream behind head of huge wicked pike snapped at heel little wretch said how dare come into lake if have only known about minute sooner id have eaten up david bounded up bank have never seen anything so ugly cruel beastly

be able to so made very dignified walked away from stream trying very hard not to hurry till be out of sight of pike coward coward yelled pike wait till catch david felt pretty safe now for knew that must be able to run on land a fast a pike continued to walk away along by hedge till have put considerable distance between stream be not quite proper for bird boy field marshal to run away from fish be such awful fish there be two signboard knew in field one down by river about fishing other where there be path across on be notice trespasser will be prosecuted with utmost rigour of law did not mind about notice since field notice belonged to father when came to second signboard looked up at felt suddenly frozen with terror teeth chattered like mr funk bather for instead of ordinary notice be written up in large capital trespasser will be married with utmost rigour of law oh what be to do thought poor david there girl coming into after know shell spoil everything began running back towards stream again for felt must rather fight pike than be married then thought of savage jaw dreadful teeth leg simply must not take nearer stream said just a if have spoken aloud between mind said that have better face danger sooner than be married leg said that must go anywhere except towards pike completely lost head began running in circle round field saying to in most determined voice wont be married wont be eaten by pike wont be married to pike wont be eaten by anybody illustration noah pursues david so round round ran though time there be nothing easier than to walk out of gate get away from marriage meadow altogether for there be not soul in sight sound except of pike still calling coward coward david have quite lost head simple thing a never occurred to at then saw that wasnt
