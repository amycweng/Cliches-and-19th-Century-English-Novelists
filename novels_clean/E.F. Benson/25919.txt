to give disgusted glance at picture on back page of morning illustrated paper chiefly represented young woman dancing in ring in surf lying on beach in attitude miss mapp must have scorned to adjust

link other first step in duty diversion of day did not get into full swing till half past ten miss mapp have ample time to skim headline of paper indulge in chaste meditation about occupant of two house before need really make herself alert to miss nothing of two major flint without doubt be more attractive to feminine sense for year miss mapp have tried to cajole into marrying have not nearly finished yet with record of adventure with romantic reek of india camphor in tiger skin of rug strewed hall surged like rising tide up wall with haughty gallant manner with loud pshawings sniff at nonsense balderdash thumping on table to emphasize argument with wound prodigious swipe at golf intolerance of who believed in ghost microbe vegetarianism there be something dashing risky about felt that be in presence of hot coal straight from furnace of creation captain puffin on other hand be of clay so different that must hardly be considered to be made of clay at be lame short meagre with string of peaceful bead papuan apron in hall instead of wild tiger skin have jerky inattentive manner high pitched voice yet to miss mapp mind there be something behind unimpressiveness have mysterious quality more so because nothing of appeared on surface nobody must call major flint with bawling sniffings least mysterious laid loud card on table great hulking king ace miss mapp felt far from sure that captain puffin did not hold joker must time come to light idea of being mr puffin be not so attractive a other occasionally gave remote consideration yet there be mystery about in spite of fact that most of movement be so amply accounted for a rule played golf together in morning reposed in afternoon a must easily be verified by anyone standing on still day in road between house listening to loud rhythmical breathing fanned tranquil air certainly went out to tea party afterwards played bridge till dinner time if such entertainment be proffered occupied arm chair at country club laboriously amassed hundred at billiards though tea party be profuse dining out be very rare at tilling patience jig saw puzzle occupied hour two intervened between domestic supper bed time again again miss mapp have seen light burning in sitting room of two neighbour at hour when such light a be still in evidence at tilling be strictly confined to bedroom must indeed have be extinguished there only last week being plucked from slumber by unaccountable indigestion for blamed small green apple have seen at le than twelve thirty in morning light in captain puffin sitting room still shining through blind have excited so much that at risk of toppling into street have craned neck from window observed similar illumination in house of major flint be not together then for in case prudent householder god knew that of scraped saved enough if did know miss mapp did must have quenched own light if be talking to friend in friend house next night pang of indigestion having completely vanished set alarum clock at same timeless hour have observed exactly same phenomenon such late hour of course amply accounted for late breakfast why so miss mapp pithily asked why late hour of course kept summer time whereas most of tilling utterly refused except when going by train to alter watch because mr lloyd george told to even allowing for then perceived that summer time made later than ever for adherent so be excuse miss mapp have mind be incapable of believing improbable current explanation of late hour be very improbable indeed major flint often told world in general that be revising diary that only uninterrupted time must find in pleasant whirl of life at tilling be when be alone in evening captain puffin on part confessed to student curiosity about ancient history of tilling with regard to be preparing monograph must talk when permitted by hour about reclamation from sea of marsh land south of town about old roman road be built on raised causeway of trace remained argued so thought miss mapp unprecedented egoism on part of major flint equally unprecedented love of antiquity on part of captain puffin that must prosecute study with gas at present price till such hour miss mapp knew better than have not made up mind exactly what be that knew mentally rejected idea that egoism even in day of diary autobiography antiquity accounted for so much study with same healthy intolerance with vigorous stomach reject unwholesome food did not allow to be insidiously poisoned by retention a took up light aluminium opera glass to make sure whether be isabel poppit not who be now stepping with high prancing tread into stationer in high street exclaimed to herself for three hundred sixty fifth time after breakfast be very baffling for be precisely year to day since have first seen mysterious midnight square of illuminated blind baffling in fact be word constantly made short appearance in miss mapp vocabulary though retention for whole year over one subject be unprecedented never yet have baffled sullied well of pure undefiled english movement have begun mr plaistow carrying wicker basket came round corner by church in direction of miss mapp window a there be temporary coolness between following violent heat with regard to worsted of brilliant rose madder hue forgetful draper have sold to mr plaistow having definitely promised to miss mapp miss mapp large mindedness scorned to recall sordid detail of paltry appropriation heat have quite subsided miss mapp be for part quite prepared to let coolness regain normal temperature of cordiality moment mr plaistow returned that worsted outwardly publicly friendly relationship have be resumed a coolness have lasted six week so be probable that worsted have already be incorporated into ornamental border of mr plaistow jumper winter scarf proper expression of regret must have to do instead so nearer mr plaistow approached more invisible became to miss mapp eye when be within saluting distance have vanished altogether simultaneously miss poppit came out of stationer in high street mr plaistow turned corner below miss mapp window went bobbing along down steep hill walked with motion of mechanical doll sold in street have three leg set a spoke to circle so foot emerge from dress with dutch rigid regularity figure have certain squat rotundity suited gait distinctly looked into captain puffin dining room window a passed with misplaced juvenility so characteristic of waggled plump little hand at at corner beyond major flint house hesitated moment turned off down entry into side street where mr wyse lived dentist lived there too a mr wyse be away on continent of europe mr plaistow be almost certain to be visiting other rapidly miss mapp remembered that at mr bartlett bridge party yesterday mr plaistow have selected soft chocolate for consumption instead of stuffed with nougat almond that furnished additional evidence for dentist for generally must not get nougat chocolate at if godiva plaistow have be in room for more than minute two a crossed narrow cobbled roadway with grass growing luxuriantly between rounded pebble stumbled recovered with swift little forward run circular foot twinkled with rapidity of of thrush scudding over lawn by time isabel poppit have advanced a far a fish shop three door below turning down mr plaistow have vanished prancing progress paused there for moment waited with one knee highly elevated like statue of curveting horse before finally decided to pas on passed further than fruit shop next door took three step elevated from street in single prance with roman nose high in air presently emerged with obvious rotundity like of melon projecting from basket so miss mapp must see exactly what have purchased went back to fish shop again surely must not put fish on top of fruit even a miss mapp lucid intelligence rejected supposition true solution struck ice said to herself sure enough projecting from top of miss poppit basket when came out be angular peak wrapped up in paper already wet miss poppit came up street miss mapp put up illustrated paper again with revolting picture of brighton sea nymph turned towards window peeping out behind observed that miss poppit basket be apparently oozing with bright venous blood felt certain that have bought red currant coupled with ice made conjecture complete have bought red currant slightly damaged must not have oozed so speedily in order to make iced red currant fool of have so freely partaken at miss mapp last bridge party be very scurvy trick for iced red currant fool be invention of miss mapp who when be praised said that inherited recipe from grandmother miss poppit have evidently entered list against grandmamma mapp have a evidently guessed that quite inferior fruit fruit be distinctly off be undetectable when severely iced miss mapp must only hope that fruit in basket now bobbing past window be so much off that have begun to ferment fermented red currant fool be nasty to taste if persevered in disastrous in effect general unpopularity might be needed to teach miss poppit not to trespass on grandmamma mapp preserve isabel poppit lived with flashy condescending mother just round corner beyond gardener cottage opposite west end of church be comparatively new inhabitant of tilling having settled here only two three year ago tilling have not yet quite ceased to regard a rather suspicious character suspicion smouldered though blazed no longer be certainly rich miss mapp suspected of being profiteer kept butler of whom be in considerable awe who used almost to shrug shoulder when mr poppit gave order kept motor car to mr poppit be apt to allude more frequently than must have be natural if have always be accustomed to one went to switzerland for month winter to scotland for shooting season a mr poppit terribly remarked summer looked very black though isabel conformed to manner of tilling in doing household shopping morning with wicker basket buying damaged fruit for fool in dressing in original home made manner indicated by good breeding narrow income miss mapp be sadly afraid that habit be not outcome of chaste instinctive simplicity of ambition to be received by old family of tilling a one of what did true tillingite want with butler motor car if be not sufficient to cast grave doubt on sincerity of inhabitant of ye smalle house there be still very vivid in miss mapp mind that dreadful moment undimmed by year have passed over when mr poppit broke silence at altogether too sumptuous lunch by asking mr plaistow if did not find super tax grievous burden on little income miss mapp have drawn in breath sharply a if in pain after few gasp turned conversation worst of perhaps because more recent be fact that mr poppit have just received dignity of mbe member of order of british empire put on card too a if to keep scandal alive service in connection with tilling hospital have be entirely confined to putting motor car at disposal when did not want not single member of tilling working club have knitted finger to bone made enough seven tailed bandage to reach to moon have be offered similar decoration if anyone have must have known what to do stinging letter to prime minister saying that worked not with hope of distinction from pure patriotism must have certainly be miss mapp rejoinder actually drafted letter when mr poppit name appeared diligently waded through column after column of subsequent list to make sure that originator of tilling working club have not be victim of similar insult mr poppit be climber be what be miss mapp be obliged to confess very nimble have be butler motor car so frequently at disposal of mr poppit friend incessant lunch tea have done work have fed rather than starved tilling into submission miss mapp felt that alone upheld dignity of old family be positively only old family solitary spinster at who have not surrendered to poppits naturally did not carry staunchness to extent so to speak of hunger strike for must be singular conduct only worthy of suffragette partook of poppits hospitality to fullest extent possible here principle came in never returned hospitality of member of british empire though occasionally asked isabel to house abused soundly on possible occasion spiteful retrospect passed swiftly smoothly through miss mapp mind did not in least take off from acuteness with observed tide in affair of tilling after ebb of night be now flowing again did few minute after isabel disappearance round corner prevent from hearing faint tinkle of telephone in own house at started to foot paused again at door have shrewd suspicion about servant with regard to telephone be convinced though at present have not be able to get evidence on point that cook parlourmaid used for own base purpose at expense that friend habitually employed for conversation with perhaps who know housemaid be worst of lot for affected almost incredible stupidity with regard to instrument pretended not to be able to speak through to understand cacklings might very well be assumed in order to divert suspicion so miss mapp paused by door to let of delinquent get deep in conversation with friend soft stealthy advance towards room called morning room small apartment opening out of hall used chiefly for bestowal of hat cloak umbrella must then enable to catch one of red mouthed at rate to overhear fragment of conversation must supply equally direct evidence have got no further than garden door into house when withers parlourmaid came out miss mapp thereupon began to smile hum tune then smile widened tune stopped yes withers said be looking for yes miss said withers miss poppit have just rung up miss mapp looked much surprised to think that telephone must have rung without hearing said must be growing deaf withers in old age what doe miss poppit want hope will be able to go to tea afternoon play bridge expects that few friend may look in at quarter to four flood of lurid light poured into miss mapp mind to expect that few friend may look in be orthodox way of announcing regular party to have not be asked miss mapp knew a if by special revelation that if went must find that made eighth to complete two table of bridge when butler opened door must undoubtedly have in hand half sheet of paper on be written name of expected friend if caller name be not on list must tell with brazen impudence that mr poppit miss poppit be at home while before baffled visitor have turned back must admit caller who duly appeared on reference paper so then poppits be giving bridge party to have only be bidden at last moment clearly to take place of expected friend who have developed influenza lost aunt be obliged to go to london here too be explanation of why a have overheard yesterday major flint captain puffin be only intending to play one round of golf to day to come back by train why seek further for explanation of lump of ice red currant probably damaged have observed isabel purchase anyone must see at least miss mapp must why have gone to stationer in high street just before pack of card who expected friend be who have disappointed mr poppit must be thought out later at present a miss mapp smiled at withers hummed tune again have to settle whether be going to be delighted to accept obliged to decline argument in favour of being obliged to decline be obvious mr poppit deserved to be served out for not including among original guest if declined be quite probable that at late hour hostess might not be able to get anyone else so one of table must be completely spoiled in favour of accepting be fact that must get rubber of bridge good tea must be able to say something disagreeable about red currant fool must serve miss poppit out for attempting to crib ancestral dish bright joyous diabolical idea struck went to telephone genteelly wiped place where withers have probably breathed on so kind of isabel said be very busy to day did give much notice did so will try to look in if can will might be able to squeeze in there be pause miss mapp knew that have put isabel in hole if successfully tried to get somebody else miss mapp might find must squeeze in there must be nine if failed to get someone else miss mapp must squeeze in then there must be seven isabel must have tranquil moment day ah do squeeze in said in horrid wheedling tone for reason major flint found so attractive that be one of weak point about there be many many others be among miss mapp found difficult to condone if possibly can said miss mapp at late hour good bye dear only au reservoir hope heard isabel polite laugh at nearly new delicious malaprop before rang off isabel collected malaprop wrote out in note book if reversed note book began at other end must find collection of spoonerism be very amusing too tea followed by bridge party be in summer chief manifestation of spirit of hospitality in tilling mr poppit be true have attempted to do something in way of dinner party though be at liberty to give a many dinner party a pleased nobody else have followed ostentatious example dinner party entailed higher scale of living miss mapp for one have accurately counted cost of having three hungry people to dinner found that one such dinner party be not nearly compensated for in way of expense by being invited to three subsequent dinner party by guest voluptuous tea be rule after really wanted more than little bit of thing cup of soup slice of cold tart dished up piece of fish toasted cheese then after excitement of bridge bridge be very exciting in tilling jig saw puzzle patience cooled brain composed nerve in winter however with scarcity of daylight tilling commonly gave evening bridge party asked requisite number of friend to drop in after dinner though everybody knew that everybody else have only partaken of bit of thing probably ruinous price of coal have something to do with evening bridge party for fire warmed room when be alone must warm guest a well then when hospitality be returned must let sitting room fire go out though miss mapp be already planning something in connection with winter bridge winter be long way off yet before miss mapp got back to window in garden room mr poppit great offensive motor car always alluded to a royce have come round corner stopping opposite major flint house be entirely extinguishing survey of street beyond be clear enough then that have sent royce to take two out to golf link so that must have time to play round catch back to tilling again so a to be in good time for bridge party even a looked major flint came out of house on one side of royce captain puffin on other royce obstructed view of other simultaneously of shouted across to house of other captain puffin emitted loud coo ee major australian ejaculation learned on voyage while major flint bellowed qui hi captain world knew be of oriental origin noise of made prevented from hearing other presently one in fuming hurry to start ran round in front of car at precise moment that other ran round behind banged loudly on other knocker knock be not so precisely simultaneous a shout have be led to mutual discovery hailed with peal of falsetto laughter on part of captain puffin more manly guffaw of major after that royce lumbered down grass grown cobble of street after great deal of reversing managed to turn corner miss mapp set off with basket to do shopping carried in weekly book must leave with payment not without argument at tradesman shop there be item for suet intended to resist to last breath in body though butcher must probably surrender long before that there be item for egg at dairy might have to pay though be monstrous overcharge have made up mind about laundry intended to pay bill with icy countenance say good morning for ever word to effect unless proprietor instantly produced article of clothing have be lost in wash like king john treasure refunded ample sum for replacing of quarrelsome errand be meat drink to miss mapp tuesday morning day on paid disputed weekly bill be a enjoyable a sunday morning when sitting close under pulpit noted glaring inconsistency grammatical error in discourse after bill be paid business be done there be pleasure to follow for there be fitting on at dress maker fitting on of tea gown to be worn at winter evening bridge party unless miss mapp be sadly mistaken must astound agonize by magnificence who set eye on have found description of a worn by mr titus w trout in american fashion paper be of what be described a kingfisher blue have lump wedge of lace round edge of skirt orange chiffon round neck a set off with basket full of tradesman book pictured to herself with watering fury jealousy madness of envy must raise in properly constituted breast in spite of malignant curiosity cancerous suspicion about friend in spite too of restless activity miss mapp be not a might have be expected lady of lean emaciated appearance be tall portly with plump hand broad benignant face dimpled well nourished cheek acute observer might have detected danger warning in sidelong glance of rather bulgy eye in certain tightness at corner of expansive mouth boded ill for who came within snapping distance to more superficial view be rollicking good natured figure of woman mode of address too bore out misleading impression nothing for instance must have be more genial just now than telephone voice to isabel poppit smile to withers even while so strongly suspected of using telephone for own base purpose a passed along high street showered little smile bow on acquaintance friend markedly drew back lip in speaking being in way ashamed of long white teeth wore practically perpetual smile when there be least chance of being under observation though at sermon time on sunday a have be already remarked greedily noted weakness error of twenty

called riseholme be rather looked down on there a not being sufficiently intellectual within week of miss mapp return tilling rang with let be understood that be original humorist godiva plaistow came whizzing along pavement short stout breathless body who might so thought miss mapp have acted up to full fell association of christian name without exciting smallest curiosity on part of lewd miss mapp have much same sort of figure height so be perfectly satisfied to imagine converted corpulence into swift alternation of dutch looking foot gave impression that mr plaistow be going at prodigious speed must stop revolving without warning then stood still just when collision with miss mapp seemed imminent came to dead halt be a well to be quite certain that be going to poppits miss mapp forgave

problem about bridge party thus seemed to be solved two poppits two bartlett major captain with diva darling made eight miss mapp with sudden recrudescence of indignation against isabel with regard to red currant fool belated invitation made up mind that must not be able to squeeze in thus leaving party one short even apart from red currant fool served poppits right for not asking originally only

satisfaction if have not contained so many court card must have proposed playing for sixpence not shilling hundred semblance of manner be invariably thrown to wind by lady of tilling when once bridge began primeval hatred took place winner of hand be exasperatingly condescending to loser loser correspondingly bitter tremulous miss mapp failed to get contract a partner contribution to success consisted of more two three than be ever seen together before when quaint irene at end said bad luck mapp miss mapp hand trembled so much with passion that with difficulty marked score must command voice sufficiently to say lovely of to be sympathetic dear irene in answer gave short hoarse laugh dealed by time boon have deposited at left hand of player cup containing red creamy fluid on surface of bubble intermittently appeared isabel at moment being dummy have strolled across from other table to see that everybody be comfortable provided with sustenance in time of stress here be clearly proper opportunity for miss mapp to take spoonful of attempt at red currant fool with wry face hastily not too hastily smothered in smile to push revolting compound away from one spoonful that took be so delicious exhilarating that be positively unable to be good for isabel instead drank cup to dreg in absent manner while considering how many trump be out red currant fool made similarly agreeable impression on major flint word said that be amazingly good cooling on hot day like full of champagne miss mapp seeing that be so popular have of course to claim again a family invention dear major said there be champagne in be grandmamma mapp famous red currant fool with little addition perhaps by champagne yolk of egg little cream dear isabel have got very nearly right padre have promised to take more trick in diamond than have slightest chance of doing mental worry communicated to voice why must there be nary wee drappie o ' champagne in said though grandmamma mapp did invent weel let see hand partner eh be sair sight there will be sair wee score agin when ye be through with playin o ' said irene in tone must not be acquitted of mocking intent why hell hallelujah did go on when did support even that one glass of red currant fool though there be champagne in have produced together with certainty that opponent have overbidden hand pleasant exhilaration in miss mapp yolk of egg a everybody knew be strong stimulant suddenly name red currant fool seemed very amusing to red currant fool said what quaint old fashioned name will invent others will tell cook to make gooseberry idiot strawberry donkey play think ducky little ace of spade haw haw gooseberry idiot said partner capital wo beat in hurry two of spade on top of must expect to find two of spade at bottom of said padre with singular acidity major be quick to resent kind of comment from man cloth cloth well by leave bartlett by leave repeat said will expect to find two of spade precisely where please when want criticism miss mapp hastily intervened after wee ace little king piece said if partner doe play queen to delicious play just one more yes lovely partner put wee trumpy on be not surprised take more than to surprise then padre got spade ken fine hoot said padre with temperate disgust hand proceeded for round two in silence during by wink gesture to boon major got hold of cupful of red currant fool there be already heavy penalty of trick against miss mapp opponent after moment refreshment major led club of at period miss mapp seemed to have none felt happier than have be ever since trying to spoil isabel second table have only succeeded in completing little trumpy again said putting on with lightness of one of white butterfly turning trick useful little trumpy broke off suddenly from chant of victory lady of tilling be accustomed to indulge in during cross rough for discovered in hand more than useless little clubby silence succeeded became tense in quality miss mapp knew have revoked squeezed brain to think how must possibly dispose of card while there be certain calmness about padre too clearly indicated that be quite content to wait for inevitable disclosure came at last trick though miss mapp made one forlorn attempt to thrust horrible little clubby underneath other card gather up padre pounced on what ho fair lady said now completely restored methinks thou art forsworn let have keek at last trick three verily wi that thou didst trump ye club aforetime said so there be eh that be bonny for partner miss mapp of course denied ruthless reconstruction of trick took place major still busy with red currant fool be last to grasp disaster then instantly deplored unsportsmanlike greed of adversary well must have thought in friendly game like said of course be within right bartlett might be right hey upon word pound of flesh know ca think what made do partner never asked if have more club said miss mapp shrilly giving up for moment contention that have not revoked always ask if partner have more of suit always maintain that revoke be more partner fault than player of course if adversary claim naturally do mapp said irene be down on sharp enough other day miss mapp wrinkled face up into sweetest extremest smile of mobile feature be capable darling wo mind telling just at moment be being dummy said so must speak single word otherwise there be revoke even if there be at consider far from proved yet there be further proof possible beyond clear final evidence of card since everybody including miss mapp be perfectly well aware that have revoked opponent merely marked up penalty game proceeded miss mapp of course following rule of correct behaviour after revoking stiffened into state of offended dignity be extremely polite distant with partner adversary alike demeanour became even more majestic when in next hand major led out of turn moment have done miss mapp hurriedly threw random card out of hand on to table in hope that irene by strange aberration must think have led first wait second said call lead give trump please suddenly awful expression a of outraged empress faded from miss mapp face gave little shriek of laughter sounded like squeaking slate pencil have got one dear said now may have permission to lead what think best thank there now existed between four player that state of violent animosity be usual atmosphere towards end of rubber must have be capital mistake to suppose that be not enjoying immensely emotion be salt of life here be end of salt everyone be overbidding hand penalty trick be glorious cause of vituperation scarcely veiled between partner who have failed to make good caused epidemic of condescending sympathy from adversary produced passion in loser far keener than fury at having lost what made concluding stage of contest more exciting be that evening breeze suddenly arising just a deal be ended made card rise in air like covey of partridge be recaptured hand be found to be complete with exception of miss mapp have card missing ace of heart be discovered by padre face upwards in bed of mignonette be vehement in claiming fresh deal on ground that card be exposed miss mapp must not speak at in answer to preposterous claim must only smile at proceed to declare trump a if nothing have happened major alone failed to come up to full measure of enjoyment for though rest of be a angry with a be with other remained in most indecorous state of good humour drinking thirstily of red currant fool when be dummy quite failing to mind whether miss mapp got contract not captain puffin at other table seemed to be behaving with same impropriety for sound of shrill falsetto laugh be a regular a visit to bucket of red currant fool what if there be champagne in after so miss mapp luridly conjectured what if unseemly good humour be due to incipient intoxication took little more of delicious decoction be unanimously determined when two rubber came to end almost simultaneously that a everything be so pleasant agreeable there must be fresh sorting of player besides second table be only playing stake of sixpence hundred must be very awkward unsettling that anyone must play moderate point in one rubber high one next at point miss mapp table be obliged to endure pause for padre have to hurry away just before six to administer rite of baptism in church be so conveniently close major afforded good deal of amusement a soon a be out of hearing by hoping that must not baptize child knave of heart if be boy if girl queen of spade in order to spare

to waver in belief that there be champagne in particularly a must not have suited theory by accounted for major unwonted good humour suggestion that pop have heard so clearly be opening of bottle of stone ginger beer be not delivered with conviction to make sure however took one more sip of new supply irradiated with smile made great concession believe be wrong said there be something in beyond yolk of egg cream oh there be boon will tell made seductive face at boon beckoned to boon will think very inquisitive of asked archly if ask whether have put teeny drop of champagne into delicious red currant fool bottle half miss said boon morosely pint of old brandy will have more miss miss mapp curbed indignation at vulgar squandering of precious liquid so characteristic of poppits gave shrill

published if who have only just tasted red currant fool tripped in speech how amply be major flint good nature captain puffin incessant laugh accounted for felt very good natured too how pleasant be oh naughty said to major pray hush be disturbing at rubber here be padre back again new rubber have only just begun indeed be lucky that cut card without delay when mr poppit appeared on return from expedition to london miss mapp begged to take hand instantly began playing must really be kindness to mr poppit said diamond at partner of course if wo have be missing such lovely party so much

morning six eight in morning be queer time of day to recommend old campaigner to be awake at often be talked to too bet hat about sitting up late exhausting nervous faculty major flint choked laughed inhaled tobacco smoke till got purple in face sitting up one side of street gasped pretending to be interested in roman road on other pulling long face over diary of with roman road diary to name let have end to such unsociable arrangement old friend bring roman road bottle to lay dust over to one night will bring diary peg over to next never drink alone one of maxim in life if can find someone to

agreeable advent of taxi be announced arm in arm limped down steep path together to road little way off to left be great bunker primarily be cause of present amity a drove by major waggled red hand at au reservoir said back again soon be late that night when miss mapp felt that be physically incapable of tacking on single poppy more to edge of skirt went to window of garden room where have be working to close glanced up at top story of own house saw that light in servant room be out glanced to right concluded that gardener have gone to bed finally glanced down street saw with pang of pleasure that window of major house showed sign of midnight labour be intensely gratifying indicated that influence be at work in for in response to wish so often so tactfully urged on that must go to bed earlier not work so hard at night here be darkened window dismissed a unworthy suspicion have be aroused by red currant fool window of bedroom be dark too must have already put out light miss mapp made haste over little tidyings so that might not be found transgressor to own precept there be light in captain puffin house have le impressionable nature than major be in so many way far inferior did really find roman road so wonderfully exhilarating miss mapp sincerely hoped that did that be nothing else of le pure innocent allurement kept up a closed window very gently did just seem to that there have be something equally baffling in major flint egoistical vigil over diary that have wondered whether there be not something else have hardly formulated what kept light burning so late must now cross dear man late habit out of list of riddle about tilling awaited solution whatever have be diary what not used to keep up have broken habit now whereas captain puffin have not took poppy bordered skirt over arm smiled thankful way to bed must allow to wonder with little more definiteness now that major light be out be abed what must be rendered captain puffin so oblivious to passage of time when be investigating roman road how glad be that major be not with benjamin flint said to herself a having put window open trod softly so a not to disturb slumberer next door across room on fat white foot to big white bed good night major benjy whispered a put light out be not to be supposed that diva must act on miss mapp alarming hint morning a to fate of coal hoarder give say ton of fuel to hospital at once in lieu of usual smaller christmas contribution without making further inquiry in proper quarter a to legal liability of having so ascertained three ton in cellar a soon a visitor have left morning popped out to see mr wootten coal merchant returned in state of fury for there be regulation whatever in existence with regard to amount of coal that householder might choose to amass mr wootten complimented on prudence in having got in reasonable supply for thought quite probable that if coal strike took place there must be difficulty in month time from now in replenishing cellar have have good supply summer added agreeable mr wootten customer have got cellar well stocked diva rapidly recollected that perfidious elizabeth be among o mr wootten said miss mapp popped dropped in to see just now told have hardly got mr wootten turned up ledger be not etiquette to disclose affair of one client to if there be cantankerous customer one who be never satisfied with price quality that client be miss mapp allowed broad grin to overspread agreeable face well ma'be if in month time be short of coal there be friend of yours in tilling who can let have permitted to say be idle to attempt to cut out bunch of rose while hand be so feverish trundled up down high street to cool off have not be so prudent a to make inquiry a likely a not must have sent ton of coal very day to hospital so strongly have elizabeth perfidious warning inflamed imagination a to fate of hoarder time elizabeth own cellar be glutted though have asserted that be almost fuelless why must have in possession more coal than diva since mr wootten have clearly implied that be elizabeth who must be borrowed from because of wretched piece of rose madder worsted by degree calmed down for be use attempting to plan revenge with brain at fever heat must be calm icily ingenious a cooling process went on began to wonder whether be worsted alone have prompted friend diabolical suggestion seemed more likely that motive one strangely elizabethan be cause of elizabeth might be taken for certain a being coal hoarder be ever so like to divert suspicion by pretending cellar be next to empty have be equally severe on who might happen to be hoarding food in case transport be disarranged supply fell short with sudden flare of authentic intuition diva mind blazed with conjecture that elizabeth be hoarding food a well luck ever attends bold constructive thinker apple for instance fell from tree precisely when newton mind be groping after law of gravity a diva stepped into grocer to begin morning shopping for have be occupied with rose ever since breakfast attendant be at telephone at back of shop spoke in lucid telephone voice have only two of big tin of corned beef said there be pause during to psychic diva ear might have seemed to grow a pointed with attention a satyr must only hear little hollow quack from other end tongue a well very good will send up at once added came forward into shop good morning said diva voice be tremulous with anxiety investigation got big tin of corned beef one contain six pound very sorry ma'be have only got two have just be ordered small pot of ginger then please said diva recklessly will send round immediately yes ma'be boy just going out be luck diva hurried into street be absorbed by headline of news outside stationer be favourite place for observation for appeared to be quite taken up by topic of day kept oblique eye on true object of scrutiny have not got to wait long for almost immediately grocer boy came out of shop with heavy basket on arm delivered small pot of ginger at own door proceeded along street be unfortunately popular conversational youth who have great deal to say to friend period of waiting to see if must turn up steep street led to miss mapp house be very protracted at corner deliberately put down basket altogether lit cigarette never have diva so acutely deplored spread of tobacco habit among juvenile population having refreshed turned up steep street passed fishmonger fruiterer did not take turn down to dentist mr wyse have errand to major house to captain then oh then rang bell at miss mapp back door time diva have be following keeping head well down so a to avert possibility of observation from window of garden room walking so slowly that motion of foot seemed not circular at then bell be answered delivered into withers hand one two tin of corned beef round ox tongue put basket on head came down street again shrilly whistling if diva have have reasonably small change in pocket must assuredly have given small share in lacking trundled home with speed began cutting out rose with swift certain stroke of nail scissors now have already noticed that elizabeth have paid visit to grocer on three consecutive day three consecutive day think of given that purchase on other occasion have be on same substantial scale a to day became matter of thrilling interest a to where kept store must not keep in coal cellar for be already bursting with coal diva who have assisted base one in making prodigious quantity of jam that year from well stocked garden be aware that kitchen cupboard be like to be a replete a coal cellar before hoarding of dead ox began then there be big cupboard under stair must scarcely be site of prodigious cache for be full of cardboard curtain carpet rubbishy accumulation elizabeth must not bear to part with then have large cupboard in bedroom spare room full to overflowing of mouldy clothes there be positively not cupboard in house that diva knew of crushed temple in hand in attempt to locate hiding place of hoard diva suddenly jumped up with happy squeal of discovery in excitement snapped scissors with so random stroke that completely cut in bunch of rose that be engaged on there be cupboard best biggest of most secret most discreet lay embedded in wall of garden room cloaked concealed behind shelf of false book case contained more than simulacrum of book just book with title have never yet appeared on honest book there be twelve volume of beauty of nature shelf full of elegant extract there be volume simply called poem there be commentary there be travel astronomy lowest tallest shelf be full of music card table habitually stood in front of false repository of learning be only last week that diva prying casually round room while elizabeth have gone to take off gardening glove have noticed modest catch let into wood work without doubt then book case be door of cupboard with stroke of intuition too sure to be called guess diva be aware that have correctly inferred storage of nefarious hoard only remained to verify conclusion if possible expose with circumstance of public ignominy be in hurry must bide time aware that in probability day that passed must see addition to damning content day when be playing bridge card table have be moved out in rubber when be dummy elizabeth greedily playing hand must secretly accidentally press catch acute vision have so providentially revealed to attacked chintz curtain again with appetite for pink rose agreeably whetted hour work must give sufficient bunch for purpose unless dyer be a perfidious a elizabeth now purple jacket skirt must arrive afternoon two day hard work must be sufficient for so accomplished needlewoman a herself to make original decoration in meantime for diva be never idle be chiefly occupied with dress got out certain american fashion paper there be in description of tea gown worn by mr titus w trout believed be within dressmaking capacity must attempt anyhow if proved to be beyond must entrust more difficult part to little dressmaker whom elizabeth employed who be certainly very capable costume be of so daring splendid nature that feared to take anyone into confidence about lest hint gossip for tilling be gossipy place might leak out kingfisher blue made mouth water to dwell on sumptuous syllable miss mapp be so feverishly occupied next morning with application of poppy to corn coloured skirt that paid very little attention to opening gambit of day a regard world in general more particularly major benjy after early retirement last night be probably up with lark morning when between past ten eleven sonorous qui hi sounded through open window shock experienced interrupted for moment floral industry be certainly very odd that having gone to bed at so respectable hour last night must be calling for porridge only now with impulse of unusual optimism figured a having be at work on diary before breakfast in absorbing occupation having forgotten how late be growing that doubt be explanation though must be nice to know for certain if information positively forced on notice a worked framing lip with elaborate motion to syllable dumbly practised phrase major benjy sometimes in moment of gallantry called miss elizabeth meant when have got accustomed to by practice to say major benjy to by accident must no doubt beg to make habit of friendly slip of tongue tongue led to new train of thought presently paused in work pulling card table away from deceptive book case pressed concealed catch of door peeped in there be still room for further small precaution against starvation owing to impending coal strike took stock of provision even if strike lasted quite long time there must now be immediate lack of necessary of life for cupboard glistened with tinned meat flour merchant have sent very sensible sack with considerable exertion transferred to high shelf in cupboard instead of allowing to remain standing on floor for withers have informed of unpleasant rumour about mouse mary have observed lost in thought in front of cupboard so mousie will only find tin on floor now thought miss mapp mousie will try teeth on tin there be tea coffee in abundance jar of jam filled kitchen shelf if morning laid in moderate supply of dried fruit there be reason to face future with anything fortitude must see about now for busy though be must not miss shopping parade must diva wondered be at window snipping rose out of chintz curtain careful thrifty soul perhaps time to morrow diva looking out of window must see that somebody else have be quicker about being thrifty than must be fun major dining room window be open a miss mapp passed must not help hearing loud angry remark about egg coming from inside that made clear that be still at breakfast that if have be working at diary in fresh morning hour forgetting time early rising in spite of early retirement last night must not be supposed to suit oriental temper change of habit be invariably known to be upsetting miss mapp be hopeful that in day two must feel quite different man further down street be quaint irene lounging at door of new studio converted coach house smoking cigarette dressed like jockey hullo mapp said come have look round new studio have seen yet will give house warming next week bridge party miss mapp tried to steel for hundredth time to appear quite unconscious that be being addressed when irene said mapp in odious manner never must summon up sufficient nerve to be rude to so awful mimic good morning dear one said sycophantically will peep in for moment decoration of studio be even more appalling than might have be expected there be german stove in corner made of pink porcelain rafter roof be painted wall be of magenta distemper floor be blue in corner be very large orange coloured wall be hung with specimen of irene art there be stout female with clothes on at whom be impossible not to recognize a being lucy there be study of fat leg ample bosom on easel be picture evidently in process of completion represented man from miss mapp instantly averted eye eve said irene pointing to lucy miss mapp naturally guessed that gentleman who be almost in same costume be adam turned completely away from what lovely idea to have blue floor dear said how original be that pretty scarlet ceiling find when be painting that bright colour disturb not bit stimulate sense of colour miss mapp moved towards screen what delicious big screen said yes go behind mapp said irene will see model undressing miss mapp retreated from precipitately a from wasp nest examined of study on wall for be more than probable from unfinished picture on easel adam lurked behind delicious screen terrible though be be conscious of unbridled curiosity to know who be be dreadful to think that there must be man in tilling so depraved a to stand to be looked at with so little on irene strolled round wall with study of lucy said see dear said miss mapp how clever leg thing when have bridge party wo perhaps cover of up turn to wall must be looking at picture instead of attending to card if be thinking of asking padre know be approaching corner of room where screen stood when movement there a if adam have hit with elbow made miss mapp turn round screen fell flat on ground within yard of stood mr hopkins proprietor of fish shop just up street often often have miss mapp have pleasant little conversation with with view to bringing down price of flounder have little bathing drawer on hullo hopkins be ready said irene know miss mapp miss mapp have not imagined that time eternity combined must hold so embarrassing moment did not know where to look wherever looked must not be at hopkins wherever looked must not be unaware that hopkins raised large bare arm touched place where cap must have be if have have one good morning hopkins said well irene darling must be trotting leave to hardly knew what to call to work tripped from room seemed to be entirely full of unclothed limb redder than one of mr hopkins boiled lobster hurried down street felt that must never face again must be obliged to go to establishment in high street where irene dealt when be fish wanted from fish shop head be in whirl at brazenness of mankind especially womankind how have irene started overture led to have just said to hopkins one morning will come to studio take off clothes if irene have not be wonderful mimic must certainly have felt duty to go straight to padre pulling down veil confide to whole sad story a be out of question went into twenlow ordered four pound of dried apricot chapter iv dyer a diva have feared proved perfidious be not till next morning that maid brought parcel containing coat skirt of projected costume diva have already done marketing so that might have other call on time to interfere with tacking on of bunch of pink rose hoped to have dress finished in time for elizabeth afternoon bridge party next day invitation to have just reached have also settled to have cold lunch to day so that cook a well a parlourmaid must devote to job have taken jacket for decoration be just tacking first rose on to collar when looked out of window what saw caused needle to fall from nerveless hand tripping along opposite pavement be elizabeth have on dress material of after moment gaze diva identified be that corn coloured coat skirt have worn so much last spring collar cuff waistband hem of skirt be covered with staring red poppy next moment called to remembrance chintz have once covered elizabeth sofa in garden room diva wasted time rang bell have to make certain janet said go straight out into high street walk close behind miss mapp look very carefully at dress see if poppy on be of chintz janet face fell why ma'be be never gone began quick said diva in strangled voice diva watched from window janet went out looked way that spied quarry skimmed up high street on foot twinkled a fast a mistress came back much out of breath with speed indignation yes ma'be said be chintz sure enough tacked on too just a be meaning to do oh ma'be janet quite appreciated magnitude of calamity voice failed what be to do ma'be added diva did not reply for moment sat with eye closed in profound concentrated thought required reflection to decide how impossible be to appear to morrow in dress seemed to ape costume tilling have seen elizabeth wearing to day at first looked a if there be nothing to be done with laboriously acquired bunch of rosebud for be clearly out of question to use a decoration for costume idle to think of sewing back into snipped gashed curtain looked at purple skirt coat hungered for flower then looked at janet janet be short roundabout person be ill naturedly supposed that have much same figure a mistress then light broke dazzling diabolical diva bounced to foot blinded by splendour coat skirt be yours janet said get with work of bustle cover with rose have finished to night wear to morrow wear always gave loud cackle of laughter threaded needle lor ma'be said janet admiringly be teaser thank ma'be be rose rose way diva have quite miscalculated number required there be sufficient not only to cover collar cuff border of skirt with to make line of six inch above hem original gorgeous a dress must be be yet sort of parody of elizabeth costume be attracting so much interest attention a popped in out of shop to day to morrow must be worn by janet janet diva be much mistaken must encourage friend to get permission to use up old bit of chintz very likely chintz decoration must become quite vogue among servant maid of tilling how elizabeth have got hold of idea mattered nothing anyhow must be surfeited with idea before diva have finished with be possible of course anything be possible that have occurred to independently diva be loath to give so innocent ancestry to adoption of be far more sensible to take for granted that have got wind of diva invention by odious underhand piece of spying what might be must be investigated probably determined later at present business of janet rose eclipsed other interest miss mapp shopping that morning be unusually prolonged for be important that woman in tilling must see poppy on corn coloured ground know that have worn that dress before diva appeared in mean adaptation of though total cost of entire purchase hardly amounted to shilling went in out of amazing number of shop made prodigious series of inquiry into price of commodity ranged from motor car to sealing wax often entered shop twice because wreathed in smiling apology for stupidity have forgotten what be told first time by twelve o'clock be satisfied that practically everybody with one exception have seen that costume have aroused deep sense of jealousy angry admiration so cunning be handiwork of herself withers mary that felt fairly sure that one have slightest notion of how decoration of poppy be accomplished for evie have run round in small mouse like circle murmuring to herself very effective idea be woven into cloth elizabeth dear wonder where must get like mr poppit have followed up street with eye glued to hem of skirt completely puzzled face then so thought elizabeth sweetly even member of order of british empire ca have everything own way a for major have simply come to dead stop when bounced out of house a passed said something very gallant appropriate even absence of one inhabitant of tilling dear diva did not strike jarring note in paean of triumph for miss mapp be quite satisfied that diva be busy indoors working finger to bone over application of bunch of rose a usual be perfectly correct in conjecture dear diva must have to see new frock to morrow afternoon at latest when came to bridge party perhaps must then for first time be wearing rose everybody must very pleasantly pity be so rapturous thought when miss mapp after

unusually early for window be dark by half past nine to night again position be reversed seemed that major benjy be good captain puffin be bad on whole then there be cause for thankfulness a added tin of biscuit two jar of bovril to prudent store found conscious sceptic about roman road diary perhaps be little different for egoism be more potent force than archaeology for part now definitely believed that roman road spelt form of drink be sorry to believe be duty to believe something of kind really did not know what else to believe did not go so far a mentally to accuse of drunkenness considering way absorbed red currant fool be clear that be foe to alcohol probably watered roman road with with vivid imagination pictured miss mapp recalled from melancholy reflection put up hand just in time to save bottle of bovril have put on top shelf in front of sack of flour from tumbling to ground with latest addition have made to larder required considerable ingenuity to fit tin package in for while diverted mind from captain puffin drinking to own eating by careful packing balancing managed to stow everything away with sufficient economy of space to allow to shut door then put card table in place again be then late with fond look at sweet flower sleeping in moonlight went to bed captain puffin sitting room be still alight even a deplored shadow in profile crossed blind shadow be queer thing must make beautiful shadow rabbit on wall by dexterous interlacement of finger thumb certainly shadow in momentary glance have of appeared to have large moustache must make nothing out of except to suppose just a finger thumb became rabbit so nose became moustache for must not have grown one since came back from golf be out early for shopping next morning for there be delicacy to be purchased for bridge party more particularly little chocolate cake have lately discovered looked very small innocent be in reality of so cloying substantial nature that partaker thereof must probably not feel capable of making serious inroad into other provision naturally be much on alert to day for be more than possible that diva dress be finished in evidence what colour must be did not know large quantity of rosebud must even at distance make identification easy diva be certainly not at window morning so seemed more than probable that must soon meet far away just crossing high street at further end caught sight of bright patch of purple very much of required shape there be surely pink border round skirt pink panel on collar just a surely mr bartlett recognizable for gliding mouse like walk be moving in fascinating wake then purple patch vanished into shop miss mapp smile poppy went with basket up street presently encountered evie who also smile seemed to have communication to make only got a far a have seen when gave little squeal of laughter quite inexplicable glided into dark entry minute afterwards purple patch suddenly appeared from shop almost collided with be not diva at diva janet shock be so indescribably severe that miss mapp smile be frozen so to speak a by sudden congealment on to face did not thaw off till have reached sharp turn at

across marsh be visible railway bridge thing be pitilessly unchanged miss mapp noted blankly until rage began to restore numbed current of mental process if record of history contained similar instance of such treachery low cunning a be involved in plot of diva to dress janet in rosebud chintz miss mapp must have liked to be told clearly distinctly what be must trace working of diva base mind with absolute accuracy if archangel in hierarchy of heaven have assured that diva have originally intended rosebud for janet must have scorned for clumsy perjury diva have designed executed that dress for herself just because miss mapp ingenuity inspired by two rosebud have fluttered out of window have forestalled have taken fiendish revenge be impossible to pervade high street covered with chintz poppy when parlourmaid be being equally pervasive in chintz rosebud be to be done with frock executed with such mirth malice by withers mary have idea might just a well give withers for must no longer wear tear poppy from hem bestrew high street with miss mapp face froze into immobility again for here trundling swiftly towards be diva diva appeared not to see till got quite close morning elizabeth said seen janet anywhere said miss mapp janet doubt according to instruction received popped out of shop came towards mistress here be said diva right janet go home will see to other thing be lovely day said miss mapp beginning to lash tail so bright yes pretty trimming of poppy said diva janet got rosebud be too much diva did think of said miss mapp in shaking voice saw new frock

of diva have got three at most pink bunch of rose come flying out of window into high street even poor wit small a be be equal to drawing conclusion that be cutting rose out of curtain well known fondness for dress did rest with permission diva intend to draw exactly what conclusion please on occasion including one ho be how got idea then said diva knew have cribbed from cribbed asked miss mapp in ironical ignorance of what so vulgar slangy expression meant cribbed mean taking what be yours said diva even then if have only acted in straightforward manner miss mapp shaken a with palsy regretted that have let slip out of pure childlike joy in irony manner in have obtained poppy notion in quarrel regret be useless went on again must very kindly explain how when have acted in manner

mr plaistow said miss mapp diva have be watching janet retreating figure feeling that though revenge be sweet revenge be also strangely expensive for have sacrificed one of most strikingly successful frock have ever made on smoking altar now revenge be gratified deeply regretted frock miss mapp heart be similarly wrung by torture revenge too have be hers general revenge on diva for existing dreadful counter stroke have made quite impossible for to enjoy use of frock more for must not habit like housemaid in fact have a matter at present stood completely wrecked other like two express train meeting in top speed collision since quarrel have clearly risen to utmost height there be farther joy of battle to be anticipated only melancholy task of counting corps so paused breathing very quickly trembling while sought for way out besides miss mapp have bridge party afternoon if parted now in extreme state of tension diva might conceivably not come thereby robbing of bridge spoiling hostess table naturally permanent quarrel be not contemplated by of for if quarrel be permanent in tilling nobody must be on speaking term more with anyone else in day two hardly le disastrous there must be fresh quarrel with anybody since must not quarrel without word there might be song without word a mendelssohn have proved not row without word by what formula must deadly antagonism be bridged without delay diva gazed out over marsh wanted desperately to regain rosebud frock knew that elizabeth be starving for further wearing of poppy perhaps wide serene plain below inspired with hatred of littleness there must be loss of dignity in making proposal that enemy felt sure must accept merely showed christian spirit set example to elizabeth to make first move janet did not consider if be in fit state to listen to reason elizabeth began miss mapp heaved sigh of relief diva have thought of something swallowed insult at gulp yes dear said got idea take away janet frock wear then can wear yours too pretty for parlour maid eh heavenly brightness spread over miss mapp face oh how wonderful of to have thought of diva said how will explain to everybody diva clung to right though clearly

janet reconciliation of course be strictly confined to matter relating to chintz did not include such extraneous subject a coal strike food hoarding even in first glowing moment of restored friendliness diva began wondering whether must have opportunity afternoon of testing truth of conjecture about cupboard in garden room cudgel brain a might must think of other cache must contain immense amount of provision elizabeth have probably accumulated be on fire to get to practical grip with problem a far a tin of corned beef tongue went elizabeth might possibly have buried in garden

intended for eye challenge have left on chimney piece conceived to be duty to take down to mr gashly cook while be putting bloodiest construction on inscription conference be interrupted by return of captain puffin in highest spirit who after vain search for challenge be quite content a purport be no longer fraught with danger death to suppose that have torn up mr gashly therefore after preparing breakfast at unusually early hour went across to back door of major house with challenge in hand to borrow nutmeg grater gleaned information that mr dominic employer for master must not be called have gone off in great hurry to station early that morning with gladstone bag portmanteau latter of have be seen more though major have returned so mr gashly produced challenge having watched miss mapp off to high street at half past ten dominic gashly went together to house to see if withers must supply anything of importance if not nutmeg grater be forced to be content with grater pored over challenge with withers having errand to diva house told janet who without further ceremony bounded upstairs to tell mistress hardly have diva heard than plunged into high street with suitable addition told miss mapp evie irene padre under promise in case of strictest secrecy ten minute later irene have asked defenceless mr hopkins who be being adam again what knew about evie with mouse like gait looked so rapid be so deliberate have mortification of seeing miss mapp outdistance be admitted into poppits house just a came in view of front door rightly conjectured that after affair of store cupboard in garden room there must be nothing of lesser importance than duel must take lady through abhorred portal finally at ten minute past eleven major flint captain puffin be seen by one two fortunate people morning having cleared up walking together to tram without exception everybody knew that be on way to fight duel in remote hollow of sand dune miss mapp have gone straight home from visit to poppits just about eleven stationed in window where must keep eye on house of duellist in anxiety to outstrip evie be first to tell poppits have not waited to hear that have come back knew only of challenge that have gone to station have already formed glorious idea of own a to what history of duel past future be intoxicated with emotion have retired from wordy fray to think about a already mentioned to keep eye on two house just below then there appeared in sight padre walking swiftly up hill have barely time under cover of curtain to regain table where sweet chrysanthemum be pining for water when withers announced wore furrowed brow quite forgot to speak scotch elizabethan english few rapid word made clear that have heard main outline terrible situation said padre duelling be direct contravention of christian principle believe of civil law discharge of pistol in unskilful hand may lead to deplorable result major flint so one have heard be experienced duellist that of course make even more dangerous be at identical moment that major flint came out of house qui hied cheerily to puffin miss mapp padre deep in bloody possibility saw heard passed together down road into high street unconscious that very look action be being more commented on than epistle to hebrew inside garden room miss mapp sighed bent eye on chrysanthemum quite terrible said in peaceful tranquil tilling perhaps duel have already taken place have missed said padre be seen to return to house early morning by whom asked miss mapp jealously have not heard that by hopkins said hopkins saw return must trust man too much said miss mapp hopkins may not be telling truth have great opinion of moral standard why be that be time to discus nudity of hopkins miss mapp put question aside that doe not matter now dear padre said only wish thought duel have taken place without accident major benjy mean major flint portmanteau have not come back to house of be sure what if have sent away to place where be unknown full of pistol thing possible terribly possible said padre wish must see duty clear must not hesitate to well to do best must to induce to abandon murderous project what do imagine be root of quarrel must say be sure said miss mapp bent head over chrysanthemum distracting sex said with moment gallantry be usually cause of quarrel have noticed that seemed to admire miss irene very much miss mapp raised head spoke with great animation dear quaint irene be sure have nothing to do with said with perfect truth nothing there be mistaking sincerity of padre tillingite to marrow instantly concluded that miss mapp knew what who be cause of unique disturbance a bent head again over chrysanthemum quite distinctly grew brick red in face felt that delicacy prevented inquiring further what be going to do dear padre asked in low voice choking with emotion decide will be wise christian oh violent men such baby too padre be bursting with curiosity since delicacy forbade to ask of question effervesced like sherbet round tongue propounded plan think duty be to go straight to major said who seems to be principal in affair tell know guess rest added nothing have said declared miss mapp in great confusion must have anything to do with guess promise that padre intimate fruitful conversation be interrupted by sound of two pair of step just outside before withers have have time to say mr plaistow diva burst in have taken tram said sank into nearest chair together asked miss mapp feeling sudden chill of disappointment at thought of duel with pistol trailing off into one with golf club yes be blind panted diva be talking laughing together sheer blind duel among sand dune padre be duty to stop said miss mapp faintly if pistol be in portmanteau began what portmanteau screamed diva who have heard about darling will tell presently said miss mapp be only guess of mine padre there be time to lose there be tram to catch said padre have gone by time taxi then padre oh lose time be coming with said in low voice presence better not said might better not repeated skipped down step be observed running down street what about portmanteau asked greedy diva be with strong misgiving that padre started on christian errand have not sense of adventure spiced must probably have returned to sermon instead be christian too to begin with there be ruinous expense of taking taxi

discover full of bleeding if not mangled body there might be only one mangled body other unmangled must pursue through sand dune offer life at price of silence that painfully reflected must be very difficult decision to make luckily captain puffin if proved to be survivor be lame with drawn face agonized prayer on lip began systematic search of sand dune often nerve nearly failed must sink

street over marsh have witnessed not so long ago final encounter in war of rose subsequent armistice be of course found to be peculiarly attractive that morning to who knew who did not that combatant have left by steam tram to fight among sand dune that intrepid padre have rushed after in taxi padre taxi have returned empty driver seemed to know nothing about anything so only thing for everybody to do be to put off lunch wait for arrival of next tram occurred at in consequence door in tilling flew open like of cuckoo clock at ten minute before hour pleasant promenade be full of who so keenly admired autumn tint from here progress of tram across plain be in full view so too be shed like station across river be terminus of line expectation when two waggoned little train approached end of journey be so tense that be almost disagreeable couple of hour have elapsed since like fisher who sailed away into west be seen no more till corps lay out on shining sand three have left for sand dune couple of hour so reasoned cosmic consciousness of tilling gave ample time for duel to be fought if padre be not in time to stop for to stop if be surgical assistance a far a be known have be summoned reason for might easily be that surgeon skill be no longer ala of avail for one if not of combatant if such be case be nice to hope that padre have be in time to supply spiritual aid to anyone whom first aid probe be powerless to succour variety of denouement approaching tram have now cut off steam be capable of providing be positively bewildering whirled through miss mapp head like autumn leaf admired so much tried in vain to catch when caught to tick off on finger moreover furnished diverse legitimate conclusion for instance taking thumb if nobody of slightest importance arrived by tram might be because nothing have happened be playing golf b worst have happened a padre have feared duellist have first shot then other c next worst have happened padre be arranging for reverent removal of corpse of major benjy ii captain puffin of iii miss mapp let go of thumb lightly touched forefinger ii padre might arrive alone in case anything nothing might have happened to of others various contingency hanging on arrival be so numerous that there be not time to sort out iii padre might arrive with two limping figure whom assisted here must not be forgotten captain puffin always limped major occasionally miss mapp did not forget iv padre might arrive with stretcher query whose v padre might arrive with two stretcher vi three stretcher might arrive from shining sand at town where woman be weeping wringing hand in case miss mapp saw busily employed in strengthening poor evie who now be running about like mouse from group to group picking up crumb of cosmic consciousness miss mapp have got a far a sixthly though be aware have not exhausted possibility when tram stopped furtively took out from pocket have focussed before put in opera glass through have watched station yard on day have be very much le exciting than after one glance put back again feeling vexed disappointed with for denouement have so unerringly disclosed be one have not entered mind at in moment have seen that out of tram there stepped three figure stretcher one figure be true limped in manner so natural that scorned to draw deduction from that halting gait proceeded side by side across bridge over river towards town be use denying that cosmic consciousness of lady of tilling be aware of disagreeable anti climax to so many hope fear have of course hoped for best have not expected that best must be quite a bad a best to put frankly must have be bandaged arm something of kind there be still room for more hardened optimist to hope that something of sort have occurred that something of sort have be averted that whole affair be not in delicious new slang phrase of padre be spreading like wildfire through tilling wash out pistol might have be innocuously discharged for be known to contrary looked bad miss mapp be first to recover from blow took diva podgy hand diva darling said feel so deeply thankful what wonderful beautiful end to anxiety there be subconscious regret with regard to anxiety anxiety be so to speak dear beloved departed diva did not feel so sure that end be so beautiful wonderful grandfather miss mapp have reason to know have be butcher probably inherited indifference to slaughter lurked in tainted blood there be portmanteau still said hopefully pistol in portmanteau idea elizabeth yes dear said elizabeth thank god must have be very wrong about portmanteau outside porter told that brought up from station to major benjy house hour ago fancy not knowing that feel sure be truthful man for attends padre confirmation class if there have be pistol in major benjy captain puffin must have gone away too be quite happy about now went away have come back be about portmanteau paused moment what doe contain then said quickly more a if be thinking aloud than talking to diva why did major benjy pack send to station morning where have come back from why did go there felt that be saying too much pressed hand to head have happened morning said what full morning dear lovely autumn leaf will go home have lunch rest au reservoir diva miss mapp eternal reservoir have begun to get on diva nerve a lingered here moment more great idea occurred to temporarily banished disappointment about duellist elizabeth a world knew have accumulated great reservoir of provision in false book case in garden room diva determined that if must think of neat phrase very next time elizabeth said au reservoir to must work in allusion to elizabeth own reservoir of corned beef tongue flour bovril dried apricot condensed milk must have to frame stinging rejoinder must escape when next elizabeth used that stale old phrase must have to be short swift spontaneous therefore required careful thought must be good to bring pop into also reservoir in garden room have gone 'pop again hope darling be first draft occurred to be not sufficiently condensed pop go reservoir on analogy of weasel be better better than be there not sort of corn called pop corn american ate have pop corn in reservoir must be nasty one required thinking over sight of padre duellist crossing field below a still lingered on escarpment of hill brought duel back to mind must have be considered inquisitive even at tilling to put direct question to combatant still hoping for best ask point blank who won something of sort until arrived at sort of information excruciating pang of curiosity must be endured must be likened only to acute toothache of mind with dentist to stop remove source of trouble elizabeth have already succumbed to pang of surmise excitement have frankly gone home to rest absence fact that for next hour two must not except by extraordinary feat on telephone get hold of anything must throw light on whole prodigious situation inflamed diva brain to highest pitch of inventiveness knew that be be inferior in point of reconstructive imagination present moment while other be recuperating energy for fresh assault on unknown be diva opportunity one person who might be presumed to know more than anybody else be padre while be with duellist be a impossible to ask have happened a to ask duellist who have won must while miss mapp rested get hold of padre without duellist even a athene sprang full grown panoplied from brain of zeus so from diva brain there sprang plan complete even resisted temptation to go on admiring autumn tint in order to see how interesting trio looked when a must presently do passed close to where stood hurried home pausing only to purchase pay for carry away with from provision shop large expensively dressed crab dainty of padre be inordinately fond ruinous a be there be note of triumph in voice when on arrival called loudly for janet told to lay place at luncheon table then putting strong constraint on waited three minute by watch in order to give padre time to get home then rang up reminded that have promised to lunch with day be use asking to lunch in such way that might refuse employed without remorse pitiless force majeure engagement be short brisk pleaded that not even now must remember even having be asked be not surprising said that wee wifie have begun lunch on diva unmasked last gun told that have ordered crab on purpose that silenced further argument said that wee wifie must be round in jiffy rang off did not particularly want wee wifie there be enough crab diva felt that have never laid out four shilling to better purpose when quarter of hour later padre gave full account of fruitless search among sand dune so deeply impressive be sense of being buoyed up to incredibly fatiguing perilous excursion by power outside never even occurred to to think that be elaborate practical joke on part of power outside to spur on to such immense exertion to purpose at have only got a far a over interrupted lunch with wee wifie though too be in agonized suspense a to what happened next bore repetition with great equanimity only making small mouse like noise of impatience nobody heard be quite forgetting to speak scotch elizabethan english so obvious be absorption of hearer without added aid to command attention then came round corner of club house said there be captain puffin major finishing match on eighteenth hole then there be be duel at said diva scraping shell of crab feel sure of there must have be time for duel round of golf in addition to impossibility of playing golf immediately after duel nerve must stand besides asked one of caddy have come straight from tram to club house from club house to first tee have not be alone for moment wash out said diva wondering whether have be worth four shilling so tame be conclusion mr bartlett gave little squeak be preliminary to speech see why there may not be duel yet kenneth said because did not fight morning excellent crab dear diva so good of to ask there be reason why there must be duel afternoon o dear cold beef a well will be quite stuffed depend upon man doe take trouble to write challenge unless mean business padre held up hand felt that be gradually growing to be hero of whole affair have certainly looked over edge of numberless hollow in sand dune with vivid anticipation of having bullet whizz by on separate occasion behoved to take sublime line dear said business be hardly word to apply to murder that within last twenty four hour there be intention of fighting duel deny something have decidedly happened have averted that deplorable calamity peace reconciliation be result of have never seen two men so unaffectedly friendly diva got up whirled round table to get port for padre so pleased be at fresh idea coming to while still dear elizabeth be resting attributed to crab have be on false scent said peace reconciliation happened before went out to sand dune at happened at station met at station know be proved that major flint went there major must send portmanteau off alone be proved that captain puffin went there too because note housemaid found on table before saw challenge from major be on chimney piece said that have be called away very suddenly went to catch early train in order to go away before must be stopped kill other why did go what happened suppose outside porter showed how wicked be confirmation class confirmation class stump almost wish elizabeth be here be good at guessing padre eye brightened reaction after peril of morning crab port combined to make man of eh 't be bonny wee drappie of port mistress plaistow said dinna ken ye be far wrang in jaloosing that mistress mapp might have wee bitty word to say aboot ' have mind be wrong about portmanteau said diva confessed be wrong hoot be not mindin ' bit pochmantie said padre what else doe know asked diva feverishly there be doubt that padre have fullest attention of two lady again there be need to talk scotch more begin at beginning said what do suppose be cause of quarrel anything said diva golf tiger skin coal strike summer time shook head grant word may pas on such subject said feel keenly know about summer time in tilling though will be reconciled over next sunday when real time god time a be venturing to call in sermon come in again diva have to bite tongue to prevent bolting off on new scent after have invested in crab to learn about duelling not about summer time well said may have have word on subject said padre booming a if be in pulpit already must hope none of go so far a to catch earliest train with pistol in defence of conviction about summer time mr plaistow if be right there be something to be said for view in thinking that went to such length a to be in time for early train in order to fight duel undisturbed must look for more solid cause than diva vainly racked brain to think of anything more worthy of highest pitch of emotion than if have be miss mapp who have be embroiled hoarding dress must have occurred to a be one in sens must dream that captain major be sartorial rival unless have quarrelled over question a to of wore snuffiest old clothes give up said what did quarrel about passion said padre in full deep tone in next sunday must allude to god time mean anger flame exalts man to heaven doe exactly opposite whomever for asked diva quite thrown off bearing such thing have never occurred to for a far a be aware passion except in sense of temper did not exist in tilling tilling be far too respectable padre considered moment be betraying confidence said because one have confided in there certainly be lady in town allude to miss irene who have long enjoyed major particular esteem may not deprecating remark wee wifie gave much louder squeal than usual mean poor elizabeth said in high tremulous voice fancy kenneth diva few second before have seen reason why padre must drink rest of port be now in act of drinking of unusual beverage tried to swallow be too late next moment opening in face be fountain of delicious wine choked gurgled until last drop have left windpipe under persuasion of pattings on back from others then gave up to loud hoarse laughter through there shrilled staccato squeak of wee wifie nothing even if be being laughed at be so infectious a prolonged laughter padre felt forced to join when one of got little better relapse ensued by reason of infection from others be not till exhaustion set in triple volcano became quiescent again only fancy said evie faintly how did idea get into head kenneth voice shook a answered well be little worked up morning said idea really know what have be laughing at do said diva go on about idea feminine diabolical inspiration flared within wee wifie mind elizabeth suggested squealed naturally diva must not help remembering that have found miss mapp padre in earnest conversation together when forced way in morning with news that duellist have left by tram nobody must be expected to have so short memory a to have forgotten just now forgave elizabeth for anything have ever done might have to be reconsidered afterwards at present be valid enough did suggest asked padre behaved like man lied like ananias most emphatically did not said disappointment must have be severe have two lady believed confident assertion diva pictured delightful interview with elizabeth in must suddenly tell wild surmise padre have made with regard to cause of duel see how looked then just see how looked then be self consciousness guilt must fly colour miss mapp have be tempted when went home that morning after enjoying autumn tint to ask diva to lunch with remembered in time that have told cook to broach one of tin of corned beef human wizard must coax into store cupboard again if shut door after diva must have be sure to say something acid allusive to remark on excellence being happily not wasted on poor people in hospital if have not said anything at about silence a ate great deal must have have sharp flavour miss mapp must have liked especially when went to take rest afterwards on big sofa in garden room to have have somebody to talk to for brain seethed with conjecture a to what have happened be happening must happen discussion be best method of simplifying problem of narrowing down to limit of probability whereas when be alone now with own imaginings most fantastic of seemed plausible have however handed glorious suggestion to padre one be concerned cause of duel have be highly satisfactory to observe sympathy respect with have imbibed have too be so discreet about have not come within measurable distance of asserting that challenge have be in way connected with have only be very emphatic on point of not being connected with poor dear irene then occupied with sweet flower have be sufficient felt in bone marrow that inferred what have meant to infer vulture of surmise ceased to peck at for few moment a considered followed up thread of gold though padre must surely be discreet hoped that must let slip to dear evie in course of vivid conversation must be sure to have over lunch that have good guess a to cause have led to savage challenge upon dear evie must be certain to ply with direct squeak question when got hot a in animal vegetable mineral reticence must lead to make good guess too might be incredulous there idea must be in mind while if felt that stirring day be time for scepticism must hardly fail to be interested touched before long how soon miss mapp be happily not aware must pop in to see diva diva must pop in to see evie observing discretion similar to of padre must soon enable dear diva to make good guess too after that must be well for dear diva such gossiping darling must undoubtedly tell everybody in tilling under vow of secrecy so that must have pleasure of telling everybody just what good guess be thus very presently tilling must know exactly that miss mapp have not said to dear padre namely that duel have be fought have be fought be about best of be that though everybody knew must still be great beautiful secret reposing inviolably in breast chest a case might be have anxiety about anybody asking direct question of duellist for if duelling for year past have be subject delicately minded person alluded to purposely in major benjy presence how much more now after critical morning must that subject be taboo that certainly be good thing for duellist if closely questioned might have different explanation must be highly inconvenient to have two contradictory story going about a be nothing must be nicer whole of rest of tilling under promise of secrecy must know even if under further promise of secrecy communicated secret to other there must be harm done after excursion into elysian field poor miss mapp have to get back to vulture again hour rest that have felt be due to a heroine of duel became period of extraordinary cerebral activity puzzle a might must make nothing of portmanteau excursion to early train got up long before hour be over since found that more thought more invincible be objection to conclusion that drowningly grasped at attack made on mystery garrison failed to march out surrender kept flag flying conjecture be woefully blasted by force of most elementary reason a agony of suspense if fresh topic of interest intervened must be frankly unendurable determined to concentrate more on rather to commit to ice house safe of subconscious mind from at will when felt refreshed reinvigorated must unlock examine again whole problem be more superlatively baffling than that must remember having encountered in inquisitive year just a subject of be more majestic than for concerned not hoarding visit of prince of wale poppy trimmed gown life death firing of deadly pistol must love be added to august list certainly not by though tilling might do what liked in fact tilling always did walked across to bow window from have conducted so many exciting successful investigation to day view seemed a stale unprofitable a world appeared to hamlet even though mr poppit at moment went waddling down street disappeared round corner where dentist mr wyse lived with sense of fatigue miss mapp recalled fact that have seen housemaid cleaning mr wyse window yesterday child dear be yesterday have noted industry drawn from irresistible conclusion that mr wyse be probably expected home usually came back about mid october let slip allusion to enjoyable visit in scotland villeggiatura so be pleased to express with sister contessa di faraglione at capri that contessa faraglione be rather mythical personage to miss mapp mind be certainly not in mediaeval copy of who be who be only accessible handbook in matter relating to noble notable personage though miss mapp must not have taken oath that did not exist saw strong reason for supposing that did certainly have never be to tilling be strange a brother lived there there be nothing brother allusion to certify about mr poppit now have gone to see mr wyse have gone to dentist one other must be for apart from that particular street contained nobody who counted at bottom simply conducted out into uneventful country mr poppit be dressed up must never walk in country in such costume must do for mr wyse dentist for be sort of woman who must like to appear grand in dentist chair so that might be shy of hurting such fine lady then again mr poppit have wonderful teeth almost too good to be true before now have asked who lived at pretty little house just round corner a if to show that did know where dentist lived have found out by underhand mean that mr wyse have come back have gone to call on give first news of duel talk to about scotland very likely have of be to scotland at conspired to say that have be to scotland stayed at shooting lodge keeper lodge more likely in order to impress tilling with magnificence miss mapp sat down on central heating pipe in window fell into one of reconstructive musing partly if mr wyse be back be well just to run over record partly wanted to divert mind from two house just below of major benjy on one side that of captain puffin on other contained key to great insoluble mystery from conjecture a to wanted to obtain relief mr wyse anyhow must serve a mild opiate for have never lost angry interest in though be for eight month of year thereabouts in tilling be never for single hour of tilling did not exactly invest with air of condescension superiority miss mapp did that justice made other people invest with so that came to same thing be invested did not drag fact of sister being contessa faraglione into conversation if talk turned on sister be asked about confessed to nobility same phenomenon appeared when innocent county of hampshire be mentioned for turned out that knew county well being one of wy of whitchurch must say talked about made other people talk about be quite impervious to satire on such point for when goaded to madness miss mapp have once said that be one of mapps of maidstone have merely bowed said very old family believe when conversation branched off on to old family have rather pointedly said to miss mapp so poor miss mapp be sorry have be satirical for reason tilling never ceased to play up to mr wyse there be not tea party bridge party given during whole period of residence there to be not invited hostess always started with sending round note with to await answer written in top left hand corner since have clearly stated that considered telephone undignified instrument only fit to be used for household purpose have installed in kitchen in manner of wy of whitchurch that alone apart from mr wyse old fashioned notion on subject made telephoning impossible for summons be usually answered by cook who instantly began scolding butcher irrespective disrespectful of whom be when mistake be made known to never apologized grudgingly said must call mr figgis who be mr wyse valet mr figgis always took long time in coming when came sneezed did something disagreeable said yes yes what be in very testy manner after explanation must consent to tell master took long time even then mr wyse did not come usually refused proffered invitation miss mapp have tried expedient of sending withers to telephone when wanted to get at mr wyse have not succeeded for withers mr wyse cook quarrelled so violently before got to business mr figgis have to calm cook withers to complain to miss mapp in brief be general reason why tilling sent note to mr wyse a for chatting through telephone be main use of telephone thing be quite out of question miss mapp revived little a made piercing analysis of mr wyse warmth of central heating pipe on baffling day of autumn tint be comforting one must say that mr wyse be not punctilious in matter of social etiquette for though refused three quarter of invitation be showered on invariably returned compliment by autograph note hoping that might have pleasure of entertaining at lunch on thursday next for always gave small luncheon party on thursday invitation be couched in chesterfield term mr wyse said that have met mutual friend just now who have informed that be in residence have encouraged to hope that might give pleasure of company etc be alluring diction presented image of mr wyse stepping briskly home again quite heartened up by chance encounter longer prey to melancholy at thought that might not give joy be encouraged to hope polite expression be traced in neat upright hand on paper when have just come back from italy often bore coronet on top with villa faraglione capri printed on right hand top corner amelia name of putative sister in sprawling gilt on left whole being lightly erased of course be quite right to filch few sheet threw rather lurid light on character that must be such grand one last year only in fit of passion at mr wyse having refused six invitation running on plea of other engagement miss mapp have headed movement object of be that tilling must not accept of mr wyse invitation unless accepted have met with theoretical sympathy bartlett diva irene poppits have agreed rather absently that must be very proper thing to do very next thursday have including originator met on mr wyse doorstep for luncheon party movement then there collapsed though protested rebelled against notion horrid fact remained that everybody basked in mr wyse effulgence whenever be disposed to shed on much a distrusted information dragged out of adored hearing about villa faraglione dressed in very best clothes to do so then again there be quality of lunch often there be caviare be impossible though interrogator who asked whether came from twemlow feared worst not to be mildly excited to know when mr wyse referred question to figgis that caviare have arrived from odessa that morning haunch of roe deer came from perthshire wine on subject of major must not be silent often made extremely talkative be from brother in law vineyard mr wyse must taste with air of connoisseur say not quite a good a last year must tell cont mean sister again when mr wyse did condescend to honour tea party bridge party tilling writhed under consciousness that general deportment be quite different from ordinarily practised among there be never squabbling at mr wyse table such squabbling

lapse listened entranced text be made summer winter after repeating word very impressively so that there might be mistake about origin of season padre began to talk about something quite different namely unhappy division exist in christian community did not deceive miss mapp for moment saw precisely what be getting at over oratorical fence got at ever since summer time have be inaugurated few year before have be one of chronic dissension of tilling miss mapp diva padre flatly refused to recognize except when be going by train tram when principle must necessarily go to wall must never have succeeded in getting anywhere while miss mapp with halo of martyrdom round head have once arrived at summer time party hour late in order to bear witness to truth in consequence have got only dreg of

anyone have missed coda close in full noon of winter sun be full of joy at healing of such unhappy division now rain rattling against window drowned doxology doctrine be so much to mind that miss mapp gave shilling to offertory instead of usual sixpence to be devoted to organist choir fund padre be true have changed hour of service to suit heresy of majority for moment made hand falter hope after convincing sermon that next year morning service must be at hour falsely called twelve decided not to withdraw handsome contribution frost dead dahlia sermon then be together overwhelmingly convincing

concerned must not still have be talking about fatal explosion from cupboard in garden room because duel have completely silenced last echo of instantly put finger on spot somebody have be gossiping how hated gossip somebody have given voice to what have be so studiously careful not to say until moment when have seen rapid breaking up of group of friend radiant with merriment have longed to be aware that somebody have given voice to that everybody under seal of secrecy knew unique queenliness of position overwhelmingly interesting role that violent passion of men have cast for have not believed in truth of when irresistible seizure of coquetry took possession of a bent over sweet chrysanthemum padre respectful reception of have caused to hope that everybody else might believe in character of smile however that wreathed face of friend did not quite seem to give fruition to hope there be smile smile respectful smile sympathetic smile envious admiring smile there be also smile of hilarious mocking incredulity concluded that have to deal with latter variety something thought miss mapp a stood quite alone in high street with mr poppit labouring up hill diva already rose madder speck in distance have got to be done only remained to settle what fury with dear padre for having hinted precisely what meant intended designed that must hint be perhaps paramount emotion in mind fury with everybody else for not respectfully believing what did not believe made important pendant what be to do said miss mapp aloud have to explain to mr hopkins who have clothes on have not spoken to then caught sight again of mr poppit sable coat hardly further off than have be when first thunderclap of intuition deafened still reeling from shock remembered that be almost certainly mr poppit who be cause of mr wyse writing exquisitely delicate note with regard to thursday be herculean task doubt to plug up fountain of talk in tilling be spouting so merrily at expense beginning must be made before must arrive at end short scurry of nimble step brought up to sable dear mr poppit said if be walking by little house must give two minute talk so stupid of to forget just now will come

effect that two minute later be in garden room have deposited sable coat on sofa quite shook room with weight of said miss mapp to herself while arranged plan stood looking out of window for moment writhing with humiliation at having to be suppliant to member of british empire tried to remember mr poppit christian name be even prepared to use crowning ignominy be saved a must not recollect such annoying thing have happened said though word seemed to blister lip dear mr poppit a woman of world can advise what to do fact be that somehow other ca think how people be saying that duel last week be so happily averted have something to do with poor little so absurd know what gossip have in dear little tilling mr poppit turned on fallen disappointed face have said why when be laughing about just now be right then thought miss mapp what tactless woman said believed told mr wyse miss mapp cursed for frankness must obliterate again not lose rare goodness knew how rare believer be in such difficult position said think ought to let be understood that there be truth whatever in such idea however much truth there may be did dear mr wyse believe in fact know must have for wrote oh such delicate understanding note at rate take notice of be being said hinted miss mapp be momentarily conscious that meant precisely opposite of dear mr wyse did take notice most respectful notice of be being said hinted thank goodness glance at mr poppit fat interested face showed that verbal discrepancy have gone unnoticed that luscious flavour of romance drowned perception of anything else drew handkerchief out buried thoughtful eye in moment rubbing with stealthy motion mr poppit did not perceive though diva must have lip be sealed continued opening very wide can say nothing except want rumour to be contradicted daresay who started thought be true true false must say nothing have always led very quiet life in little house with sweet flower for companion if there be one thing more than dislike be that private affair must be made matter of public interest do harm to anybody wish everybody well nothing nothing will induce to open lip upon subject will not cried miss mapp say word to defend justify what be true will prevail come in bible mr poppit be too much interested in what said to mind where came from what can do asked contradict dear rumour have have anything to do with terrible thing might have happened last week say on authority that be so tremble to think here trembled very much what might happen if report reached major benjy ear found out who have started must have more duel in tilling thought must never survive that morning will go tell mr wyse instantly dear said mr poppit must never do true believer be so scarce that be wicked to think of unsettling faith poor mr wyse said miss mapp with magnanimous smile think dear of troubling with little trumpery affair will not take part in little tittle tattle if must let dear diva quaint irene sweet evie good padre know that laugh at such nonsense laugh at too said mr poppit must have be baffling for anyone who allowed to be baffled be not miss mapp way oh bitter laughter said hurt to hear be envious laughter dear scoffing bitter laughter heard can not bear that dear thing must feel like tell that say how silly be to believe anything of sort trust be right about wash hand of such nonsense made vivid dumb show of after drying on imaginary towel let sunny smile peep out eye have rubbed gone said will have dear little party on wednesday to show be friend again meet for lunch at dear mr wyse next day will get tired of poor little if see two day running so will not ask will just try to get two table together nobody will contradict dear diva however many shilling say have won must sooner pay than have more of unhappy division will have talked to before wednesday will not dear a there be only four to talk to mr poppit thought that must manage spent most interesting afternoon for two year now have tried to unfreeze miss mapp who when be said done be centre of tilling circle who if attempt be made to shove out towards circumference always gravitated back again now on important errand be miss mapp accredited ambassador terrible business of opening of store cupboard decoration a mbe be quite forgiven forgotten there must be so much walking to be done from house to house that be impossible to wear sable coat unless have royce to take about effect of communication must have surprised anybody who did not know tilling le subtle society when assured from first hand authoritative source that report have entirely refused to believe be false must have prided on perspicacity said that have laughed at such idea a soon a ever heard a being palpably look at miss mapp untrue not so tilling very fact that by mouth of ambassador so uncompromisingly denied be precisely why tilling began to wonder if there be not something in from wondering if there be not something in surged to conclusion that there certainly be diva for instance moment be told that elizabeth for mr poppit remembered christian name perfectly utterly scornfully denied truth of report became intensely thoughtful say there be nothing in observed ca understand at moment diva telephone bell rang hurried out in party at elizabeth on wednesday said saw laughing why ask mr poppit be full of sacred mission to show how little mind laughing suggested a if be true then seems like want to think be not true be very earnest about said ambassador diva got up tripped over outlying skirt of mr poppit fur coat a went to ring bell sorry said take off have chat tea coming muffin oh thanks said mr poppit have so many call to make what similar call asked diva wait ten minute tea janet quickly whirled round room once twice corrugated with perplexity beginning telegraphic sentence not finishing say be not true laugh at notion of mr wyse belief padre believed after major little cock sparrow captain puffin t'other way round do think other explanation know might have be blood buried teeth in muffin believe there be something in summed up observed guest have tea muffin help said want to worry out elizabeth absolutely denies said mr poppit eye be full of oh anything said diva rubbed pepper if be at lunch be evidence solemn assertion began mr poppit thinking that be being complete failure a ambassador be carrying conviction at saccharine observed diva handing small phial have got more than enough sugar for expect be got plenty well never mind that see if be true must try to convince that be seemed absurd on face of if try to convince that be true well something in there be gist of matter mr poppit proceeding next to padre house found more muffin incredulity nobody seemed to believe elizabeth assertion that there be nothing in evie ran round room with excited squeak padre nodded head in confirmation of opinion when first delivered have be received with mocking incredulity over crab quaint irene intent on mr hopkins left knee in absence of model said good old mapp better late than never utter incredulity in fact be ambassador welcome incredulous be going to elizabeth party on wednesday mr poppit have sent royce home for last of call staggered up hill past elizabeth house oddly enough just a passed garden room window be thrown up cup of tea dear susan said elizabeth have found old note of mr poppit among waste paper for firing of kitchen oven fully signed just two minute talk elizabeth promptly responded news that nobody in tilling believed left miss mapp more than calm on bright side of calm be to say have few indulgent phrase tripped readily off tongue for dear thing who hated to be deprived of gossip susan certainly did not receive impression that playful magnanimity be attained with effort elizabeth did not seem really to mind be very gay then skilfully changing subject mourned over dead dahlia though tilling with perspicacity must not have known intuitive reader will certainly have perceived that miss mapp party for wednesday night have so to speak further iron in fire have originally be bribe to susan poppit in order to induce to spread broadcast that ridiculous rumour whoever have launched have be promptly denied by person whom most immediately concerned served second purpose in showing that miss mapp be too high above mire of scandal however interesting to know care who might happen to be wallowing in for reason asked everybody who have done so such loftiness of soul have earned amazing bonus for have induced who sat in seat of scoffer before to come hastily off join thin unwavering rank of true believer who up till then have consisted only of susan mr wyse frankly so blest conclusion have never occurred to miss mapp be one of unexpected reward fall like ripe plum into lap of upright by denying rumour have got everybody to believe when on wednesday morning went out to get chocolate cake be so useful in allaying appetite of guest encountered broken conversation gleeful smile sidelong glance of respectful envy what tilling did not must not know be that first of autumn after dinner bridge party be destined to look on famous teagown of kingfisher blue a designed for mr trout doubt other lady must have hurried up new gown at least have camouflaged old one in honour of annual inauguration of evening bridge miss mapp have misgiving about being outshone once again here felt that luck waited on merit for though when dressed that evening found have not anticipated that artificial light must cast somewhat pale though not ghastly reflection from vibrant blue on to feature similar in effect to not so marked a light shine on face of who lean over burning brandy raisin of snapdragon interesting pallor seemed very aptly to bear witness to that have gone through did not look ill be satisfied a to that looked gorgeous little wan bridge table be not set out in garden room entailed scurry over damp gravel on black windy night in little square parlour above dining room where withers in interval of admitting guest be laying out plate of sandwich chocolate cake reinforced when interval for refreshment came with hot soup whisky syphon jug of cup prepared according to ancestral economical recipe miss mapp have taken great deal of trouble about single bottle of white wine with suitable addition of ginger nutmeg herb soda water be mother of gallon of drink seemed aflame with fiery probably spirituous ingredient guest be very careful how partook of so stimulating seemed miss mapp be reading book on gardening upside down have taken up rather hurriedly when poppits arrived sprang to foot with pretty cry at being so unexpectedly delightfully disturbed susan isabel said lovely of to have come be reading about flower making plan for next year saw four eye riveted to dress susan looked quite shabby in comparison isabel did not look anything at dear too lovely said mr poppit slowly miss mapp looked brightly about a if wondering what be too lovely at last guessed new frock said do like dear how sweet of be just little nothing talked over with nice miss greele in high street put head together invented something quite cheap simple here be evie dear padre so kind of to look in four more eye be riveted on enticed out just once padre went on miss mapp so sweet of to spare evening here be major benjy captain puffin well be nice be really tremendous of miss mapp here be meeting without embarrassment awkwardness two who if duel have not be averted must have risked very life over dispute concerning everybody else naturally be rather taken aback for moment at situation so deeply dyed in dramatic must either of gladiator have heard that be padre who undoubtedly have spread rumour concerning hostess mr poppit be afraid that even cloth might not protect such deplorable calamity occurred only four more eye be riveted to kingfisher blue upon word said major never saw anything more beautiful than gown miss elizabeth straight from paris eh paris in line of oh major benjy said elizabeth be making fun of simple little frock be getting quite shy just bit of old stuff have so nice of to like wonder where diva be will have to scold for being late ah sha be scolded diva darl endearing word froze on miss mapp lip turned deadly white in doorway in equal fury dismay stood diva dressed in precisely same staggeringly lovely costume a hostess have diva miss greele put head together too have diva got bit of old stuff miss mapp pulled together first moistened dry lip so sweet of to look in dear said will cut naturally malice of card decreed that miss mapp diva must sit next other a adversary at same table combined effect of two lot of kingfisher blue be blinding complete silence on subject connected however remotely with dress be of course only line for correct diplomacy to pursue then major benjy be not diplomatic only gallant never saw such stunning gown eh padre said dear be very much alike too be pair of exquisite sister must be hard to say of two found speech more provocative of rage for while diva be four year younger than miss mapp miss mapp be four inch taller than diva cut card to sister with hand trembled so much that have to do again diva must scarcely deal mr wyse frankly confessed next day when at one o'clock elizabeth found first arrival at house that have be very self indulgent have given treat dear miss mapp said have asked three entrancing lady to share humble meal with have provided be not shocking of nobody else to meet pardon dear lady for greediness now be admirably done elizabeth knew very well why two out of three men in tilling have not be asked very gratifying that reason be with true refinement of mr wyse be so amply possessed where be taking blame on putting so prettily bestowed widest smile on oh mr wyse said will quarrel over not until miss mapp have spoken did perceive how subtle word be seemed to bracket mr wyse together men two out of three at rate have be quarrelling over now there seemed very fair prospect of three of woman quarreling over mr wyse without being in least effeminate mr wyse morning looked rather like modern troubadour have velveteen coat on soft fluffy mushy tie looked a if made of shirley poppy very neat knickerbockers brown stocking with blob like fruit of plane tree dependent from elaborate top shoe with cascade of leather frilling covering lace might almost equally well be about to play golf over putting hole on lawn a guitar made gesture of polished polite dissent not contradicting yet hardly accepting tribute remitting perhaps just a king when enters city of london touch sword of lord mayor tell to keep so pleasant to be in tilling again said will have cosy busy winter hope know miss mapp be always busy day be never long enough for said elizabeth enthusiastically what with household duty in morning garden pleasant little gathering be always bed time too soon want to read great deal winter too diva at sight of whom elizabeth have to make strong effort of self control here came in together with mr poppit party be complete elizabeth must have be willing to bet that in spite of warmness of morning susan must have on sable coat though technically must have lost more than won morally for mr wyse repeated speech about greediness be hardly out of mouth when discovered that have left handkerchief in pocket of sable coat have put over back of conspicuous chair in hall figgis however came in at moment to say that lunch be ready delayed very much by long ineffectual search for during figgis with visible effort held up sable coat so that be displayed to utmost advantage then only fancy susan discovered that be in sable muff time three lady be on tenterhook of anxiety a to who be to be placed on mr wyse right who on left who must be given only place between two other woman tact be equal to anything miss mapp said will honour by taking head of table be hostess for only must have vase of flower removed figgis can look at flower when miss mapp be not here now what have got for breakfast lunch must say macaroni mr wyse have brought back with from naples naturally led on to italian subject general scepticism about contessa di faraglione have staggering blow dealt sister began mr wyse by swift sucking motion diva drew into mouth several serpent of dependent macaroni in order to be able to listen better without agitating distraction sister hope will come to england winter spend several week with sensation count asked diva having swallowed serpent fear not cecco francesco know be great stay at home amelia be looking forward very much to seeing tilling will insist on making long stay here before visit relation at whitchurch elizabeth found reserving judgment must believe in contessa faraglione one more firmly when saw have reasonable proof of identity delightful said abandoning with fruitless pursuit with fork of few last serpent writhed on plate what addition to society will do best to spoil mr wyse when do expect early in december must be very kind to dear lady be insatiable bridge player have heard much of great player will meet here that decided mr poppit must join correspondence class conducted by little slam in cosy corner little slam for sum of two guinea payable in advance engaged to make first class player of anyone with normal intelligence diva mind flew off to subject of dress thought of awful tragedy concerning tea gown of kingfisher blue combined with endive salad gave wry twist to mouth for moment a know continued mr wyse be hand at bridge oh mr wyse play beautifully interpolated elizabeth too flattering of miss mapp amelia cecco agree with be never allowed to play when be at villa faraglione unless table can not be made up without will look forward to seeing many well contested game quail fig have come from capri miss mapp greedily devouring in turn be so much incensed by information that have elicited about that though joined in general lobgesang be tempted to inquire whether ice have not be brought from south pole by antarctic expedition mind be not like poor diva taken up with obstinate questioning about kingfisher blue tea gown for have already determined what be going to do about naturally be impossible to contemplate fresh encounter like of last night gown crimson lake colour of mr trout toilet for second evening of duke of hampshire visit a vogue informed have completely annihilated newport with splendour have already consulted miss greele about who said that if kingfisher blue be bleached first dye of crimson lake must be brilliant pure thought of fact that miss greele lip be professionally sealed made able to take diva arm a strolled about garden afterwards way in diva susan have made up to mr wyse during lunch be really very shocking though did not surprise miss mapp supposed head have be turned by prospect of playing bridge with countess luckily expected nothing better of of so conduct be in way blow disappointment to companionship with diva be rather prolonged for adhesive susan staggering about in sable clung close to host simulated clumsy interest in chrysanthemum whatever other two did manoeuvred into strong position between mr wyse from operating on interior line must cut off assailant more depressing yet throwing sad new light on character mr wyse seemed to appreciate rather than resent appropriation of instead of making sortie through beleaguering sable must beg diva elizabeth who be so fond of fuchsia knew about so well to put head together over afflicted bed of flower in quite part of garden tell be best treatment for anaemic condition pleasant proper though be to of mr wyse must pay so little attention to other be bitter a endive salad to that must tolerate if not enjoy companionship forwardness of susan forced on while absently stared at fuchsia fire kindled elizabeth spake with tongue how very plain poor susan look to day said colour though to be sure attribute more to what ate drank than to anything else crimson oh poor fuchsia think must throw away common antagonism diva felt have drawn elizabeth into most cordial of understanding for moment felt nothing enthusiastic sympathy with elizabeth in spite of kingfisher blue gown what on earth in parenthesis be to do with hers must not give to janet be impossible to contemplate idea of janet walking about high street in tea gown of kingfisher blue just in order to thwart elizabeth mr wyse seems taken with said diva how can rather snob mbe be always popping in here saw yesterday going round corner of street what time dear asked elizabeth nosing scent middle of morning saw in afternoon said elizabeth that great lumbering roll royce went tacking skidding round corner below garden room be in asked diva appeared rather slur on elizabeth reliability in observation darling be sitting on top said taking edge off sarcasm in case diva have not intended to be critical by little laugh diva drew conclusion that elizabeth have actually seen inside think be serious said think will marry idea of course repellent odious a be have occurred to elizabeth so instantly denied oh busy little match maker said brightly such idea never entered head must make such fun of dear susan come dear ca look at fuchsia more must be getting home must say good bye au reservoir rather to mr wyse if susan will allow to get word in edgeways susan seemed delighted to let miss mapp get particular word in edgewise after little speech from mr wyse in said that must not dream of allowing to go yet immediately afterwards shook hand warmly with hoping that reservoir must be very small one two be forced to leave artful susan in possession of field looked rather black miss mapp vivid imagination altogether failed to picture what tilling must be like if susan succeeded in becoming mr wyse sister in law of countess sat down in garden room closed eye for moment in order to concentrate power of figuring situation what dreadful people climber be how swiftly swarmed up social ladder with roll royces red currant fool sable few week ago have never asked susan into house while very first time came unloosed sluice of store cupboard now owing to necessity of getting aid in stopping that mischievous rumour have be so careful to set on foot regarding cause of duel miss mapp have be positively obliged to flatter to susan if diva awful surmise proved to be well founded susan must be in position to patronize talk about count countess with same air of unconcern a mr wyse must be bidden to villa faraglione must play bridge with cecco amelia must visit wy of whitchurch what be to be done might head movement to put mr wyse in proper place if successful must have agreeable result of pulling down susan rung two must carry out design failure of last attempt mr wyse eminence did not argue well for further manoeuvre of kind must poison mr wyse mind with regard to susan be causelessly agitated curiosity rushed like devastating tornado across miss mapp mind rooting up other growth buffeting with necessity of knowing what two whom have be forced to leave in garden be doing now snatching up opera glass glided upstairs let out through trap door on to roof did not remember if be possible to see mr wyse garden part of from that watch tower there be chance not glimpse of be visible lay quite hidden behind red brick wall bounded not chrysanthemum fuchsia must see blood froze a without putting glass down ran eye over such part of house wall a rose above obstruction in drawing room window on first floor be seated two figure susan have taken sable off be a if intended remaining there for ever at least for tea chapter viii hippopotamus quarrel over whisky between major flint captain puffin culminated in challenge shining sequel have have excellent effect of making united service more united than ever knew that have not severally run away from encounter so providentially met at station very serious consequence might have ensued have not both only one of be averse from taking risking life other must surely have remained in tilling spread disastrous report about bravery of refugee while if of have have scruple on sacredness of human existence there might have be one if not two corps lying on shining sand naturally fact that have taken very earliest opportunity of averting encounter by flight made improbable that future quarrel must be proceeded with to violent extreme be much safer to run risk not let verbal disagreement rise to hippopotamus pitch again consequently when there be real danger of such savagery a be implied in sending challenge hastened by mutual concession to climb down from perilous place where loss of balance might possibly occur for of must be absolutely certain that next time other of might not be more courageous be coming up from tram station one november evening fizzing fuming good deal major be extremely lame lamer than puffin rattle of tram have made argument impossible during transit from link have in enforced silence thought of several smart repartee supposing that other made requisite remark to call out on arrival at tilling station went on at precisely same point at have broken off on starting from station by link well hope can take beating in a english spirit a anybody said major be lucky for captain puffin have thought likely that must say just have got stinger for worry to find that hope be doomed to disappointment swiftly said major flint stepped in puddle cooled foot not temper most offensive remark said be called sporting benjy in regiment for nothing never mind that worm cast be worm cast said puffin be sheep dung luck have veered here major have felt sure that puffin must reiterate that utterly untrue contention ca pretend to be such specialist a in matter said must allow sufficient power of observation to know worm cast when see be worm cast sir cast of worm have right to remove if will do favour to consult rule of golf oh grant that be more specialist in rule of golf major than in practice of said puffin brightly suddenly struck sporting benjy that red signal of danger danced before eye though odious puffin have scored twice to once called up power of self control for if friend be anything like a exasperated a breeze of disagreement might develop into hurricane at moment be passing through swing gate led to short cut back to town before must take hold of have slammed back in fury hitting puffin who be following on knee then remembered be sporting christian gentleman duellist be sure beg pardon dear fellow said with utmost solicitude uncommonly stupid of gate flew out of hand hope did hurt puffin have just come to same conclusion a major flint magnanimity be better than early train ever so much better than bullet indeed there be comparison not hurt bit thank major said wincing with shrewdness of blow silently cursing friend for what felt sure be accident limping with leg did touch have what brilliant sunset town look amazingly picturesque doe indeed said major fine subject for miss mapp puffin shuffled alongside there be still lot of talk going on in town said about duel of ours fairy of yours be agog to know what be about be sure think that there be lady in case just like vanity of sex if two men have quarrel think must be because of silly face ordinarily major gallantry must have resented view reconciliation with puffin be too recent to risk just at present poor little devil said make excitement for wonder who think be must puzzle to name woman in tilling worth catching early train for there be several who 'd be surprised to hear say that major said puffin archly well well said other strutting swelling walking without sign of lameness have come to where house stood opposite other on steep cobbled street fronted at top end by miss mapp garden room happened to be standing in window major made great flourish of cap laid hand on heart there be one of said puffin a miss mapp acknowledged florid salutation with wave of hand tripped away from window poking fun at said major perhaps be cause of quarrel hey well will step across will about half past nine bring diary with will expect will find at roman road humour of joke never staled parted with hoot guffaw of laughter must not be supposed that duelling puzzle over portmanteau machination of susan have put out of miss mapp head amiable interest in hour at major benjy went to bed for time have be content to believe on direct information from that went to bed early worked at diary on alternate evening maturer consideration have led to wonder whether be being quite a truthful a gallant soldier must be for though on alternate evening

even a looked chink of light came from front door immediately enlarged into full oblong then went completely out have opened door have put out hall light whispered miss mapp to herself have gone out shut door perhaps be going to post letter have gone into captain puffin house without knocking so be expected miss mapp did not at once guess that held in hand key to mystery be certainly major benjy

set of alternate night with major for have not escaped observation that when major seemed to be sitting up captain seemed to have gone to bed instantly with strong conviction suspected orgy remained to be seen must remain to see to what hour orgy be kept up about eleven o'clock little mist have begun to form in street obscuring complete clarity of view through there still shone light from behind captain puffin red blind mist be not so thick a to be able wholly to obscure figure of major flint when must pas below gas lamp again into house such figure passed did then work at diary evening what price to put vulgarly roman road moment sense of being deceived grew blacker moment curiosity a to what be doing became more unbearable after spasm of tactical thought glided back into house from garden room taking envelope in hand so that might if detected say that be going down to letter box at corner to catch early post unbolted door let out crossed street tip toed along pavement to where red light from captain puffin window shone like blurred danger signal through mist from inside came loud duet of familiar voice sometimes spoke singly sometimes together must not catch word sounded blurred indistinct told that be very glad that must not hear what said for must have seemed like eaves dropping voice sounded angry be there duel pending be about time quite suddenly from so close at hand that positively leaped off pavement into middle of road door be thrown open duet louder than ever streamed out into street major benjy bounced out on to threshold stumbled down two step led from door tell be worm cast bellowed think know worm cast when see worm cast suddenly tone changed be getting too near quarrel well good night old fellow said jolly evening turned saw veiled indistinct in

have be quite unfair to have described a drunk be no more than gay ready to go to bed now became portentously solemn a cold mist began to do deadly work letter said impressively without address be uncommonly dangerous thing hic ca tell into whose hand may fall must sooner go 'bout with loaded pistol than with letter without address send to bank for safety send for police follow advice send for p'lice police miss mapp penetrating mind instantly perceived that dreadful captain puffin be drunk promised that tilling must ring with tale of excess to morrow major benjy whom if mistook not captain puffin have be trying with perhaps small success to lead astray be gallant gentleman still conceived brilliant madly mistaken idea of throwing on protection major benjy said will ask to take home captain puffin have have too much to drink woz that asked captain puffin with air of great interest miss mapp abandoned dignity pleasantness lost temper said be drunk said with great distinctness major benjy will captain puffin came carefully down two step from door on to pavement look here said need beplanation say be drunk do well say be drunk going out like in mill ' of night to post letter

letter with 'dress on must find slit to put in a say nothing say nothing ca say fairer than liberal term mutual protection society lip sealed lip sealed strictly private trespasser will be prosecuted by order hic miss mapp felt that major benjy ought instantly to have challenged ignoble friend to duel for insolent suggestion did nothing of kind silence have awful quality of consent about chilled mind even a sea mist now thick cold made certain that nose be turning red still boiled with rage mind grew cold with odious apprehension be like ice pudding with scalding sauce there stood veiled in vapour outlined by red light streamed from still open door of intoxicated puffin getting colder moment yessorno said puffin with chattering teeth bitter a be to accept outrageous term there really seemed without major support to be way out of yes said miss mapp puffin gave loud crow ayes have major said so be frens again goonight everybody miss mapp let into house in agony of mortification must scarcely realize that little expedition undertaken with so much ardent earnest curiosity only quarter of hour ago have ended in so deplorable surfeit of sensation have gone out in obedience to innocent indeed laudable desire to ascertain how major benjy spent evening on have deceived into imagining that owing to influence have gone ever so early to bed only to find that sat up ever so late that be fettered by promise not to breathe to soul single word about depravity of captain puffin on pain of being accused out of mouth of two witness of being equally depraved more wounding yet be part played by major benjy in odious transaction be only possible to conclude that put higher value on fellowship with degraded friend than on chivalry what did silence imply probably be defensive one imagined that too must be included in story miss mapp proposed to sow broadcast upon fruitful field of tilling indeed when called to mind bellowing about worm cast general instability of speech equilibrium told that have ample cause for supposition when light be out be abetting assisting perhaps joining captain puffin when window be alight on alternate night made doubt now that captain puffin be performing similar role have be going on for week under very nose without having smallest suspicion of humiliated by have happened flattened in own estimation by sense of blindness penetrated to kitchen lit gas ring to make hot cocoa must at least comfort physical chattering there be letter for withers slipped sideways into envelope on kitchen table mechanically opened read by bluish flame of burner have always suspected withers of having young man here be proof of that must be mr hopkins of fish shop there be known to medical science pleasant device known a counter irritant if patient have aching rheumatic joint be counselled to put hot burning application on skin smart so agonizingly that ache be quite extinguished metaphorically mr hopkins be thermogene to miss mapp outraged aching consciousness smart occasioned by knowledge that withers must have encouraged mr hopkins else must scarcely have written letter so familiar amorous thus be contemplating matrimony relieved aching humiliation of have happened in sea mist shed new lurid light on withers made mistress feel that have nourished serpent in bosom to think that withers be contemplating so odious act of selfishness a matrimony must be necessary to find new parlour maid trouble connected with must not nearly be compensated for by being able to buy fish at lower rate be least that withers must do for to insist that mr hopkins must let have dab plaice exceptionally cheap ought to tell withers that have seen mr hopkins be impossible must write if decided for withers sake to make fell communication miss mapp turned tossed on uneasy bed mind went back to major captain fiasco in fog of course be perfectly at liberty having made promise under practical compulsion to tell everybody in tilling what have occurred trusting to chivalry of men not to carry out counter threat looking at matter quite dispassionately did not think must be wise to trust too much to chivalry still even if did carry out unmanly menace nobody must seriously believe that have be drunk might make very disagreeable joke of pretending to do so in word prospect frightened whatever tilling did did not believe residuum of ridicule must assuredly cling to reputation of having perhaps be cause of quarrel so happily did not end in duel must be lost for ever must squeak quaint irene must certainly burst into hoarse laughter when heard story be very inconvenient that honesty must be best policy brain still violently active switched off for moment on to eternal problem of portmanteau why so asked for hundredth time if portmanteau contained fatal apparatus of duelling did not combatant accompany if only other alternative did not idea so luminous flashed across brain that almost thought room have leaped into light challenge distinctly said that major benjy second must wait upon captain puffin in course of morning with what object then must former have gone down to station to catch early train there must be one object namely to get away a quickly a possible from dangerous vicinity of challenged captain why did captain puffin leave note on table to say that be suddenly called away except in order to escape from ferocious neighbourhood of challenger coward ejaculated miss mapp ran away from other how blind have be veil be rent perceived how carried away with notion that duel be to be fought among sand dune tilling have quite overlooked significance of early train felt sure that have solved everything now gave up to rapturous consideration of what use must make of precious solution regret for impossibility of ruining character of captain puffin with regard to intoxicant be gone for have even deadlier blacking to hand faintest hesitation at ruining reputation of major benjy a well crossed mind gloried in for have not only caused to deceive about early hour on alternate night by infamous willingness to back up captain puffin bargain have shown imperviously waterproof to chivalrous impulse for week now sorry pair of have enjoyed spurious splendour of being men of blood valour when time have put to sort of inconvenience in catching early train packing bag by candle light in order to escape hot impulse of quarrel that a saw now be probably derived from drained whisky bottle mysterious holloaing about worm cast be just such disagreement crowning rapture of own position a cause of projected duel be quite unassailed owing to silence about drink one must suspect mere drunken brawl must still figure a heroine though hero be terribly dismantled to be sure must have be better if ardour about have be such that one of at least have be prepared to face ordeal that have not both preferred flight even without that have much to be thankful for will serve said miss mapp interrupted by sneeze for have be sitting up in bed for quite considerable time right to one of miss mapp experience first step of new delightful strategic campaign be obvious spent hardly time at in window of garden room after breakfast next morning set out with shopping basket at unusually early hour shuddered a passed between front door of miscreant neighbour for chill of last night mist dreadful memory still lingered there present errand warmed soul even a tepid november day comforted body sign of life be at present evident in bibulous abode qui have indicated breakfast put utmost irony into reflection that united service slept late after protracted industry last night over diary roman road by natural revulsion violent in proportion to depth of previous regard for major benjy hugged more closely on prospect of exposing than on of exposing other have have daydream about major benjy conversion of into nightmare annealed softness into semblance of red hot stone giving vengeance concentrated sweetness a of saccharine contrasted with ordinary lump sugar sweetness be of so powerful quality that momentarily forgot about content of withers letter on kitchen table tripped across to mr hopkins with oblivious smile for good morning mr hopkins said wonder if have got nice little dab for dinner to day yes will send up then please what mild morning like may opening move of course be to tell diva about revelation have burst on night before diva be incomparably best disseminator of news walked so fast telegraphic style be so brisk lucid terse tongue revolving foot such gossip diva darling have to look in moment said elizabeth pecking affectionately on cheek bit of news oh contessa di faradidleony said diva sarcastically heard yesterday journey put off miss mapp just managed to stifle excitement must have betrayed that be news to dear not that said did suspect of not knowing that unfortunate though be just when be beginning to believe that there be contessa di faradidleony what sweet name for part will believe in when see poor mr wyse what be news then asked diva dear came upon in flash said elizabeth explains portmanteau early train duel diva looked disappointed thought be to be solid piece of news not one of elizabeth idea only drive ahead said ran away from other said elizabeth mouthing word a if speaking to totally deaf person who understood lip reading never mind cause of duel be affair whatever cause here dropped eye major having sent challenge packed portmanteau ran away dear diva met captain puffin at station running away too did began diva yes dear note on captain puffin table to housekeeper said be called away suddenly what called away cowardice dear how ignoble be have be thinking how brave wonderful be fled from other came back together played golf never thought be game for men sand dune where be supposed to be fighting might lose ball there must be utmost not life poor padre going out there to stop duel only finding game of golf understand nature of men better now what eye opener diva by time be trundling away round room longing to be off in order to tell everybody must find hole in elizabeth argument be founded a solidly a euclidean proposition ever occurred to that drink asked believe in roman road diary miss mapp bounded from chair danger flag flapped crimsoned in face what if diva went flying round tilling suggesting that in addition to being coward two men be drunkard must a soon a hint of further exposure reached conclude that have set idea on foot then diva darling said dream of imagining such thing so dangerous to hint anything of sort coward may be indeed be never have seen anything lead to suppose that drink must give due stick to what know must not launch accusation wildly about other matter just because know be coward coward need not be drunkard thank god be miserable enough a be having averted danger miss mapp with radiant excited face seemed to be bearing misery very courageously a diva must no longer be restrained from starting on morning round plunged together into maelstrom of high street riding whirling in water with solution of portmanteau early train for life buoy very little shopping be done that morning for permutation combination of tilling society with exception of course of coward have to be formed on pavement with view to amplest possible discussion diva a might have be expected gave proof of accustomed perfidy before long for certainly gave padre to understand that chain of inductive reasoning be of own welding elizabeth have to hurry after to correct grabbing impression discovery in be so great that small false note like must not spoil glorious harmony even mr wyse abandoned usual neutrality with regard to social politics left tall malacca cane in chemist so keen be gusto on seeing miss mapp on pavement outside to glean fresh detail of evidence by eleven o'clock morning two duellist be universally known a coward padre alone demurring being swampingly outvoted held sticking up for sex that major have be brave enough to send challenge on subject to friend have though subsequently failed to maintain high level shown courage of high order since for knew captain puffin might have accepted miss mapp be spokesman for mind of tilling on too indulgent judgment dear padre said be too generous altogether ran away ca get over besides must remember that when major sent challenge knew captain puffin oh so well quite expected must run away then why did run away asked padre be rather puzzling for moment miss mapp soon thought of explanation oh just to make sure said tilling applauded ready irony then came climax of sensationalism when at about ten minute past eleven two coward emerged into high street on way to catch tram out to link day threatened rain carried bag contained change of clothes just round corner of high street be group have applauded miss mapp quickness coward be among breaker glanced at other seeing that miss mapp be most towering of breaker be too late to retreat made usual salutation good morning said diva with voice trembling off to catch early train together mean tram good morning captain puffin said miss mapp with extreme sweetness what nice little travelling bag oh major got one too h be certain dismay looked from major flint eye captain puffin mouth fell open forgot to shut yes change of clothes said major look threatening morning very threatening said miss mapp hope will hing rash dangerous there be moment silence two looked from one face to of fell group wore fixed inexplicable smile will be pleasant among sand dune said padre wife gave loud squeak well will be missing tram said major au au reservoir lady nobody responded at hurried off down street bag bumping together very inconveniently something up major said puffin with true tilling perspicacity a soon a have got out of hearing precisely at same moment miss mapp gave little cooing laugh now must run do bittie shopping padre said kissed hand round curtain have to come down for little while on so dramatic situation discussion just then must be anti climax chapter ix captain puffin found sombre diarist when came over to study roman road with major flint that evening indeed be sombre antiquarian have pondered good deal during day over strange reception in high street that morning recondite allusion to bag sand dune early train more pondered more probable became that not only be something up a regard duel everything be up for week now have be regarded by lady of tilling with something approaching veneration there seemed singularly little veneration at back of comment morning following so closely on encounter with miss mapp last night irreverent attitude be probably due to atheistical manoeuvre of hers such at least be major view when held view usually stated did sporting benjy have got to thank for puffin said upon soul be ashamed of for saying what did to miss mapp last night utter absence of chivalrous feeling hinting that if said be drunk must say be be a sober lucid last night a be morning be devilish lucid to mind morning pity did take part last night said puffin thought be very ingenious idea of mine to make hold tongue there be finer thing in world sir than ingenuity said major what ingenuity have led to be public ridicule may not mind that may be used to man must regard consequence of act on others status in tilling be completely changed changed for worse sir puffin emitted fluty disagreeable laugh if status in tilling depended on reputation for bloodthirsty bravery said sooner be changed better be in same boat say like boat there be have drink will feel better never mind status have good mind never to have drink again said major pouring out one of stiff little glass if drink lead to sort of thing did said puffin how got out ca say for matter can if have be for last night must have be over tilling that be tipsy a well that must have improved status can see be in consequence of what said to mapp began major good lord where be connection asked puffin produce connection let have look at connection there ai connection duelling be a much a mentioned last night major flint pondered in gloomy sipping silence bridge party at mr poppit day after to morrow said feel a if must face suppose go on making allusion to duelling early train sha be able to keep mind on card for fear of more than sensitive man ought to be asked to bear puffin made noise sounded rather like fudge pardon said major haughtily granted by mean said puffin see what be in such taking about be worse off than be before got reputation for being such fire eater being fire eater be wash out be pleasant while lasted now be a be be not said major be detected fraud be not same a being fraud far from who be going to rub in friend who be be rubbing away for be worth miss mapp to whom if may say so without offence behaved like cur last night cur stood by wagged tail retorted puffin be about a far a be safe to go puffin hastened to say something pleasant about hearthrug to friend have suitable rejoinder after affair last night dark saying in high street morning there be little content cosiness about session puffin brazen optimism be tinkling cymbal major did not feel like tinkling at snorted glowered revolving in mind how to square miss mapp allied with if must be won over felt must face rest of tilling with indifference for hers must be most penetrating shaft most stinging pleasantry have more too so reflected to lose than puffin for till affair of duel other have never be credited with deed of bloodthirsty gallantry whereas have enjoyed end of reputation in amorous honourable affair marriage doubt must settle satisfactorily bachelor life with plenty of golf diary be not to be lightly exchanged for unknown short of light broke got to foot following gleam walking very lame out of general discomfiture tell what be puffin said particularly owe estimable lady very profound apology for what happened last night ought to withdraw word said word did say ca be done said puffin must be giving up hold over lady friend must be known a drunkard over shop before must say winkie worse off than before not bit of if be miss mapp be sure be who have be spreading damaging rumour about duel be because be outraged offended quite rightly at conduct to last night mine too if like ample apology sir be ticket dog ticket said puffin thanks very objectionable expression said major flint will do a like so with permission will will apologize for share in sorry performance in thank god only played minor role view if like may dislike puffin yawned mapp cat said stroke cat will get scratched shy brick at cat will spit at skedaddle be poor company to night major with qualm then sir can relieve of company said major by going home just what be about to do good night old boy same time to morrow for tram if be not too badly mauled miss mapp sitting by hot water pipe in garden room looked out not long after to see what night be like though be not yet half past ten coward sitting room be dark wondered what precisely meant there be bridge party anywhere that night apparently there be diary roman road why sober chastened darkness major qui hied for breakfast at unusually early hour next morning for courage of resolve to placate if possible hostility of miss mapp have not like of challenge oozed out during night have dressed in frock coat seen last on occasion when prince of wale proved not to have come by female breast however furious must fail to recognize compliment of such formality dressed thus with top hat patent leather boot be clearly observed from garden room to emerge into street just when captain puffin hand thrust sponge on to window sill of bath room probably too have observed apparition for finger prematurely loosed hold of sponge bounded into street wild surmise flashed into miss mapp active brain most likely of be that major benjy be going to propose to mr poppit for if have be going up to london for ceremonial occasion must be walking down street instead of up then saw agitated finger press electric bell of own door so be not on way to propose to mr poppit slid from room hurried across few step of garden to house just in time to intercept withers though not with idea of saying that be out then withers according to instruction waited till miss mapp have tiptoed upstairs conducted major to garden room promising that must tell mistress be unnecessary a mistress knew major pressed half crown into astonished hand thinking be florin must precisely account for impulse general propitiation be at bottom of miss mapp meantime have sat down on bed firmly rejected idea that call have anything to do with marriage during year of friendliness have not got so far a whatever future might hold be not likely that must begin now at moment when be so properly punishing for unchivalrous behaviour what must frock coat mean there be captain puffin servant picking up sponge hoped be covered with mud must be very just continuation of punishment to tell withers must not see punishment must entail on must be more than must bear for must not know moment peace while be ignorant of nature of errand must be on way to padre to challenge for very stinging allusion to sand dune yesterday be come to give fair warning so that might stop duel did not seem likely unable to bear suspense longer adjusted face in glass to expression of frozen dignity threw over shoulder cloak trimmed with blue in on occasion of prince visit have sat down in middle of road matched major frock coat hummed little song a mounted few step to garden room stopped just after have opened door did not offer to shake hand wish to see major flint said in such voice a iceberg might be supposed to use when passing other by night in arctic sea major flint certainly looked a if hated seeing instead of wishing for backed into corner of room dropped hat good morning miss mapp said very good of called clearly have difficulty in saying what have come to say if thought that be proposing to give smallest assistance be in error yes called said pray be seated did so stood got up again called said major called to express very deep regret at share rather that did not take more active share allowed in fact friend of mine to speak to in manner did equal discredit miss mapp put head on one side a if trying to recollect trivial unimportant occurrence yes said what be captain puffin began major then miss mapp remembered hope major flint said that will not find necessary to mention captain puffin name to wish nothing well be concern of mine have charity to suppose that be quite drunk on occasion to imagine allude intoxication alone must excuse what said let leave captain puffin out of have come to say to be adroit compelled major to begin over again come entirely on own account began understand said miss mapp instantly bringing captain puffin in again captain puffin now presume sober have regret for what said when drunk quite see expected more le from yes be afraid interrupted major flint threw friend overboard like ballast from bumping balloon speak for said behaved miss mapp like have worm defenceless lady insolent fellow drunk allude to captain p be very sorry for part in up till moment miss mapp have not made up mind whether intended to forgive not here saw how crushing penalty might be able to inflict on puffin if forgave erring possibly truly repentant major have already spoken strongly about friend offence must render life supremely nasty for particularly puffin if made major agree that must not if truly sorry hold further intercourse with there must be no more golf no more diary besides if be observed to be friendly with major again to cut captain puffin very natural interpretation must be that have learned that in original quarrel major have be defending from odious tongue to extent of challenge even though subsequently ran away tilling be quite clever enough to make inference without suggestion from if forgave of must probably go on boozing golfing together saying quite dreadful thing about not care very much whether forgave not mind be made up gave wan smile oh major flint said hurt so dreadfully that must have stood by heard man if be man say awful thing to not take side made feel so lonely have always be such good friend with then turned back on like did know what have done to deserve lay awake ever so long be affecting violently rubbed nap of hat wrong way then miss mapp broke into sunniest smile oh be so glad came to say be sorry said dear major benjy be quite friend again dabbed handkerchief on eye so foolish of said now sit down in most comfortable chair have cigarette major flint made peck at hand extended to cleared throat to indicate emotion really be great relief to think that must not make awful allusion to duel in middle of bridge party since feel a do about captain puffin said of course wo see anything more of be quite one be about that have dissociated from completely fact of being sorry doe that be quite clear to major that condition be involved in forgiveness though fact so obvious to miss mapp have not occurred to before still have to accept go unhouseled again must explain to puffin under cover of night perhaps in deaf dumb alphabet from window infamous unforgivable behaviour said pah so glad feel that said miss mapp smiling till saw entire row of fine teeth oh may say one little thing more feel feel that dreadful shock to of being insulted like be quite lovely little blessing in disguise now that effect have be to put end to intimacy with never liked liked le than ever other night be not fit friend for oh be so thankful major flint saw that for present be irrevocably committed to clause in treaty of peace must not face seeing torn up again a certainly must be if failed to accept in entirety must imagine leaving room with renewal of hostility must lose game of golf to day a be for apart from fact that must scarcely have time to change clothes idea of playing golf in frock coat top hat be inconceivable catch tram must not be seen in puffin company at indeed in future unless puffin must be induced to apologize miss mapp to forgive saw if be to play golf at with friend that endless deception subterfuge be necessary in order to escape detection one of must have to set out ten minute before other walk to tram by unusual circuitous route must have to play in clandestine furtive manner parting company before got to club house disguise might be needful there be peck of difficulty ahead must have to go into later at present must be immersed in rapture of forgiveness most generous of miss elizabeth said a for well wo allude to again miss mapp gave happy little laugh having made further plan switched away from subject of captain insult with alacrity look said found little rosebud in flower still though be end of november such brave little darling be one for button hole major benjy then must do little shopping withers will scold withers be so severe with keep in such order if be going into town will take with will put on hat request for present be certainly command two minute later set forth luck a usual befriended ability for there be puffin at door itching for major return else must miss tram lo there came stepping along miss mapp in blue trimmed cloak major attired a for marriage top hat frock coat button hole did not look at puffin cut did not seem with deceptiveness of appearance to see at so eager agreeable be conversation with companion major so puffin thought attempted to give sort of dazed hunted glance must not be certain even of so swiftly have to be transformed into genial interest in what miss mapp be saying puffin stared open mouthed after for be terrible a army with banner then diva trundling swiftly out of fish shop came a well might to dead halt observing absolutely inexplicable phenomenon good morning diva darling said miss mapp major benjy be doing little shopping together so kind of be very naughty of to take up time told ought to be playing golf lovely day au reservoir sweet oh there be padre major benjy how quickly walk see there be mr poppit everybody be enjoying sunshine what beautiful fur coat though must think found very heavy warm good morning dear susan shopping too like major benjy how be dear isabel miss mapp made most of morning magnanimity of forgiveness earned incredible dividend up down high street went with major benjy in attendance buying grocery stationery glove eau de cologne boot lace literary supplement of time dried camomile flower conceivable thing that might possibly need in next week so that shopping might be a protracted a possible allowed such be firmness in spoiling to carry shopping basket when be full decked like sacrificial ram with little parcel hung by loop of string sometimes took into shop in case there might be someone there who have not seen yet on leash sometimes left on pavement in prominent position marking time just a if have be clinical thermometer feverish curiosity be burning in tilling vein only yesterday have spread news of cowardice broadcast to day comradeship be of chattiest most genial kind there be carrying basket wearing frock coat top hat hung with parcel like christmas tree spending entire morning with instead of golfing with puffin miss mapp positively shuddered a tried to realize what state of mind must have be if have seen thus coupled with diva must have suspected rightly in probability loathsome intrigue against cream of be that until chose nobody must possibly find out what have caused metamorphosis so paralysing to inquiring intellect for major benjy must assuredly never tell anyone there be reconciliation due to apology for rudeness when have stood by permitted intoxicated puffin to suggest disgraceful bargain tilling poor tilling must go crazy with suspense a to what meant never have there be shopping be nearly lunch time when at front door major flint finally stripped of parcel companionship hobbled home profusely perspiring lame from so much walking on pavement in tight patent leather shoe be weary footsore have have golf though forgiven be wreck have made ridiculous morning with frock coat top hat porterage if forgiveness entailed more of nightmare sacrament of friendliness felt that must be unable to endure fatiguing accessory of regenerate state hung up top hat wiped wet throbbing head kicked off shoe shed frock coat furiously qui hied for whisky soda lunch physical restoration be accompanied by quickening of dismay at general prospect what to put succinctly be life worth even when unharassed by allusion to duel without solace of golf quarrel diary in companionship of puffin hated puffin one more so must not possibly get on without be entirely due to puffin that have spent so outrageous morning for puffin seeking to silence miss mapp by intoxicated bargain have be prime cause of misery must not even for fear of seeing eye in miss mapp garden room go across to house of unforgiven sea captain by judicious recital of woe induce to beg miss mapp forgiveness instantly must have to wait till kindly darkness fell mere slavery exclaimed with passion tap at sitting room door interrupted chain of melancholy reflection permission to enter be responded to by puffin major bounced from seat must stop here said in low voice a if afraid that might be overheard miss mapp may have seen come in puffin laughed shrilly why of course did gaily assented be at window right ancient light will call what be about now must go back said major flint agitatedly must see go back ca

late when major left after putting out light in puffin hall so that must not be silhouetted against slid into darkness reached own door by subtle detour miss mapp have good deal of division of swift mind when next morning learned nature of major benjy second errand if like mr wyse be to encourage puffin to hope that must accept apology must be obliged to remit further punishment of allow to consort with friend again be difficult to forgo pleasure of chastisement on other hand be just possible that major might break away whether liked not must not refuse permanently to give up puffin society must be awkward since have publicly paraded reconciliation with what further inclined to clemency be that very evening crimson lake tea gown must shed effulgence over mr poppit bridge party

to speak to anybody instantly did that justice for be just to everybody paid more attention to what said than must have paid to tipsy vagabond in slum daresay hardly remember what said so that before hear expression of regret will remind of threatened unless promised to tell nobody in what disgusting condition be to say be tipsy elizabeth mapp tipsy be what said captain puffin captain puffin

there hope will not be wet evening glass be sadly down oh withers captain puffin be going good morning captain puffin pleasure miss mapp hummed rollicking little tune a observed totter down street there said have glass of burgundy for lunch a treat chapter x news that mr wyse be to be of party that evening at mr poppit be to dine there first en famille a casually let slip in order to air french created disagreeable impression afternoon in tilling be not usual to do anything more than have tray for evening meal if one of winter bridge party followed there be to miss mapp mind deplorable tendency to ostentation in dinner giving before party still if susan be determined to be extravagant might have asked miss mapp a well who resented want of hospitality did not like hole corner en famille work with mr wyse indicated pushing familiarity to be hoped mr wyse eye be open there be point party have be ascertained must in number ten if a be certain there must be two bridge table seemed to imply that two people must have to cut out there be often nine at mr poppit bridge party appeared to be unable to count on occasion isabel be generally told by mother that did not care for bridge so there be cutting out only pleasant book for isabel what must be done with ten be idle to hope that susan must sit out a hostess always considered part of duty to play solidly entire evening still if cutting of card malignantly ordained that miss mapp be ejected be only reasonable to expect that after magnanimity to united service major benjy captain puffin must be so obdurate in insistence that must play instead of that must be only ladylike to yield did not therefore allow possibility to dim pleasure anticipated from discomfiture of darling diva who must be certain to appear in kingfisher blue tea gown find ghastly outshone by crimson lake be colour of mr trout second toilet miss mapp after prolonged thought a to most dramatic moment of entrance in crimson lake determined to arrive when might expect rest of guest to have already assembled must risk be true being out of rubber for little since bridge might have already begun play must have to stop for minute of greeting when came in must beg everybody not to stir must seat quite quite close to diva openly admire pretty frock like one used to have be therefore not much lacking of ten o'clock when after have waited considerable time on mr poppit threshold boon sulkily allowed to enter gave answer to timid inquiry of be very late boon drawing room door be little ajar a took off cloak masked splendour of crimson lake acute ear heard murmur of talk going on indicated that bridge have not yet begun while acute nostril detected faint certain smell of roast grouse showed what susan have given mr wyse for dinner probably telling that bird be present to from shooting lodge where have stayed in summer then after have thrown glance in mirror put on smile boon preceded slightly shrugging shoulder to drawing room door pushed open grunted loudly be manner of announcing guest miss mapp went tripping in almost at run to indicate how vexed be with for being late there just in front of stood diva dressed not in blue at in crimson lake of mr trout second toilet perfidious diva have have dress dyed too miss mapp courage rose to occasion other people major tipsy captain might be coward not twice now omitting matter of war of rose have diva by cunning be impossible not to suspect of diabolical origin clad odious little roundabout form in splendour identical with miss mapp now without faltering even when heard evie loud squeak turned to hostess who wore order of mbe on ample breast made salutation in perfectly calm voice dear susan scold for being so late said though know deserve so sweet of isabel darling dear evie oh mr wyse sweet irene major benjy captain puffin have nice game of golf padre hesitated moment wondering if must without screaming scratching seem aware of diva presence then soared lambent a flame diva darling said bent kissed even a st stephen in moment of martyrdom prayed for who stoned flesh blood must not manage more turned to mr wyse remembering that diva have told that contessa faradiddleony arrival be postponed dear sister have put off journey understand said disappointment will see at tilling at do think mr wyse looked surprised dear lady said be second person who have said that to mr plaistow asked just now yes be who told said miss mapp in case there be mistake be true certainly not told housekeeper that contessa maid be ill must follow be only foundation know of for rumour amelia encourages to hope that will be here early next week oh doubt be said miss mapp in aside so that diva must hear darling diva always getting hold of most erroneous information must have be listening to servant gossip so glad be wrong about mr wyse made one of stately inclination of head amelia will regret very much not being here to night said for see great bridge player be present oh mr wyse said will be humble learner compared with contessa expect not at said mr wyse what delightful idea of yours mr plaistow to dress alike in such lovely gown quite like sister miss mapp must not trust to speak on subject showed teeth not snarling amazingly smiling have occasion to reply however for captain puffin joined eagerly deferential what charming surprise mr plaistow have given miss mapp said in appearing again in same beautiful dress quite like miss mapp must not bear to hear what diva be like wheeled about passionately regretting that have forgiven puffin manoeuvre brought face to face with major upon word miss elizabeth said look magnificent to night saw light of fury in eye guessed mere man a be what be about bent to spoke low by jove said with supreme diplomacy somebody ought to tell good mr plaistow that woman can wear wonderful gown others have dear major benjy said cruel of to poor diva instantly happiness be clouded again for padre have very ill inspired notion what ho fair madam plaistow humorously observed to miss mapp ah peccavi be in error be mistress mapp let to card hostess craves thy presence at yon table contrary to custom mr poppit did not sit firmly down at table be isabel told that have invincible objection to playing bridge instead bade everybody else take seat said that mr wyse have settled at dinner that much preferred looking on learning to playing with view to enjoying incredible treat a fully a possible at once seated on low sofa at far end of room where must not look learn at engaged in conversation diva elizabeth a might have be expected from malignant influence watched over attire cut in at same table be partner so that have in spite of deadly antagonism of identical tea gown financial interest in common while further bond between be eagerness with strained ear to overhear anything that hostess mr wyse be saying to other miss mapp diva alike be perhaps busier when be being dummy than when be playing card over background of mind be spread hatred of other red a tea gown shot with black despair a to what on earth must do now with ill fated piece of pride miss mapp be prepared to make perfect chameleon of hers if only must get away from diva hue what if having changed say to purple diva became purple too must not stand third coincidence besides much doubted whether gown have once be of so pronounced crimson lake must successfully attempt to appear of other hue except perhaps black if diva died might perhaps consult miss greele a to whether black must be possible then if diva died there be reason for not wearing crimson lake for ever since must be insincerity of miss mapp humbly hoped be incapable to go into mourning for diva just because died in front of lurid background of despair moved figure must have commanded attention have aroused feeling of disgust pity of be capable have only diva stuck to kingfisher blue there sat on sofa talking in voice be impossible to overhear if ever woman made up to man if ever man be taken in by willow artifice thought miss mapp be one there be longer question that susan be doing utmost to inveigle mr wyse into matrimony for other motive not politeness not charm of conversation not low comfortable seat by fire must possibly have have force enough to keep for whole evening from bridge table that dinner en famille so miss mapp sarcastically reflected what if be first of hundred of similar dinner en famille perhaps when safely married susan must ask to one of family dinner with glassful of foam called champagne leg of crow called game from shooting lodge there be use in denying that mr wyse seemed to be swallowing flattery other form of bait a fast a be supplied never have be so made up to since day now two year ago when miss mapp wrote down a uncapturable now on awful evening of crimson lake seemed only prudent to face prospect of falling into net be spread for susan sister in law of contessa susan wife of man whose urbanity made tilling polite to other susan wyse of whitchurch made miss mapp feel positively weary of earth be sum of miss mapp mental activity a sat being dummy to diva for in addition to rage despair disgust with various topic filled have narrowly to watch diva play in order at end to point out to with lucid firmness mistake have made while with snort sniff muttered exclamation jerk of head pulling out of card putting of back with amazing assertion that have not quitted wrestled with task have set herself of getting two trump be impossible to count trick diva made for have habit of putting elbow on after have raked in a if in fear that adversary must filch when be not looking miss mapp distracted with other interest forgot that trump have be declared thought be heart of diva played several after adversary hand be quite denuded of often did that to make sure three trick said triumphantly at conclusion counting card in cache below elbow miss mapp gave long sigh remembered that mr wyse be present must have got two more said if have played heart dear must have be able to trump major benjy club padre diamond must have gone out never mind played beautifully otherwise ca trump when be trump said diva forgetting mr wyse be there be nonsense got three trick did go out did think be heart be miss mapp naturally must not demean to take notice of deal be major benjy asked to cut diva have remembered just after sharp speech to partner that mr wyse be present looked towards sofa to see if there be indication of pained surprise on face might indicate that have heard what saw there to be more accurate what failed to see there forced to give exclamation caused miss mapp to look round in direction where diva bulging eye be glued there be doubt about mr poppit mr wyse be no longer there unless be under sofa have certainly left room together altogether have gone to put on sable coat on hot night be mr wyse staggering under weight a fitted into miss mapp rejected supposition have gone to room to converse more privately looked very black indeed noted time on clock in order to ascertain when came back how long have be absent rubber went on wild way relieved from restraining influence of mr wyse when thirty nine minute afterwards came to conclusion hostess mr wyse have returned miss mapp be content to let diva muddle madly adding up score with assistance of finger went across to other table till must be called back to check partner figure must be certain to need checking have mr wyse gone away already dear isabel said how early four make nine muttered diva getting to little finger isabel be dummy have time for conversation think have only gone with mamma into conservatory said more diamond partner to advise about orchid now conservatory be what miss mapp considered potting shed with glass roof orchid be one anaemic odontoglossum there must scarcely be room besides for mr poppit mr wyse potting shed be visible from drawing room window over curtain be drawn lovely night said miss mapp while diva be checking score may have peep at star dear so fond of sweet star glided to window conscious that diva be longing to glide too be preparing to quarrel with major score took peep at sweet star light from hall shone full into potting shed there be nobody there made quite sure of diva have heard about sweet star for first time in life made objection to adversary total be right major flint eighteen penny said stupid of have left handkerchief in pocket of cloak will pop out get back in minute cut again for partner trundled to door popped out of before miss mapp have slightest chance of intercepting progress be bitter because dining room opened out of hall so did book cupboard with window dear susan called boudoir diva be quite capable of popping into of apartment in fact if truant be there be use bothering about sweet star more diva must already have won there be sweet moon a well just a baffled miss mapp be turning away from window saw that made positively glue nose to cold window pane tuck curtain in so that silhouette must not be visible from outside down middle of garden path came two truant susan in sable mr wyse close beside with coat collar turned up ample form with small round head on top looked like short funnelled locomotive engine like driver on foot plate perfidious thing have said be going to consult over orchid did orchid grow on lawn be news to miss mapp if did stopped mr wyse quite clearly pointed to celestial object moon star gazed at sight of two such middle aged people behaving like made miss mapp feel quite sick heroically continued moment more at post heroism be rewarded for immediately after inspection of celestial object turned inspected other mr wyse kissed miss mapp scriggled from behind curtain into room again aldebaran said so lovely simultaneously diva re entered with handkerchief thwarted disappointed for have certainly found nobody in boudoir in dining room there be going to be sit down supper a boon be not there have taken marron glace miss mapp be flushed with excitement disgust almost forgot about diva gown found hanky dear said then will cut for partner again major benjy scold if play wrong managed to get seat commanded full face view of door for next thing be to see how young couple a have already labelled in sarcastic mind looked when returned from amorous excursion to orchid grew on lawn entered most unfortunately while be in middle of playing complicated hand brain be so switched off from play by entrance that completely lost thread of what be doing threw away two trick simply required to be gathered up by now lurked below diva elbow what made worse be that trace of emotion heightened colour coy downcast eye betrayed hint of what have happened on lawn with brazen effrontery susan informed daughter that mr wyse thought little leaf mould what liar thought miss mapp triumphantly put remaining trump on to dummy best card then prepared to make best of have lost three be afraid major benjy said think overbid hand just little wee bit know about miss elizabeth said major if have let two spade go have trumped best heart miss mapp interrupted with famous patter oh if have taken spade said quickly must have have to lead up to diva club then must have got rough in diamond must have never be able to get back into hand again then at end if have trumped heart must have have to lead losing spade diva must have over trumped brought in club must have gone down two more if follow think will agree be right to do good player overbid hand sometimes major benjy such fun supper be unusually ostentatious miss mapp saw reason for that be clear that susan wanted to impress poor mr wyse with wealth probably when came to settlement must learn very unpleasant news there be agreeable little circumstance to temper dislike of extravagant display for be hungry diva always gross feeder spilt hot chocolate sauce on crimson lake if indelible might supply solution to problem of what be to be done now about own frock kept eye too on captain puffin to see if showed sign of improvement in direction have indicated to in interview be rejoiced to see that one of glance be clearly cause of refusing second glass of port have already taken stopper out of decanter when eye met then put back again improvement already everything else pending discovery a to whether chocolate on crimson lake spelt ruin now faded into middle distance while affair of susan poor mr wyse occupied entire foreground of miss mapp consciousness mean cunning a susan conduct must have be in entrapping mr wyse when others have failed to gain affection miss mapp felt that must be only prudent to continue on most amicable of term with for a future sister in law to countess wife to man who by mere exercise of presence must make tilling sit up behave must doubtless not hesitate about giving miss mapp nasty one back if retaliation demanded be dreadful to think that audacious climber be so soon to belong to wy of whitchurch since moonlight have revealed that such be mr wyse intention be best to be friend with mammon of british empire poppit cum wyse be likely to be very important centre of social life in tilling when not in scotland whitchurch capri miss mapp wisely determined that even announcement of engagement must not induce to give voice to very proper sentiment must not help inspiring after have done for susan in letting door of high life in tilling swing open for when must not possibly keep shut longer seemed only natural that if only kept on good term with now susan must insist that dear elizabeth must be first to be told of engagement made pause before adopting obvious course of setting off immediately after breakfast next morning telling friend under promise of secrecy just what have seen in moonlight last night thrilling to narrator a such announcement must be must be even more thrilling provided only that susan have sufficient sense of decency to tell of engagement before anybody else to hurry off to others inform that have known of ever since night of bridge party be important therefore to be at home whenever there be slightest chance of susan coming round with news miss mapp sat at window whole of first morning so a not to miss hardly attended at to rest of pageant of life moved within radius of observation heart beat fast when about middle of morning mr wyse came round dentist corner for might be that bashful susan have sent to make announcement if so be bashful too for walked by house without pause looked rather worried thought a well might passing on disappeared round church corner clearly on way to betrothed carried square parcel in hand about a big a jewel case might contain tiara hour afterwards however came back still carrying tiara occurred to that engagement might have be broken off little later again with quickened pulse miss mapp saw royce lumber down from church corner stopped at house caught glimpse of sable within time felt certain that susan have come with interesting news waited till withers having answered door came to inquire doubt whether must see mr poppit ala minute later royce lumbered on carrying additional weight of christmas number of punch miss mapp have borrowed last night have not of course have time to glance at yet anticipation be supposed to be pleasanter than fulfilment however agreeable if be case miss mapp during next day two have more enjoyment than announcement of fifty engagement must have given so constantly when from garden room heard sound of knocker on front door did spring up in certainty that be susan never be however enjoyable might be appeared to herself at least to be suffering torture of suspense through by degree idea painful revolting in extreme yet strangely exhilarating began to insinuate into mind there seemed deadly probability of correctness of conjecture a week went by without further confirmation of kiss for after who knew anything about character antecedent of susan a for mr wyse be not constant visitor to fierce fickle south where a everyone knew morality be wholly extinct how if be too true must tilling treat hitherto unprecedented situation be terrible to contemplate moral upheaval might prove to be social upheaval also time again a miss mapp vainly waited for news be within ace of communicating suspicion to padre ought to know for christmas a be usual in december be daily drawing nearer there came half way through month dark ominous afternoon rain falling sad thick so unusual density of cloud dwelling in upper air that by three o'clock miss mapp be quite unable until street lamp at corner be lit to carry out minor duty of keeping eye on house of captain puffin major benjy royce have already lumbered by door since lunch time so dark be peer a might be lost in gloom before came to dentist corner miss mapp have to face fact that really did not know whether have turned into street where susan lover lived have gone straight on be easier to imagine worst have already pictured to herself clandestine meeting between passionate one who under cover of darkness be imperviously concealed from observation beneath umbrella from house roof nothing powerful searchlight must reveal what be going on in drawing room window of mr wyse house apart from fact that have not got powerful searchlight be strongly improbable that anything of very intimate nature be going on there be not likely that must choose drawing room window thought of calling on mr wyse asking for loan of book so that must see whether sable be in hall even then must not really be much further on even a considered sea mist began to creep through street outside in few minute be blotted from view nothing be visible nothing audible hissing of shrouded rain suddenly from close outside came sound of door knocker imperiously plied must be no other than own only telegram urgent errand must bring anyone out on such day unable to bear suspense of waiting till withers have answered hurried into house to open door herself be news of engagement coming to at last late though be must welcome even now for must atone in part at rate be diva diva dear said miss mapp enthusiastically for withers be already in hall how sweet of to come round anything special yes said diva opening eye very wide spreading shower of moisture a whisked off mackintosh be come must not refer to susan who asked miss mapp faradiddleony said diva said miss mapp very loud so much interested that quite forgot to resent diva being first to have news let have comfortable cup of tea in garden room tea withers miss mapp lit candle there for lost in meditation have be sitting in dark with reckless hospitality poked fire to make blaze tell about said must be treat for diva who be such gossip went to station just now said diva wanted new time table besides royce have just gone down mr wyse susan on platform sable asked miss mapp parenthetically to complete picture swaddled talked to train came in woman got out kissed mr wyse shook hand with susan hand while luggage be got out much asked miss mapp quickly hundred covered with coronet f two cab miss mapp mind on hot scent went back to previous telegraphic utterance hand did say dear asked perhaps be italian fashion maybe then what else do think faradiddleony kissed susan mr wyse must be engaged ca account for other way must have written to tell sister must have told then at station must have be engaged day never knew went to look at orchid remember be when be bitter doubt bitterness must be transmuted into amazing sweetness then now can speak said miss mapp with sigh of great relief oh have be so hard keeping silence felt ought to knew along diva dear along how asked diva with fallen crest miss mapp laughed merrily looked out of window dear while went for hanky peeped into dining room boudoir did there be on lawn kissed other so said to myself 'dear susan have got perseverance rewarded h be only guess of yours did susan tell dear said nothing susan be always secretive might not have be engaged at said diva with brightened eye man doe always marry woman kiss diva have betrayed lowness of mind now by hazarding that have for day dwelt in miss mapp mind a almost certain drew in breath with hissing noise a if in pain darling what dreadful suggestion said such idea ever occurred to secretive thought susan might be immoral never must forget ever thought that let talk about something painful perhaps must like to tell more about contessa diva have grace to look ashamed of herself to take refuge in new topic so thoughtfully suggested must see clearly said so dark tall lean sneezed that might happen to anybody dear said miss mapp whether tall short nothing more eyeglass said diva after thought single one asked miss mapp on string how strange for woman seemed positively last atom of diva knowledge though miss mapp tried on principle of psycho analysis to disinter something have forgotten catechism led to result diva have evidently something else to say for after finishing tea whizzed backwards forward from window to fireplace with little grunt whistle a be habit when be struggling with utterance long before came out miss mapp have of course guessed what be wonder diva found difficulty in speaking of matter in have behaved so deplorably about wretched dress said at length got stained with chocolate first time wore janet can get out hurrah thought miss mapp must have dyed again continued diva thought 'd better tell else might have yours dyed same colour a mine again kingfisher blue to crimson lake came out of vogue mr trout rather funny know expensive must have seen face elizabeth when came in to susan other night must dearest said miss mapp trembling violently yes must have gone home with in dark for anything murder diva dear said miss mapp anxiously have got mind like to put worst construction on everything if mr wyse kiss intended think thing too terrible for word if look surprised think be full of hatred malice be more generous dear put evil construction on see ho said diva with world of meaning know what intend to convey by ho said miss mapp sha try to guess be kinder darling will make happier thinketh evil know charity diva felt that limit of what be tolerable be reached when elizabeth lectured on need of charity must no doubt have explained tersely unmistakably exactly what meant by ho have not withers opportunely entered to clear away tea brought note with miss mapp opened encourage to hope be first word met eye mr poppit have be encouraging to hope again to dine at mr wyse to morrow said doubt announcement will be made then probably wrote before went to station yes few friend going dear diva instantly got up think will run home see said by by elizabeth what about teagown if go if yours be covered with chocolate must think 'd like to wear said miss mapp must tuck away said diva just for once put flower then send to dyer wo see again not crimson lake mean miss mapp summoned whole of magnanimity have be put to great strain already be tired out be capable of one more effort wear then said will be treat to let know if be not asked daresay mr wyse will want to keep very small good bye dear be afraid will get very wet going home chapter xi sea mist rain continued without intermission next morning shopping with umbrella mackintosh be unusually brisk for there be naturally universally felt desire to catch sight of contessa with a little delay a possible foggy condition perhaps added to excitement for be not possible to see more than few yard thus at moment anybody might almost run into diva impression meagre though be have be thoroughly circulated morning passed lady of tilling went home to change wet thing take little ammoniated quinine a precaution after so long chilly exposure without single one of having caught sight of single eyeglass be disappointing disappointment be bearable since mr wyse so far from wanting party to be very small have be encouraged by mr poppit to hope that must include world of tilling with one exception have hope with regard to major captain padre wee wifie irene miss mapp of course isabel apparently despaired of diva alone therefore be absent from long wet shopping for waited indoors almost pen in hand to answer in affirmative invitation have at present not arrived owing to thickness of fog absence from street passed unnoticed for everybody supposed that everybody else have seen while biting nail at home waited waited waited then waited about quarter past one gave up duly telephoned according to promise via janet withers to miss mapp to say that mr wyse have not yet hoped be very unpleasant to let know if have rung up be answered by elizabeth who usually rushed to telephone felt that must sooner have choked than have delivered message so janet telephoned withers said must tell mistress did miss mapp be steeped in pleasant conjecture most likely of be that contessa have seen that roundabout little busybody in station taken instant dislike to through single eyeglass might have seen poor diva inquisitively inspecting luggage with coronet f on have learned with pain that be one of lady of tilling algernon must have said so said miss mapp to herself who be that queer little woman be going to steal of luggage then algernon must have told that be poor diva decent sort of little body when came to algernon asking guest for dinner party in honour of betrothal arrival at tilling doubt contessa must have said algernon beg if diva poor diva be right in conjecture that note have be written before arrival of train be evident that algernon have torn up one addressed to diva when contessa heard whom be to meet next evening susan might easily have insinuated that must have two very pleasant table of bridge after dinner without including diva who be so wrong quarrelsome over score of explanation be quite satisfactory since diva must not be present miss mapp must naturally don crimson lake must see what crimson lake looked like when decked suitable wearer be not parodied on other side of card table how true a dear major benjy have said that one woman must wear what must not if there be woman who must not wear crimson lake be diva be mr wyse really ashamed to let sister see diva in crimson lake must be just like to be considerate of diva not permit to make guy of herself before italian aristocracy doubt must ask to lunch day quite quietly have miss mapp bloomed with pretty conjecture like alpine meadow when smitten into flower by spring enjoyed lunch very much indeed anxiety suspense of morning instead of being relieved have ended in utter gloom gave diva headache adopted usual strenuous method of getting rid of so instead of lying down taking aspirin dozing set out after lunch to walk off sprinted splashed along miry road indifferent a to whether stepped in puddle not careless how wet got bit on bullet of omission from dinner party evening determining not to mind one atom about to look forward to pleasant evening at home instead of going out like in wet never never under circumstance must ask of guest what sort of evening have be spent how mr wyse announced news how faradiddleony played bridge said that satirical word aloud mouthing to puddle dripping hedge row must not evince slightest interest in must cover with spadeful of oblivion when next met mr wyse must whatever might feel behave exactly a usual plumed on dignified resolution walked so fast that hedge row became quite transparent be proper thing to do have be grossly slighted like true lady must be unaware of slight whereas poor elizabeth under such circumstance must have devised hundred petty scheme for rendering mr wyse life burden to if if only said if found reason to believe that susan be at bottom of then probably must think of something worthy not so much of true lady of true woman without asking question might easily arrive at information must enable to identify susan a culprit must then act in way must astonish susan what way be need not think yet so devoted entire mind to question way home feeling better with headache quite gone arrived in tilling again drenched to skin be already after tea time abandoned tea altogether prepared to console for exclusion from gaiety with good blow out in shape of regular dinner instead of usual muffin now tray later to add dignity to feast put on crimson lake tea gown for last time that must be crimson though same tea gown still since to morrow must be sent to dyer to go into perpetual mourning for vanished glory have meant to send to day misery anxiety have put out of head

introduced to in lump got name wrong addressed neighbour a captain flint major puffin thought that diva be mr mapp seemed vivacious good humoured dropped eye glass into soup talked with mouth full drank good deal of wine be very bad example for major puffin then there be many sudden complete pause in talk for diva news of kissing of mr poppit by contessa have spread like wildfire through fog morning owing to miss mapp dissemination of now whenever mr wyse raised voice ever so little everybody else stopped talking in expectation that news be about to be announced occasionally also contessa addressed remark to brother in shrill voluble italian rather confirmed gloomy estimate of table manner in matter of talking with mouth full for to speak in italian be equivalent to whispering since purport of what said must not be understood by anybody except then also sensation of dining with countess produced slight feeling of strain in addition to correct behaviour mr wyse presence always induced almost congealed correctness into stiffness a dinner went on evident enjoyment of herself made felt eccentricity though carefully observed noted by miss mapp be not succeeded by silence hurried burst of conversation be ladyship making long stay in tilling asked real major to cover pause have be caused by mr wyse saying something across table to isabel dropped eye glass with splash into gravy pulled out again by string a if landing fish sucked depends on gentleman said with greater audacity than be usual in tilling if major puffin that sweet little scotch clergyman fall in love

hate for will mean that like best miss mapp hated nobody at moment not even diva off whose face hastily applied powder be crumbling leaving little red mark peeping out like star on fine evening dinner came to end with roasted chestnut brought by contessa from capri always scold amelia for luggage take with said mr wyse to diva amelia dear be hostess to night everybody saw look at mr poppit must

attention to in drawing room swiftly established at card table where proceeded with most complicated sort of patience series of cigarette to while away time till gentleman joined though lady of tilling have plenty to say to other be about such comment must not conveniently be made in presence unless like talked language unknown to subject of conversation must not talk at so gathered round table watched lightning rapidity with piled black knave on red queen in pack red knave on black queen in others have taken off ring in order to procure greater freedom of finger eye glass continued to crash on to glittering mass of magnificent gem rapidity of motion be only equalled by swift surprising monologue poured from mouth there that odious king get in way said so like man to poke in where

clearly then revoked heavily contessa so far from being angry with burst into peal of unquenchable merriment way of taking revoke be new to tilling for right thing be for revoker partner to sulk be sarcastic for at least twenty minute after contessa laughter continued to spurt out at interval during rest of rubber be very pleasant at end said be not up to tilling standard at refused to play more miss mapp in highest good humour urged not to despair indeed dear contessa said play very well little overbidding of hand perhaps do think be tendency be subject to often overbid hand not little wee rubber more be sure must like to be partner again must come play at house afternoon will have tea early get good two hour nothing like practice evening came to end without great announcement being made miss mapp a reviewed event of party sitting next morning in observation window found whole evidence so overwhelming that be no longer worth while to form conjecture however fruitful on subject diverted mind to pleasing reminiscence project for future have certainly be distinguished by contessa marked regard opinion of charm ability be of very highest doubt strange remark about duelling at dinner have be humorous in intention many true word be spoken in jest contessa perspicacious woman have seen at once that major benjy captain puffin be just sort of men who might get to duelling at rate challenging about woman asking of lady men be most in love with saying that believed be miss mapp miss mapp have turned nearly a red a poor diva when came out so lightly yet so acutely diva have of course be horrid blow to find that diva have be asked to mr wyse party in first instance even shrewder one when diva entered with such unnecessary fussing apology on part of mr wyse in crimson lake luckily must be seen more for diva have promised if must trust diva to send to dyer be great puzzle to know why diva have on at if be preparing to spend solitary evening at home by eight o'clock ought by right to have already have tray dressed in old thing within three minute of being telephoned for have appeared in crimson lake eaten so heartily that be impossible to imagine greedy though be that have already consumed tray in spite of diva adventitious triumph main feeling in miss mapp mind be pity for looked so ridiculous in dress with powder peeling off red face wonder dear contessa stared when came in there be bridge party for contessa to consider contessa must be le nervous perhaps if there be only one table must be more homey cosy must at same time give rise to great heart burning indignation in breast of who be left out diva must certainly be one of spurned contessa must not play with mr wyse then there be major benjy must certainly be asked for be evident that contessa delighted in suddenly miss mapp began to feel le sure that major benjy must be of party contessa charming though be have said several very tropical italian thing to have told that must stop here for ever if men fought duel about have said dear darling to at bridge when a adversary failed to trump losing card have asked to ask to tea with one else for have great deal to say to when general macedoine of sable au reservoir thanks for nice evening took place in hall miss mapp be not in fact sure when thought over that contessa be nice friend for major benjy did not do injustice of imagining that must ask to tea alone very suggestion proved that must be piece of contessa southern extravagance of expression after thought miss mapp to herself a writhed at idea other extravagant expression be proved to cover good deal of truth in fact major chance of being asked to select bridge party diminished swiftly towards vanishing point be time indeed late to set forth on morning marketing miss mapp have already determined not to carry capacious basket with to day in case of meeting contessa in high street must be grander wysier more magnificent to go basket le direct that good must be sent up rather than run risk of encountering contessa with basket containing couple of mutton cutlet ball of wool tooth powder so put on prince of wale cloak postponing further reflection over bridge party till le busy occasion set forth in unencumbered gentility for morning gossip at corner of high street ran into diva news said diva met mr wyse just now engaged to susan over town by now everybody know oh there be padre for first time shot across street miss mapp shaking dust of diva off foot proceeded on chagrined way annoyed a be with diva be almost more annoyed with susan after have done for susan susan ought to have told long ago pledging to secrecy to be told like by common diva without secrecy at be affront that must find hard to forgive susan for mentally reduced by half sum that have determined to squander on susan wedding present must be plated not silver if susan be not careful must be plated at have just come out of chemist after indignant interview about precipitated chalk have deposited small packet on counter when asked to have sent up to house must not undertake to deliver small package left precipitated chalk lying there emerging heard loud foreign sort of scream from close at hand there be contessa by carrying marketing basket of unusual size newness contained bloody steak crab where be basket miss mapp exclaimed algernon told that great lady of tilling went marketing in morning with big basket that if aspired to be du monde must have basket too be greatest fun have already written to cecco to say be just going marketing with

what be mr hopkins doing with miss cole do kiss market basket disappoints for algernon said have biggest market basket of bought biggest must find be a big a yours miss mapp head be in whirl contessa said in loudest possible voice that everybody else only whispered displayed in basket that everybody else covered up with thick layer of paper if miss mapp have only guessed that contessa must have market basket must have paraded high street with leg of mutton protruding from one end pair of wellington boot from other who must have suspected that contessa black thought succeeded be possible that mr wyse have be satirical about affair of tilling if so wished nothing worse than to be married to susan playful face must be put for moment on situation too lovely of dear contessa said may go marketing together to morrow will measure size of basket such fun have too laughing at dear people in tilling what thrilling news morning about sweet susan dear brother though of course knew long ago indeed how be said contessa quite sharply miss mapp be nettled at tone oh must allow two eye said since be merely tedious to explain how have seen from behind curtain kissing in garden just two eye nose for scent remarked contessa very genially be certainly coarse though probably italian miss mapp opinion of contessa fluctuated violently like barometer before storm indicated changeable dear susan be such intimate friend said contessa looked at very fixedly for moment then appeared to dismiss matter crab steak said where doe nice captain major flint live have note to leave on for have asked to tea alone to see tiger skin be going to be flirt while be in tilling when go will break heart will have told who can mend again dear major benjy said miss mapp at wit end to know how to deal with so feather tongued lady what treat will be to to have to tea to day be contessa quite distinctly winked behind eyeglass have put up to look at diva who whirled by on other side of street if said 'to day remarked must what be that one say indicated diva yes must pop in good major must pay attention to so if tell will go to day will know be lie clever miss mapp so will go to tea with to morrow find there bene now where be house be sort of scheming have never entered into miss mapp life saw with pain how willow have be year often often have when inquisitive question be put answered without strict subservience to truth never have thought of confusing issue like if told diva lie diva probably guessed be lie acted accordingly have never thought of making practically impossible to tell whether be lie not have more idea when walked back along high street with contessa swinging basket by side whether lady be going to tea with major benjy to day to morrow when than knew whether crab be going to eat beefsteak there be house said a paused at dentist corner there be mine next with little bow window of garden room looking out on to street hope to welcome there dear contessa for tiny game of bridge tea one of day very soon what day do think to morrow then must know if contessa be going to tea with major benjy to morrow unfortunately contessa appeared to know that must know too flirt said perhaps may be having tea with flirt to morrow better anything than will ask too to meet said miss mapp feeling in awful helpless way that be playing adversary game adversary did say to herself did inscrutable contessa be up to too will not amalgamate treat said so that be house what charming house how heart flutter a ring bell miss mapp be now quite distraught there be possibility that contessa might tell major benjy that be time married on other hand be making arrangement to go to tea with on unknown date hero of amorous adventure in india elsewhere might lose heart again to somebody quite different from one whom must hope to marry by daylight dear contessa be undeniably plain be something in short day tea must be conducted by artificial light by artificial light be not so like rabbit be worse be that by light have liveliness might be mistaken for wit flattering manner might be taken for sincerity hoped men be not so easily duped a be sadly afraid that be blind fool number of visit miss mapp made about tea time in week before christmas to post box at corner of high street with envelope in hand containing mr hopkins bill for fish postal order enclosed baffle computation naturally did not intend either by day night to risk being found again with blank unstamped envelope in hand one enclosing mr hopkins bill postal order must have passed scrutiny for correctness anywhere fair calm a be exterior of envelope none must tell how agitated be hand carried backwards forward until edge got crumpled inscription clouded with much fingering indeed of trick miss mapp have compassed for others none be so sumptuously contrived a in have now entangled for december day be dark in consequence not only must contessa be looking best such a be at tea time from miss mapp window be impossible to tell whether have gone to tea with on particular afternoon for there have be strike at gas work lamp at corner in happier day must have told told nothing whatever miss mapp must therefore trudge to letter box with mr hopkins bill in hand a went out after feint of posting with in pocket a came back in order to gather from light in window from sound of conversation must be audible a passed close beneath whether major be having tea there not with whom must hear that ringing laugh have sounded so pleasant when revoked now be so sinister have quite determined to go in borrow book tiger skin anything major must scarcely fail to ask to tea once there wild horse must not drag away until have outstayed other visitor then a malady of jealousy grew more feverish began to perceive a by ray of dreadful dawn light in major room sound of elfin laughter be not completely trustworthy a proof that contessa be there be possible awfully possible that two might be sitting in firelight voice might be hushed to amorous whispering pregnant smile might be taking place of laughter on one such afternoon a came back from letter box with patient mr hopkins overdue bill in pocket wild certainty seized when saw how closely curtain be drawn how still seemed inside room firelight dalliance be going on rang bell imagined heard whispering inside while be being answered presently light went up in hall major mr dominic opened door major be in think be mr dominic said miss mapp in most insinuating tone miss out said dominic uncompromisingly miss mapp wondered if dominic drank dear how tiresome when told said with playful annoyance must be very kind mr dominic just see for certain that be not in room may have come in miss be out said dominic with parrot like utterance of determined liar message miss mapp turned away more certain than ever that be in immersed in dalliance must have continued to be quite certain about have not glancing distractedly down street caught sight of coming up with captain puffin meantime have twice attempted to get up cosy little party of four so a not to frighten contessa to play bridge from tea till dinner on occasion faradiddleony for so have become be most unfortunately engaged second of disappointing reply contained hope that must meet at marketing to morrow morning though poor miss mapp be really getting very tired with innumerable visit to post box whether wet fine set forth next morning with hope anyhow of finding out whether contessa have be to tea with major flint on what day be going there be just opposite post office there oh shame be major benjy on way to tram in light hearted conversation with be slight consolation captain puffin be there too miss mapp quickened step to little tripping run dear contessa so sorry be late said lot of little thing to do morning major benjy captain puffin oh how naughty of to have begun shopping without only be to grocer said contessa major benjy have be so amusing have got on with shopping at have written to cecco to say that there be one so witty major benjy thought miss mapp bitterly remembering how long have taken to arrive at

at then be vexed with for keeping men always blame poor woman well upon word what be game of golf compared with pleasure of being with lady asked major with great fat bow want to catch tram said puffin quite distinctly miss mapp found more nearly forgetting inebriated insult than ever before poor captain puffin said contessa will catch be off of at once will not say word to of will never forgive if miss to morrow afternoon major benjy turned round to bow again bicycle luckily for rider going very slowly butted softly into behind not hurt called contessa good ah miss mapp let get to

for towel learn housekeeping like cecco will delight in economy will make quick to draper lest there must be towel left in spite of figgis list contessa shopping be soon over miss mapp having seen a far a corner walked on a if to own house in order to give time to get to mr wyse then fled back to high street suspense be unbearable have to know without delay when where diva contessa have played bridge yesterday never have eye so rapidly scanned movement of passenger in entrancing thoroughfare in order to pick diva out learn from precisely what have happened there be coming out of dyer with basket completely filled by bulky package needed ingenuity to identify a late crimson lake must have to be pleasant with diva for much a perfidious woman might enjoy telling where furtive bridge party have taken place might enjoy even more torturing with uncertainty diva must if put to give answer to direct question skilfully changing subject talk about something utterly different crimson lake said miss mapp pointing to basket hope will turn out well dear there be rather wicked light in diva eye not crimson lake said jet black sweet of to have dyed again dear diva said miss mapp not very expensive trust send bill in to if like said diva miss mapp laughed very pleasantly must be good joke said how nice be that dear contessa take so warmly to tilling way so amusing be about commission figgis have given wee bit satirical do think ought to put diva in good temper for there be nothing liked so much a few little dab at somebody else diva be not very good natured be rather satirical

quite be toothpick yes toothpick said diva perhaps have bad teeth said miss mapp run in family mr wyse know be lucky diva maintained complete silence have now come nearly a far a door if must not give information that knew miss mapp longed for must be asked for with uncertain hope that must give then be playing bridge lately dear asked miss mapp quite lately said diva thought heard say something about to contessa yesterday be whom did play with diva paused when have come quite to door made up mind contessa susan mr wyse said thought never played with mr wyse said miss mapp have to get four said diva contessa wanted bridge nobody else popped into house there be use in describing miss mapp state of mind except by saying that for moment quite forgot that contessa be almost certainly going to tea with major benjy to morrow chapter xii peace on earth mercy mild sang miss mapp holding head back with uvula clearly visible sat in usual seat close below pulpit sun streaming in through stained glass window opposite made face of colour like joseph coat not knowing how looked from outside pictured to herself sort of celestial radiance coming from within though diva sitting opposite be reminded of iridescent hue observable on cold boiled beef then miss mapp have registered fact that diva notion of singing alto be to follow treble at uniform distance of minor third below so that matter be about square between wondered between verse if must say something very tactful to diva might before next christmas induce not to make noise major flint came in just before first hymn be over held top hat before face by way of praying in secret before opened hymn book piece of loose holly fell down from window ledge above on exact middle of head jump that gave be considering baldness quite justifiable captain puffin miss mapp be sorry to see be not there at have be unwell lately with attack of dizziness one of have caused in last game of golf that have played to fall down on eleventh green groan if attack be not due to lack of perseverance right minded person must fail to be very sorry for there be good deal more peace on earth a regard tilling than might have be expected considering what week immediately before christmas have be like picture by miss cole who have greatly dropped out of society lately owing to odd way called adam be certainly mr hopkins though one must have guessed have appeared for sale in window of dealer in picture curio have be withdrawn from public view at miss mapp personal intercession revelation of whom unlikely a sounded picture represented unchivalrous dealer have told artist history of withdrawal have come to miss mapp ear among many other thing quaint irene have imitated scene of intercession with such piercing fidelity that servant lucy eve have nearly died of laughing then there have be clandestine bridge at mr wyse house on three consecutive day on none of occasion be miss mapp asked to continue instruction have professed perfectly willing to give to contessa contessa in fact there seemed to be doubt about have declared that must sooner not play bridge at than play with miss mapp because effort of not laughing must put un warrantable strain on muscle prevented from doing so then contessa have gone to tea quite alone with major benjy though shrill senseless monologue be clearly audible in street a miss mapp went by to post letter again major dominic have stoutly denied that be in notion that contessa be haranguing by in drawing room be too ridiculous to be entertained for moment diva dyed dress have turned out so well that miss mapp gnashed teeth at thought that have not have hers dyed instead with green chiffon round neck even diva looked quite distinguished for diva then quite suddenly angel of peace have descended on distracted garden room for poppits contessa mr wyse went away to spend christmas new year with wy of whitchurch be probable that contessa must then continue round of visit with coroneted luggage leave for italy again without revisiting tilling have behaved a if be case for taking advantage of fine afternoon have borrowed royce whirled round town on series of call leaving ppc card everywhere saying only so miss mapp gathered from withers mistress not in so sorry have driven away before withers must get out information that mistress be very much in for have bad cold there be ppc card wy with future connection be going to whitchurch after few hour of rage against have be going on without revenge being now possible of reaction after excitement of different reaction set in odd unlikely a must have appeared month two earlier when tilling be seething with duel be fact that be possible to have too much excitement ever since contessa have arrived have be like active volcano planted down among dangerously inflammable element removal of be really matter of relief miss mapp felt that must be dealing again with material whose property knew since doubt strain of susan marriage must soon follow be merciful dispensation that removal of volcano granted tilling short restorative pause young couple must be back before long with susan approaching elevation certainly going to head making talk in manner wholly intolerable about grandeur of wy of whitchurch be boon to be allowed to recuperate for little before settling to work afresh to combat susan pretension there be fear of being dull for plenty of thing have be going on in tilling before contessa flared on high street plenty of thing must continue to go on after have taken explosion elsewhere by time that second lesson be being read sun have shifted from miss mapp face enabled to see how ghastly dear evie looked when focussed under blue robe of jonah who be climbing out of whale have have disappointment to contend with for contessa have never really grasped at who be sometimes mistook for irene sometimes did not seem to see never have appeared fully to identify a mr bartlett wee wifey then dear evie be very insignificant even when squeaked loudest best friend among whom be miss mapp must not deny that have be wilted by non recognition must recover again now that be left to sermon contained many repetition quantity of split infinitive padre have once openly stated that shakespeare be good enough for shakespeare be guilty of many split infinitive on occasion there have nearly be breach between mistress mapp for mistress mapp have said then be not shakespeare dear padre must find nothing better to reply than hoot there be nothing more of interest about sermon at end of service miss mapp lingered in church looking at lovely decoration of holly laurel for be so largely responsible until instinct assured that everybody else have shaken hand be wondering what to say next about christmas then just then hurried out be there came like late honoured guest poor diva diva darling said merry christmas evie padre padre dear thank for sermon major benjy merry christmas major benjy what small company be not le christmassy mr wyse susan isabel oh captain puffin not quite well again major benjy tell about dreadful fit of dizziness so hard to understand beautifully succeeded in detaching major from rest with peace have descended on tilling have forgiven for having be made fool of by contessa be anxious about friend puffin said not at up to mark most depressed told have business to be depressed be selfish to be depressed said if be depressed must be dreary world miss elizabeth be sent for doctor be to have have round of golf with puffin afternoon doe feel up to must have done much more good than host of doctor oh wish must play golf not disappoint of round major benjy said major benjy seemed rather to recoil from thought did not profess at rate sympathetic regret be going to have have christmas dinner together to night said spend jolly evening afterwards be sure quiet be best thing for captain puffin with dizziness said miss mapp firmly sudden audacity seized here be major feeling lonely a regard christmas evening here be delighted that must not spend jollily with captain puffin there be plenty of plum pudding come have dinner with said be alone too shook head very kind of be sure miss elizabeth said think will hold in readiness to go across to poor old puffin if feel up to feel lost without friend puffin must have jolly evening major benjy said so bad for little soup good night rest be best thing perhaps must like to go in read to will gladly tell so from if find doe want anybody not even well there be slice of plum pudding at neighbour warm welcome stood on step of house in summer be so crowded with sketcher must have kissed hand to have not diva be following close behind for even on christmas day poor diva be capable of finding something ill natured to say about most tender womanly action miss mapp let into house with only little wave of hand somehow idea that major benjy be feeling lonely missing quarrelsome society of debauched friend be not entirely unpleasing to be odd that there must be anybody who missed captain puffin who must not sooner play golf alone if be possible than with spend evening alone rather than with companionship if captain puffin have to be missed must certainly have chosen major benjy to be person who missed without wishing captain puffin unpleasant experience must have borne with equanimity news of settled melancholia permanent dizziness for major benjy with bright robustness be not sort of man to prove willing comrade to chronically dizzy melancholic friend must be right that must be so men in prime of life be not meant for be meant to be victim of designing woman even though wy of whitchurch be saved from by most opportune departure in spite of readiness to be interrupted at moment miss mapp spent solitary evening have pulled cracker with withers severely jarred tooth over threepenny piece in plum pudding there have be no other event once twice in order to see what night be like have gone to window of garden room be aware that there be light in major benjy house when half past ten struck have despaired of company gone to bed little carol singing in street gave christmas feeling hoped that singer got nice supper somewhere miss mapp did not feel a genial a usual when came down to breakfast next day omitted to say good morning to rainbow of piggy have run short of wool for knitting boxing day appeared to very ill advised institution must have imagined thought miss mapp a began cracking egg that tradespeople have have enough relaxation on christmas day especially when a on occasion be immediately preceded by sunday must have be better for getting to work again never relaxed effort for single day in year why overpowering knocking on front door caused to stop cracking egg that imperious summons be succeeded by moment of silence then began again heard hurried step of withers across hall almost before must have be supposed to reach front door diva burst into room dead said in soup captain puffin ca wait whirled out again front door banged miss mapp ate egg in three mouthful have marmalade at putting on prince of wale cloak tripped down into high street though shop be shut evie be there with market basket eagerly listening to what mr brace doctor wife be communicating though mr brace be not strictly speaking in society miss mapp waived social distinction pressed hand with mournful smile be too terribly true asked mr brace did not take smallest notice of dropping voice spoke to evie in tone so low that miss mapp must not catch single syllable except word soup seemed to imply diva have got hold of correct news at last evie gave shrill little scream at concluding word be a mr brace hurried away miss mapp firmly cornered evie heard what have happened captain puffin have gone up to bed last night not feeling well without having dinner have told mr gashly to make soup must not want anything else parlour maid have brought to have soon afterwards opened door to major flint who learning that friend have gone to bed went away called master in morning found sitting still dressed with face in soup have poured out into deep soup

die of stroke said evie in strangled whisper be drowned drowned dear said miss mapp yes lung be full of ox tail oh dear stroke first fell forward with face in soup plate got nose mouth quite covered with soup be drowned on dry land in bedroom too terrible what danger be in gave loud squeak escaped to tell husband diva have finished calling on everybody approached rapidly must have died of stroke
