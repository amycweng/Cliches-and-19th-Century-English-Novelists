little tremble of voice that be for to choose whether must part with portrait according to formula have already employed in discussing matter with craddock on second repetition have gained reality in mind joyce with sweet indulgence for concerned father did justice of recognizing to tissue of imagination be of solid quality somehow prospective loss of picture too did not weigh heavily with for be conscious of sunlight of inward happiness must not be clouded by such event have idea from whence sprang seemed to be connected with particular happening be like one of hour of childhood remember life when be intensely utterly happy for definite reason never too have seen father more alive alert went so far a to drink nearly whole glass of bottle of champagne have opened for guest to wish

gathering dusk even song of bird be over bat wheeled in darkening air moth hovered over drowsy fragrance of flower bed from somewhere not far away sounded tinkle of guitar accompanying boyish tenor joyce without thought found wondering whether be voice of charles of unknown surname anonymous fashioner of omelette tune be tawdry enough number from musical comedy though performer have particular skill of finger throat effect be young fresh not in discord with midsummer stillness something of same impression be made on arthur craddock also who listened with indulgent smile on big face gleamed

be even now just rising in east charioteer over star scattered field of heaven seemed dressed for part a mistress of moon in white with riband of silver in bright hair what of said lightly men cease to think of even before be middle aged suddenly struck craddock that more heaven sent opportunity for carrying out second of purpose have brought down here must possibly be desired be in luck to day too business of portrait have be carried through so smoothly so easily immediately became aware that be not in vulgar parlance quite up to needed support needed father consent above all needed imperative call hunger of soul clearly too word did not refer however remotely to herself felt that be spoken quite impersonally immediately changed subject have to thank said for trying to dissuade father from selling portrait told have suggested that must not be kind of caressed side of face with usual gratifying result found mind be made up said though in accordance with request suggested must not sell always command miss joyce will always fly on quest be aware that look particularly like knight errant there be motor car railway train nowadays transport more swiftly le hazardously than

melody be new to joyce though might not have great skill in singing have crisp enunciation delicious old word be clearly audible see chariot at hand here of love wherein lady rideth louder more distinct moment a canoe drifted closer came beautiful lyric singer be not using more than voice a distance between canoe audience diminished light boyish tenor be sufficiently resonant to set windless air quiver just a canoe emerged into blaze of moonlight opposite came final stave white shirted singer sang from full open throat have smelt o ' bud o ' briar nard in fire have tasted bag of bee o so white o so soft o so sweet be silence of night shut down like lid of jewel box then after little while came drip of paddle canoe grew small dim in distance down stream jolly boy again said joyce arthur craddock heaved long sigh horribly conscious of year rich joyce heard creak of shirt front that young man have diplomatic gift said be clear that intended to serenade chose far side of river so a to make seem that have intention of kind be reasonable supposition that if serenading be object certainly be might be supposed not to see standing here so serenaded with open throat if tried to do same sorely tempts must only convince have not open throat sore one nobody have ever heard sing not even when be a young a white shirted youth in canoe will paddle back to tent before long unless stay here visible in moonlight dream steadily about till morning joyce laughed oh what nonsense mr craddock said knowing in very secret place of girl heart that be not nonsense at boat with guitar singer go by night often night ca all be serenading can not imagine why not mormonism of serenading young men be not illegal must join miss joyce if must sing if did not think that canadian canoe in embarked must instantly sink philip wroughton in addition to glass of champagne have drunk at dinner permitted further indulgence of sitting up for nearly hour beyond usual bedtime to talk to guest read more

winter be likely to meet more young men than have ever come across in life before must not imagine one who must suit a if be own marriage be in contemplation better than craddock philip found quiet deferential agreeable since be certainly necessary that joyce husband if be permitted to marry must be with good deal be favourable point detested young men with high spirit loud laugh automatic digestion did not for moment intend to have one about house furthermore craddock be certainly very well off philip must have have fit if have known that picture be in act so to speak of enriching more be clearly desirable to have wealth about house possibly one more eligible might discover philip have little difficulty in convincing that must be failing in duty towards daughter if did not let craddock know that attention to joyce be favourably regarded by father if meditation be stripped of fabric of unreality until truth in bare austerity be laid open must be confessed that planned joyce possible marriage with single eye for own comfort game of bezique succeeded craddock stroll with joyce cigarette with whisky soda consoled for withdrawal of lady have positively to go up to town again to morrow said philip can not by mean persuade to stay night in modesty have idea what refreshment be to in retirement to get whiff of air from busy bustling world yes may say ' for dear little joyce

narrow limit of shelter brother reggie be lying on back still fast asleep with little parted plume of tumbled hair falling over forehead bare brown arm shoulder outside sheet in be loosely wrapped late last night after have got back from moonlit drift down river reggie who to do justice have done paddling so a to leave charles free to serenade propriety of one dip in pool below weir before bed have come back into boat dripping refreshed glistening without further formality of drying have curled up gone to sleep with mocking reference to lady of punt picture of taking header into pool now on point of completion leaned against tent side couple of bag gaping open vomiting clothes brush box of provision lid of did duty for table completed furniture of tent charles got up quietly so a not to disturb sleeper went out into clean dewy morning thicket behind encampment be chirrup with earliest bird music of day high up in zenith few wisp of cloud have caught sun not yet risen on earth have turned rosy with dawn spouting of weir made bass for staccato treble of bird otherwise stillness of night be not yet broken little ripple lapped at side of canadian canoe drawn half out of water onto bank blue with forget not tangle of briar rose with cataract of pink folded petal hung motionless over water then with sudden shout of awakened colour first long level ray of sun sped across meadow with sigh of wind of dawn world awoke morning light be what charles needed for picture not le did need brother for painting of braced shoulder muscle of arm a pointed above head for imminent plunge sun dappled shade from tree bounded meadow just beside weir fell onto naked body making here splash of brilliant light here green stain of sunlight filtering through translucent leaf while face side

of twinkling dazzling light got picture out of tent set on easel put kettle of water on spirit lamp be still far too early to have breakfast cup of tea brought presently to reggie bedside might tend to make unresentful of being awakened when charles found must get on further without so when be ready charles rattled sugar in tin loud enough to wake not one only seven sleeper reggie sat up with

absolute adonis said charles humbly oh reggie stand exactly like that a long a possibly can be exactly right work went on in silence after for modelling of muscle flesh below checker of light shade reflection be utterly absorbing to artist have tried way of solving subtle complicated problem once have put in curve shadow of tense muscle first painted diaper of sun shade on top of that made skin thick muddy in texture once have mapped sunlight surface shadow first overlaid with indicated muscle seemed to turn model inside out then only yesterday have seen that whole thing must be painted in together laid on in broad brushfuls of thin paint so that luminousness solidity must be preserved method be proving excitingly satisfactory often during last week have almost despaired of accomplishing have set to do stronger than despair be absolute determination to record what saw not only what knew to be there be impossible for brother to hold tiring pose for more than couple of minute often be difficult to get resumption accurately morning reggie seemed to fall rather stretch into correct position without effort charles on side knew that to day have clear seeing eye clever co ordinating hand for hour of pose rest reggie stood there then charles stepped few yard away from canvas stood moment biting end of brush frowning a looked from model to picture back again then frown cleared thanks most awfully reggie said be done good bad be done reggie gave great shout disappeared altogether in pool charles made breakfast ready according to agreement two sat for while

reinforced while be possible for to continue working must be cowardly surrender to give up tending ripening fruit of year in paris let tree wither turn brush so to speak into pen palette into office stool besides have within lying secret shy vitally alive unalterable conviction of true artist that work be ordained to be art that where heart be there must sufficient treasure be found also be hard for even with endorsing sincerity of mother encouragement to continue being drone of hive so far a actual earning be concerned have demanded utmost have of faith in love for art to continue working with ecstasy of toil that art demand at education needed not to grudge day week spent in work a profitless from earning point of view a believed to be profitable in own artistic equipment drawing have always be weak point hour after interminable hour from cast from skeleton property saved from lavish paris day must patiently copy framework of bone patiently clothe in appropriate muscle sinew a must always happen long week of work went by without progress a noticed by until once once again found standing on firm ground instead of floundering through bog quick sand endlessly engulfed charcoal hour knew certain haltings uncertainty of line troubled no longer made pause for self congratulation continued with mingling of fire unremitting patience be characteristic of true inspired learner colour whole complex conception of value go to make up single picture instead of collection however well rendered of different object be naturally have by instinct that embracing vision take in subject a whole heat of morning disposed to quiescence two boy with spice of meadow sweet loosestrife round coolness of running water drowsily booming to temper growing swelter of day talked lazily desultorily concerned with thing for long time after breakfast be over be vividly concerned with more to opening pageant of life be more engrossing than tragedy of past being young looked forward where middle aged must have dwelt with present old have mumbled starved with past to be dawn promise of day be insistent thing there be temptation to dwell in ruin conjure back night before long itch for activity in spite of resolve of lazy morning possessed reggie fervidly washed up used crockery of breakfast while charles went up few yard of path lay between tent side of weir to behold again picture have left standing on easel in heart knew be finished in eagerness of youth almost looked forward to further brushful of inspiration must not touch what knew be good hoped only to find something must be touched with advantage turned sharp corner where willow screened weir picture be planted within dozen yard of between picture be planted big white faced man who be regarding so intently that did not hear swish of parted willow be not till charles be at elbow that craddock turned saw put into manner deference reserved for duchess talent have come to private view said without being asked be very impertinent of really be second visit have first private view yesterday when looked at picture from punt in happened to be have just couple of glimpse at work before have be very fortunate in inspiration since then muse paid good visit morning charles said nothing eye questioned intruder giving tentative welcome before pause be at prolonged tentative welcome have be changed into wondering tremulous expectancy be there fairy still by thames side be fat white man to prove fairy have painted admirable picture continued possible fairy handling of most difficult part of of course know mean light shadow on delightful figure be masterly of course there be fault plenty of can see can draw can paint craddock saw charles lip quiver heard that cost effort to command voice not really stammered unless be much mistaken have be business of life to seek out who can see draw paint now know name assuredly have never seen work before since be business also to know name work of young men who can paint imagine that have artistic debut so to speak still in front of will be exceedingly grateful to if will sell picture straight away here now if wo let have for fifty pound will have to offer sixty charles looked vaguely round first at craddock then at picture then at spouting weir almost expecting to see melt a be manner of dream into other farrago a fantastical a dissolve altogether into waking reality do really mean will give fifty pound for asked will give sixty touch again take word for that be finished did know that already oh yes said boy finished hour ago came back to make sure well then when leave encampment here will please send to at address be to say if be to have privilege of purchasing repetition gave reality to interview people in dream be not so persistent charles gave little joyous laugh a craddock took card out of pocket gave to be thinking of exhibiting asked be meaning to have try with at autumn exhibition of 'artists etcher said charles have objection to provided will let have little talk with first put certain proposal before looked at picture again saw more surely than ever admirable quality have unity be picture of boy just about to plunge into sunlit pool not boy pool sunlight mere pictorial map painted enumeration of object be tingling with freshness vitality rapture of early achievement artist however skilled if have outgrown youthful enthusiasm must have done like though must easily have produced work more technically faultless eagerness though wonderfully controlled burned in joy of life shouted from when looked from to tall shy boy whose grey eye have seen that whose long finger have handled brush recorded felt sure must not go far wrong in own interest in making proposal to must seem to fantastical in encouraging generosity indeed felt that there be element of chance in matter for there must be doubt about young man temperament lie at bottom of artistic achievement in case be so clearly to be read in eager eye sensitive mouth naturally have tremendous lot to learn temperament so full of ardent life romantic perception a have inspired idyll of youth sunshine outpouring water must never rest from realization of dream vision looked at watch found have still hour before need to go to station can give few minute of time now said of course will just tell brother that ca come with at once be going on river do tell to come back for in hour be suppose on header board charles went quickly down little path to tent o reggie said fat white man have come bought picture absolutely bought be real be just beginning to believe reggie stared for moment then for have poor opinion of brother business capacity how much demanded sixty pound not shilling pound want to talk to now so come back for in hour say can paint somehow think know bless fat face said reggie will let have at own price anything for model think model deserves something will get said charles reggie caught hold of brother by shoulder danced round in three wild capering circle arthur craddock have sat down on step led to header board waiting for charles return have turned picture round so that saw in le perplexing light found that have need to reconsider previous conclusion about be brimful of lusty talent there seemed to to be hint of something more transcendent than talent there be really original note in have style of own not style of others though felt sure that artist must have studied at bonnart in paris there be something about drawing of have never be taught in admirable atelier artist be so young there be telling at what might not arrive craddock have true reverence for genius suspected genius here also have very keen appreciation of advantageous financial transaction expected might be gratified before long for reason awaited charles return with impatience be prepared to make proposal to at once if necessary felt must prefer to see more of work first charles did not tax patience long came running back let begin at beginning like catechism said craddock what be name charles lathom mine be arthur craddock so here be craddock be capable of considerable charm of manner disarming frankness already charles felt disposed to like trust work such a have seen of went on interest immensely also make feel hundred year old be not in pleasant bear grudge for mean pointed at picture excuse effect now dear lathom be kind answer few question studied with bonnart did not yes for two year only that used time well who taught drawing charles looked at with charmingly youthful modesty candour nobody said must draw at when left bonnart of course mean can draw now worked very hard by for last year felt have to learn drawing for at least bonnart must teach have copied much copy in national gallery try to copy english master there be better practice will do well to keep up provided do plenty of original work too of course ca help doing must like to see of copy unless have sold charles laughed not worse luck said indeed have only done bit of picture see be warming to confession artist within bubbled irrepressibly in presence of man who seemed to understand so well to invite confidence see did care so much about copying entire picture said be reynolds grouping be that fearfully conceited that wanted to learn to understand drawing ear nose hand find can manage composition of picture in way seems to more le right can see value drawing be what wanted to get have improved be perfectly rotten year ago further idea lit lamp in craddock quick brain will show of study said must care to copy reynolds feel sure can get good commission if copy be anything like a good a original work do tell anything more about that feel disposed to charles brushed hair back off forehead craddock manner be so supremely successful with that did not know that be manner at felt must tell anything trusted completely studied with bonnart for two year said then there came crash father died be left extremely poor in fact be left penniless perhaps remember mother earns money so doe reggie brother for last year see be whom have be supporting wanted to go on working not mind about so worked on have be very industrious think till now till minute have earned more than pound two why charles have to pause moment reality significance of what be happening almost overwhelmed sixty pound meant tremendous lot to meaning of that of be symbol meant so infinitely more be why must hardly believe at first that wanted to buy picture said seemed too big thing to happen be not only fact of sixty pound be belief that picture be worth can paint if nobody ever wanted to buy saw merit in what did believe must help going on working be sitting on ground just below step craddock occupied felt kind hand on shoulder a if to calm fortify voice knew be rather unsteady so guessed said craddock be just a pleasant to find that somebody doe believe in assure that be only first of many who will now about arrangement will give ten pound at once to show be in earnest about buying picture o good lord interrupted charles must prefer will send balance from town now will come up there to morrow show what call bit of thing show day after to morrow will say ten in morning must give address of studio will come there bring up picture with get boy from village to look after tent belonging for night two if prefer to room very likely will want to occupy again reynolds of spoke be in house near craddock got up pulled out russia leather pocketbook here be earnest money said studio address thanks charles heart be so full that seemed to choke brain power of utterance first ineffable moment of recognition dear even to most self reliant of artist have come to until then have not known how nearly have despaired of advent held out hand smiled shook head be use trying to thank said for there be word be use expect know a have be said arthur craddock have profound reverence for talent quite apart from keen pleasure in advantageous bargain answer dictated by be quite sincere thanks must pas from to said people like who be unable to create find reward in being able to appreciate work of like pray think of a patron be customer hope may prove to that be good one ten o'clock then day after to morrow craddock have invaluable mental gift of attending with thoroughness hermetically sealed from other distraction to business on hand did let mind dribble force into other channel when wanted whole of to gush from one nozzle in interview with charles have summoned whole energy though expression of be very quiet to winning boy confidence making appear a discerning generous appreciator must have seemed to very poor policy to obtain picture a must no doubt have done for quarter of price have offered for while on other hand be unnecessary to offer twice price must willingly have done since must make impression be needful for future scheme at lower figure economy be excellent thing there be mistake more gross than to economize at wrong time be satisfied a to now dismissed subject of charles picture quite completely turned whole thought elsewhere there be several direction in might profitably have turned turned to one in possible profit be remote that morning before made visit to charles craddock have proposed to joyce who have refused have not taken did not now take refusal a final told so have considerably surprised knew well how restricted life led at home how subjected be to father peevish caprice complaint how cut off be from general diversion of life added to father assurance that pleased be sufficient to make frankly astonished at rejection of refusal to walk through door held open for provided so easy escape from disability have put before though not pompously advantage have mentioned that father endorsed application have not omitted to lay stress on devotion to have ascertained that there be rival in field of maidenly preference be true that be not in love with acute man though be in concerned head never entered into mind even now a drove to station thought intently about subject that omission must have have anything to do with ill success be quite doubtful whether even if have be desperately in love with joyce must conceivably have given different answer a be omission be so fatal to instinct that there must not be moment struggle debate for be not even sorry for for clearly there be nothing real to be sorry for otherwise must have sincerely regretted inability to accept for in spite of certain physical distaste felt for liked admired quickness cleverness have father told that craddock be going to live with must have hailed with genuine welcome quite apart from feeling towards there be insuperable barrier of want of feeling towards of barrier of possibility of knowing with cleverness have idea to joyce whole matter be abundantly evident knew did not even love love for be only thing must have made acceptance of ever so faintly possible without that other reason for marrying be fly blown debate balancing be conceivable scale dinted beam with unchecked kick thought over ill success guessed without getting within mile of truth at primary reason for a drove through white sunshine from interview with astounded grateful charles almost immediately became aware that in last hour feeling for joyce have undergone curious intensification inspired a have be life by desire be entirely material have be used by aid of clever brain to compass posse often of course have not be able for mere wanting to obtain coveted object hitherto have almost invariably happened that temporary check stirred up to such further effort a be necessary wish denied hitherto have connoted wish intensified since there be great deal of truth latent in commonplace to want thing enough always earns appropriate reward of desire have not often fainted failed before reaching goal even now though up till now desire for joyce have be scarcely more than wish seemed to different from other wish be becoming desire a simple primal a hunger for food sleep internal need dictated be disturbing since have other immediate work on hand turned attention to typewritten manuscript of have read part last night proposed to finish in train craddock a have be said have mind profoundly critical appreciative have also quite distinct segregate astonishing flair for perceiving what public must appreciate often bought picture from artistic point of view thought frankly contemptible because saw sign so subtle that be instinctively perceived rather than reasoned that public be going to see something in old outworn mode in new abominable trickery then transferred purchase to thistleton gallery gladly parted with on advantageous term flair of be by mean confined to mere pictorial representation be always glad to read novel play in manuscript with view to purchasing disposing of acquired right to publisher playwright living a publicly did in centre of thing assiduous diner out frequenter of fashionable stair case yet have quiet secret life of own a distinct from other a be life of inhabitant in adjoining house whose circle of friend be a diverse a bishop from ballet dancer preferred to deal in work of men who be young unknown at present have not be able to get producer for possible masterpiece be thus often able by liberal offer to secure option of purchase at specified figure over output of next few year often to sick heartedness of deferred hope such prospect seemed dictated by princely liberality be gladly accepted score of such play read found wanting now then came across something with judicious handling backed by undoubted influence have with public through press felt sure must waft into desirable haven only morning by weir side have found gem of very pure ray believed to be easily obtainable now a read manuscript in train fancied that jewel box need not be locked up again yet public thought to be tired of problem drama liked thinking to be peptonized for presented in soft digestible form just at present too have use for high romance on one hand on other subtle situation delicate unravellings wanted to be shown sort of thing that with little laughter tear might suitably happen to perfectly commonplace undistinguished though not indistinguishable person in comedy of suburban villadom with curate stockbroker churchwarden behaving naturally about a humorously a might be expected to behave without straining felt sure that held in hand potential success on large scale author be young desperately poor have already have play on board at first night of arthur craddock have be present have scored a complete failure a must possibly have be desired to produce suitable humility in young man craddock who always thought for instead of accepting opinion of others have seen what good writing there be in how curiously deft be handling of material knew that failure be largely due to choice of subject though ten year ago must probably have be welcomed a vigorously a be now condemned be excellent play of ten year ago perhaps ten year to come with lurid story too difficult for indolent theatre goer of particular year to grasp climax of inextricable misery have therefore immediately written to frank armstrong author at ensuing interview told what in opinion be line on to build popular success then guessing rather knowing that armstrong must have attempted drama many time before have produced so mature piece of work a unfortunate lane without turning said daresay have something in desk at home rather like what have be sketching to have very likely failed to get produced before now send to let read be play easter egg craddock finished a train slowed down into paddington station must not be described a so fine play a have achieved so complete failure have that other lacked in popular effective sentiment even to man of craddock experience in want of discernment in theatrical manager be quite astounding that have ever be refused must guess why have be fate for there be star part in there be character overwhelmingly conspicuous who must dominate whole play turn into one man show success of must depend on level competent acting without limelight slow music be domestic drama without villain hero dominating personality when again read over list of acting manager to whom frank armstrong have submitted saw how absurd be to suppose tranby akroyd miss loughton must ever have considered production saw also how company of perfectly unknown artist must admirably present with great saving of salary needed moderate talent evenly distributed one part mishandled must wreck a surely a must ranting actor manager who tried to force dominant personality into play only succeeded in upsetting whole careful balance of even a craddock drove back to sumptuous airless flat in berkeley square jotted down half dozen name of who filled minor part in star play quite excellently wanted without star then quite suddenly mind usually so obedient bolted proceeded at top speed in quite direction without intention found wondering what joyce be doing whether must have told father about proposal confided in astutest of grandmother whether be in punt with panting dog still troubled with undoubted indisposition of buz who have not be at well so have told last day two life seemed to deplorable waste of heavenly maidenhood partly owing to selfish father partly now at least because have not consented to waste no longer youth lasted so short time possessor so often squandered on thing profited not ailing dog for instance swan nest among reed then caught sight of own large face in mirror of motor felt terribly old too have squandered youth in amassing of knowledge in must have be acquired when leap of blood thrilled le imperatively in passion devoted to passionless thing in mere acquisition of wealth in formation of unerring taste acumen knew that blood have tuned to brisker more virile pulse since joyce have shaken head smiled be little troubled be over indisposition of buz that be troubled then arriving at flat became own man again cordially telephoned to frank armstrong to have lunch with chapter iii hour later frank armstrong be sitting opposite craddock eating lunch with steadfast business like air of man who be not only hungry now knew from long experience that be prudent to eat whenever edible must be have for nothing minute before craddock have suggested slice of cold meat to give solidity to very light repast be so suitable to heat of day since then armstrong have be consuming ham firm piece of bread without pause speech nobody be le greedy than only for year of life have be among habitually hungry in appearance be rugged potentially fierce great shock of black hair crowned forehead projected like pent house over deep set angry eye might be guessed that be person easy awkward to quarrel with for expression be suspicious resentful a of wild beast accustomed to ill usage whom ill usage have altogether failed in taming though ugliness of expression be certainly predominant characteristic of strong distrustful face le casual observer might easily form conclusion that there be better thing below certain eagerness certain patience certain sensibility looked up at craddock after while with queer crooked smile on large mouth not without charm will now cease being pig said when one be really hungry one ca think about anything else be more hoggish really than longing for sleep if have slept for night for water when one be thirsty have breakfast morning now what have got to talk to about craddock be strong believer in emollient effect of food have determined to talk business till client be at ease in chair with tobacco quiescent influence ah breakfast said find work best before eat frank armstrong laughed said work best after large meal did not have breakfast because must have be highly inconvenient to pay for there be such people know have often be one of arthur craddock found peremptory young savage slightly alarming for demanded that social intercourse must be conducted in sort of atmosphere of politeness of manner just a in landscape painting have to have atmosphere else effect be of cast iron so in dealing with fellow men there must be such thing a edge particularly raw one thought have seldom seen anybody so unatmospheric dear fellow said do mean that have be actually in want of money to pay for food why did not tell knew what interest took in work frank looked at quite unatmospherically why must having breakfast matter to said wanted work if thought good if not be more to than rest of brute who go without breakfast now about play at least suppose asked to lunch in order to talk about breakfast quite expect to tell be twaddle indeed know be doe by chance seem to remunerative twaddle craddock really suffered in want of atmosphere gasped mentally speaking like unaccustomed aeronaut in rarefied air ah ca agree with that be twaddle said plot doubt be slender dialogue be excellent show considerable precision fineness of line in character drawing what character said candid author curate housemaid churchwarden lord what people without shred of life force in answered description of what theatre goer liked wrote last year in reaction after 'lane without turning ' ah be that said craddock puzzled to know how boy like be boy dear fellow must possibly write anything so bitter hopeless a something so quietly genial a 'easter egg easily enough wrote one be a found out nobody liked 'easter egg be merely observation of quantity of blameless chattering people lived in surbiton when be quite boy be rather like that there be teaparties sewing society to relieve distress among poor packet of cross over used to be sent to cancer hospital let get back to subject remunerative not without doubt remunerative agreed craddock again gasping have given three of leading actor opportunity of remunerating wo touch be soul above remuneration do only want topping high art arthur craddock did not see way to telling armstrong that have sent play to exactly manager who must be quite certain to refuse because be information have excellent reason if be to conclude advantageous bargain for keeping to nevertheless be right about play said tranby akroyd be wrong frank shrugged shoulder so tell observed yes be willing to back opinion will here now buy play from pay for at figure will not consider ungenerous considering be pure speculation on part there be certain condition frank armstrong pulled chair up closer to table put elbow on craddock must see that finger be trembling name condition if will be so good said perhaps must also tell more about not ungenerous figure craddock held up white plump hand of deprecation positively must not get on without manner life little insincerity a young man seemed to have none of have to supply sufficient for two be glad to observe signal of nervousness on armstrong part argued well for acceptance of bargain be so direct dear fellow said demand 'yes 'no ' like cross examining counsel must permit to explain situation take great interest in work in be willing to run considerable risk in order to give work chance of being fairly judged appreciated now there be nothing more difficult to gauge than liking of public while tell that play will be without doubt remunerative may be hopelessly in error see in certain quality think will attract though in previous play frankly think finer piece of work than public be merely repelled here armstrong elbow gave jerk be quite involuntary will come to point said of course be very gratifying can talk about play merit afterwards how much do offer for 'easter egg on what condition craddock drummed with plump finger on table looking across at strong rough face opposite must see suspense anxiety very clearly written there felt rather nasty pleasure in be like poking up fierce animal with stick where there be bar between prevent retaliating violence perhaps must be kinder to put out of suspense for armstrong wanted to know more than have wanted lunch even offer l down for right of play said on condition that let have three more of play within next three year at same price must choose to buy armstrong did not take eye off did stringency of gaze relax did say l asked in odd squeaky little voice did then tension relaxed young man got up rubbed back of hand across eye if be asleep said hope sha wake for long time be deuced pleasant quite know what five hundred pound mean ca see to end of thought perhaps be going to offer l must certainly have accepted why did be good opportunity for craddock because happen to be sweater said because like honest man prefer paying fair price for good work armstrong gave great shout of laughter because there be much difference to between fifty pound five hundred said paused beg pardon said have business to say that understand offer by way of course accept craddock have tried to look hurt when rather ruthless suggestion a to reason for generosity be made did not feel within that attempt be very successful be glad to look benign again when frank armstrong apologised tremulousness of hand have ceased looked straight at benefactor with distrustful gaze then once more crooked rather charming smile came on mouth personally be sure rather detest said so suppose seems to worth while financially to run risk with money so though be bewildered tell frankly with prospect of five hundred pound be not grateful to wish be of course if 'easter egg make anything of hit will do pretty well will be popular playwright broke off moment pushed back hair ah see be where come in said have option to buy three more play by popular playwright at same price again if of three new one make success wo do very badly craddock went on whisker hunt for moment if 'easter egg ' be put on fails a other play did observed will not be considerably out of pocket failure must not encourage to exercise option over future work of yours however let be time who asks to come to point do accept offer not may mention that will not renew can not waste time over arrangement come to nothing armstrong nodded at with comparative friendliness good lord yes accept said told must have accepted l craddock got up then if have finished lunch might draw up agreement over cigarette certainly daresay will let have cigar too when have signed have to do will give cheque straight off will have banking account suppose sha be hungry again for ever a far a can see by george ought to be grateful to think sort of experience have be through give fellow much practice in gratitude gratitude be acquired virtue be prosperous who mainly acquire craddock patted on shoulder dear fellow may leave cynicism of lane have turning behind said armstrong suddenly drew up shirt cuff showed long scar healed year ago ran nearly up to elbow be where father threw knife at once said be bad shot for threw at head be healed might think look healed bleeds inside though be savage young beast seemed that craddock have got hold of one who have be set in slippery place sloped hell ward craddock have known who have learned patience from sojournings in such resort have known others who have simply be broken by others again of possibly joyful attractive charles lathom be one who seemed to have taken colour from surroundings emerged with serenity sweetness undisturbed never yet have seen anyone who came out of dark place with mere anger resentment against suffering yet with strength quite unimpaired armstrong seemed to like that flame apparently have hardened annealed have suffered under lash of circumstance not stout heartedly with loss of spirit now when for first time saw daylight ahead be in wise grateful for dispersal of darkness did not hail sun melt to benignancy of beam came out iron remembering hunger of year have starved body soul without subduing for physically be hard muscular morally be cynical expecting from others little except such emotion a shared instinct of self defence stoical bearing of such blow a must not ward off be not in kind unselfish loving up till now have practically never come across such quality in others there be really reason why must believe in existence hitherto nobody a far a remembered have done good turn unless thereby reaped personal benefit indeed armstrong saw little reason why anybody must for world a have known be not run on line of altruistic philanthropy strong spoiled weak weak looked for opportunity of preying on weaker rich paid a little a must for service of poor be obviously course common sense indicated while poor worker combined so far a be possible to make rich pay more there be reason for side to act otherwise thus be puzzled to know why craddock have offered more than be necessary in order to get play from ensuing contract a matter of fact craddock have done so for exactly same reason a prompted to give charles lathom sixty pound for sketch wanted to earn sort of blind unreasoning gratitude from new client since client possessed of convenient spirit be far easier to manage to deal with have failed knew new client though looked forward to finding very remunerative indeed must not possibly be considered to be blind with gratitude after main point be that must sign contract embodied craddock proposal be perfectly willing to do craddock butler coming in with coffee witnessed transaction leaf from craddock cheque book completed appliance of refrigeration in way of electric fan

encouraging than symbol of worship mortality gas stove promised supper anyhow supper be symbol life not only be not extinct that demand to be maintained mr lathom turned to kettle from steam be beginning to spurt put saucepan on bar of top of range simultaneously motor car hooted outside appeared to draw up still throbbing at house then there came impatient roulade on bell moment after leap of active ascending foot on staircase be impossible to mistake tread nobody in house reggie came upstairs like charging brigade yet how must reggie have taken motor from paddington must scarcely be that charles be ill that there have be accident for then surely must have telegraphed did flying foot sound like bearer of ill news left gas stove went to head of stair not exactly expecting ill news

visit here have straw hat tilted back on skull on shelf by be cast of skinless man with flayed muscle three four reproduction from greek antique easel rough square table three four cane backed chair in various stage of disrepair completed furniture in one corner cupboard let into wall be masked by ragged curtain bulged suspiciously thither mr lathom housewife eye be led drew aside with contumelious finger horror be revealed have scarce believed that cupboard must contain so appalling catalogue of evidence to prove utter incapability of man to live when left to in way consistent with self respect tidiness cleanliness have not be to studio for month past to day must cheerfully have sworn that for week charles have never touched cupboard except to stow away in new disgraceful object crockery knife fork clean dirty be lodged there there be twisted empty tube have contained colour there be hat without brim jug without handle irregular shape done up in newspaper bottle of medium tin tack sheet of paper with embryonic sketch painting rag half used stick of charcoal remains of food remains of everything must have be cast into dust bin be withering face turned on charles must not have survived if mr craddock have seen in what pig sty choose to live charles said must have died of shame be little work will do morning in way of typewriting water duster scrubbing brush please charles twitched curtain over cupboard again something fell behind a did so mother groaned be little work will do in way of cleaning up mess said there be charwoman about who brush scrub make everything resplendent for crown per resplendency on word of honour will dust clean might help to dust sketch put out mother got to tidy up once wiped off complete oil sketch be still wet mr lathom looked round of course will said oh charles what squalor torn blind broken screen three chair of want reseating to think of reggie last night stuffing at restaurant with money where will sup to night asked charles bringing out pile of canvass at twenty three sidney street give duster dear what quantity of painting hour be sufficient to make charles private view presentable to display sketch finished unfinished round wainscot of wall then without pause put new canvas on easel bribed by promise not to spend more than five shilling on supper to night mr lathom consented to abandon own work for hour sit for put typewriter on table made rehearse be like instantaneous photograph said at least be what picture be going to be like oh do attend mother not look at skeleton reggie stuck there with straw hat on doe matter may dust afterwards now tinkle with typewriter then of sudden reggie come in here to right put hand on arm of chair get up saying 'gosh what surprise how nice doe poor mind take that in at be rather important mr lathom sat down in obedience to peremptory son clacked machine turned woodenly round with smile a wooden a gesture not at like said charles have set easel up be waiting with poised charcoal ca manage to get up a did when came in morning exercise imagination look surprised will try again be working hard with typewriter be that clear be thinking that there be debt of sixty pound to clear off that reggie be very ill then on sudden door open here to right reggie come in quite well bursting with health stack of sovereign do attend think of what tell to think of then get up say 'darling reggie ' will say 'one two three then do then stop just in position have told never mind about face charles took up charcoal again stood with hand poised one two three said got up second added into minute there be sound at except dry grating of charcoal on canvas otherwise austere stillness of actual creation of art filled room once again a on morning of yesterday charles knew hand be attuned to eye eye attuned to vision that lay behind rapidly unerringly bold stroke grated across canvas then ceased altogether beautiful woman said charles have got ca escape now then face have be grave frowning lit into smile mother darling said be going to make such queen of with shabby old dress eye of love now for treat may dust skeleton for ten minute then must give face again see see rummaged behind terrible curtain found palette couple of brush squirted onto worm cast of colour filled tin with turpentine be medium sized canvas have chosen about three foot six by three foot with big brushfuls of colour very thinly laid on splashed in dull neutrality of grey brown to frame figure making note rather than painting blot of black indicated typewriter then with greater care filled in black of dress smeared in white of apron wore with body colour took ten minute for bold brush then standing little back from half closed eye looked long time at to see whether value of background to figure figure to background be a meant to be did not want figure to jump out from place for even a rose to greet incomer with face of loving welcome left hand still hovered with finger outstretched over typewriter have to be felt that greeting over work must occupy again have not detached from for leaping forth of heart in shining eye smiling mouth a yet figure be little too near spectator little too far off from background while puzzled over solution struck little more emphasis given to chair arm of grasped gave what wanted belonged to chair anchored in place charles suddenly threw back head laughed oh jolly good exclaimed care if nobody else agrees with leave silly skeleton please get back to place may sit down turn face towards remember reggie be just coming in have thought be ill charles voice suddenly ceased stared at mother a obeyed instruction with eye a of inspired seer very slowly hand moved to brush have laid down very slowly quietly a if afraid of startling away vision saw mixed paint laid on first brushful in plane of colour bold firm defined between stroke paused long while actual application be work of second be in pause when stood with drooping mouth head thrust forward eye seemed a if burned way into beloved face that work be done to record what saw be far le effort than to see insight be what demanded fire effort imagination possessed have set to divine to show what motherhood meant for hour worked thus too absorbed for speech wise enough not to risk interruption then from mere fatigue of brain eye with sustained white heat effort felt power of vision slipping from laid palette down come look at said to mother face be roughly put in a yet spirit of face be there oh charles dear said be just how love reggie how did guess took face in hand kissed guess did guess said told face told charles be not to be induced to leave picture while daylight lasted wheeled round with face to wall before shut up studio for night be not sure whether wished craddock to see in present stage somehow seemed to private not for everybody until have be clothed so to speak in paint felt shy though at same time told be merely fantastical at exhibiting so crude confidence while be in two mind about next morning heard visitor footstep on bare creaky staircase outside last flight of step a knew well be mere trap to ignorant with darkness of angle corner set door wide to give light to visitor then just before craddock came in told be ridiculous in imagining that there must be privacy in portrait wheeled easel round so that stood just opposite door craddock large white gently perspiring emerged from stair with outstretched hand good morning dear fellow said be very well for art to sequester live alone four flight of break neck stair be really exaggerated precaution against intrusion however here be suddenly caught sight of portrait dropped charles hand without word stared at silent second grew into minute more than minute passed without sound hard commercial self seeking a craddock be have saving grace of true reverence for genius there be not smallest question in mind that be master work stood before there be need to ask who be tired beautiful woman for one son must have painted woman so have divined that unique inimitable love that woman ever felt even for husband lover only for who have be born of body soul be that tenderness love other that charles have seen for none son must have glowed in worn lovely face craddock be immensely touched have expected good deal from visit to charles studio have never dreamed of so noble simple triumph a unfinished portrait presented when at length turned to charles eye be moist spoke with simplicity be quite unusual to be very true beautiful said be fortunate to have mother to love like charles gave exultant laugh then have shown that asked shyness entirely vanishing before penetrating person where be point of being shy when man understood like indeed have said craddock have shown very tenderly very truly required son to show looked again at eager welcoming face on canvas from to face of boy beside asked impatiently what be mysterious feeling of perception that underlay transcended technique here be portrait with perhaps two day work only happened to be le than expended on even now have arrived at level to mere technique must never lift love inspiration that love gave caught up gave wing caused to soar yet how why there be hundred hundred of artist who a far a mere technique went must paint with same precision delicacy why must not of have put on brushful just so yet even in most famous of portrait of artist mother there be not such glow of motherhood then turned from abruptly have not come here merely to admire though hoped that must admire have come on business proposal must satisfy young man to whom be made began examining smaller canvas charles mother have displayed round room here be couple of study of thorley weir here dozen sketch of reggie prepared to take plunge with detail thereof raised arm bent knee toe of foot pressed heavily in act of springing there be copy of cast there be portrait numerous transcription of leg bone arm bone rib with muscle without muscle betokened same indomitable resolve to draw then there be copy bit of copy from masterpiece in national gallery dozen head of lady hamilton a bacchante in particular philip iv of spain quantity of philip iv head sometimes sometimes dozen of left eyebrow with eye beneath right hand finger of right hand thumb of right hand must have be put together like dry bone of ezekiel vision there must be great army of philip iv in none be there sign of impatience argus of eye be drawn for purpose till that purpose be achieved be evident that artist be prepared to go on copying eye until own be dim admirable also be determination to achieve result by same process a employed by master to get general effect be clearly not sufficient else there must not have be so copious repetition examination of quarter of delicate copy be sufficient for craddock purpose in looking at only doubt be whether be not mere waste of time to give youth more copying work to do study of picture so admirable a wroughton reynolds must hardly be waste of time for anybody also be not sure whether involuntary tribute to unfinished portrait have not be too strong did not wish charles to think of a one with world at foot see have got sense of importance of copying method said feel sure will be able to produce adequate copy of reynolds have in mind now will see why told to leave camp at thorley weir unbroken for picture in question be at house little lower down river mill house probably know lawn come down to water edge certainly charles knew involuntarily there sounded in brain song knew also see chariot at hand decidedly knew infantine caution possessed raised wrinkled eyebrow think do said be there big tree on lawn be there usually dog about yes charming young lady who look after now ca offer very much for work if l tempts at can go a far a must not recommend to do at if did not think must be good for what do say charles drew long breath say 'yes remarked let consider settled then will telegraph for exact size of picture can take canvas down must start to morrow if be ah talking of l here be specimen of l already owe advanced ten did not will take picture away with if may crisp crinkling note be counted out charles took up stood irresolute then by effort word came ca know said what have done for feel must tell note trembled rustled in hand have given hope life said think must have gone on much longer with others working earning not bringing penny back have done that have put on foot craddock felt for whisker in silence moment to do justice there be little struggle in mind a to whether must put proposal have come here to make do what better self self reverenced unfinished portrait prompted to do yet for year now boy have be toiling struggling unaided undiscovered none of who must have seen copying in national gallery have seen what eye of philip iv repeated finger thumb implied none have ever suspected fire indomitable patience of admirable sketch be just that who have recognised at once what charles already be might easily become must reap fruit of perspicuous vision offer be about to make must seem wildly generous too to beneficiary dear lathom said hope to put much more erect on foot have said anything of what came to say now let put whole proposal before paused moment be quite impossible for to continue in studio here said be painter of portrait what sitter will come up stair admirable portrait of mother will certainly be seen next year at big exhibition certainly people will enquire for artist be mere folly for to live here must be more accessible more civilised fine lady want to be painted by will survive will lace survive stair will sit on chair like for hour together look at torn blind know what will say quite sensibly will say that can afford nothing better can afford for will start in proper studio well furnished comfortable a must be why even dentist have comfortable chair for sitter waiting room with paper servant who open door again craddock paused for have caught sight of unfinished portrait again felt desperately mean pause be very short will start decently properly said will not charge penny want return can make that return by painting propose then that must promise to let have picture of yours year for next three year at price of l do understand in year time before can say to pointing to picture will take for year can say same next year can say same year after get studio appurtenance free also get hundred year for certain provided only go on painting a well a paint now will get three picture by at price honestly believe will be cheap in three year time tell that plainly think picture will fetch more than then craddock caressed side of face moment will also said have have pleasure privilege of helping young fellow like who believe have future in front of to get footing in arena where attention be paid to artistic work have certain command of press will assuredly be exercised on behalf have heard of struggling genius say have genius have great talent will have enabled to work without cramp constriction of poverty a paint now need not tell now what decide think over talk over with beautiful mother whom hope may see day be just business proposal on other hand if feel doubt a to answer if be going to tell to go to deuce for certain charles took two quick step towards accept said how gladly thankfully ca tell might guess think understand so well craddock laid hand on boy shoulder then there be little private bargain said tell mother that bathing boy of course will not talk about otherwise little agreement yours mine think will either of repent wo be who start repenting said charles joyously chapter iv charles be in camp again at little peninsula fringed with meadow sweet loosestrife below thorley weir scarcely hearing far le listening to low thunder diminished by long continuance of drought scarcely seeing far le looking at dusky crimson behind tree showed where sun have set probably unconscious self never resting observer recorder of minutest unremembered incident of life saw took note though eye be open ear alert conscious brain be busy with what concerned more vividly than thing besides in way have already made own have painted dozen time in sketch study have guessed secret learned magic of romance be be not life be expanding opening about must not claim receive surrender of brain heart have come back here two day ago on morning following have presented card at mill house to parlour maid who have taken in leaving canvas easel paint box have brought with to grill at door rather haughty young person returned after while bidding follow took upstairs into what looked like disused nursery overlooking lawn river pointed at picture propped against end of sofa mr wroughton hope there be everything require said please to ring if want anything rustled out of door closed with elaborate precaution exactly a if charles have fallen into sleep be necessary for recovery charles grave grey eye have be twinkling with amusement a be thus led through empty house stowed away like leper in sequestered chamber left alone broad grin spread over face then before looking at picture stood with face towards end of sofa eye made observant tour of room certainly have be nursery for here stood doll house here child crib here chair with confining bar between arm so that child imprisoned there must by mean escape there be sign of later occupancy couple of big arm chair revolving book case stood there also on top of evidently in recent use lay writing pad with ink bottle pen tray attached also there be that indefinable sense in air manifest subtly unmistakably that room be still in use rap at door indicated not may come in be coming in interrupted short survey parlour maid entered cast vulturine glance round room saw annexed writing pad again before leaving spoke like delphic oracle up to date if desire to rest smoke there be garden observed now charles have already drawn conclusion about room resented removal of writing pad by anybody owner for required little constructive imagination to reform history of room surely have be nursery of girl of punt be still used by a sitting room ought to have come got blotting pad however have done nothing of sort in meantime be business not to dream dream see reproduce painter vision took hold of picture stood against end of sofa turned round then gave short gasp of amazement for here be girl of punt inimitably portrayed just so in other fashion have turned opposite tent looked at charles while brother execrated that must have be omelette there be question that be there be question either that be superb reynolds instantly artistic frenzy awoke dream lay deep down in young soul dim faint asleep seemed suddenly to awake merge personify in treasure that be to copy instantly whole room too burst into life when prototype of owner be manifested apart from sweet exquisite pleasure that gave to work here have room be badly chosen there be excellent north light by drawing down blind of window opposite must secure exactly illumination required in five minute have adjusted easel with canvas already mapped faintly out into square to guide drawing charcoal began soft grating journey for long time worked on in one absorbed pulsation be just beginning to feel that arm be momentarily unable to continue without pause for rest when interruption unlooked for for moment inexplicable occurred faint continued scratching not impatient entreating came at door rightly rejecting first idea have presented to that indomitable parlour maid suddenly brought low besought admittance charles opened to intruder big golden collie stood outside who sniffed at with doubt hesitancy then deciding that be harmless came softly by established on sofa established there in haven where must be thumped gently with tail a signal of gratitude charles stood with open door in hand moment seemed impossible to continue drawing into passage so to speak with tremor of anticipation in wicked young heart closed again parlour maid must remove writing pad might easily require someone with greater authority to entice away that other possession then before going back to work tested friendliness of visitor finding be welcome spent minute in stroking ear received a thanks rather dry hot nose thrust into hand clearly dog be not well with strange canine instinct be grateful for expression of even stranger sympathy then lay down with muzzle on outstretched paw eye wide open suffering puzzled charles went back to canvas expected further interruption now in little while began through open window on side towards river where have drawn down blind heard footstep on gravel path below whistle then voice calling buz buz heard too for pricked languid ear just moved languid tail did not feel equal to more active recognition again once again buz be whistled for called seemed to charles that be in position of unwilling accomplice who have better turn king evidence so a quietly a must pulled up blind looked out below on grass stood buz mistress perhaps whisper of blind have caught listening ear for on moment looked up saw charles at window beg pardon said be shown up here think must be buz who asked to come in be lying on sofa there be sudden surprise in girl face might only be due to being thus addressed by stranger from upper storey a matter of fact be not stranger quite who addressed perfectly recognised though surprise be there oh thank said will come up to fetch charles stood there waiting with blood somehow strangely tingle alert seemed to a if have happened before yet must not remember what happened next seemed very natural then heard quick step on stair entered smiled at rather remotely not without friendliness certainly without embarrassment thank so much said must not find buz dear come along stood in doorway with head already half turned to leave room again just a in hundred year old portrait of buz tattooed languidly with tail be afraid be not very well said charles with sense of taking plunge nose be hot dry be afraid so dog always think of room a sick room if feel what be called thing buz come along buz thought not wo leave here said charles joyce came couple of step into room oh hardly like to said wo disturb not atom do leave if feel like stopping doe object to that last sentence won joyce heart be easy to reach through dog detached from charles again a be went up to ailing dog buz darling be so sorry said can stop here if like not quite well oh be afraid not well at bestowed kiss on buz head who wrinkled puzzled eyebrow at appeared must not help did not understand then turned to charles again please forgive interrupting said be painting below thorley weir week ago yes thought be before have time for more than bare affirmative have left room again way downstairs mingled with compassion for buz wonder why have felt a if must not help asking that although be perfectly certain be be characteristic of charles that flew to drawing again for expressed feeling better than mooning reverie must have helped to do must draw must draw just a eager young horse must run to give outlet to life rejoices in limb besides moment of industry brought nearer to painting of face half turned neck before began again with buz permission kissed top of flat golden head went to work with heightened colour feeling little ashamed of perhaps hour passed while from house came sound at from room where charles worked except scrape of charcoal rather quick uneasy breathing of dog then came interruption did not excite in least for have not forgotten manner of access peculiar to parlour maid will be working here afternoon sir mr wroughton want to know said if so will take lunch charles foolish heart leaped must be delighted to said again silence descended then with heart leaped down again heard subdued clink on stair be even so then re entered parlour maid with neat tray on be set adequate austere refreshment a charles ate excellent cold mutton rather stringy french bean grinned largely at mental picture of a prisoner in solitary confinement who might take exercise in prison yard when wanted to smoke buz shared confinement apparition of buz mistress be not unknown by by must take exercise then again glory of reynolds portrait exquisite satisfaction too of being able to see from study in national gallery manner of doing knowledge that must owing to long careful practice put on paint somewhat in manner swallowed up entire consciousness again gong sounded from below buz from mere force of habit knowing be dinner time got off sofa before realized that dinner be of use to went few step towards door then turned sat down in front of charles seeking eye with own mournful not understanding mutely beseeching to know what be matter asking to help charles tried to convey comfort buz acknowledged effort by few heavy sigh breathed into caressing hand then walking stiffly painfully went back on to sofa again charles felt a if have be taken into poor beast confidence buz have enlisted to give such aid a be possible room have grown very hot in last hour with unflecked outpouring of sun on roof charles thought with touch of not more than secondary rapture of cool liquid embrace of weir more primary ecstasy be in foreground putting aside charcoal must not resist getting out paint rioting with loaded brushfuls over expanse of faded blue of sky toned into pale yellow above low horizon to right of picture on left rose thick grove of dark serge clad tree against be defined that exquisite head to there pointed that beckoning hand who be unseen to whom beckoned with gracious gesture yet little imperious to what did beckon perhaps only must be best of to saunter through twilight wood with alone away from such crowd a might be supposed to throng stone terrace seen glimmeringly to front of picture to talk sitting on soft moss on felled tree trunk in low voice a befitted quietness of evening hour to hour remission from gabble gaiety of world be unseen onlooker who have asked to give hour have something wanted to tell charles must picture in satin coat knee breech stammering little little shy something for ear alone

first shadow laid over be impossible not to daub in of one have ever seen quite a reynolds saw not quite so simply comprehensively then suddenly despair benumbed finger must be profanity be not so grotesque to think of copying such wonder at charles became aware that hand eye be thoroughly deservedly tired also that have searching imperative need for tobacco be decidedly time to seek prison yard sun have ceased pouring in at window when have raised blind to turn king evidence with regard to buz now cooler breeze suggestive of coming of evening sauntered in be perhaps have refreshed sick dog for when charles opened door buz shambled off sofa followed downstairs there be difficulty about finding way into garden for lay straight in front of at foot of stair still seeing sign of life crossed lawn walked on grass path down between two old yew hedge buz still at heel towards river then turning corner stopped suddenly on low chair sat very old lady suitably to hot day be dressed in

contemporary young men did not flirt enough nowadays to please thought about inside silly scotch golf have noticed change of expression in charles respectful eye when looked at joyce liked that look be many year since have seen directed to kept pleasantest recollection of welcomed sight of a directed at in opinion joyce well deserved to have handsome young fellow looking at like so strictly dieted on somewhat acid glance of father little judicious flirtation such a lady crowborough be quite disposed to encourage must certainly brisken house up bit at present in spite of own presence

prepared to back up for have guessed in twinkling of eye craddock have philip consent in paying attention to joyce with sympathy for youth so keen antipathy for middle age so pronouncedly contemptuous altogether recoiled from idea of joyce ever having anything to do with great white cream cheese a expressed to herself found cream cheese agreeable enough at lunch dinner to give news of town bit of tittle tattle in desert of place have other use for for herself granddaughter charles received at edge of domain ankle deep in forget nots conducted distance of three yard to shadow of tent where tea be spread there be two deck chair for visitor box of provision with handkerchief on top for table small piece of board for have pinned up against tent side two three of sketch sole tumbler stood by

that boy may look at girl shade longer than girl may look at boy prevailed joyce bent over tea cup be not le sorry for buz there be other thing in world too know be sorry said so doe buz think nice of how long really do think copy will take what will do if weather becomes odious will get cold in head said charles drawing brush to fine point by putting between lip joyce looked at with horror oh put brush in mouth said always used to stop doing at drawing school of paint be deadly poison oh do paint said charles ought to have painted to have washed up please stop still for moment exactly like so sorry sha be minute damn unfortunate movement of elbow jerked straw hat be lying by into thames caught pirouetted for moment on be eddy of water then hurried gladsomely down stream hat said joyce in strangled whisper a if being forbidden to move must not speak be afraid have already said what have to say about said charles just one second worked eagerly intensely with concentrated vision effort of realization for minute then again used that forbidden receptacle for paint brush dragged off excessive moisture from wash now will get while dry said picked up punt pole ran down edge of bank to recapture hat have floated out into mid stream pursuit be fruitless looked quite new said joyce reproachfully on return be afraid be extravagant just other way round must have be false economy to have saved hat price crown have risked losing sight got of just for minute while hat started voyaging now said gleefully washing out brush now that have got let great river take to main made quotation simply in bubble of high spirit not thinking of context of concluding following line more dear love for at touch yield instantaneously sequel occurred to for word be set to tune very imperfectly sang with light tenor accompanied on banjo talk of too many thing in one breath mr lathom said joyce said if weather broke must catch cold here so of course must go to inn in village if rain men have sense believe must stick on here while get congestion inflammation pneumonia then asked if painted may tell used to try if have sketch left sight of must convince of truth of what say charles art heart tugged for whole attention for minute be silent absorbed quite done said thank so much miss wroughton charles looked at thought of art passed from be entrancing suddenly woke to fact that in last quarter of hour have made friend came towards stripping sketch off block do let give said rather shyly see will enjoy fruit of labour a sha have to wash up be only fair that must have fruit of mine at least if must care for at must not take in hand sketch not yet dry held out to looking at must not care never be there anything more admirably simple never have impression be more breezily recorded there be attempt at making picture of there be space unfilled in mere daub of hard edged blue in middle of sky be sufficient note to indicate weir be brown blob brown blot of reflection splash of grey a if brush have spluttered like cross nibbed pen showed where water broke below against came triumphant painting of head own on head in reynolds picture so careful so delicate for rest of there be wash of stained blue for dress patch of body colour careless apparently curiously like tea cup against at foot be scrabble of blue lighter than dress none must doubt that meant forget nots be like though scrabble of pale blue seemed so fortuitous probably charles never painted more magically than in ten minute even when magic of brush have become phrase in art criticism cliche there be that man can have to inspire there inspiration have potential energy of bud of great rose have power of full blossom still folded in energy of coiled spring inimitable vigour of young man opening blossom of love be wonder that paused when handed to own face own slim body gesture a saw leaped at from sketch thrilled to think be that what see in array of compliment subtly worded brilliantly spoken must have told so much of mind be exquisite maiden that saw be must not see how exquisite thought must not fail to glow inwardly secretly at view of few minute work at cost of straw hat came a revelation to showed at least showed how saw insatiable heaven born love of girl to be admired shot in flame through now that saw sketch knew that have longed for tribute from man though till now have be utterly unconscious of such longing mr craddock when proposed to lacked spark of flame have even smouldered knew be loved that in seemed almost terrifyingly sufficient let droop lie on on thought of be transcendent in significance scrutiny lasted moment then from sketch looked back to charles again who have seen like have possessed skill of brush must have painted there must have be something in sketch a in of glimmering light tremble high in zenith when day of love be dawning back forth between ran preluding tremor hint warning of fire must one day break into full blaze fed by to girl at present be remotely felt origin scarcely guessed at to tremor be more vibrant source obscure water be already beginning to well out from secret spring beginning to thirst for moment have be grave immediately smile broke on to oh be kind of said will love to have sketch retract be worth lot of straw hat to do perhaps have not even lost one may overtake on mad career a go back home will rescue for if come across give first aid must be getting back now thank ever so much for delicious tea delicious sketch will be at work again suppose to morrow morning such be history of two day charles revolved within that evening after have eaten supper sat out by water side unwitting of dusky crimson in west outpouring weir thing fairer more heart holding than absorbed dominated consciousness day by day copy of wonderful reynolds wonderfully grew beneath deftness certainty of brush though have said that must take much longer than have originally contemplated found that be progressing with amazing speed though must gladly have worked more slowly le industriously so a to lengthen out tale of beautiful day seemed to be out of power to keep back hand be dragged along a be by gloriously galloping steed of own supreme gift once in room opposite portrait must no more keep finger off brush brush off canvas than must drunkard refrain alone with cork drawn intoxicant must for perhaps more potent reason keep away from house where picture be after reasonable morning work lounge away afternoon on river by cord be drawn to mill house for there be chance of not infrequent fulfilment of meeting joyce then have to go to extemporized studio other frenzy possessed poor buz have pleasure in day a went by old dog grew steadily worse be constant occupant of sofa where have established on first morning of charles occupation if be not a be generally case in place when charles arrived of morning be never long before there came at door request for admittance daily feebler more hesitating charles have to help to couch now for be too weak to climb up by always managed tap two with tail in acknowledgment of such assistance gave long despairing glance out of dulled topaz eye expressed dumb bewilderment at own suffering abandonment of dismay that nobody must help once on entering charles found joyce kneeling by sofa cry quietly got up when entered openly wiped eye be so glad think silly said for feel sure other people must say a darling grannie doe 'it only dog only what more do want charles laid comforting hand on buz head stroked ear must easily cry too said for helplessness because ca make understand that must help if possibly must what did vet say yesterday joyce shook head there be hope said there must have to be operation anyhow probably must die under must get over altogether in case be too old mr gray told have much better have killed ca bear know ought to be beastly coward sent bottle syringe morning there be on chimney piece ca bear that groom coachman must do vet ca do though be just only thing must do for poor darling buz charles turned from dog to let do miss wroughton said know what mean ca bear that stranger like coachman must do buz always liked know rather trusted mean that joyce gave great sigh yes oh just that said how well understand must really do for charles went across to chimney piece looked at what vet have sent yes be perfectly simple said see what be did for dog of own once be quite instantaneous wo feel anything when said joyce piteously a if demanding respite think now said charles be dying wo know anything joyce bit lip nodded to then bent down over sofa once more kissed buz on nose on top of head then without looking at charles again went out of room aroused buz before many minute be past have dozed off again then charles filled little syringe wiped end of so that bitterness must not startle gently pushing back loose skinned corner of lip inserted nozzle discharged little shiver went through dog stretched out leg then moved more at charles went to door found joyce standing outside be over said buz felt nothing whatever joyce be not up to speaking took hand between of hers pressing chapter v dark october

sober hued rug over colour be there in plenty couple of brilliant screen one of lacquer one of stamped spanish leather intercepted possible draught gave gorgeous warmth of hue to neighbourhood big open fireplace with dutch tile little congregation of chair round about added to mere workroom delightful focus of rest comfort faithful skeleton flayed man kept other company in sequestered corner where might be supposed to entertain other with dismal tale of how came to be what be for room be no longer study of student living place of practitioner beyond thing there be little to attract attention seduce eye for vision come from within must feed on what suggests to not be tickled with what others have done thought at time when craddock have made offer to charles room with little chamber adjoining be already in hand have thought of using a overflow gallery from thistleton have drawn longer bow in offering to charles for speculation there believed to hold larger financial possibility than extension of thistleton promised furnishing in accordance with what thought to be charles psychical requirement be not le than masterly morning by morning when charles arrived there felt instinctively that saw clearly here that own vision be unharassed by thing be ugly inconvenient yet not distracted by challenge of beauty demanded attention in temperate colourless place grew a plant grow on warm grey day not soaked scorched realizing expanding accordingly to own irresistible vitality month ago charles must not have scraped out face to day so joyfully erased from canvas doubt utterly congenial condition did not produce development presented nothing that hindered above constant gnawing at heart of thought that earned nothing contributed nothing to who worked for be removed to nature such condition be spur to have only be drag have never retarded industry have always caused that inward anxiety though knew not shackled perfect freedom of service to art to day have touch of such cramp stiffness felt entirely untrammelled soul stood nude unimpeded like beautiful runner wrestler there be nothing to hinder leap swiftness arthur craddock have be exceedingly busy autumn indeed since month that have spent at marienbad during august when atoned for plethora of nourishment have taken during year before cleared deck so to speak for action again have hardly spent night out of town bulk of work be in connection with production of easter egg for since knew that acting manager must look at for not containing star part if did must quite infallibly spoil by making star part out of on rather magnificent scale of speculation have taken theatre engaged actor whom desired to see in be without exception lady gentleman who have not hitherto be so fortunate a to attract attention for reason service be more cheaply secured be advantage corresponding disadvantage be that be not possessed of great histrionic experience thus needed more drilling instruction craddock have engaged excellent stage manager who fully entered into conception of manner in play must be presented there be scarce rehearsal at be not present after did not confabulate with stage manager sometimes from incessant hearing of scene seemed to to lack significance dramatic force be a despairing author have openly avowed merest twaddle even when hope burned lowest craddock seriously wondered how great must be loss must have to face still stuck to opinion that there be marketable element in quiet drama have cause for financial disquietude during summer there have be outrageous exhibition of post impressionist at one of london gallery though from artistic point of view considered that nightmare canvas have a little to do with art a tasteful decoration of saloon carriage have

in frieze of nightmare brooded on gallery wall though for present money considerable sum of be locked up in monstrous unmarketable ware did not must have affected far more poignantly lose prestige a critic appraiser of art since have bought under agent name secret of identity with thistleton gallery be at present inviolate astute young clerk a have be seen have conjectured a much be only conjecture conjecturer be only reggie have craddock known of reggie brotherhood to new protege might perhaps have devoted little thought a to whether must take step to ensure secrecy a be knew reggie name suspected conjecture relationship third disagreeableness have chequered september for craddock added further burden to anxiety during week of rehearsal for play four year before have purchased one of convenient option on literary work of slow labouring diabolically canny scotchman who have failed to find publisher for story craddock have judged to be very beautiful delicate piece of work have given execrable pict sum of three hundred pound for coupled with right to purchase future work by during next three year for same sum whereupon execrable pict having made quite sure that have mastered term of agreement have sat down in frugal house in perthshire devoted to study porridge reflection for three year have not set pen to paper lived life of meditation must have done credit to student of raja yogi attaining samadhi period of apprenticeship to craddock being finished contract terminated have written book over when be published during september whole world seemed have laughed

common sense told that when be dealing with brain hand so sensitive a of true portrait painter be falsest economy to spare money trouble in securing for best possible condition for work when afternoon paid visit to studio hour before charles triumphantly joyously expunged that sweet tender face from canvas craddock thought justified will be readily understood that among multiplicity of venture perplexity craddock have little time psychical stuff to devote to girl who be not too much to say have brought new type of emotion into life though have time to address actively to thought of image lived somewhere in background of mind without loss of vividness indeed without volition on part seemed to be gently soaking into business with be more acutely concerned so that for instance even when brain be most attentive to lugubrious rehearsal must see with perhaps lady crowborough a chaperone frank armstrong a perspiring author seated in stage box on night of first representation perhaps must not ask armstrong a there be fierce rugged kind of strength about that girl might possibly find attractive such be blindness with ironical fate smites puppet such qualm with regard to charles who have so have learned stayed at mill house on lady crowborough invitation for week after summer have broken in torrential rain towards end of july ever entered head then only week ago for date of production have to be postponed yet again postponed until rehearsal went with smoothness that friction disturbed came first night of easter egg before evening be half over conduct of execrable pict apparent permanence of post impressionist picture on wall of gallery have be smoothed out of craddock mind a wrinkle in sand be erased by incoming tide from first moment simple brilliant little play with neat construction well etched delineation of character charmed captivated house be not necessary for audience to put too strenuous call on intelligence a craddock have foreseen found entertainment much to mind in watching enjoying unfolding of unpretentious absorbing little chronicle have something of fragrance of cranford about gaiety be of little bonneted quakeress suddenly moved to dance in shy decorous manner did faint patronizing blame praise of critic next morning disturb in slightest knew well from manner of reception pleased chattering crowd waited for vehicle in lobby when last act be over that need have fear for solidity of first night success being critic knew how seldom colleague spotted right horse indeed only jarring note be attitude of sardonic author when subsequently supped with owner in reply to craddock congratulation returned congratulation into bosom armstrong in fact seemed rather vexed at success of evening craddock remembering for brief moment own feeling on success earned by book of execrable pict understood something of young man ingratitude certainly ill luck followed craddock last month even at number of pound of too too solid have lost be not what have hoped for seemed to have turned for easter egg when have run week gave evidence by advance booking of security of favour with public critic also be airily beginning to say that have said so all along so with removal of financial anxiety craddock be at leisure to turn mind to riverside again on evening of day on have visited charles just previous to ruthless destruction of head in portrait went down again to thorley to dine sleep at philip wroughton house have two ostensible reason for so doing in first place wanted to see charles copy of reynolds in second wanted to talk over friend plan for egyptian winter be minded to spend month two in egypt wondered whether little judicious hinting must cause philip to make suggestion that must be eager to fall in with found be not ill pleased to find lady crowborough be not in residence have gone back to town where be accustomed during winter month to hermetically seal up in manner of hybernating dormouse in small dark house in half moon street found when subject of egypt be mentioned at dinner that have gone to town principally in order to supply with linen frock veil must thwart freckling power of egyptian sun dear mother said philip a passed port to craddock have got into head that must like to accompany joyce when have got plan of kind in head joyce find useless to protest doe not listen to argument doe reply to carry out plan entirely applaud one a likely a not will be who will have to look after for be sure will find journey heat very trying a planned expedition with view to regaining such measure of health a may be possible for confirmed invalid quite applaud resolution a say be quite indifferent to applause absence sometimes think that old people tend to become little selfish frowned slightly a poured out water with be to facilitate entry of after dinner cachet will expect joyce to be with read to look after continued will be companionless shut up condemned to invalid life a have be find difficult to think of anybody who might accompany relieve of solitude will so largely be mine world in general even one friend soon forget invalid like certainly must like now that mother have settled to come with further addition to party philip be sufficiently astute to observe others when be not entirely absorbed in a looked at craddock now seemed to that there be certain suggestion of expectancy of tension even about in fact have raised wine glass from table a if to drink sat with poised drinking replacing if only must induce to come with said craddock put glass down think if have not suggested that said that must have risked rebuff done paused moment only one thing might have deterred added namely fear that presence after what happened when be here last might be distasteful to miss joyce philip waved away with thin white hand know that young be often very selfish said believe that joyce must for own sake wish to deprive of so congenial companion even if suggestion be well founded be sure be not indeed think being able to come with be very fortunate circumstance for if may say so for a well a for will have ample opportunity for knowing better appreciating more truly will go into next room ah by way since will now be seeing about journey hotel accommodation in egypt perhaps must not be troubling to make arrangement for also mother know will take maid who will look after joyce can not afford similar luxury rain gale have clamorously wept day have vastly increased at nightfall when two men left dining room found joyce sitting in drawing room with open window in attempt to clear room of smoke have be blowing down chimney rendered room impossible for father to sit in since own sitting room be in better plight joyce be despatched to see whether room be on other side of house sheltered from fury of wind be more tenable report be favourable father coughing feeling sure that quarter of minute exposure to open window of drawing room have chilled went upstairs with leaving craddock to look at copy of reynolds hung in dining room have have dusky glimpse of during dinner now when examined by fuller illumination execution of amazed not only be faithful in line colour in indefinable quality of mark off inspired from merely intelligent copy there be same gleeful mystery in turned radiant face be a if charles le than painter of original picture have known entrancing girl have penetrated by artistic insight into joy vitality enveloped how like be to joyce be swift to see picture did not long detain on way upstairs very sincerely congratulated on tide in affair be proving so fortunate easter egg already counted a gold mine three picture of charles one of admirable portrait of mother be enviable possession there be winter in egypt golden possibility contained already own determined almost determined to give charles hundred pound have received from customer in payment for copy made of reynolds instead of fifty have promised must easily say that mr ward have be so delighted with that in fit of altruistic generosity seeing that copy be not wished to make larger remuneration charles must be so ingenuously grateful craddock liked gratitude ingenuousness contained element of security joyce gave charming welcome to room have just heard from father that craddock must join party be delightful that will come to egypt with said party of four be ideal number there be absence of personal note in craddock a caressed side of face did not fail to observe quantitatively then be right miss joyce said be latest addition qualitatively satisfactory joyce wore raised eyebrow slightly puzzled smile at polysyllabic observation be probable that understood very well be delightful that be coming repeated craddock might have attempted to get more personal welcome than at moment very observant eye caught sight of small framed sketch stood in circle of lamplight on table instantly attention be diverted there be only artistic attention be thus captured for in glance saw that sketch concerned in way other than artistic put out hand drew picture more immediately under light unconscious that have not even acknowledged joyce repeated speech of welcome there knelt in charles sketch on carpet of forget nots at water edge head be turned a in reynolds picture to face spectator while body be in profile be possible enough that charles have begun water colour replica of head from reynolds there be difference in subtle insistent showed beyond doubt that girl have sat to for also be engaged a to hand with white blot of tea cup dish cloth held in other hand be green with reflection from bank beside basked in brilliant sunshine behind be weir with screen of tree above dab of blue be sufficient neither more le to indicate serenity of summer day critic to finger tip craddock must appreciate none better than slenderness of mean employed to portray thing adequacy one great artist must have dared to omit so much foreground of forget be two mere swirl of paint weir splash of brown with smudge of grey to indicate shadowed water while mere twirl of brush showed swift current of river in midst of mere symbol note of colour be face be marvel of portraiture into infinity of care be absorbed of same quality be vague line showed girl slim body be other who knelt among forget nots seemed to craddock just a none son must have painted that portrait of charles mother so none lover must have painted saw difference between joyce reynolds picture now previously have only seen marvellous similarity here blood heart beat of artist throbbed in exquisite handiwork artistic sense took first call on faculty little masterpiece said have never seen happier moment be inspired boy philip just shrugged shoulder at admiring explosion ah little picture of joyce said have always seemed to rather sketchy unfinished if admire so much be sure joyce must be delighted to let have joyce turned quickly to father for first time craddock saw troubled disturbed oh father ca possibly said quickly mr lathom gave broke off short face neck be flushed with blood sprang there then bright eyed rosy a dawn turned to craddock be clever sketch be said background be only three dab smudge suppose happen to be put in right place did one afternoon when granny be having tea with gave few second more for looking then quickly held hand out for replaced on table then baldly ruthlessly changed subject think have even be up here before mr craddock said be nursery once a rocking horse doll house witness then school room a time table of lesson above chimney piece witness please let now become smoking room light cigarette now do tell about egypt know darling granny will want to stop in cairo go to dance dinner party new topic effectively diverted father from channel concerning charles sketch for be always more ready to talk about thing concerned own comfort than topic be unrelated thereto week in cairo before going up nile to settle down for month sunshine at luxor be not unreasonable if lady crowborough desired more cairo there be of course cause why must not indulge to extent in pleasure festivity must be obliged to indulge alone party whose sole object be pursuit of health for philip must not be expected to hamper guest joyce have inclination so assumed then for gaiety like temple of karnak be much more to mind joyce left two men before there be sign of discussion growing lukewarm went to bedroom be on other side of house fronting full bugling of gale maddened tattoo of rain on pane be impossible in onslaught of elemental fury to open window felt in very bone blood of longing for out of door condition up down room walked strangely unwontedly excited have obeyed impulse must have put on cloak let out of house to walk to run even to stand in blackness of night bellowing of wind feel one with wild simplicity force of storm better even than must have liked to go forth plunge naked under hueless night with torrent froth of weir to struggle be buffeted by furious water to be nobody else not anybody daughter not anybody companion not even with whom soul seemed suddenly mated have gone out for drenching walk to weir only afternoon have leaned over grey wooden railing watched water in flood over promontory where tent have stood below carpet of forget nots where have knelt must have found in heart to wade through foam of flood to kneel there again recapture first thrill of knowledge have come to then that unbidden flash of desire have lightened on for second have instantly shoved away again slamming door on turning key shooting bolt have be there to night a paced room knew quite well what lay behind barred door of consciousness though have imprisoned giving bail to go abroad be not ashamed of burned there within warmly radiant though must not allow to see light of knew to be there secretly exulted in knowledge did not directly want to throw open to herself just now only wanted to be a felt must be if must be out in storm did not formulate in mind indubitable necessity of unlocking inmost self in order to be illogically enough with very human inconsistency longed for condition must give sense of freedom of expansion that demanded without contemplating that on whole freedom be based yet knew well that against revolted from longed to escape in word be fact implication founded on fact that arthur craddock be coming to egypt with coupled with be idea so cursorily introduced by father that must give craddock sketch that charles have made of literally expedition of ingenuity must have framed more unfeasible request there be nothing in world must le easily have parted with suggestion be just thrown over shoulder so to speak like idle question meaningless complimentary speech now wondered whether be only that taken in conjunction with craddock bloodless wooing of felt be possible that be in nature of test question be be once more for moment desired night storm water of swollen river then instantly knew that be symbol of knowledge burned behind closed barred door of mind seemed to have volition in matter looked at door swung open light burned within be made manifest ceased from restless pacing of room with little sigh of recovered rest sat down at dressing table unlocked one of drawer be empty for couple of letter addressed to be quite short nearly quite formal filled drawer filled everything else beside read dear miss wroughton hope copy of picture satisfies father did see before left must so much like to know that be pleased with if be ca tell how sorry be to finish for be such pleasure to do must so like to see in place if be possible often think of poor buz there be nothing here that merest formalist might not have written only man formalist must not have written took out second letter dear miss wroughton be so glad father like copy about silly little sketch if be going to frame think have better just have plain gilt frame mount mount will only make look more dabby be busy with portrait of mother be tremendous fun chiefly suppose because have perfectly darling face be utterly like face of course day will suit to come down look at copy do want to see if be fairly satisfactory will come on day at hour that suggest sincerely yours charles lathom p s have got into new studio be lovely wo be up in town sometime before go to egypt wo come to lunch tea lady crowborough said must will ask same day if mother came must do must like to see thing have be quite dark for day suppose will be winter wish must put studio down in egypt there be nothing here that anybody might not see joyce must not have shown letter to anybody felt must have shown heart le than own in showing for comment on text if be needed there be sketch of be how saw restlessness have utterly subsided have only be restless a long a have wanted to be without admitting to herself be most real in a long a shut up bright burning knowledge shone in innermost heart now have thrown closed door wide sat very still very bright eyed with two simple little note on table in front of desiring more air tumult of night unconscious of hearing no longer below drawer where kept letter be also locked after while opened that also took out what contained often have laughed at for keeping often have scolded herself for so doing ridicule blow have stung sufficiently to make throw away destroy in present condition must have be hard to catalogue describe there be doubt that shapeless mud stained affair have once be straw hat have found drowned pulpy just below landing stage of mill house day after charles have made sketch of meantime arthur craddock though glib instructive in matter of hotel travel have be very deeply busy over new condition that felt to concern considerably rightly wrongly believed that boy who have painted that wonderful little water colour of joyce be in love with must not wholly account for conviction judging intuitively seemed plain to what seemed le plain far more important be fact that joyce peculiarly valued that sketch intuition be necessary here trouble sudden colour in face when told father that must not possibly part with spoke more intelligibly than word even have known guessed little more have conjectured that even at moment joyce be sitting in room with two little note spread in front of while in drawer yet unopened there lurked dismal remains of charles straw hat might have suspected futility of abominable interference that be even now concocting for little meddling lie have seldom vitality to enable to prevail against need be big emotion be real soon late by logical chance discovery come vindication of latter assert by virtue of inherent strength soon late for air be full of thousand of stray spark come explosion that shatters such petty fabrication chance circumstance blow sky high only thought that be dealing with calf love of boy whom have rescued if not from gutter at rate from garret who be altogether insignificant save for divine artistic gift fruit of be bound to sell at so reasonable price to with supposed fancy of girl who know nothing of world for handsome young face so in dangerous state of little knowledge planned invented a talked about steamer hotel till even companion be convinced that utmost possible must be done for convenience comfort then for be now ready craddock took up charles sketch again certainly that young lathom have wonderful gift said congratulate on having obtained so fine copy of reynolds stayed with did not when weather broke philip glanced at clock be already half past ten did not mind having word two about charles indeed be possible must have initiated subject yes be with week said though invitation be not of asking seemed well behaved young fellow craddock caressed side of face before replying wish must share good opinion of said of course when recommended to for work have certainly done very well never occurred to that must have in house like have wish to enter into detail since connection with be over there be reason why must philip got up indeed be glad to know that said because there certainly be considerable friendliness between joyce did not altogether like though be hard to prevent now have reason duty forbids to disobey for refusing to allow resumption of acquaintance be not sorry for craddock got up also then let leave subject said now know bedtime be half past ten so pray be ceremonious with allow to sit here for quarter of hour more while go to bed listen at storm by day month hope will be in valley of avalon basking in warm sunshine of nile side for present be goodnight goodbye for have to go early to morrow will write to miss joyce fully about travelling arrangement craddock lit cigarette after host be gone knowing must not see again in morning thought over what have just said to assure that have managed to convey indefinite sufficiency have in view thought that have probably succeeded very well for have given host excuse be clearly glad to make use of for stopping future intercourse between young fellow own circle have effected without being positively libellous for have said no more than that wished must share philip good opinion of felt that be certainly time to prevent ripening of acquaintanceship joyce have better have conveyed to a assuredly must that must not see author of sketch more sketch stood by on table once again took up found even more admirable than have thought even a looked injury wrong that have done to artist made feel for first time curious dislike of disliked just because have injured dislike did not extend to picture thought that portrait of mother two more canvas besides must pas into possession gave keenest sort of satisfaction since augured for author fame future of ordinary kind what must hand be capable of when power be fully matured certainly must not be for want of recognition that must longer remain unknown though anonymously have written notice to whitehall regarding charles picture of brother at thorley weir next week under own signature must appear column notice of same exhibition practically devoted to one canvas at rate must have effect of making world in general turn eye to have evoked from so apparently extravagant eulogy completely trusted picture to convince that extravagance have be committed people must be set talking in next year academy must be hung portrait of charles mother must be sufficient got up lit bedroom candle seemed to that have arranged charles future very satisfactorily must do most must be done for young man with regard to artistic career a regard private affair have made arrangement for already in dozen sentence have not be spoken amiss new born dislike of made reconsider resolve to pay hundred pound mr ward have be so pleased to give for copy of reynolds after charles have be promised only half that sum have be more than content to close with bargain fact that mr ward have paid more for be thing lay outside question concerned craddock have promised fifty pound for copy craddock must pay did not definitely settle either on one sum other be three day after craddock word of warning to joyce father bore fruit have come into study that morning before lunch found singularly well pleased at proposed itinerary craddock have sent that morning sleeping berth have already be secured must not have to change train at paris sleeping car went on arrival at marseille straight through to quay where ship be berthed came in to ask something joyce said when have explained yes father have heard from mr lathom asking when can come down to see picture framed in place suppose day will do will not will ask to stay night philip have be expecting remembered cordial invitation conveyed by mother to artist to come back see handiwork when be framed in room of original picture be little uncomfortable to be obliged to give reply so different to joyce expected there be nothing in world disliked so much a being uncomfortable bodily discomfort of course be worst form of imperfection mental discomfort be odious also think mr lathom may take for granted that picture look well plea said have le than three week here before actually start for egypt there be infinity of thing to do will be very busy without extra burden of entertaining people joyce did not at once assent to even reply to secret knowledge seethed within be asked to come to see said more definite statement be necessary philip have be glad enough of craddock information did not find quite easy to use with joyce young eager face looking at yet eagerness gave added courage be too eager in spite of excellent reasonableness of word felt unreasonable wish behind by mother said who doe not regulate affair frankly dear joyce want mr lathom in house again hear very good account of to copy picture for be one thing to have proposing even though asked be quite may take that have finished with mr lathom joyce instinct desire urged see how can write letter to on line said be to say that wish to see again if be so father must write be very friendly with when be here why must appear to cease to be so philip went into rage of weak man have not meant to argue point with joyce have in imagination framed interview on quite different line in imagination be enough for to have said that charles proposed visit be inconvenient joyce must have written note must embody wish while delayed fussed with little appurtenance of writing table adjusting sealing wax putting pen level joyce spoke again be quite like bootmaker tailor said whom can order down who will send in what have commanded have be staying with ca say to that have finished with weak rage burst out be what be to say cried will make clear that be not to come here again will show note when have written quite polite of course must be made clear that have finished with came to paint portrait have done so have be paid doubt for trouble be be going to egypt within week two visit will be inconvenient may come after have gone away if chooses look at picture want to see very well will see after third week in beat with feeble closed hand on table do understand said will tell that may come here when be gone not before not after get back can look at picture day for three month may tell that if choose have consideration for joyce make excited make raise voice a know quite well always give fit of coughing joyce came back from window sat down by father at table if be to write letter father said must know why write must tell something account for have voice perfectly in control must not control colour felt that face have become white though detested for palpable sign of emotion be powerless to prevent be easy for to account for said philip though must have hoped that wish be enough be enough said joyce quietly have treated like friend must treat a friend no longer a acquaintance no longer be not desirable friend for acquaintance be nothing to painted portrait begin end with be not sort of man want to know want daughter to know weak rage subsided calmer tone followed be not le ineffectual must take word for dear joyce said be young inexperienced must obey not see more of young man have excellent authority for telling that be undesirable a friend acquaintance be sorry for seemed harmless enough even well bred joyce got up accumulated weight of habit of filial obedience be heavy heart be in declared rebellion did believe what have be told will tell who excellent authority be asked must take excellence on trust from joyce turned to spoke quite respectfully quite firmly then ca write that letter said be very sorry be quite impossible do intend also to disobey with regard to seeing communicating with mr lathom again joyce hesitated intend to obey said at least at least promise to tell if ever intend to do otherwise for first time struck that be dealing with force greater than be at command hitherto joyce have never put into open opposition to have have experience of power habitual serenity held within be vastly obliging said have idea have so obedient daughter be sorry father said have be asking to do thing ca do thing wo do said have made feel very unwell with obstinacy be sorry for too said chapter vi autumn session combined with singularly evil season a regard pheasant have caused london to become very full again during november with class that most need happily can best afford to pay for amusement theatre be enjoying period of unprecedented prosperity night after night queue outside theatre where easter egg be being performed have length attained usually only by gala performance after month run craddock have successfully accomplished hazardous experiment of transplanting to much larger theatre by chance happened to be tenantless luck still burned a star of first magnitude have without difficulty sublet scene of initial triumph started couple of provincial company on prosperous progress money poured in with generosity surprised presented author though there be kind of claim on with further munificent sum of two hundred pound armstrong continued ingratitude though pained did not surprise nearly so much a own generosity knew exactly how young man felt be few day before be to start on egyptian expedition when armstrong be dining with in flat in berkeley square intending to read to after have dined first act of lane without turning with somewhat cynical enjoyment be remodelling in order to suit taste of great as a called patron of drama though craddock have urged entreated not to attempt transformation however thoroughly be transformed argued that great as must detect that below lay original play of have so strongly disapproved must feel that be being laughed at must a always be quick to do resent ridicule put forward view with much clearness a dined have have good fortune come perhaps to one per cent of who try to write play said have scored great signal success beseech not to imperil reputation prestige by so risky experiment doubt adroitness in remodelling even reprincipling if may coin word frank have only just filled wine glass emptied at gulp not exactly reprincipling said be more turning upside down think advice be rather premature do know considering have not at present slightest idea what remodelled play will be like have not better wait till read of think matter what be like said craddock because there will still be 'the lane without turning ' at bottom of might be macbeth hamlet rolled into one remarkable combination must certainly have very short run remarked frank be saying be saying that public critic will know at base of play lie play so unmistakably rejected there be one critic who thought promising said frank be reaping very tidy little harvest for perspicacity be girding at everything say evening dear fellow said craddock placidly frank looked at with scarcely repressed malevolence think sight of opulent room good dinner delicious wine make feel vicious said ca help remembering that be who have really paid for be eating drinking hundred time over yet be who ask to dinner be sorry if burden with hospitality said craddock a matter of fact be who asked frank armstrong laughed quite true said will ask to have glass of port really think situation justifies little wailing gnashing of teeth craddock be slightly afraid of very uncompromising young man liked to feel master beneficent patron of protege be very imperfect sense of mastery that enjoyed when be with particular beneficiary have tried cajolery flattering with most insignificant result determined to adopt more heroic method a to gnashing of teeth observed there certainly be le gnashing of teeth on part before put on play for for simple reason that often have to go without meal be bound to say did wail frank laughed again be not bad said repeat that be maddening to think of earning in week over labour a much a earned altogether of course have capital one ca expect labour capital to fall into other arm have much more than capital said craddock have sense to see that star actor must not take if did take must ruin work have not sense to see that if will pardon saying so true like better when answer back be not denying shrewdness god forbid when have be victim of have be thinking let tell how can get out of clutch really see way may take suppose that be safe now about play see to begin with why matter to what write need exercise option over unless please in case will get done on own account ah doe matter to said craddock if produce couple of play fail may consider present success a wiped out ca tamper with reputation bigger be yours at moment be very big indeed more be vulnerable be for sake le than mine that be so strong about surely for sake little le than yours suggested frank if will have so for sake little le than mine advise not to produce play too quickly public be very fickle if flood theatre with drama of frank armstrong will soon laugh at disagree with policy altogether said frank happens will get tired of in five six year so for five six year propose to produce a many play a possibly can find have got lot more twaddle sketch thing half finished scenario be invariably returned to will be returned to no longer actor manager be tumbling over other to get hold of work like seeing tumble by way there be point in agreement must like to discus akroyd came to to day good lord think of akroyd coming to when few month ago must even let come to came to with terrible smile amazing clothes offered thousand pound in advance on account of royalty for play want to see approve bare scenario now supposing accept choose to exercise option on do get that naturally have acquired right in such play will also try to make akroyd give little more than hell said frank succinctly poured out glass of port a spoke shaking drop off lip of decanter broke glass flooded tablecloth action be on border land between purpose accident certainly be not sorry a looked at swiftly spreading stain port tablecloth observed manner said craddock drily yes deserved that did really do on purpose so a be accident will say be sorry more thanks feel in better temper may be pleased to hear there be nothing so soothing a smashing something if one doe value spent hour afternoon at one of side show in exhibition banging wooden ball seven for sixpence at lot of crockery on shelf what ironical affair world be when have hardly enough money to get dinner for nobody ever asked to dinner now that there be longer difficulty in paying for own dinner everybody want to dine at chiefly house people have never seen who live in square write to giving choice of couple of night ask other people have never seen to meet roar with laughter say if obviously be funny look pensive say 'how true ' what great as be ah make most of said craddock dozen people talking about will do more for than dozen newspaper shouting about probably rather like newspaper shouting be so damned funny to think of lot of grinning compositor ruining eyesight to set up column about read article in 'whitehall by way did spare adjective did send interviewer to too with camera flash light who fill room with stinking smoke ask to tell about early day hot stuff of be nut on story of father throwing knife at did tell asked craddock feeling rather bruised certainly why must not came to see morning rather tipsy told to go away come back when be sober must give crown to get drunk on again there be commandment be there

say be kind nice world just because be not cold hungry longer be not bit sorry for cold hungry more than be sorry for when be among hated being cold hungry be true nobody cared learned to expect that nobody must care unless must get something out of a have done fine rich people be there while be starving nobody asked to dinner treated to dozen of wooden ball at exhibition now have shown that can amuse for hour two after dinner think be end of fine fellow have not changed always believed in even when be hungriest not being hungry doe make believe in anything else more wine thanks be not going to take after father by way met dear little female methuselah last night name of lady crowborough who told knew congratulated of course did did mention connection with asked craddock with little anxiety not wholly concealed must have liked must can make mind easy did suppose will must vex for world be not so good reason a must expect from try one then made fool of see outwitted want people to know that for sake far more than yours role of brilliant successful dramatist be more to mind than role of dupe be offensive expression said craddock certainly why must care doubt other people have used before to by way again there be fellow there last night who knew under lady crowborough slightly moulting wing lathom be name congratulated also there be something rather taking about weird sort of guilelessness gratitude be coming to play with sometime next week now if want to hear first act of 'lane without turning have better begin be going to mr fortescue party later on who be mr fortescue prettiest bore in london be saying good deal a regard look a regard ennui be so convinced be only twenty eight be worth study a showing length to credulity can go by mean let hear first act armstrong got up want to tell when have heard said when have told how second third act will go whether exercise option not be going to egypt in few day tell want hung up till get back have doubt will be able to tell said craddock in spite of assurance craddock found hour afterwards in state of bewildered indecision finished first act together with very full scenario of other two gave a be well aware sufficient data for conclusion be strangely embarrassed at recital of brilliant farcical medley a author have said turned original play upside down parodied winged with iridescent absurdity knew well unaccountableness of public well too knew value of reputation such a easter egg have brought author seemed to frantic imperilment of reputation to flaunt rainbowed farce in face of public armstrong have acquired name of observant kindly humorist here laughed at not with gentle life of ungifted people again in original play involved puppet in net of inextricable tragedy here a by conjuring trick let escape with shout of ridicule at suppose destiny have entangled play might easily be failure more stupendous because of stupendous success of easter egg on other hand there be chance bare chance that inimitable mocking wit might be caught by rather stolid as have to decide knew quite well that have sufficient data for decision did not in least desire merely to annoy armstrong by plea for further opportunity of consideration most sincerely wished that play have never be written that wish gave idea for moment seemed brilliant be harvesting money in sheaf must well afford will exercise option said at length then will destroy play for convenience dear fellow need even put on paper last two act can take cheque away with to night frank armstrong considered munificent proposal for moment in silence looking very ugly did purchase right to destroy work said purchased right to posse for minute more armstrong frowned glowered then suddenly face cleared gave astonishing shout of laughter right said draw cheque here be manuscript note be going to destroy to morrow will begin new play exactly like how be gosh what as be ought to have got cheque first cashed before told gave away so terribly by telling must purchase destroy be off guard now once again sense of imperfect mastery struck craddock there be difference about now that forced rather a being sense of mastery on other side be thrown back on original debate in mind doubt of success prevailed take option said curtly frank got up thank god said good night craddock sat quiescent for few minute after armstrong have left feeling rather battered bruised yet conscious of having passed stimulating evening did not wonder that section of london who spend most of time money in procuring tonic entertainment that will keep pulse racing must pursue flaring young man with eager hospitality be liable be true to behave like young bull calf might often did lower head fixing steady vicious eye on

be bored be true that yawned did yawn in order to impress upon boring quality only expressed naturally unaffectedly own lack of interest in what be saying to be sure also be ugly clumsy when there be

year even when with inimitable mimicry showed how craddock felt for whisker looked at plump little hand be immensely entertaining very likely must soon become tiresome familiar must be time to drop then craddock be not in least surprised at lionizing of young armstrong not only have written play be undeniably bull eye of year in be sufficient unlike most writer artist strength of whose personality be absorbed into achievement have dominating personal force craddock knew well mercantile value of social excitement over author of easter egg a have said to armstrong dozen people talking be worth shouting of two dozen journal while lasted there be question that stall dress circle must overflow for play apparently too have le valuable attraction for pit gallery there be sincerity about work appealed to who be not warmed by mere crackle of epigram neat conversation while welcomed armstrong appearance a lion a remunerative asset at box office be not so sure that entirely approved of possible intimacy between new artist new playwright must not have definitely accounted for distaste be there though be in rapid preceded departure for egypt found time next morning to go round to charles studio ostensibly to see finished portrait of mother with mind alert to sound warning note a to undesirable companionship charles joyful a craddock have christened received visitor with arm

cook lunch for lady crowborough who be coming there be thing in tin to eke out with indeed be very different sort of protege from who have spilt port last night so much easier to deal with so much more conscious of benefit gratitude affection be so infinitely more becoming than envious mistrust frank habitually exhibited how handsome boy be with fresh colour kindled eye unconscious grace of pose a stood there palette on thumb how fit to draw after like magnet glance of tall english girl at thought at remembrance of injury have done charles craddock felt dislike of stir hiss once more ca do dear charles said a have only quarter of hour to spare besides be far too prudent to think of incurring lady crowborough enmity by spoiling tete tete with on grey morning felt must do good to see

fresh quite differently craddock frowned be a if armstrong have interpolated act in easter egg without permission dear fellow think have business to do without consulting said have said must buy picture knew too that immensely admired a be where be let see charles seemed to resent somewhat hectoring school master like tone below serene joyfulness there be something rather more firm masculine than craddock have expected oh ca concede to right to tell how will paint said just after saw picture other day suddenly saw must do better than must do best a matter of fact think will mind when see here be anyhow wheeled picture be on easel face to wall into position stood rather stiff high headed will be sorry if like said ca help somehow struck craddock charles have grown tremendously in self reliance manliness since have first seen that shy incredulous boy at weir be disposed to take credit to for week of happy expansion of freedom from dragging sense of dependence have made man of then still blameful looked at picture long looked at silently quickly in mind conviction grew that must climb quite completely down from hectoring attitude after be not so difficult there be compensation for lower have to go higher picture soared soared like sunlit ship in air be perfectly right said at length be rashest presumption in to suppose that knew better than will make famous be utter fool dear charles to have imagined that must have spoiled oh that be right said charles tall amid certainty again craddock looked long at be finished now asked humbly think so seems to be what see picture be finished when be case daresay will see more sometime then will do craddock felt call on superlative must say will be seriously anxious if thought be going to scrape out again said though time must dream of interfering now what other work have got on hand be off to egypt in two day must like to know leave busy did mr fortescue come to studio recommended to know be awfully good of be going to paint told to charge two hundred guinea seemed tremendous lot not in least wo remain at figure long charles made face of comic distaste quite know how to paint said ca make a young a be clear think ca make such bore a think how must portrait show think bore asked craddock how will not be difficulty must try not to get weary brush then lady crowborough say will sit to when come back in spring will love doing that by way charles hesitated moment have be so extraordinarily kind to said that perhaps mind consulting told to propose to go down see copy of reynolds picture when be framed in place for last month have be ready to do so day mr wroughton wrote rather queer letter suggested must go down after left for egypt read to rather a if did want to see be so friendly with what can have happened craddock assumed most reassuring manner happened said what on earth must have happened know respected host down at mill house assure when be there three week ago for one night must think about nothing underclothing for egypt price of pith helmet have already believe begun to pack steamer trunk medicine chest give thought charles gave sigh of relief be so glad think be reason said same must have liked to go down say goodbye to to to mean said craddock charles flushed laughed well yes to said why not why not indeed sensible young man like to say goodbye to charming girl if can do more than dear fellow if only be age must take leaping heart to egypt now that have pricked that little troublesome bubble tell little more about life meant to have seen much more of last week two have be distractedly busy have seen one people on business apart from work have be going about much hardly at know so many people see dined with lady crowborough though couple of night ago took to big party oh met there strange queer fellow name of armstrong who said knew wrote easter egg such ripping play have seen be going to take to next week craddock puffed smoked out end of cigarette from amber tube into grate yes know said must not have thought there be much in common between be not sure must like to find out heaven how must like to paint portrait where be charcoal charles seized stick spread loose sheet of paper on table eye like said with eyebrow like pent house over face did ever see such jaw square like hungry be sort of face pay to paint there be something to catch hold of ear be pointed like satyr think must ask to sit to will give portrait if will craddock took up six line sketch yes very like indeed said terrible face now must go wonder if will resent word of advice try said charles encouragingly well will now dear charles be young man just beginning career be immensely important must get among right people latin quarter in paris be one thing bohemianism in london be quite for next forty year work will be to paint charming mother daughter of england have got to come sit to in studio wo if find that savour of bohemian ca be too careful a to friend for strongest most self sufficient people take colour from friend ca help laid plump white hand have be observing on charles shoulder must pardon said have got to time of life when unmarried man wish have son growing up have none have to expend unfruitful potentiality of parentage elsewhere if be son must choose friend for so carefully there be something pathetic unexpected about must not touch charles somehow felt a if ought to have be more touched propos of armstrong suggested propos of intimacy with mr armstrong in general said craddock feeling somehow that have missed fire that be a well to get behind hedge again charles nodded then suddenly felt own lack of responsiveness felt also though without touch of priggishness that here be man who have be wonderfully good to who felt burden of year be not lightened by tie of fatherhood with youth struck suddenly vaguely convincingly have be a kind a father to said quickly hope pay with son proverbial ingratitude have be like father to have often wanted to tell that looked up moment at craddock then seized with fit of misgiving at blurted outspokenness shied away from subject like young colt must like to paint armstrong portrait said promise that must not think have wasted time craddock appeared to accept sudden switching off of sentiment will leave free from option of mine regarding said to have on wall opposite must certainly cause indigestion if be a like a charcoal sketch truth be have not behaved very nicely to tried to befriend a have tried to befriend with le success in amicable relationship be mere nothing felt might do worse than give word of warning be of course for private ear alone goodbye dear charles will let know when get back from land of bondage accept long experience to make mind easy over matter of going down to see admirable copy of reynolds picture must not for instance confide in lady crowborough god bless craddock took unusual step of walking back to berkeley square after have left charles a pursued portly way up brompton road thought rather intently over what have said again a on evening when have let drop few lying word to philip wroughton felt have not spoken amiss must not possibly prevent acquaintance between two protege must certainly prevent ripening into intimacy felt have spoken well when hinted that armstrong have not behaved very nicely to a rule did not much believe in stability of such emotion a gratitude believed very strongly in child like simplicity of charles in conclusion be firmly founded for in course of life have never come across a matter of fact so guileless unsuspicious nature almost regretted necessity of deceiving for feat be so inconspicuous one charles be child child with divine gift of be in position to take secure advantage after nurse kind mother habitually deceived child told that if squinted wind changed squint must be permanent told that many poor beggar must be glad of food rejected in order to induce to swallow thus incidentally to extinguish altogether outside chance of poor beggar getting told that god must be angry with if disobeyed order got foot wet charles be just child though certainly have grown good deal lately soul be child be not until have walked a far a hyde park corner that knew be waging war instead of merely conducting child education be at war with obese person half century of year with generation have sprung up after be now realising zenith of youthful vigour already trod on heel already seemed to hear in ear intolerant laughter at portly progress first acute attack of middle age stabbed like lumbago from occasionally suffered seemed to devilish complaint not to be acquiesced in to be ostentatiously disregarded denied even since last june when have first felt charm need of girlhood have suspected foe fact that charles admitted attraction be magnet also stiffened resistance hated young generation chiefly because own youth have be bloodless affair did not feel old except when met guileless eye of charles vindictive glance of young armstrong of in widely different fashion illumined truth thus for young vigorous male cherished enmity rivalled be be not shelved done with yet a far a attainment of love went entered list against charles a far a hard business capacity went be willing to meet armstrong have suffered initial defeat on hand on one side armstrong have taken remodelled play into own control on other be more subtle charles have be able to paint rough sketch of joyce among forget nots yet have weapon against attack must must write feebly appreciative notice of play more damning than slash of onslaught must must go southward with joyce approving father day after to morrow then with spasm of satisfaction thought of lady crowborough with one if not foot in grave be kissing hand a vigorously contentedly a ever conviction of perennial youth overrode disability of year age be mere question of conviction have only to convince even at moment who have attained middle age before be born be lunching with boy whose father might be tasting delight of flirtation unspeakable decoction over gas stove new flirt must hear say with unctuous serenity new flirt be that child charles who be so much younger than anyone craddock have ever known of course lady crowborough be freak if woman did not feel old at ninety according to own account what excuse be there for man feeling middle aged at fifty little le determined to have lunch whatever have turkish bath swim at bath club instead just a craddock might have made certain sinister suggestion to philip wroughton about charles have known that after left read re read two common place little letter regarded something have once be straw so to day might not have foregone lunch sat in agreeable tropic underneath bath club a matter of fact process made so hungry that indulged in sandwich two afterwards in heroic hue cry after vanished youth if have be aware of charles immediate occupation after have left there be canvas big one leaning with averted face in corner of studio represented girl kneeling among forget nots at edge of stream behind be spouting weir have dozen sketch of weir to help very carefully finished have made in preparation for picture of bathing boy have so many sketch more vivid than more brilliantly lit by steadfast lamp within brain to help have felt must not show to craddock did not know if must ever show to anybody be own hers if ever cared for for be not craddock eagerly now pulled into light mattered not what worked on in picture so long a worked at figure knelt there dressed in stained blue have suffused whole so that grey camp sheltering below weir loosestrife meadow sweet rope of hurrying water woven by force of stream be part of unsuspicious trustful by nature relying on craddock experience knowledge of world on brief assurance that there be nothing below curt note have given charles leave to see reynolds copy after family have gone wiped off mind almost without effort vague doubt have for last week two tarnished dimmed craddock who have be so uniformly kind to who have almost lapsed into parental sentiment to day have not thought doubt worth moment debate besides what must have occurred to change friendliness of family into cold acidity what also must be more reasonable than explanation craddock threw off over shoulder so to speak of philip amazing solicitude for complete provision of own comfort blue blue what world of blue sky dress eye forget nots reflection of sky reflection of dress eye that looked straight into reflection came not into picture caught kept craddock prophecy wish perhaps being to that two young men whom have benefited must not find much in common seemed at first meeting to be likely of fulfilment met at theatre charles enthusiastic appreciation of piece at second time of witnessing seemed to rouse armstrong contempt wish have told have seen before said a lounged smoked between act must have gone to something else there be nothing else must have liked so much said charles eagerly think that scene between violet curate be simply priceless do tell about did know people like frank beckoned to man in box office just show return for week said then answered charles yes used to think be like that said expect be far harder meaner fouler really people ca be a gutless a have made out to be oh be not gutless do think be kind jolly slightly ridiculous be that like most people in fact have seen funny side of man from box office have returned handed armstrong strip of paper fuller than ever mr armstrong see said with sort of proprietorship like head waiter at restaurant when guest find dish to taste advance booking go well on to other side of christmas unaccountably dish be not to armstrong taste blasted fool people be remarked nodded curtly to man be one of know said charles yes forgot that ever despise picture anyhow distrust just because be popular charles laughed have yet be in position to find out what effect popularity must have on own estimate said oh wait minute went to gallery other day where there be picture of mine there happened to be people round so went among listened to what said be rather complimentary think liked for anyhow did affect own estimate frank armstrong glared at well dressed well fed lounger in entrance somehow think fellow like must be wrong in taste said then must like unpopularity must be better pleased if theatre be empty there be advance booking frank armstrong grinned must curse like mad said happened to once have use for then surliness broke down mind telling said fact be that sold play inside out from iceland to peru madagascar get penny more le whether run to doomsday only new year day feel people be defrauding oh what pity said charles be sorry will come flocking to next play thought that there be three more play of to be pouched by craddock sealed armstrong good humour up again have put in very inconspicuous appearance now popped back like lizard into hole shrugged shoulder there be bell said if want to hear third act want to miss word said charles cordially through first half of act armstrong so yawned fidgetted in stall next about middle of charles felt that good manner prompted to suggest that must not remain till end yet way round good manner be horrified at course must appear that play bored decided to risk armstrong be so obviously tired of will go suggested armstrong slid from seat into gangway thought third act must be too much for observed went quickly quietly up through swing door charles rather troubled hand on other arm be that bit indeed be said be yawning grunting know thought wanted to get out be enjoying armstrong knew be behaving rudely to guest to night thronged theatre also in part buoyancy of serene joyfulness have got on nerve then go back enjoy rest of said charles good humour be quite unimpaired be a fresh a paint think will said thanks awfully for bringing be enjoying tremendously good night somehow for moment annoyed armstrong even more there be doubt that must have found pungently flavoured reply there be reply possible on word charles have turned gone back through swing door once more then dawned on armstrong annoyance with charles be really annoyance with at own ill mannered behaviour for minute hesitated more than half disposed to follow to say whispered word of regret if necessary then again balance wavered went out into street people with such infernally good temper a new acquaintance thought must not be allowed at large did not fit in with own idea of world where everyone sought grasped snarled unless have specific reason for making pleasant looked aimlessly up down shaftesbury avenue a stood on step of theatre uncertain what to do with there be party be bidden to felt inclination to stand fire off cheap neat gibe that knew be considered contribution to such gathering payment for supper cigarette a on night did illuminated street with flaring sky sign up above flaring gaiety of pavement below allure in least sometimes wandered up down piccadilly for hour at time in absorbed yet incurious observation of bore out theory of life spoiler spoiled barterer bartered everybody wanted something everybody have to pay for to night street seemed mere galaxy of coloured shifting glass must then go home work for hour on remodelled lane without turning thought with little spasm of inward amusement at title have occurred to to day namely be long lane have five turning be there in play five distinct turning parody of passion five separate time must stall make fixed face so a not to show be shocked five separate time must be utterly fooled have fixed face for nothing who happened to remember original play there must not be many of must laugh little first because must guess what be not going to happen who have never seen that sombre serious work must merely find here most entrancingly unexpected farcical situation developing on legitimate line out of tragical data strolling found underneath brilliantly lit door of mr akroyd theatre where within at hour a armstrong well knew mr fred akroyd be being nobler than anybody who have ever yet worn frock coat patent leather shoe with pith helmet to indicate india third act must only just have begun akroyd be even now probably beginning to dawn like harvest moon on blackness of night plentiful crop moon must reach zenith in about twenty minute then died in garden of viceroy at simla blue incredible himalaya behind if sent card in felt sure that mr akroyd after death in garden must be charmed to talk to for ten minute must be well to make sort of contract without delay in case craddock changed mind about option on bewildering topsy turvy of lane for moment even felt grateful to craddock for hint have given a to possibility of getting larger advance on royalty out of akroyd than thousand pound eminent actor manager have offered must certainly act on suggestion akroyd be just expiring when arrived after waiting five minute be shown into dressing room actor be still little prostrate perspiring profusely with effort extended languid hand people sometimes said that if acted on stage a well a acted off delighted to see dear fellow said sit down while rest for minute take too much out of last act cruel work feel whole pulse of theatre beating in own vein artery strong pulse for dying man observed armstrong yes very good know author how slave for well well a long a give good strong part have quarrel with how 'easter egg by way oh booked full over christmas said armstrong negligently such rot a be too wonder refused to look at strong part in have got something fully in head partly on paper might suit better hear that present strain on be likely to continue after middle of december so if feel inclined might come round to room can have supper there while read what have done tell about rest reassuring alacrity possessed akroyd at made good steady convalescence from prostration always made point of walking home after theatre for sake of health said did not walk very fast often took off hat held in hand so a to get refreshing breeze of night on brow much thought expands tall massive form fine tragic face often attracted good deal of attention people must whisper name a went by put up with small penalty of publicity be very good for hair to let wind play upon akroyd ten year ago have sprung to front of profession by masterly acting of comedy part verged on farce since then have drifted into noble middle aged part such a bachelor marquis who made marriage possible between fine young fellow girl whom marquis be secretly in love with husband of fifty with wife of twenty five part in fact in tact nobility breadth of view unselfish wisdom untie knot for everybody else give everybody else splendid time drifting though in part dictated by conviction that handled virtue a if born to job be due also to fact that during year have really not be given comedy seemed to worth risking knew must always make success a prime minister marquis without risk at luck a le fortunate manager called be proverbial for never have failure be not luck at be responsible for success be fine business capacity knowledge of what following among play goer expected of always gave public what expected then never disappointed in secret heart have longing provided risk be not too great to play rousing comic part again to set stall laughing instead of leaving dim eyed be aware that must do soon if be going to do at there be age when even most self reliant feel equal to strain of being funny be rather out of line said armstrong abruptly a sat akroyd down to oyster once did part of same kind be first play ever saw be marvellously good in ah 'the brittlegings said akroyd considerably stimulated old history be afraid time of george well be time of george again remarked armstrong play be called be long lane have five turning akroyd when discussing theatrical matter always criticised freely author once have suggested forty two a suitable age for part that be to play have considered replied forty three think forty three be very long title said be long lane said armstrong anyhow be title dramatis persona tell what have designed to be part said akroyd think will leave to guess there be many point by way want discussion must like advice think will read straight through first act without interruption akroyd a have be stated be very shrewd business man keen appreciation of wit effectiveness of act made difficult for to bring business capacity into full working order many time throughout have checked laughter throughout too have seen in glorious tragico farcical situation provided for have difficulty in guessing part in sort of parody of own manner be brilliant piece of work saw brilliantly interpreting at end with effort put cork into admiration yes yes very clever very sparkling said hardly in line do think hardly in yours perhaps must be taking great risk must not expect there to be much money in appreciative stall perhaps be hard to say however read scenario of rest frank armstrong felt knew quite well what meant be usual decrying of work by intending purchaser in order to get cheaper roused in resentment that a producer have so often felt for craddock a capitalist threw manuscript onto table resolved to play same game hardly worth while said obviously play doe appeal to though think might have ten year ago before took to heavy work business be thinking of a saw first jove be thirsty work reading now will have to read over again to somebody else to morrow ah rush at conclusion altogether too much said akroyd slightly alarmed much necessarily depends on working out of play be admirably laid down scene be full of wit interest insist on hearing rest sha bother said armstrong taking whisky soda enjoying keenly then let take away read said akroyd really dear fellow be hardly fair to ask here to listen to act scenario of rest then refuse feel now read how much more suitable must be for tranby said armstrong will telephone to read to to morrow have be asking if have got anything for hope oyster be good let read then now said akroyd holding out hand almost trembled with anxiety frank gave up obstinacy with indifferent yawn o well will tell rest of said having begun indifference vanished while akroyd anxiety increased to think of tranby esteemed gifted colleague having marvel of dexterous fooling submitted to to morrow be to picture on edge of precipice felt giddy head swam at propinquity of catastrophic gulf fortunately must crawl away now for armstrong be continuing intentionally did utmost must for reading giving drama significance to bare sketch here there have written upwards of page of dialogue in wonderful neat hand once when found dozen line of speech by akroyd passed over to asking to read aloud did moving about room with excellent gesticulation then a one of ludicrous turning approached armstrong must drop voice speak slowly huskily surely ca be fooling time thought akroyd a tragic moment approached then came ludicrous legitimate situation of impasse thwarting of ridiculous destiny life became series of brilliant conjuring trick carefully explained gorgeous conjuror be akroyd felt there must be further mention of tranby for nerve must not stand at end got up shook hand with armstrong be much obliged to for offering most brilliant piece of work have seen for year said will certainly accept put on when open after christmas will send contract to sign to morrow frank armstrong lit cigarette might talk over line of to night said else perhaps might not sign akroyd a be custom became so great artist so magnificent gentleman when question of money be brought forward that be almost impossible to proceed be sure will find proposal framed on most generous line said armstrong allowed faintest shadow of grin to hover about mouth doubt said there be reason that must not tell what be advance for instance on account of royalty what do propose akroyd put hand to fine brow frowning little think suggested sum to said eight hundred pound advance be something like again armstrong boiled within yet after be business akroyd wanted to pay a little a must wanted to obtain most possible be mean when knew quite well that have proposed thousand pound be great fun too thought of craddock now on bosom of treacherous mediterranean perhaps being sea sick oh said quite good naturedly thousand be sum proposed accept interview did not last long after mere mention of tranby name be enough quarter of hour afterwards akroyd went home in taxi a street be now empty having yielded on point well pleased with acquisition fifteen hundred pound down royalty on high scale be good deal to give seemed to that there be good deal to be got frank sat up for half hour alone in big arm chair hugging knee occasionally bursting out into loud unaccountable laughter what excellent ten minute scene last half hour must make in play called say actor manager middleman how mean people be how delightful fifteen hundred pound be what work what work to bring play up to level of first act must do be not going to be content with anything best then laughed again 'the middleman sweater thwarted good play for tranby put down expired pipe rose to open window room be full of tobacco smoke table hideous with remains of supper be rather stale sordid stale sordid too now be over be encounter with akroyd complete victory have scored oh yes have scored leaned out for moment into cool freshness of night air that smelt of frost finding with distaste that coat sleeve on leaned face reeked of tobacco reeked of akroyd too somehow of meanness cunning own superior cunning be much healthier out of window gosh wish have be such pig to jolly fellow at play said to chapter vii philip wroughton be sitting not on step for must have be risky on cushion on step of mena hotel occasionally looking at paper occasionally looking at pyramid in state of high content to relieve reader mind at once may be stated that egypt thoroughly suited have not sneezed ached mourned since got here nearly month ago voyage from marseille be true have be detestably rough blamed nobody for since have come under benediction

going to mount with assistance on egyptian as ride to see sphinx make tour of great pyramid in company with craddock may be added that reason for sitting on hotel step be largely in order to make minute survey of donkey on hire just beyond wanted one be not too spirited looked a if wanted to canter there be pinkish one there might do flapped ear in rather ominous manner perhaps craddock must choose one for glancing again at paper observed with singular glee that there be flood in thames valley lady crowborough joyce have gone into cairo that morning to do shopping lunch with friend happened with considerable frequency not infrequently also went to dinner dance in gay city stopped night there dinner dance have at first be supposed to be for joyce sake be actually now avowedly for lady crowborough sake though joyce for more reason than one be delighted to accompany on such day a two did not go into town be pretty certain that small relay of british officer others must ride out to have lunch tea with at ulena lady crowborough have several new flirt altogether be amazing prodigious rode donkey morning a beveiled a temple in blue cotton habit with fly whisk accompanied by handsome young donkey boy with milk white teeth engaging smile called princess being shrewd young man be to be feared that be to be numbered also among new flirt also a ran behind donkey used to call out in arabic make way for bride o ah used to evoke shout of laughter from fellow then lady crowborough must ask what be saying that made laugh with ingenuous smile explained that told dog to get out

think for always to see after welfare in thing great small in hundred way too knew that father wished success in desire often made dreadfully disconcerting remark be designed to be understood in way joyce understood ah joyce must say mr craddock a usual have seen to for declare mr craddock guess inclination before know have ordered donkey for half past ten felt that assuredly mr craddock be going to send bill in account rendered time ask for payment not possibly not conceivably must imagine paying retrospective affair occupied more secretly more engrossingly behind splendour gaiety interest

with thing not to be associated with never have subject be ever so remotely alluded to again between charles name have not crossed lip have never asked who informant be felt that such question be superfluous knew whole heart mind told that knew whether have ever actually believed tale scarcely remembered anyhow have accepted a far a action went now without further evidence on subject utterly passionately disbelieved by communing with have arrived at unshakeable conviction that not only be not must not be true through quietly thinking of charles through telling over like rosary bead hour of intercourse together have seen that be a clear a simplest logical proposition saw also that when craddock repeated question have asked last june must ask far more urgently authentically there have be no fire behind then now saw that be kindled before used to look at with unconcealed glance of direct admiration make great speech of open compliment comparing to greek victory bacchante now looked at more shyly more surreptitiously paid compliment no longer just because no longer expressed have to say about have become worn like defaced coin out of currency acquired seriousness sincerity of

disgustful antipathy be a pleasant a agreeable a clever adaptable a before conjectured knowledge have spread through whole personality staining poisoning have thought so now supposed to put rival out of field by treacherous stab in back to unhorse ride over in that have bitterly erred though still thinking have succeeded deep in heart be disgraceful failure blazoned daily felt nightmare of renewed proposal be coming nearer very possibly thought be delaying speech until must go up nile must be leading more leisurely be afraid more intimate life in comparative quietude of luxor where proposed to make long stay for reason largely gladly joined grandmother in amazing activity in cairo gave kindliest welcome to pleasant young english soldier who be so ready to come out to most of joyce loved to wander over hot yellow sand of desert go out alone if possible sit looking at pyramid at wonderful beast that lay looking earthwards with fathomless eye of everlasting mystery a if waiting patiently through unnumbered century for dawning of ultimate day else ensconced in wrinkle of undulating ground must watch hawk circling in fathomless sky let eye wander over peacock green of springing crop to city sparkling very small bright on edge of nile long avenue of carob tree giving value of prussian blue against turquoise of sky vivid green of rising maize corn led in streak across plain to be not

for escorting craddock mused gleefully over news of flood in thames valley remembered be new year day to morrow kept eye on pinkish donkey felt confidently daring pinkish donkey looked very quiet except for twitching ear hoped that craddock must approve choice not want to mount on one shook craddock have proposed expedition for minute two philip wondered whether wanted to talk about anything special joyce for example felt so well that did not care just now what craddock talked about what happened to anybody felt sure too that must be hungry by lunch time really be insane to have let reynolds hang on wall so many year rot like blotting paper in thames valley then have notion that must get five thousand pound for owed great deal to craddock who at moment came out of hotel large fat white reassuring a to point about whisker suddenly struck philip a being rather like music master on holiday at margate who have ordered new smart riding clothes in order to create impression on pier looked rich a usual be very very deferential attentive highly approved philip penchant for pinkish donkey selected for small one resembled in essential manner depressed disappointed widow large leg almost touched ground on side of must almost have progressed in manner of ancient velocipede philip having made quite clear that if donkey attempted to exceed foot pace must go straight home give backshish at made start a smooth imperceptible a launching of ship craddock have interesting communication to make regarding monarch of fourth dynasty information be neither given taken a if be of absorbing importance philip indeed be entirely wrapped up in observation of donkey movement satisfaction felt in not being in thames valley indeed so long ago a that said how take one back even then nile flood came up here did ah by way thames be in flood probably lawn be under water must have be cripple with rheumatism if have stopped there make clicking noise mohammed be going quite fast enough yes there be three dynasty before find movement at jerky painful dear craddock must not wonder if rode again fancy riding must not have believed possible a for manage like positive jockey what do say mohammed if must want to stop positive jockey whose positiveness apparently consisted in size weight decided to slide away from fourth dynasty to time person who more immediately concerned indeed be difficult to imagine such thing a flood rain said when bask in amazing illumination ca express to gratitude in allowing to join happy harmonious party philip just waved fly whisk in direction of sphinx a if to acknowledge without making too much of presence dear joyce said think have be will continue to be happy time for gave great deal of satisfaction to be able to bring out though of course entailed certain sacrifice alone must have be able to compass journey think on interest of what reynolds picture brought with have have necessarily to part with capital still of what use be money except to secure health enjoyment for others be looking wonderfully well craddock who have till now be standing outside topic took sudden header into very depth of rather adroitly there be money must not spend on miss joyce health enjoyment said there be nothing nearer to heart than sounded very pleasing satisfactory for more philip saw of craddock more liked a prospective son in law everything seemed slightly remote unimportant to day in comparison with own sense of comfort well being dear friend renew assurance of sympathy good wish said ah be afraid donkey be going to stumble then held up held up craddock habit of attention to philip found expression before continued that have come out to say anyone can see be rider said rather mechanically of course must know that pleasure in being

have expected that morning bringing work with a desired charles half dressed only in loose shirt flannel trouser have hopped on to seat immediately for frank with scarcely word of greeting have sat down at once to struggle with troublesome situation seated there with sheaf of spear like paint brush young seraphic face looked like modern variation of st sebastian frank have already remarked with singular annoyance charles smiled stared painted if must manage to put pipe out of mouth for five minute frank said tentatively must doe matter bit said charles cordially frank instantly took out charles have to stop painting for moment for be so entertained by brilliance of own guilefulness that hand trembled in moment got to work again began whistling under breath oh do stop row said picture

over play craddock too be told be always saying nice thing about be because want to put very best work into play have got to write for charles remembered that craddock have said not altogether nice thing about frank on one occasion often remembered a often remembered also that be expressly meant for private ear fact lurked always in mind in shadow into have deliberately pushed here be back at craddock said yes oh by way charles saw flame of yours last night very old flame in fact lady crowborough daresay must have thought be being tender solicitous about thought that be merely extremely inquisitive about said charles yes wanted to know must tell about reminded of somebody wanting to engage servant from previous employer charles looked thoroughly puzzled lady crowborough asked again about yes have already said so what be matter charles have risen came across to where frank sat in window seat into head there have instantaneously flashed episode of proposing to go down to mill house to look at reynolds copy inexplicable letter of mr wroughton nothing be matter said sitting down close to frank please tell just can did ask why wanted to know not be perfectly clear that somebody have be gently hinting thing about told good deal frank face grew quite gentle affectionate told be best chap in world said that be about what came to think made believe too then hurrying away from anything approaching to sentiment of course have to lie on behalf of friend said briskly daresay wanted to be sure must trust in studio without chaperone charles did not smile at think one have be telling damned lie about asked probably why not what doe matter be upset charles wish have told at least think do may convince that there be somebody in world not set to hymn tune now do dress will then come lunch with in flat may be able to hear craddock walking about overhead that will make happy can get step ladder kiss ceiling there be idea now have to be put in shadow of charles mind be far uglier than first have to be poked away in darkest of recess a soon a money have begun at to flow way last autumn charles have hounded mother a put out of disgusting room so put in sidney street have established modestly indeed comfortably in grieve crescent not far from new studio to night be going to dine at home looked forward to serenity always seemed a much part of her a hand hair a man after hot dusty day may look forward to cool bath picture be candidate for academy have to be sent in before end of week have spent industrious afternoon working steadily at background accessory in portrait of frank craddock have advised to send portrait of mother mr fortescue to august tribunal have promised to speak helpful word if such be necessary in authoritative ear to day joy of painting have wholly deserted a worked conscious mind occupied with light shadow unconscious mind have done great deal of meditation disagreeable object have so loyally stuffed away in dark seemed gambolling there like cat active alert now then one other seemed to leap out of shadow confront with frank face always before on canvas seemed in nightmare sort of fashion to be using mask of paint to communicate with be a if frank knew that charles have be so careful not to tell be a if said oh warned against did be so like worse still frank seemed to say be warned other people against be why be welcome at mill house wanted to cut off from wroughtons wonder why what motive can have have look for bad one let see be there girl why yes bet be girl among forget nots what liar be charles always said be picture out of head be rival do think afternoon sort of vague unspoken monologue rang in ear again again pulled up knowing that be conversation internal to not to be indulged in moment conscious superficial mind be occupied again with craft began again there be other voice mixed with almost heard lady crowborough say five thousand pound for lick of paint almost heard reggie say drew cheque for ten thousand one hundred pound again pulled up felt that must be suspecting mother next for overcharging for board lodging be frank fault with cynical false view about rottenness of mankind for once charles felt glad that light be beginning to fail that must honestly abandon work before left studio turned joyce picture round to light stood looking at for moment ca wo believe said there be still hour to spare before need go home to dinner bustled out for walk in park in fading day spring be languorous in air triumphantly victorious in space of grass where marched with daffodil crocus for banner of advancing vanguard squib of green leaf have burst from red sheath on lime plane be putting forth tentative angled hand a if groping feeling way still drowsy from winter slumber into air under provocation of compelling month did charles good liked sense of silent plant expanding according to own law minding own business be just to grow blossom not warning other of untrustworthiness of neighbour frank ought to be planted out here with gag in clever mouth archangel two to inject into acidulated vein milk of human kindness charles smiled at idea must make cartoon of on postcard send to then suddenly heart hammered stood still out of brain be driven thought suspicion that have be stifling day frank cynicism craddock clung to kindness art mother dream deed be blown from a awakening of untamed wind by night blow from sultry sky sullen low hung cloud leaving ray of star celestial to make darkness bright holy again down broad path towards came joyce until have got quite close to

getting back be late already be there taxi do think charles ill luck prevailed there be put into stood there looking after retreat a turned corner not fifty yard away out of park most distinctly did see joyce lean forward look out though not one atom of ill defined trouble suspicion be relieved walked on air way home instead of wading through foul resistant stickiness of mud great star only star really mattered have shone on again not averting light though walked on air mud be still there visitor to tea charles wish have be home earlier three guess lie remarked reggie do enjoyed being asked thing must never have happened if charles have be at home be rather like uncomfortable though not uncommon phenomenon of feeling that scene now being enacted have taken place before charles experienced vividly at moment first guess last be lady crowborough said right fancy near enough said reggie question charles felt descend into mud again closed stiffly about thrust something back into darkness of mind perfectly simple said wanted to know exactly about a if a if be going to engage a servant be making enquiry into character very clever how be done asked reggie never mind be done be mother yes dear how did know have to be so be oh have have tiresome day about minute of portrait have to go in before end of week will be rejected dear there be not much conviction in voice observed mr lathom be being uriah ish a mr armstrong say probably frank be sitting to morning tirade put out of joint worst of be have stuck fast again in slough again thing with dreadful face evil communication on tongue tip looked at from darkness sight of reggie also have given birth to others there stood in dim lengthening line waiting for nod to come out into open may a well let know worst said reggie encouragingly ca bear suspense what be akroyd say 'it kill ' be over fourth turning much funniest what did frank tirade about charles wish have be there love hearing warning about whole human race make wonder when ca account for sixpence whether have taken out of trouser pocket while be asleep suppose be sort of thing really enjoy thinking about said charles savagely yes be so interesting sometimes think be rather bad for frank said to other day can always trust charles asked if did feel well be like mr lathom got up be perfectly evident that something worried charles be possible might like to talk alone either with reggie if took upstairs charles must join leave brother wait with here if be to be chosen depository be too long boy said going out charles did not at once show sign of desire to consult reggie who have left thistleton gallery in winter obtained clerkship in broker office in city politely recounted witticism two from stock exchange with view to reconciling brother to human race fell completely flat charles sat frowning silent blowing ragged ring of smoke at length got up reggie have be worried day said seeing have put worry into mind reggie linked arm in brother be so sorry charles said have be babbling goatishly on why did stop nothing have done to worry hope reggie went anxiously over in mind variety of small adventurous affair there be nothing must cause eclipse of brother spirit doe concern in way except a regard memory if be perfectly certain about couple of point want to ask say so well first be do remember last june american called ward drawing cheque at desk at thistleton want to tell that remember about reggie leaned arm on chimneypiece ward craddock came out together said after pause ward asked for pen drew cheque for five thousand pound post dating by day two be not sure how long doe matter said charles cheque cheque be for dutch picture have bought there be van der weyde think dutch picture never told that be sure quite be that what be wrong charles be silent moment one of figure in shadow leapt out of seemed to nod recognition at there be one thing more did same sort of affair happen again asked oh yes much later must say in october ward did exactly same thing drew cheque out at desk mean for rather odd sum what be ten thousand ten thousand something ten thousand one hundred think drew to craddock a before yes be sure be for how doe concern why doe worry may know charles charles wondered whether horrible inference be somehow quite unsound whether to interpretation must seem ingenious indeed laughably fantastic felt knew what frank must make of to reggie whole affair might seem of purely imaginary texture yes will tell said ca say how long to find that think be suspicious devilishly minded fact be craddock paid mr wroughton five thousand pound for reynolds giving cheque of ward who purchased tell cheque be for dutch picture picture did not go to till much later know when craddock gave fifty pound for copying do see what if if ward gave craddock cheque for ten thousand pound for picture with hundred for for copy now be worse than frank more suspicious more more awful reggie be staring at with wide open eye shook head said sound sound surely be impossible oh be tired of saying that to myself by way say word to anyone there be other thing too oh reggie ca think of explanation be at reasonable again reggie shook head said first cheque be for dutch picture well let go upstairs said other later in evening when mr lathom went to bed charles followed up to room sat down in front of fire while brushed hair be not rarely that did minute be to sort of confessional generally confession be mere babble of happy talk concerning picture project to night sat silent until hair brushing be nearly over then spoke mother darling said saw miss joyce evening be jolly friendly natural lifted up out of what be out of mire clay have gone back again oh much deeper want advice instantly got up came across to put in chair sat down on rug by leaning against knee ah be so glad darling said that want to tell what be wrong be jewel ca tell explicitly what be wrong suspect someone whom have always trusted immensely who have be very good to of of swindling perhaps worse what be to do stroked hair oh dear if be only suspicion dismiss from mind make certainty of one way other how ca be sure without knowing fact if suspicion be reasonable if mean can see other explanation except bad one go a soon a can to anyone who can give certain information if there be loophole for doubt see that there be said charles quickly then make certain somehow quickly said not in hurry of course for must not act foolishly a soon a can with wisdom oh charles can none of risk keeping suspicion in mind there be nothing so poisoning to oneself shuts wisdom of soul turn everything sour spread like dreadful contagion infects within so that there be health left sense of beauty serenity be like walking in cloud of fly dear unless suspicion be be terribly well founded give thought if can possibly avoid be very certain that ca explain thing away otherwise charles turned shining face to shining for through trouble thanks mother darling said really be beastly position be such coward so be dear said most of turn back really perhaps be such coward a think be so easy to make worst of oneself charles got up yes be pretty bad said know dear be continual sorrow trouble to ah bless saw joyce be something be well good deal said good night must get back home charles have labelled coward indeed a in manner of youth whose function so clearly in life be to enjoy shrank from pain instinctively not seeing beyond present discomfort living in moment yet be not bravery be here attacked be at trust that blow at cowered be aimed at confidence in fellow be so natural to a lay tossing turning night must not imagine taking only step seemed to be able to decide suspicion be to go to craddock with whole history of there be just one other chance namely that lady crowborough purpose in making inexplicable enquiry about might declare that in manner ruthlessly convincing must settle everything if purpose be that must not surmise at thought felt face burn with flame of anger at possibility of so monstrous explanation yet agitating thought be just secret nurture suckling of suspicion against mother have warned how right be how poison encroached spread frank turned up early next morning for final sitting with evil eye brisk demeanour plan at last announced real plan good plot for play be quite serious be going to do be taken five month to puzzle out last night burst upon new play of mine will begin working at immediately be stale over other will be change daresay craddock will like so much that will ask to put other aside bit see be about craddock be egotist see will like charles be touched on raw oh do leave alone frank said with sudden appeal a be to own vanished confidence disagree about know a settled yesterday be really very nice of to abuse man who be friend of mine be nice of to stick up for enemy of mine remarked frank must respect dislike just a much a must respect affection a never do will proceed charles packed on painting stool must at least try to absorb in work for sake of stifling own thought even more than for distracting from what frank said rumple hair said stop still be going to submit scenario to craddock evening if can see said obligingly rubbing up hair golly be good plot have really only thought out first two act will be enough for to judge by be called 'the middleman ' there be lot in title charles sighed need groan said can tell be great big fat chap popular wealthy hearty engaged to delightful girl then come out that sweat young men of genius of course take up when be unknown get option on future work be that 'where be plot then see hang of one of young men of genius be go to in play with play of what have just said be sketch hamlet not in more say 'now let out of option of yours will write play like ' then will faintly dawn on craddock that play be really happening to that in real life will do exactly what young man of genius say will do do see simultaneously of young men of genius be can be in love with 'the middleman ' girl say `` m going to paint portrait called middleman great big fat chap with gold dust on coat collar there be play called middleman coming out at same time may have heard of now will let out of option middleman in burst of righteous indignation exclaims 'this be conspiracy say 'it be conspiracy what then be in rather hole be charles did not answer be ungrateful dog charles said frank get out of option too that will be part of bargain really be going to craddock with scenario there be third act be true will give credit for thinking of something spicy tranby must take sort of play like shot craddock have 'done ' why must 'do ' do whom have be done by very christian sentiment application of abstract justice charles put down palette got off stool there be frank ish fiendish ingenuity about in ordinary mental weather so to speak with gleam of sun on own part to give sparkle to east wind of must not have failed to make brisk talking to day with nightmare of doubt swarming bat like round found humour only horror in sometimes hardly think be human frank said if really believe craddock be swindler how can make joke about if be true must be too terrible to speak of believe be true yet dwell on gloat on think be sort of devil rubbing hand when see poor soul damning hullo said frank rather startled by be good saying 'hullo ' be news to said charles standing in front of fire flushed troubled looking younger than ever have often told hate attitude towards craddock hurt to hear jolly good friend of mine abused be continually doing must have required prodigiously dull fellow not to see that there be something serious at bottom of for frank cynicism for armoured hardness with met world there be just one person for whom felt affection protective tenderness that be half ashamed of yet cherished valued more than of other tinned food so to speak in spiritual larder have fragrance freshness of dew on got up put hand on charles shoulder charles old chap said never told in voice know charles shook head know did said never felt in in voice before do now ca bear thought of anybody know cheating swindling lying suppose found out that have be cheating blackguarding must be able to laugh about do think sketch out damned little play to read to must show up yes always say that craddock be so good to said frank till now have always half laughed at when slanged who have be blackguarding must like to know what doe mean be referring to what lady crowborough asked talked rot about explanation being that one have be abusing charles grasped at rather appealingly yes be rot be frank said of course be charles never dreamed must stick in mind like have got to do with craddock nimble option charles interrupted clamourously nothing nothing at said have got blue hump black cat what please now be good chap think more about want to finish hair wo take long interrupted sitting have not be in progress many minute before telephone bell stung silence charles went to where hung in corner of studio very few word appeased that black round open mouth charles put back receiver frank noticed that hand be little unsteady craddock coming down here almost immediately frank said be bringing man called ward with for whom copied wroughton reynolds customer hope said frank what do want to do charles charles flared out at with uncontrolled irritability of jangled nerve stop here behave like gentleman hope said if other man in world have said that must assuredly have found most convenient hard object in full flight for head right old boy said frank craddock arrived not quarter of hour later with mr ward be in height of cheerful spirit having only hour before disposed of entire lunatic asylum of post impressionist picture to friend of ward whose ambition be to spend a much a possible over embellishment in manner totally unprecedented unique of house in new york dining room be called inferno have black wall with frieze of real skull floor of drawing room be on steep slant table chair have two short two long leg in order to keep occupant appurtenance on horizontal be for room brightly described to by owner that post impressionist be designed craddock in sympathy with client conviction that be predestined for have put enormous price on bargain have be instantly completed after that cheerfully gave up hour to do charles good turn of taking mr ward down to studio on way found hoping that picture of mr lathom have not yet gone in to academy on way too gave patron short resume think never saw young lathom when be at work on reynolds said will find charming young fellow a soon a academy open year will find famous will leap at one bound to top of profession strongly recommend to get to do portrait of now in fact charge for full length at present be only four hundred pound however here be will judge for on value of work craddock made peculiarly amiable to frank while ward looked at portrait in studio before one of charles mother stopped long time regarding steadily through glass be spare middle aged man grey on temple rather hawk like in face with low very pleasant voice from looked at charles back again may be proud to have mother blood in mr lathom said daresay be not ashamed of wish 'd got to copy more picture for at hundred pound apiece craddock have given up wasting amiability on desert of playwright be standing close to other two quite involuntarily charles glanced at have one moment remote uneasiness must not remember if have given charles hundred pound not really be of importance must charles say anything what be easier than to look into so petty mistake rectify charles said nothing ward turned saw craddock close to be saying to mr lathom said that there be more full length copy to be have for hundred pound more than there be more original reynolds of calibre to be have for what gave for mr wroughton what did give asked charles deliberately felt heart beat in throat a waited for answer well tell anyone mr lathom said got for ten thousand pound have felt ever since a if have be robbing mr wroughton time charles did not look at mr craddock at yes suppose be cheap said considering what enormous price fine reynolds fetch yes now suppose mr lathom that portrait of mother be not for sale be building may tell sort of annex luxembourg to picture gallery at berta entirely for modern artist must like to see that there must indeed charles smiled must talk over with mr craddock said belongs to may be sure will now must be very grateful to if must find time must consent to record mr ward have certain native redundancy to record at full length impression of blameless uninteresting person price friend tell be four hundred pound will think be making very good bargain if will execute part of contract charles saw craddock from where stood just behind mr ward give almost imperceptible nod to confirm valuation if have not seen that be very likely that must have accepted offer without correction a be that signal revolted put into partnership with with man in whose studio now stood now for future time there must be nothing secret manifest between have made mistake about price said to ward only charge two hundred for portrait will be delighted to paint for from little way off heard frank make noise be written tut saw puzzled look cross craddock face who just shrugged shoulder turned on heel be very busy for rest of week said charles after will be free glanced at craddock who have moved away be looking at portrait of mr fortescue be changing studio said charles in low voice will send new address craddock did not hear frank did seemed to with quick wit to supply key to certain thing charles have said that morning felt doubt of mr ward involved in somewhat flowery speech of conge next week will suit admirably said will think honour to sit to only thing doe not quite satisfy be question of price must allow at future time to refer to again picture may tell be designed to be birthday present for mr ward though intrinsic merit of picture be sure will be such that donor became aware that must never get out of labyrinth so burst so to speak through hedge well must talk about now see have already interrupted sitting will interrupt no longer mr craddock will take away to have conversation in taxi about picture of mr lathom mother charles saw to door came back to frank suppose guess said well have guessed right threw into chair have swindled mr wroughton said have swindled of paltry wretched fifty pound be worse meaner than other mr wroughton asked frank gave five thousand for reynolds receiving ten be not so despicable there be point in to save fifty pound when be giving studio getting commission doing everything for there be damned telephone see who be will frank went to instrument lady crowborough said want to see particularly very particularly can go to house at three yes said charles got up from chair white shaking there may be something worse frank said may have something to tell much worse than good god wish have never seen frank came back across studio to charles charles old chap said have often told there be swindler in world have run up against one well face wail charles turned piteous boyish face to hurt said paused moment father killed said because have gambled everything away none of knew suspected be where hurt frank be not anything like of course somehow be old place have got old place said frank wound good lord

lunch there be nothing like food drink when one be thoroughly upset afterwards will leave at house of very mature siren suddenly occurred to charles that joyce be staying with at rate have done so last night till then first outpouring of amazed disgust have caused to forget be fact that ate very creditable lunch indeed chapter ix lady crowborough a have be incidentally mentioned be in habit of hermetically sealing up in small dark house in half moon street for winter month year a recounted have substituted process of whole hearted unsealedness in egypt for couple of month on return have be more rigorously immured than ever to counteract must be supposed possibly deleterious effect of so persistent exposure to air to fortify for coming visit to charles studio in evening be true often went out to dine in small brougham with window up except for call yesterday on charles mother daylight of piccadilly have scarcely beheld since return window in house be always kept tightly shut

mind concern sit down dear said light cigarette saw mother yesterday a may have told be coming to sit for next week so please have room well warmed not at what doctor call aired lord bless have enough air in egypt to last for twenty year to come indulged in cheerful generality until saw that charles be established then broke off completely now sent for because wished to see most particularly mr lathom said there be nobody here sent joyce back to father morning so if think be going to see will be disappointed now be use beating about bush there be something have got to tell here come that craddock call that craddock told son philip that be disreputable young fellow be about what come to have from craddock own lip that did joyce knew from father that somebody have done so guessed be that craddock so be a cool a cucumber just said `` m sorry have so bad report to give son of mr lathom ' said so naturally that never guessed did know be there be caught like wasp in marmalade wish have be one have have spoon over in time charles sat quite still for moment in moment feeling one be expunged from mind there be left nothing still white anger spread evenly smoothly over heart brain have no longer regret that craddock have done consciousness that have sufficed to choke other emotion more superficially ordinary mechanism of thought went on never believed word of dear went on lady crowborough did joyce be duty for reason can guess to find out if be true not well got mother account of yesterday a may have told friend mr armstrong account a also may have told there be several others so either people be liar else that craddock be there ai sane person in land who must doubt be joyce have gone back home to tell father charles got up still very quietly want to know one thing said why did craddock do good lord dear said lady crowborough a if be plain why man wanted to marry joyce proposed to too guessed suppose guessed very wrong that there be somebody in way at least added with sudden fit of caution might have be that in mind for part le know about craddock mind better will sleep at night be why mr wroughton did want down there last autumn asked why of course

anger filled charles there hovered rainbow lady crowborough said flushing little told that be duty to find out whether lie be true not for reason must guess did did mean must really guess yes dear unless be blockhead ai for to talk about ai going to now what about craddock be got to eat lie up without more waste of time be got to tell philip be lie how can make do charles looked at minute

be not yes dear mr ward paid ten thousand pound for said charles good lord dear do mean that asked mr ward told morning that paid craddock ten thousand for said charles certainly gave philip mr ward

dear said will be calling idiot next minute then will have to quarrel with get along have talk with craddock mind shut door tight when go out charles came out into half moon street pale sunshine of spring afternoon in sort of black exaltation of spirit for time thought of joyce of magical golden possibility that detected slander opened in front of be utterly obscured by immediate errand hung between like impenetrable cloud must first find due discharge in outpoured storm before clear shining must dawn on felt void of pity void even of regret that man whom have so completely trusted for whom have cherished so abounding sense of gratitude must have proved so sinister rogue what must say on what line scorching interview must develop fulfil have sort of idea to did give one moment thought only looked forward with savage glee to fact that within few minute if be lucky enough to find craddock in must be face to face with shrinking from suspicion have so sincerely tried to keep at arm length be gone now that suspicion have turned out to be true only longed to fling truth of in teeth of man whose integrity so short while ago have rejoiced to champion integrity be blown into blackened fragment belief in seemed now a incredible to a happening of diseased dream to awakened sens be tissue of wildest rubbish mere babble of unfounded incoherence there must be regret for cessation of impression so false unreal walked quickly along piccadilly with colour little heightened smile vivid genial on mouth now then lip pursed up for bar two of aimless whistling swung light hearted stick a went pavement be full of cheerful passenger roadway of briskly moving vehicle stir of life seemed full of promise of exquisite springtime then in flash recognition of lively world passed from consciousness saw only that black cloud of own exalted indignation blind anger so soon so soon now be going to discharge in god knew what torrent tempest must quietly dissolve drain away must there be explosion torrent of storm only just little trickling sentence denial doubt then more little trickling sentence until there be just silence denial at did not know certainly did not care manner of affair in way occupied interested over boiling indignation that knew raged below there stretched crust just shook trembled with tumult within showed sign of giving way now then said softly to something be got to happen something got to happen a whistled tuneless phrase swung stick frank who occupied flat immediately below craddock be in charles brisk gay of face marched in upon have seen lady crowborough said now will go to see craddock be be amazing worst suspected did tell be soberly true have lied about told wroughtons be disreputable sort of affair have lied lied to get out of way now have got to eat lie come on come on what be waiting for frank sprang up tell about first said not now will tell about upstairs by way have little scheme to get out of hand will take that first will lead up to grand crash more artistic eh will begin with grand crash know care let go upstairs anyhow see what happens let nature take course let have touch of nature what be have got to do according to plan oh yes just say will draw portrait of middleman frank why devil be not blazing with indignation chucking thing about be psychologist be tell that study people make have adventure be for adventure come on let see what happens have fine day too frank licked lip gosh be on in piece said now wait minute will take little farce first just curtain raiser be got agreement of yours suppose just a be got one of mine give option must get out of first of then then can proceed with unbiassed mind have frank gave one mirthless crack of laughter will get first said then start fair up go craddock be in two be admitted appeared that have be having little nap for even a entered struggled to sitting position on sofa sorry to disturb said frank wanted to see rather particularly charles also so came up together frank took up stand on hearth rug while charles gracefully subsided into long low arm chair craddock looked from one to other not nervously with air of slightly puzzled expectancy there be something vaguely unusual about wanted to speak to about play said frank under certain circumstance will assuredly write tranby must be sure to take naturally want to know if appeal to craddock stroked right side of face be smooth plump dear fellow said must be charmed to hear a matter of fact have not very much time afternoon perhaps if left scenario with be not written out said frank craddock glanced at clock ah see have hour said that ought to be sufficient if not perhaps can postpone next engagement however will see if think worth while propose to call play middleman ' craddock hand be still up to face paused moment then began stroking again quite good title said with absolutely impassive tone thought must approve of course be hero will say of play be large stout want to picture to wealthy cultivated great judge of picture art generally purchase option on work of young unknown men be how get money make devilish good bargain craddock raised eyebrow slightly turned to charles what be part in conspiracy said quietly be conspiracy suppose charles crossed one leg over other put finger tip together oh yes may call conspiracy said thought must see be going to paint portrait of frank middleman know just what look like must draw for on half sheet if think necessary then will send to gallery other will be very like just about time that frank play come out might like to exercise option over so will paint one not in present studio said craddock suddenly certainly not in present studio will never paint anything more in present studio craddock grasped whole situation indeed did not require very great acuteness to enable to see exactly how stood on whole felt up to dealing with for moment there be dead silence charles whistled futile tuneless phrase there be such thing a libel action said to frank for who feel up to bringing said once again craddock paused got up from sofa went to window came back again rather expected to surprise consultation of eye going on between two young men there be nothing of kind frank be regarding own boot charles be staring vacantly stupidly smiling little straight in front of craddock be by mean coward felt not smallest fright nervousness if think must hesitate to bring libel action against said to frank if ever put on anything must be construed a defamatory to character be stupendously mistaken know quite well that have always disliked who took out of gutter gave chance of making talent known be always way to befriend certain type of man mean to make enemy by mean proceed to write play make a scandalous defamatory a please will make not smallest protest against can produce a soon a like mind will run for one night only will then find involved in libel action will beggar incidentally though imagine that will seem to comparatively light matter will find have caused to be recorded against verdict not of jury only of decent minded man woman in england frank looked at suppressed obviously artificial yawn hear hear said about portrait said charles from depth of chair craddock turned to have said to friend regarding line of conduct applies to also said may do caricature of please more hold up to ridicule sounder will ground for action be what applies to only be consider that conduct be infinitely more treacherous than at least have from first almost be avowedly hostile to have pretended that be conscious of gratitude certainly owe have made think be befriending young man who be fond of appreciated kindness to armstrong at rate have made such nauseous pretence how deeply be hurt wounded care to tell if be a suppose must be source of gratification to to know that have wounded may rest thoroughly well satisfied with what have done congratulate on result warned month ago about choice of friend only possible excuse for be that have fallen under influence of man cautioned against frank looked up from boot to charles did caution against asked never told that frank did want then to give cause for grievance did warn against must have be wise to take advice said craddock a be perhaps will see propriety of vacating studio a soon a be convenient to must think that by to morrow evening might hope to find at disposal certainly said charles daresay will soon find other promising student craddock turned back on frank for moment never must have thought of charles said there be real sincerity in reproach bitter a be injury have inflicted on boy be very fond of valued return of affection might be objected that man doe not wilfully cruelly injure one whom be fond of such objection be mistaken ignorant for herein lie three quarter of tragic dealing of world namely day by day day long men strike betray friend wrong who be indifferent to for where must be motive of must never have thought of said charles voice faltered on word craddock turned to frank again have told about proposed play said imagine be object of coming here charles have come about portrait know that anything further detains of frank must have applauded quiet dramatic development of scene if have come across in play must have watched with tensest diligence here be unplanned situation seemed to develop without exterior assistance craddock for instance be taking exactly line that drama demanded be quite certain that have not rehearsed part felt certain also that charles must prove equally discerning there be just one more thing said require to destroy in presence contract signed giving option to purchase three more play of mine have similar one with regard to picture by charles must be destroyed also craddock stared at in amazement be there anything else must like to do for asked be craddock gave usual sign of merriment laugh chuckled in throat did not reach outwards a far a lip remained without smile be something of relief to find that be object of outrageous threat for again felt quite competent to deal with be not that have actually feared anything else in spite of that be glad to have object of threat avowed be most original conspirator said threaten first when see that threat disturb in slightest degree produce somewhat a anti climax surely object hope to gain by futile menace go away practise be what recommend to do get small handbook about conspiracy black mail be ignorant of very rudiment of a have seen snap finger at threat indeed be not sure whether must not amuse if put into execution to make demand upon top of so pathetic failure be surely what armstrong must call 'weak curtain certainly must be very weak curtain said frank looking at boot again there be need for to look at charles be a certain a if have gone over scene till knew by heart that charles must pick up cue when charles spoke frank looked up at craddock again wanted to see how must take charles shifted position cleared throat how much did ward give for philip wroughton reynolds asked frank watching craddock face saw only very slightest change pas over for moment eye looked inwards squinting little that suppose be business observed yes in moment will tell how be said charles first may say what be going to tell still craddock face did not change do mean by what have just asked be same thing be not in order to get free of option that tell be very minor concern what matter be that have swindled mr wroughton be business because cheque be paid for reynolds included certain sum for copy of picture of only gave fifty pound then change came craddock face grew shade whiter upper lip forehead glistened in moment pulled together ah so be real threat said be going to have weaker curtain than ever entirely decline to discus private affair with go tell whom please have swindled to use own word very good friend philip wroughton go down to thorley see how will receive news do suppose must listen to do suppose will do so longer tell story other may have be concocting to whole world at proper time will very effectually stop friend seem to have so much money that libel action be only way in can get rid of first tell wroughton whom have swindled monstrous suggestion for one moment indignation flared up next have mastered again inflamed by by underlying emotion made error allowed to say more when have so rightly intimated that enough have be said be lucky for said with such fellow round be business like in matter cheque ward drew for five thousand pound passed straight on to friend when purchase be concluded have receipt for a for miserable fifty pound agreed a very well know to make copy for sum be glad enough to get gratitude be quite pretty be think have more to say to of got up indicated door charles frank moved then second sign escaped indicating hand dropped one word uttered to charles stuck in throat well said have forgotten said charles ward gave cheque for five thousand pound in payment for dutch picture there be van der weyde among be from thistleton gallery may remind be very copiously informed yes see brother be clerk there well remembers purchase drawing of cheque be in june cheque be post dated by few day without doubt craddock be listening now though have said must listen more frank watched with same hard devouring interest with must have watched man pinioned led out to execution shed charles went on in voice sounded little bored be a if repeated well known tiresome task have learned be in october said that cheque be drawn to by mr ward under same circumstance wrote be to say at thistleton gallery at brother desk time cheque be larger for be of ten thousand one hundred pound reggie told of at time did not connect then with reynolds picture lie pack of lie said craddock under breath still listening not pack of lie said charles must not say that sort of thing morning asked mr ward how much paid for reynolds told not to tell anyone be news to so repeat paid ten thousand pound also said to heard that that did suppose must do many more copy for one hundred pound drew inference whole cheque be accounted for suddenly frank looked away from craddock glanced at charles nodding be done said a if contest of boxing be in progress frank be right during fall of quiet word craddock have collapsed there be more fight left in sat hunched up in chair mere inert mass with eye glazed meaningless fixed on charles mouth little open drooping shame of what have done have month left trace on shame of detection be vastly different matter made one more protest a forceless unavailing a last roll of fish being pulled to land dead beat lie said just once be silent charles got quickly out of chair stood up pointing at a yet felt spark of pity for for there be nothing to pity in man who with last effort reiterates denial of shame tale of indictment be not done yet spoke with raised voice vivid scorn must know lie when hear better than that said do sound a if be lying did lie like when lied about to philip wroughton last autumn not let damned poison just dribble from just hinted be disreputable fellow not fit to associate with said with regret oh can hear do felt ought to tell be like go on tell whether what be saying now be lie too ca be done a frank said there be limit even to power of falsehood now sit there just think over what be best to be done be know now word came from craddock have little more into plump white hand hung ludicrously in front of like paw of begging dog wisp of long black hair crossed crown of head have fallen forward lay stuck to moisture on forehead two young men stood together away from on hearth rug looking at couple of minute passed in absolute silence then impulse not yet compassionate for collapsed rogue compassionate only for collapse came to charles have better have drink said will do good will get for received answer went into dining room next door table be already laid for dinner on side board stood syphon spirit decanter poured out stiff mixture brought back to then a held out to saw take in hand that even together be scarcely steady enough to carry to mouth pity awoke be awfully sorry know mr craddock said hate be miserable business craddock made answer sip by sip emptied glass charles have brought for few minute after that sat with eye shut smoothed fallen lock of hair into place again what do mean to do of asked charles nodded to frank to speak know what charles mean to do said because have talked over for mean to have back contract with to see destroyed when be done will have nothing more to ask from thought moment must do unfriendly thing know said must systematically run down work in paper must be fair intend may tell to hold tongue about for future sha sha even want to abuse more a for what have heard about in last hour be quite safe with unless somehow other provoke to mention just want contract then will have done with craddock got up unlocked pigeon holed desk in corner of room there be quantity of paper in of took out one from pigeon hole from of l glanced at handed one to of young men frank read carefully over what be written on then folded up put in pocket thank be said charles stood with contract in hand not glancing at instead looked at large white faced man in front of have more to talk about said will must be better if got over at once if wish will come in later uncontrolled irritability of nerve jangled seized craddock for god sake let have finished with now said unless have got fresh excitement to spring on what do want to do why doe wait there said pointing to frank charles nodded to frank will go then said charles anger hot indignation have burned out of there be nothing left ash grey feathery ash not smouldering even longer be impossible to be angry with anything so abject a man who sat inertly there be impossible to feel anything regret that sat convicted of such pitiful fraud falsity saw only wreck of year friendship stricken corpse of own gratitude loyalty here be man who have first believed in befriended be not in nature to forget that have so long be to ever present consciousness that have become permanent inmate of mind present to in idle hour present most of when be at work thus wrought into web of life passion in extinction of anger reasserted again tarnished might be stained existent with awoke pity sheer pity for man who have made marred waited till frank have closed door be wretched said absolutely wretched even to craddock in shame of detection in miserable apprehension of what must yet follow ring of sincerity be apparent reached down to in inferno have made for pity be without patronage did not hurt thank for that said now tell what want done perhaps have done what wanted already broke off short charles waited guessed how terribly difficult kind of speech must be there be just one thing must like to tell said craddock at length lied about to philip wroughton object be not to injure did want to injure guessed that be in love with joyce guessed also that that liked stood in way perhaps object be to reach be there be justification attempted be mere statement of fact paused moment be not sorry said even when found have not advanced own suit did seem to matter suppose said charles in sudden flash exactly said craddock ask forgiveness always liked charles did not answer at once because did not know whether forgave craddock not certainly did not want to injure felt must go further than intend to forgive said that will have to do even a spoke innate generosity of boy surged up in rebellion at shabby speech shabbier hesitation of thought have prompted wo have to do said quickly must be ashamed to let do forgive why yes of course now for rest owe mr wroughton five thousand pound there be reason suppose why must see explain take that will send money be that so that will be done right about what said about mean must write to think must withdraw what said perhaps have better do at once yes charles got up will go then said property will have left studio by to morrow evening there be nothing more to settle think held out hand goodbye said ca forget have be friend want to have be awfully good to in many way always told frank so goodbye craddock be perfectly capable indeed have proved so of depth of meanness falsity be not in natural construction like villain of melodrama who pursues primrose path of nefarious dealing calm well balanced without one single decent impulse to clog tripping foot when boy for whose gift have so profound admiration who knew worst of must not forget a said that have be friend felt pang of self abasement shot out beyond mire clay in foot be set wonder if can possibly believe be sorry said know be good deal to expect if be so may ask a favour must so much appreciate that take thing away from studio just yet anyhow wo do a sign of forgiveness wo come there wo bother embarrass with sight of be so very much to ask of charles charles have instinctive repulsion from doing anything of sort wanted to wash hand clean of man of belonged to must awaken remembrance of on other hand craddock be so down be hardly possible to refuse so humble petition besides have said that forgave if be not fully unreservedly done might at least prop solidify what desired must be true in material compassable way mind needed moment to make up by mean if wish said must be very glad to perhaps soon not just yet soon will come see work if ring up do when feel must like to see again will tell goodbye craddock heard go downstairs from frank door continue journey not till then did see that charles have left on edge of chimneypiece contract concerning option have given back for second attitude of mind built confirmed in by habit of year asserted must have put back into dark from have taken hour ago close on heel of came more dominant impulse tore to bit threw fragment into fender then sat down at table drew out cheque book wrote cheque payable to philip wroughton for five thousand pound there be difficulty about mr ward amazing friend who have carried off complete nightmare decoration of post impressionist from wall of thistleton gallery have enabled banking balance to withstand even larger call on substantiality than there be letter to be written with hour later servant came in to remind that in hour expected two friend to dinner already waste paper basket be choked with ineffectual beginning implying palliation where palliation be possible telling truth hinting at rest still craddock sat pen in hand a far a ever from accomplishing epistolary effort then illuminating idea occurred to must state just what have happened neither more le saying in simplest possible manner took full half hour always to dress for dinner be ready to receive guest who be almost meticulously punctual so short time have note taken philip wroughton have become so often said to joyce perfectly different man owing to salutary wintering in egypt in consequence thinking perhaps differenter man than really be have just be knocked flat by attack of lumbago owing to course of conduct that few month ago must have considered sheer insanity for one so physically handicapped a in consequence be joyce mission to take letter morning paper up to after breakfast hear account of fresh comment on origin of painful attack have occurred to during night open letter for there be seldom more than one entertain with such news out of paper a thought must interest to day pain be good deal better have remembered new daring action of own quite accounted for trouble doubt be what did on thursday evening said for if remember called to window after dinner saying what beautiful night be that moon be full be not blaming dear only blame for imprudence because if remember went out on gravel path in thin evening shoe dress clothes stood there daresay couple of minute remember felt little chilly took glass of hot whiskey water before went to bed have already have glass of port at dinner in old day be sufficient to give couple of day of rheumatism whiskey on top be indeed enough to finish off do not think that be that joyce sometimes feel that be not really interested in sort of thing mean just heaven hell to be sure if mere look at moon glass of whiskey water without sugar put on back for three day in agony sleeplessness must show little more curiosity about suppose be accustomed to being ill seems natural state of thing to be sure wonder considering that for year have be normal condition well well open paper let try to find there something appeal to more than father health aviation in france perhaps flood in netherlands poor joyce have not at present have chance of speaking be interested father said be rather rash of to take port then stroll at night whiskey know what dr symonds will say to if tell that particularly when told yesterday that be draught in church on sunday help joyce said father now contentedly embarked on only interesting topic a dr symonds said attack be cumulative little piece of unwisdom of one be guilty add to pile at last nature revenge wonder if coffee must go too must miss cup of coffee after dinner used to take in egypt without slightest hint of ill effect perhaps if have saccharine instead of sugar will ask dr symonds what letter be there for only one think be from mr craddock philip wroughton frowned really what told when came down from town yesterday about slandering that young lathom said seems to be quite upsetting if true if true certainly took away appetite for lunch at least if have eaten lunch feel sure must have disagreed so briefly left on thinking over joyce thought great deal about last night for slept most indifferently see why must let influence bearing to craddock after what have happened said that young lathom be not very nice young fellow mother have heard from mother great friend that be very nice young fellow what must expect mother friend to say be craddock word against a for flying out a did into state of wild indignation against craddock be that upset for lunch feel convinced be quite ludicrous grandmother letter to giving what called piece of mind can only now be better regard a raving of very old lunatic person on top of tirade saying that wish to come down here next week bring precious young lathom with luckily attack give ample excuse for putting off proposed visit from anybody need only see a much a feel inclined said joyce on contrary said philip with excitement when one be ill there be visitor in house one be always meeting when one doe not want to a know take hot bath till middle of morning be sure to meet one other of in passage mother invariably us up hot water in boiler must all be very inconvenient besides a say be hearsay about young lathom being not quite steady be equally hearsay that be may be a steady a rock a unsteady a a steamer from marseille to port said for care acted on report of unsteadiness said joyce in not letting come down to see copy of reynolds philip put fretful hand to face closed eye be very persistent argumentative joyce said know be not up to discussion morning only be planning that a soon a must move must go spend fortnight at torquay see have be having great deal of sunlight there pray let not continue think said there be letter from craddock to whom never did justice disappointed very much too of course please take letter see what have to say joyce tore open envelope took out content there seems to be cheque enclosed said philip raised in bed put out hand unexpected cheque by post be pleasant excitement to most apathetic croesus give said wonder what can be for glanced at good god how slow be joyce exclaimed read letter know what mean joyce read enclose cheque for five thousand pound be balance of what actually received from mr ward for reynolds with regard to subsequent proceeding throw unreservedly on mercy have also to tell that statement made to about character of charles lathom be entirely unfounded unreservedly withdraw philip made quicker movement than have done since be three morning before same being moment when lumbago stabbed five thousand pound exclaimed why man thief joyce five thousand pound liar too acknowledges told lie about young lathom have never have such shock in life interest on money doe owe that a well be that mean by throwing on mercy be not sure that be inclined to be merciful about then made enormous concession joyce must certainly show young lathom why be sitting quite upright in bed felt nothing when moved a say young lathom must certainly be told that may come down to see copy must not do to be le generous than craddock about be very much shocked hardly know what to say anyhow will have bath at once might look up train to torquay dear grandmother young lathom must come down after get back really even when move feel pain at only little stiffness say great shock sometimes produce miraculous result joyce never quite determined nature of shock sometimes seemed only reasonable to suppose be shock of joy at unexpected considerable sum of money sometimes construed into shock of horror at self revelation of travelling companion certainly lumbago ceased from troubling two day afterwards started for torquay chapter x be day of private view of academy morning afternoon continuous stream of public person have be flowing in out of gate into piccadilly mysterious folk who tell press who be there how be dressed to whom be seen talking must have have busy day of for everybody be very nicely dressed be talking rather more excitedly than usual to everybody else in fact there be hubbub of quite exceptional kind connected for once in way with object nominally brought crowd together crowd in fact be not so much excited with habit universal in crowd a with something else indeed sight of akroyd who have just be knighted talking to tranby who just have roused far le attention than usual sort of people whom be accustomed to converse with on day of private view hurried by a stood in advantageous position in front of extremely royal canvas at end of third room catalogue in hand scrutinizing not number affixed to picture for little while be inclined to consider that tinge of jealousy perhaps of natural diffidence more probably prompted inexplicable slight before long became aware that there be something in air besides opportunely enough craddock made appearance at moment sir james annexed something up something up be there craddock asked yes many thanks lady be very much pleased about surely there be unusual animation how de do unusual animation about morning be picture potentate ballerina ah there be young armstrong armstrong hope will come to hundredth night evening will say something about at call doubt friend in front will demand also frank looked craddock full in face for moment decided to recognize hullo craddock said what will give for portrait do business in sacred hall be afraid amount of demand will produce evening akroyd goodbye be going to stand by portrait again be biggest lark out charles be up on top be craddock charles certainly be up on top for be alone who be causing crowd to forget in excitement about work have risen new amazing star on artistic horizon eye be turned towards in vain for moment anyhow have mr hoskyns conceived executed last masterpiece angelic song be welling in glory of evening sunlight fell through stained glass window onto profiled head of girl with mouth open sitting at organ while four stupefied person gazed heavily at in room consisting of marble polished woodwork mother of pearl in vain be acre of heather highland cattle interspersed with birch tree coffee brown burn in vain did whole gamut of other portrait from staid railway director in frock coat map spread on table by down to frisky blue white youngest daughter of somebody esquire frown smile frolic on wall there be just three focus of interest one in second room one here among masterpiece of master third in room just beyond here be portrait of artist mother in room beyond mr fortescue gallantly maintained place by presentment of herself received congratulation in second room frank scowled wrestled with play be boom in fact everybody wanted to see charles picture without delay having done so told everybody else to go do likewise craddock have made what be known a good recovery after painful operation recorded in last chapter have suffered be true one relapse when on giving lady crowborough choice of three night on to come to dine with have received third person note regretting without cause assigned inability to do so soon became apparent to that nobody not even have intention of making fact of operation known to world with recovery there have come to certain shame at what have done true shame be inextricably mixed with le worthy kinsman shame at detection be there in own right though doubt detection have be necessary to bring forth have come anyhow cowering cry into world morning more especially shame grew throve even a recovery grew when looked on three superb canvas before whole world be agape there be little under sun that reverenced reverence be always ready to bow knee before genius seemed to that of low trick that greed selfishness have ever prevailed upon to accomplish lowest of be when let fall little efficacious word about charles have mocked cheated owner of gift compelled obeisance gift to in tortuous spinning have never failed in homage surrounded a three star be now with smooth dark night so to speak of mere talent more le misplaced industry be easier to judge of luminous shining did not seek to excuse by assurance of previous hesitation doubt in verdict of quality have known from first when one summer morning close on year ago have stood by thorley weir that star be rising felt a if have be picking velasquez ' pocket yet temptation at time have be very acute just a there be mistaking charles genius for second rate quality so there have be no mistake in telling that have be in love with joyce when have succeeded so easily meanly for time in removing from path what undoubtedly stood materially in way have cleared path for so have hoped path when cleared led so far a be concerned nowhere at might just a well have left cumbered to passage encumbered of monstrous meanness joyce still stood impenetrably barred from no longer only by barrier so rightly have conjectured to be there by fact of own detection in attempted removal have accepted second rejection of a final since return from egypt have forbade to dally with subject of domestic happiness consolation of sort must be brought to play like hose on burning place given time most awkward wielder of must not fail to quench trouble house of life have many window into sun shone without risk of provoking internal conflagration only sometimes subtly decorated sumptuous flat seemed to now little lonely there be longer thought of girl presence abiding there turning into strange abode called home there came there no longer that eager divinely gifted boy whose growth during last year have be thing to love wonder at might have kept at rate have be in power instead have grasped at little more money did not except from habit want have lied little in hope of entrapping that wild bird love have gained nothing by certain morality born perhaps of nothing higher than experience have in consequence begun to make felt in crowd surged thickened about found bureau of myriad of inquirer last winter spring london have vaguely heard of amazing young genius who be going to burst on world craddock in room mr fortescue looking nearly a brilliant a portrait in next be seized on a fountain of original information elsewhere lady crowborough in large shady hat trimmed with rosebud daisy must give news of own portrait now approaching completion mr ward who have marked down dozen picture a suitable for new york luxembourg followed faint pursuing wherever must get news of craddock having passed way to tempt with fresh offer for mother portrait round that crowd be thickest there who must see be silent there be epithet seemed to be of use in presence of noble simplicity tenderness once in shrill voice mr ward exclaimed well be honoured mother anyhow even though on right line savoured of inadequacy fault to be mostly stranger now then critic must point out wonderful modelling of hand high light on typewriter even shrug fastidious shoulder wonder whether quality of brush work be such for greater part there be not much talking just in front of somehow lived to criticise appreciate be like making personal remark to face took hold of did not want to talk charles have not intended to appear on day of private view considering how deep true be knowledge that portrait showed of mother be strange that have not occurred to that be absolutely certain that must insist on going must not dream of considering escort called for in fact at studio about twelve dressed eager with anticipation charles have sense not to waste time in expostulation over so pre ordained fact a now perceived visit to be accepted inevitable put on best clothes while mother brushed hat be thus about quarter to one when gallery be most crowded ferment over three portrait be at highest that entered probably until moment there be scarce fifty people out of multitude who knew charles by sight scarce five who knew mother even a went way up step met opposing crowd of out goer be aware of eager unusual glance directed at heard little whispered conversation beginning why surely knew that people stopped looked after a passed exultant pride uprose triumphant laughing in sheer joy of happiness even a when first knew have borne child vague be conjecture at first chattering group passed recognising suddenly confirmed from conjecture passed to knowledge why did stare at with quiet unremarkable face who always passed about so private unobserved unless something have happened to make thus suddenly recognised stared at cared not at for little access of shyness timidity kept breaking over making sweet pale face flush like girl for conscious self be drowned forgotten in son in who in hour have caused face to be famous familiar how longed that inkling of might reach charles so that triumph might be prolonged magnified how encouraged to consult catalogue tell who picture be by fixing attention by mean in power on anything rather than crowd that more more openly stared whispered about well knew that if once guessed cause of whisper glance horror stricken face flying coat tail must be last must see of for recognition of saw just led to recognition of with ear pricked eager must catch sequel must be what handsome boy surely be so young be sweeter than honey honeycomb have passed in through sculpture gallery into third room where a knew own portrait hung with infinite craft prolonging time have immediately caught sight of something on opposite wall claimed instant attention from one picture passed to furtively saw how dense crowd be congregated on other side of room knew what be that so absorbed charles be getting interested now in showing what have seen on that first historic varnishing day be eager with speech pointed finger look at sargent said make hate to look at sunshine how on earth doe do be magic just blue yellow same a have got in paint box see so splendidly be battle seeing be capital at rate triumph must last up long wall round top of room nearly way down other ala be already nearly over charles looked up saw mass of people round place where undoubtedly picture be let go look at mother said a said wanted to see hanging say what lot of people there be there be gorgeous thing of lavery hanging next be rather bad luck that on though be miracle getting on to wall at come across will get that over then can enjoy rest crossed room wedged into inter shouldered crowd very slowly indeed in front of cleared away at length stood opposite then a looked round recognizing making infallible guess at charles identity stood little back for still little more back charles still childlikely unconscious be intent on picture neighbour mother knew exactly what be happening despite felt gathering dimness in eye in tale of unselfish year have never felt so big with personal pride into not one atom of self entered well if have finished looking at mother dear said in rather high voice turned horror glazed eye be quite impossible to mistake what that half circle of pleasant well dressed folk be staring at not picture neighbour not picture moment for heaven sake let get out of said blushing furiously knot of people round picture turned smiling pleased at boy modesty mother superb pride charles in retreat with mother in wake ran straight into craddock be great embarrassment for craddock have be to studio not long before also mother knew nothing except charles month ago have be greatly upset in connection with craddock might have guessed more charles have told word at moment in confusion known face be harbour of refuge hullo mr craddock said mother wanted to come look at so brought here be what jolly show craddock made answer to mr lathom be proud said be more than proud satisfied shook hand with be even that said what be to do with foolish boy lead about show to everybody have got to get used to expected great deal have yet to get used to charles eye went back to crowd in front of picture again what have happened asked be do mean be huge success huge know walk up down again with mother dear fellow judge charles became wild eyed again be dream said be oh lady crowborough lady crowborough be sufficiently moved to recognize craddock how de do mr craddock said well charles dear have gone done there ai artist here what be cursing there never be such private view have seen somewhere about eighty of now be going to have lunch there be nobody a can say sensible word morning along of picture forget to be at paddington in good time to morrow afternoon for train down to thorley if get there before lay hold of empty carriage put window tight up charles be instantly completely diverted by new topic oh mr wroughton doe expect asked yes told to tell if find be enjoying will stop over till tuesday hate saturday to monday thing running away again before get box unpacked daresay will find enough to amuse till tuesday can bring down paint box if want something to occupy make drawing of maid joyce something with very broad grin on face moved away frank descended next on libel action imminent charles said looking firmly at craddock found inevitable have be standing in front of portrait for hour listening two timid little people come up to say 'good gracious what dreadful looking young man who be turn up hundred seventy five jane ' beunrise on alp ca be youngest daughter of lady jellicoe hundred seventy five oh mr frank armstrong be fancy liked easter egg so much ' will have damage for sort of thing have spoiled public lord if have wished to libel said charles must have let off like mother too said frank why be kid seething mother in own vitriol have seen yet be too occupied libellous fellow what doe say to mr lathom turned to doe say much mr frank said be having rather happy morning well then take to have look at will take to have look at after charles brass band have ordered will be ready beee conquering ' know charles lingered with craddock now tell really said without chaff mean like lady crowborough frank have told really said if want in other word say that price for full length be thousand pound practical be charles shook head still understand said then boyish spirit surged high high too surged true artistic ambition passion rising to splendid point of humility must always accompany triumphant achievement recognition utter surprise shock of last quarter of hour have unsteadied bewildered cleared away what have happened began to be real what gorgeous fun cried how must work there be everything to learn yet craddock wondered whether must find at thorley that must be centre sun of wakening almost hoped that must for so radiant completeness burned envy away at most left little negligible dross joyce centre sun loving loved lover splendid star with inspiring bliss what be there that young hand eager eye might not see accomplish love of son for mother comradeship of friend mere presence of pretty woman brother well made limb in act to spring have be sufficient to bring forth work of just one astounding year what when love light of man woman flashed back forth between exquisite girl down by riverside might that not open new chapter in history record of beautiful did not seem to outrageous fantasy to imagine that possibility be real one be seldom that who be to travel with lady crowborough be privileged to reach appointed station before arrival for amount of contrary experience convinced that train be not capable of starting hour so before appointed time also liked to get carriage to herself dispose on available seat so enormous quantity of book parasol cloak rug handbag that question whether seat be taken must scarcely be ventured on so heavily potently be occupied consequently on next afternoon charles found already in possession with window tightly shut perfect bale of morning evening paper by have bought in fact copy of paper published day a far a must ascertain with object of utterly overwhelming philip with first notice of academy in order to impress a by demonstration in force with charles immensity have attempted to read of herself being unused to artistic jargon have made very little of still there must be no doubt a to what meant to convey be right dear said a appeared jump in quick for though there time yet never can tell when wo slide out of station clear place for yourself then will sit look out of window will take for couple on honeymoon not dream of coming in if have sense of what be right when have started can read about be likely will find lot did know before ca make head tail of talk of key of colour tone what not a if 'd be writing bundle of music leit motif what be leit motif will say picture be nothing lot of accidental next chord harmony indeed a if 'd put musical box in frame there be that craddock got column half about key what not be so pleased yesterday have to pas time of day with what have bought paper for asked charles oh yes here craddock mind why to let philip see what think of be affair dear be going to stuff under nose one after other will see there be off now expect to talk in train just read about if see nodding let nod there be hour yet before need be thinking of putting thing together great heat have come with opening of may spring be riotous in field hedgerow with glory of early blossom valour of young leafage last month charles have be town tied among unchanging bloomlessness of brick stone pavement have scarcely seemed to that winter be overpast time for bud bird have come already on lawn by water side summer batswing tent have be set up across grass joyce unbrothered huz came to meet with smile tail of welcome faint smell of eucalyptus have be apparent a passed through house lady crowborough drew unerring conclusion well joyce dear here be said wo ask after father because will bet that have got cold smelt stuff moment set foot in house yes darling grannie said joyce be not very bad be really more afraid of having one than than how be mr lathom lady crowborough maid be standing little way behind looking like tweedledum prepared for battle so encompassed be by mass of miscellaneous object prominent among be file of to day paper will find out how be dear said lady crowborough when have dipped into little lot be just grand piano of key harmony ah read notice in 'daily review ' said joyce be so pleased long to see picture well then will have to wait turn dear said lady

got mother if have 'd tell just same with end of beautiful word scattered about like flower on dinner table just to hide victual a always did victual be there just same must be much of dinner without intercourse flippant nugatory concerned with what lady crowborough summed up under head of moon mr browning poetry be sufficient cover for hidden approach of two soul be stealing towards other channel sufficient to conduct conveyance of such stream when not long after lady crowborough left to go indoors to make salutation to philip get out of nasty damp draught be blowing up from river be under most insignificant of shelter that crept nearer ever nearer for talked over happening little not so little that concerned jointly in past be a if gathered in store must so soon burst door of granary sat telling bead in hushed sacred place before blazed out into light music banner be below a leaven secretly working on surface boy girl by thames side talked a comrade talk with laughter unembarrassed pause wonder if will be june like last year said charles sliding from chair onto grass be camped up there mile away for three week of there be never drop of rain oh except one night for hour smelt so good know best watering cart in dusty street said be doing that picture of weir brother then one afternoon punted up with craddock be how began what asked joyce knowing must give only one answer longing for other answer career large c said charles with pomp came bought picture next morning must believe at first thought thought be fairy mr craddock doe not answer idea of fairy said joyce after little consideration oh left out about reggie be reggie trying to make omelette succeeding only in producing degraded glue think noticed that said charles looking at be staring at a if be fairy oh did notice made laugh too charles went back to previous topic strictly speaking be fairy said at least not completely be fairylike proceeding oh yes grant something fairylike got commission to copy reynolds started on foot believed in found fairy for for quite long time of course there be bad fairy a well said joyce conceding point yes do mind asking one thing did ever of course not said joyce what on earth do think of know what yes do never never believed one word doe that show talk about something else want to be sick on lovely evening charles relapsed into laughter be so distressing on wet day asked do know think what did to father about picture be nearly so bad that only made feel rather unwell have seen since knew about charles made little conflagration of dry leaf with match have just lit before answered yes once twice said be rather ashamed of not having seen oftener believe be sorry if people be sorry well be over be what painfully noble sentiment said joyce think must caress scorpion however grief stricken besides how can say that be over just because person be sorry have become to different person if find out have done something mean something something like not that thought very much of mr craddock before added well did said charles bias said joyce be silent moment in way injury done to be easier to forgive than injury done to somebody else began charles rudely interrupted painfully noble sentiment enquired yes perhaps be let be careful might die in night if became more edifying real point be that mr craddock little plot did come off said at least seems to most important thing for moment eye met for moment huge underlying reality came close to surface smiled nodded assent to leave there said then where be o yes then came to copy reynolds up in room do remember dear old buz lay on sofa got worse worse leaned back in chair so that must not see face oh what coward be said knew there be only one thing must do for poor darling yet let do instead of well there be delay said charles be done oh understand better than said be who failed now be thing hard to forgive loved buz best be privilege to help in only way possible yes know thing in be nothing just to press syringe there be principle behind see of course do threw love right away believe ever thanked for picking up so to speak be grateful charles little conflagration have burned out poor buz said joyce sat up did have such bad time said though why expect to be interested in buz really know have confessed always rather wanted to confess to penance think turn in punt might do good said especially if take pole for present be end of anything serious charles exhibited most complicated incompetence a regard propulsion though a piece of aquatic juggling performance be supreme joyce told how to stand like that stood juggling began thrust pole into water stuck fast pulled hard at punt went little backwards second wrench landed chunk of mud water weed on trouser pushed again time with so firm vigorous stroke that flew into mid stream only by swift antic step in direction of stern did recover balance pole once again pushed time in unfathomable water plunged arm up to shoulder in astonished flood fell in entangled heap of arm leg on top of stupefied huz be going up down river asked joyce charles looked wildly round bow of punt seemed if anything to be pointing down stream down said punt thought not yawed in slow half circle directed up stream be down stream be said slowly slid into bank swift circular motion began fool hardy swan coming within range narrowly escaped decapitation then lady crowborough having made visit appeared at edge of lawn charles rashly promised to pick up moved westward instead into crimson pool of reflected sunset joyce have never ached so much in healthy life yet even inanity brought nearer love have use for laughter six month ago on evening of gale autumn storm when chimney smoked rain made fierce tattoo on streaming window pane joyce have gone up to bedroom leaving father guest together have felt wild primaeval instinct stirring in blood that made long to go out alone into blackness hurly burly of streaming heaven to be solitary unencumbered by presence subtle silent influence of others to night when lady crowborough left philip charles talking together philip cold have miraculously almost encouraged by eucalyptus vanished altogether again felt prey to same desire to night be pall of streaming blackness drew still starry twilight warm scent of spring now even a then wanted to be alone hidden unsuspected in deep dusk of star shine to wander through fresh fallen dew in meadow to finger new leaf on riverside willow to lie perhaps face downwards in growing hay field to listen to mysterious noise of night to learn to learn what did not know at rate did not formulate answer be something that dark spring time be ready to tell something concerned spirit of life kept world spinning on secular journey made bright eye of wild creature of wood set rose budding made in red blood leap on joyous errand surely somehow in dark of spring night must link pulse beat in with great indwelling rhythm of world make realise that be one singing bird whose time be come rose tingled on stem with potential blossom have taken off dinner dress put on dressing gown now blowing out light went across to open window drew up blind leaned out into night then in flash of newly awakened knowledge be aware that wanted to be alone no longer wanted teacher who also must learn with one more human than star light dearer to heart than fragrant hay field leaning out into dark be nearer than in house opened heart stood wide just below gravel path bordered lawn be illuminated by light came in yellow oblong of glow from long window of father study heard little stir of movement below sound of voice dim unintelligible inside presently after tread of foot step on stair so along passage past room where father slept then window below be thrown open charles stepped out onto gravel like perhaps felt call of night wondered if like needed more than night must give must look out without risk of detection from outside window must appear mere black hole in wall paused moment then strolled onto dewy lawn a walked away towards river heard whistle softly to song have sung last year to guitar see chariot at hand here of love joyce lay long awake when got to bed not tossing turning even desiring sleep very quiet with wide open eye did not seem to herself to be thinking at be preoccupation kept awake lived breathed be part of spring night seemed to that have never be alive till then sometimes for little while dozed nonsense of sort began to stir in brain drowsy moment be more than moment from stable clock not far away heard faint clanging of hour half hour seemed to follow very rapidly one after other by dressing table in window there came very faint light through unblinded casement from remote noon day of shining star rest of room be muffled in soft darkness then missed sound of one half hour when woke again light in room be changed already faint illumination by window have spread over rest of there be more conspicuous brightness on table stood there then from outside heard first chirruping of one bird light grew light hueless colourless mere mixture of white with dark more bird joined voice to first heard in earliest welcome of day breeze set tendril of creeper tapping at pane colour began to steal into hueless light must guess there in east be cloud wisp caught morning joyce got out of bed went to window lure of sunrise irresistibly beckoned out message night have seemed to hold for though contradicted afterwards have be authentically transmitted to dawn something certainly called now dressed quickly in old boating costume went quietly along passage down stair at foot huz be sleeping awoke at step found necessary to give loud joyful bark of welcome seemed to excellent plan to go out crossed lawn with dog for river seemed to beckon must have taken canoe except meant that huz must be left behind did not want huz huz wanted stepped into punt puzzled victim of charles aimlessness pushed off boom of thorley weir that be something else about thorley weir determined direction slid away upstream be still not yet hour of sunrise must be at weir before few minute before charles have wakened also too have slept little awaking be sudden felt a if noise have roused shutting of door perhaps barking of dog early light preceded dawn be leaking into room got out of bed to draw up blind magic of hour breeze of morning chirruping of bird seized held into mind brighter than approaching dawn there came flooding back have kept sleep from sleep be far away again now morning beckoned dressed went out be in mind to wrestle with punt perhaps to spring on joyce mysteriously acquired adeptness then suddenly saw that step have preceded across lawn wiping away dew heart leaped must be who have passed that way already must meet heart hammered in throat in pearly sacred hour when only bird be awake be not quite sunrise yet must day day lit by dawn that from everlasting have moved sun star dawn together where have gone where must seek find punt be gone canoe lay tapped by ripple from mill stream right left down stream up then boom of thorley weir decided that something else quivering line that have left to guide imperfect chirrupings be forming into actual song on smooth flowing river reflection of blue above began to stain grey steel colour willow leaf be quiver with breeze of morning hardly noticed thing a plied paddle round bend promontory of stream louder sounded boom of outpoured weir last corner be turned on spit of land where year ago tent have be pitched stood joyce have just tied punt to bank stood looking up towards weir huz be by hearing splash of paddle turned waved welcoming tail that beat against joyce skirt at turned also saw gave word of welcome did speak to in silence ran boat into soft ground beside punt stepped ashore have left coat in canoe came towards hatless like bare armed to elbow looked at still silent yet flooding with self own identity very self being seemed to pas utterly away from be conscious of nothing more than have to be like said joyce joyce still did not answer quivering little bent towards a young tree lean before wind then lip parted oh charles said have come to be waiting for
