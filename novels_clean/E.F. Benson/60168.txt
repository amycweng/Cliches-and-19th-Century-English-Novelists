son limited brunswick street stamford street s f bungay suffolk chapter certainly breakfast tongue be for first time that morning be not of pleasant reddish hue mr altham be justified in expecting considering that delicacy in question be not ordinary tinned tongue have to take thing a found if false sense of economy led to order tinned good one came out of fine glass receptacle with eminent label on be more of colour of cold mutton unattractive if not absolutely unpleasant to eye while to palate proved to be singularly lacking in flavour altogether be great disappointment for reason when mr altham set out at quarter past twelve to stroll along to local club in queensgate street with ostensible purpose of seeing if there be fresh telegram about disturbance in morocco wife accompanied to door of desirable mansion round be grouped variety of chained up dog in various state of boredom irritation went on into high street in order to make in person justifiable complaint at grocer must be sorry to have to take custom elsewhere if mr pritchard did not see way to sending tongue of course without further charge must be obliged so morning there be special imperative reason why mr altham must walk out before lunch to high street why husband must make morning visit to club to avoid misconception may be stated at once that there be on day of week except sunday equally compelling cause to account for expedition if be very wet perhaps mr altham might not go to high street wet fine husband went to club exactly same thing happened in case of most of friend acquaintance so that mr altham be certain of meeting general fortescue mr brodie major ames others in smoking room while mr altham encountered wife sister on errand like own in high street often professed superior distaste for gossip when met friend coming in out of shop be civil reasonable that must have few moment chat with thus if striking event have taken place since previous afternoon learned about simultaneously there be similar interchange of thought tidings going on in smoking room at club so that when mr altham have drunk glass of sherry returned home to lunch at one thirty there be probably little of importance interest have not reached ear of wife must then be discussed at meal queensgate street ran at right angle to high street debouching into thoroughfare at bottom of steep slope while grocer shop lay at top of morning be hot day of early june to woman of mr althams spare frame active limb ascent be more than pleasurable exercise vivid colour of face so unlike discouraging hue of breakfast tongue be not result of exertion be habitually there though restlessness of dark rather beady eye might have made doctor on cursory glance especially if influenza be about think that suffered from slight rise of temperature must have be in error symptom betokened not unnatural warmth of blood be visible sign of eager slightly impatient mind like inhabitant of ancient athens be always on alert to hear new thing though disliked gossip mind appreciated infinitesimal more than important smaller piece of news be more vivid be perception of firmer grip of large question produced vague impression on husband retired solicitor be singularly well adapted to be partner of life for mind very much akin to hers appetite for news be le rapacious indeed chief difference between in respect be that snapped at food like wolf in winter whereas took quietly in manner of leisurely boa constrictor capacity be in way inferior to hers similarly practised same harmless hypocrisy on other politely forbore to question others sincerity instance have already be recorded where such lack of trust might have be manifested never entered mr althams head to tell husband just now that cared nothing whatever about disturbance in morocco while must have thought very odd conduct on part to suggest sharply worded note to mr pritchard must save walk uphill on hot morning be only sensible to go on quest have not ascertained if there be news must have have nothing to talk about at lunch a be conversation never failed for little town of riseborough be crammed with interest incident for who felt proper concern in affair of other people high street morning be very full for be market day mr althams progress be le swift than usual barrow of itinerant vendor be crowded into road from edge of pavement leaving straitened channel for traffic swelled by farmer cart occasional drove of dusty perplexed looking cattle being driven in from country round more than once mr altham have to step into doorway of shop to avoid random erring of company of pig sheep made irruption on to pavement be interesting to observe in one such enforced pause impeded passage of sir james westbournes motor with owner broad faced good humoured driving to conjecture a to what business brought into town then saw that there be servant sitting in body of car while there be two portmanteau on luggage rail behind there be need for further conjecture clearly be coming from south eastern station at top of hill be driving out to place four mile distant along maidstone road then caught sight of somebody on pavement whom knew stopping car entered into conversation for moment mr altham must not see who be then a car moved on again there appeared from behind tall figure of dr evans mr altham be not so foolish a to suppose that conversation have necessarily anything to do with medical matter did not fly to conclusion that lady westbourne of child must certainly be ill to person of mental grasp be sufficient to remember that mr evans be sir james first cousin heard also baronet cheerful voice a two parted saying twenty eighth then ill tell wife that of course settled required only moment employment of power of inference to make feel convinced that saturday twenty eighth must be date for mr evans garden party there be good many garden party in riseborough about then for strawberry might be expected to be reasonably cheap probably date have be settled only morning might look forward to receiving at home card four to seven by afternoon post residential quarter of riseborough lay at top of hill on town stood clustering round fine old norman church at bottom along queensgate street passed into greater spaciousness of st barnabas road on whole might be taken to be park lane of place commanded highest rent house there in addition to being completely detached have small front garden with carriage drive long enough to hold three carriage simultaneously if horse did not mind putting nose within rubbing distance of carriage in front of while foremost projected little into road again there be good house also at top of hill where dr evans lived who lived below naturally considered advantageously placed in being sheltered from bleak easterly wind often prevailed in spring while at top wondered among in sultry summer day how be possible to exist in airless atmosphere below middle section of town be mercantile be here that lady of place from above below met other with such invariable fortuitousness in hour before lunch to day however though street be so full be for purpose of news gathering curiously deserted apart from circumstance of inferentially learning date of mr evans garden party mr altham found nothing to detain until have got to very door of mr pritchards grocery there prolonged fast be broken mr taverner be ready to give receive after business of colourless tongue be concluded in manner be perfectly creditable to mr pritchard two lady retraced step for mr taverner be of st barnabas road down hill again mr taverner quite agreed about strong probability of mr evans garden party being on twenty eighth proceeded to unload herself of far more sensational information talked rather slowly without ever stopping of own accord so that got a much into given space of time a most people even if be temporarily stopped by interruption kept mouth open so a to be able to proceed at earliest possible moment yes three week a say be long notice be not said im sure people be wise to give long notice otherwise will find guest be already engaged quantity of party a there will be summer mr ames have sent out dinner card for exactly same date be told daresay agreed together to have day full of gaiety perhaps be asked to dine there on twenty eighth mr altham not at present well then will be news to said mr taverner if what have heard be true be mr fortescues governess who told whom met taking one of child to dentist must be edward said mr altham unerringly have often noticed teeth be most irregular one here there spoke a if be more usual for child to have teeth on same spot mr taverner understood very likely indeed think have noticed well what have to tell seems very irregular too edward teeth be nothing to be talked about so miss can never recollect name from what hear think mr fortescue find very satisfactory be talked about so mr fortescues governess told at breakfast time be agreed that general fortescue must accept for if be asked three week ahead be use saying be engaged doubt mr ames gave that long notice for very reason what be be so irregular asked mr altham nearly dancing with impatience at circumlocution did not tell ah there be mr evans be told be asked too without husband how slowly walk must not be surprised if husband have told never to hurry did not see otherwise might have found out more about what asked martyred mr altham why what be saying mr ames have asked general fortescue to dine night without asking mr fortescue have asked mr evans to dine without asking dr evans dont know who rest of party be must try to find time afternoon to call on mr ames see if let anything drop about seems very odd to ask husband without wife wife without husband know yet whether dr evans will allow wife to go there without mr altham be suitably astounded never heard of such thing said expect memory be a nearly said long stopped in time clear retentive a of most people seems very strange will look a if general fortescue wife be not on good term a far a know there be reason to suppose that however be none of business be thankful to say that concern with thing concern have mr ames wanted advice a to desirability of asking husband without wife wife without husband must have be very glad to give a have not asked must suppose that doe not want be sure be very thankful to keep opinion to myself if asked what thought about must be compelled to tell truth be very glad to be spared such unpleasantness dear here be at home again have idea have come way mr taverner seemed inclined to linger other have caught sight of husband face looking out of window known a study where be accustomed to read paper in morning go to sleep in evening again be very irregular for watch on wrist told that be not yet quarter past one hour at invariably ordered glass of sherry at club to fortify for walk home possibly have heard something about revolutionary social scheme in club have hastened return in order to be able to talk over with without delay for moment occurred to to ask mr taverner to join at lunch after have heard what that lady have to tell one of smaller bundle of asparagus must not be considered ample for more than two so checked hospitable impulse hurried into study alert with suppressed information though did not propose to let explode at once for method of be to let news slip out a if accidentally even a crossed hall idea for testing truth of what have heard be simple ingenious came into head despised poor mr taverners scheme of calling on mr ames in hope of letting something drop for mr ames never let thing drop in way though be adept at picking up own plan be far more effective also harmonized well with system of mutual insincerity have be thinking dear said briskly a entered study that be time for to be asking major mr ames to dinner again yes pritchard be reasonable will send tongue take back old one be sure be quite glad that must do though must have come in for savoury very handily still be quite within right since doe not charge for must not think of quarrelling with because exercise mr altham be a keen housekeeper a wife colour must not have signified in savoury said a pritchard supply new tongue without charge can not complain about mr ames now dined with quite month ago want to think be lacking in exchange of hospitality be sure be so pleasant on side mr altham considered question caressing side of face there be doubt that have short pointed beard on chin about way up jawbone hair got shorter shorter be quite clean shaven before got up to ear be always question in fact among junior le respectful member of club whether old altham have whisker not general opinion be that have whisker be unaware of possession be odd that idea of asking mr ames to dinner occurred to to day said for be wondering also whether did not owe hospitality major ames of course added mr altham smiled bright detective smile next week be impossible know said so be week after a there be perfect rush of engagement then after might find evening free how must suit if asked mr ames few friend to dine on saturday of week let count seven fourteen twenty one yes on twenty eighth think that probably mr evans will have garden party on day must make pleasant ending to afternoon must be le of interruption to of if give up day must be better than disarranging week by sacrificing evening mr altham rang bell before replying be hardly likely that major mr ames must have engagement so long ahead said think will be sure to secure bell be answered glass of sherry said forgot dear to take glass of sherry at club young morton be talking to though dont know why call young forgot about sherry yes must think twenty eighth must be very suitable mr altham waited until parlour maid have deposited glass of sherry have completely left room with shut door behind heard very extraordinary story to day said though dont for moment believe be true if be will find that mr ames can not dine with on twenty eighth will have asked with plenty of notice so that will count one never know how little truth there may be in what mr taverner say for be mr taverner who told said that mr ames have asked general fortescue to dine with night without asking mr fortescue have invited mr evans also without husband one doesnt for moment believe if asked mr ames for same night must very likely hear about be anything said at club about mr altham affected carelessness be very far from feeling young morton did say something of sort said be not listening particularly since a know went there to see if there be anything to be learned about morocco get tired of tittle tattle did mention something of kind there be luncheon bell dear might write note immediately send by hand for james will be back from dinner by now tell to wait for answer mr altham adopted suggestion at once knew of course perfectly well that thrilling quality of news have brought husband home without waiting to take glass of sherry at club thing have not happened since morning year ago when have learned that mr fortescue have dismissed cook without character did not think of accusing of duplicity after be amiable desire to talk matter over with without loss of moment be motive at base of action so laudable motive covered else so have note written with amazing speed cordiality boot knife boy who also exercised function of gardener be instructed to wash hand go upon errand criticism of mr ames action based on hypothesis that news be true be sufficient to afford brisk conversation until return of messenger mr altham put back on plate first stick of asparagus tore note open glance be sufficient be quite true said mr ames writes be so sorry to be obliged to refuse kind invitation general fortescue millicent evans with few other friend be dining with evening well be sure so after mr taverner be right feel owe apology for doubting truth of will slip round after lunch to tell that need not call on mr ames be thinking of doing can save that trouble mr altham considered condemned wisdom of slipping round might land in unpleasantness dear said mr taverner might ask how be certain of must not like to say that asked ames to dinner on same night in order to find out be true see thing very quickly henry on other hand if mr taverner doe go to call mr ames might let drop fact that have received invitation from must sooner let mr taverner know than let get to in roundabout way will think over have doubt will be able to devise something now about mr ames new departure must say that seems to very queer piece of work if be to ask without without be other to sit at home alone for dinner for be not to be expected that somebody else will on very same night always ask other of a likely a not if there be invitation for same night will be for of for suppose that will follow mr ames example model hospitality on hers mr altham paused moment to eat asparagus be getting cold a matter of fact dear do usually follow mr ames example said may be said to be leader of society here if gave hundred guess why do follow example said mr altham rather excitedly picking up head of asparagus have fallen on napkin be sure must not give one answer that must think sensible there be dozen of friend in riseborough who be just a well born a be a many more much better off not that say that money must have anything to do with position though know a well a do that must buy house over head henry afford to keep empty while time for one dont believe that have got three hundred year between over above pay a for breeding if mr ames manner seem to so worthy of copy cant understand what be find to admire in except that walk into room a if belonged to look over everybodys head be very ridiculous a cant be more than two inch over five foot doubt if shes a much never have be able to see suppose ever will be able to see why none of can do anything in riseborough without asking mr ames leave perhaps be stupidity though know that be more stupid than most henry altham felt to blame for agitated harangue be careless of to have alluded to mr ames leadership for if there be subject in world produced specie of frenzy complete absence of full stop in wife be that desperately before now have attempted to wrest sceptre from mr ames podgy little hand to knock crown off noticeably small head have given party be positively lucullan in magnificence on first coming to riseborough regimental band part of at least have played under elm tree in garden on occasion of mere afternoon party while at dance have given thing almost unknown in riseborough there have be cotillion in present cost up to five sixpence to say nothing of trouble have given party for child at there be not only christmas tree conjuror when distinguished actor once stayed with have instead of keeping to herself be mr ames plan when person of eminence be guest asked practically whole of riseborough to lunch tea dinner to of great party have bidden mr ames with view to deposition on certainly one occasion of cotillion have heard afterwards unimpeachable evidence to show that lady have remarked that saw reason for such display therefore to day have occasional burst of volcanic amazement at mr ames undoubted supremacy made occasional frantic attempt to deprive her of throne there be method of attack have not employed have flattered admired mr ames openly to face with view to be permitted to share throne have abused vilified with view to pulling off have refrained from asking to own house for six month at time for six month at time have refused to accept of mr ames invitation be use vilification so have known for fact have be repeated to mr ames who have not taken slightest notice of abated one jot of rather condescending cordiality in spite of mr althams refusing to come to house have continued to send invitation at usual rate of hospitality indeed for last year two mr altham have really given up thought of ever deposing husband though on occasion felt to blame for convulsion felt also that might reasonably have supposed volcano to be extinct yet such be disconcerting habit of subliminal force break forth with renewed energy exactly when person of exactly average caution think that there be longer life in hastened to repair error to calm tempest by fulsome agreement well dear said certainly there be great deal in what say for have reason to suppose that everybody will ask husband wife singly that two of new set of invitation will always come for same night then too there be question of carriage hire though doe not much matter to will be important item to others for time that husband wife dine out there will be two carriage needed instead of one wonder if mr ames have thought of not said mr altham whose indignation still oozed spurted why a often a not come on foot with great golosh over evening shoe ah have brilliant idea struck did much to restore equanimity may depend upon said that mr ames mean to ask just husband wife a case may be make count will save cost of dinner now come to think of be sure must not be surprised to learn that have lost money lately major ames may have be speculating for saw financial news on table last time be there daresay be must account too for very poor dinner got salmon be in season remember only have plaice something common ordinary winter desert just orange apple noticed too henry told that have claret that couldnt have cost more than eighteenpence bottle one glass of port afterwards dinner before though there be champagne got little foam poor thing declare be sorry for if be reason be convinced be mr altham felt considerably restored by explanation got briskly up think will just run round to mr taverners said to tell there be need for to call on mr ames since have heard same story at club so that can rest assured that be true will do famously will account for everything there be pritchards cart at gate will be tongue wonder if have told man to take away pale one if not a say will serve for savoury summer have certainly come in earnest mr altham when went out on to shaded verandah to east of house in order to smoke cigar before going up to golf link found that thermometer registered eighty degree in shade consequently before enjoying that interval of quiescence succeeded meal to felt largely owed serenity of health went upstairs to change cloth coat for light alpaca jacket always wore when weather be really hot last year remembered have not put on at until end of july except on one occasion wore over ordinary coat for be loosely made taking drive along extremely dusty road heat to day certainly called for alpaca jacket settled in chair after tapping barometer observing with satisfaction that concussion produced upward tremor of needle be at set fair already feeling much more cool comfortable life in general be very cool comfortable affair to contented gentleman even in youth have not be of very exuberant vitality have passed through early year without giving moment anxiety to parent like good child who eats digest what be given so mr altham even in early manhood have accepted life exactly a found have seldom wondered what be about what be made of emotion have be stirred when met wife have once tried to write poem to soon desisting owing to obvious scarcity of rhyme in english language since then emotional record have be practically blank if happiness implies power to want to aspire quality must be denied content be so profound that need not be pitied for lack of more effervescent emotion that cared about be abundantly there be time to be read after breakfast news to be gleaned at club before lunch golf to be played in afternoon little well earned repose to be enjoyed before dinner while at odd moment looked at thermometer tapped aneroid be distinctly kindly by nature must no doubt have cheerfully put to small inconvenience in order to lighten trouble of others hardly ever found necessary to practise discomfort since with whom associated be sunk in precisely same lethargy of content a being almost completely devoid of imagination qualm questioning a to meaning of drama of life presented to annual subscription to local hospital certain parish fund connoted more to than did money paid at station for railway ticket be in fact completely characteristic of society of riseborough largely consisted of men who have retired from profession spent day with unimportant variation in precisely same manner a did necessarily be not aware of amazing emptiness of life for if have be must probably have found life very dull have tried to fill with sort of interest a be golf gardening gossip made day pas so smoothly quickly that must really have be hazardous to attempt to infuse life into for might have produced upset fermentation chronicle must convey very false impression if made seem a if life at riseborough appeared dull empty at riseborough affair of other people be so perennial source of interest that must only be detached sluggish mind be not perpetually stimulated stimulus be not of alcoholic character be succeeded by reaction headache after undue indulgence mr altham woke morning with clean palate so to speak appetite digestion quite unimpaired a yet have not to seek to fill hour of day with gardening like major ames with continuous rubber of bridge in card room at club day be full enough without additional distraction secretly rather despised a sign of senility wondered that major ames who be still supposed not much more than forty five must so soon have taken to hobby be better fitted for lady septuagenarian be not that did not like flower thought pretty enough thing in place be pleased when looked out of bathroom window in morning saw neat row of red geranium ran along border by wall between calceolaria lobelia very likely when be older other interest have faded might take to gardening too at present preferred that hired man must spend two day week in superintending operation of james certainly there must be sense in looking after vegetable garden for there be intelligible end in view there namely production of early pea giant asparagus for table since garden at cambridge house be not of larger capacity than be occupied with croquet lawn couple of flower border be impossible to grow vegetable production of new red sweet pea about major ames have really rendered tedious last summer be quite devoid of interest to especially since there be plenty of other red flower before cigar be already half smoked before recalled from pleasant vacancy of mind have succeeded summer resumal of alpaca jacket for ten minute still remained to before cab from livery stable be to take up long hill to golf link must be announced roused to greater activity of brain be natural that game with mr turner afternoon must first occupy thought felt sure must beat if only paid very strict attention to game did not let mind wander few day ago mr turner have won merely because have be rather late in arriving at club house have started with sense of hurry about to day have ordered cab at ten minute to three instead of at hour thus must both start from here arrive there without feeling of fuss appointed hour be not till quarter past three took bare fifteen minute to drive up also have on alpaca jacket must not a on last occasion of encounter be uncomfortably hot a usual must play adversary for sum of crown must pay for cab caddie thought took wider range certainly be strange thing mr ames must ask husband without wife wife without husband of course to ask mr evans without doctor be le remarkable than to ask general fortescue without wife for sometimes happened that dr evans be sent for in middle of dinner to attend on patient once when be giving party at own house have received note led to get up at once say to lady on right be afraid must go maternity case naturally have caused very painful feeling of embarrassment succeeded by buzz of feverish haphazard conversation to ask general fortescue without wife be very different affair be not possible that mr fortescue must be sent for in middle of dinner cause dislocation in party felt that if hostess except mr ames have attempted so startling innovation must even with three week notice have received chilling refusal coupled with frankly incredible reason for declining thus with growing radius of thought found considering case of mr ames undoubted supremacy in riseborough world most of what wife have said in excited harangue have be perfectly well founded mr ames be not rich marked parsimony often appeared to have presided over ordering of dinner while so far a birth be concerned at least two other resident here be related to baronet just a much a be mr evans for instance be first cousin of present sir james westbourne whereas mr ames be more distant than from same fortunate gentleman by one remove mother be to say have be eldest sister of last baronet one older than so that beyond question if mr ames mother have be boy have be boy also must now have be baronet herself in place of cheerful man who have be seen by mr altham driving motor car down high street morning a for general fortescue be actual brother of baronet there be end of matter though riseborough in general have very proper appreciation of deference due to birth mr altham felt that mr ames supremacy be not really based on so wholesale rearrangement of parent sex again be manner breeding such a compelled homage seemed to take position for granted very seldom thanked hostess for very pleasant evening when went away be remarkable for good look indeed be more nearly remarkable for absence of yet somehow mr altham must not perhaps owing to lack of imagination see anybody else not even own wife occupying mr ames position there be force about put where be felt efficiency guessed must situation arise mr ames must deal with have larger measure of reality than majority of mr althams acquaintance did not seem to exert in way call attention to what did yet when mr ames called on slightly doubtful newcomer to riseborough be certain that everybody else must call too one defect have of most glaring nature appeared to take most tepid interest only in what one said about everybody else once not so long ago mr altham have shown more than ready to question on best authority birth upbringing of mr turner election of whose husband to club have caused so many member to threaten resignation mr ames have said when be clear that shadiest antecedent be filed so to speak for perusal be have always found very pleasant woman be dinning with on tuesday again when be full of praise of mr taverner to whom mr ames be somewhat coldly disposed though lady have called three time be perhaps calling again afternoon mr ames have never once asked to lunch dine be believed to have left card without even inquiring whether be in mr ames have only answered panegyric by saying be told be very good natured sort of woman mr altham hearing stopping of cab at front door got up be still thirteen minute to three be ready to start indeed felt that motion distraction must be very welcome for there have stolen into brain strangely upsetting idea be very likely quite baseless ill founded did occur to that defect on part of mr ames a regard incuriousness on subject of small affair of other people be somehow connected with ascendency have so often thought of a defect that be quite shock to find wondering whether be quality in case be quality be glad to be without possession of must have robbed of quite nine point of law governed nature must have be obliged to cultivate passion for gardening like major ames of course if married woman quite ten year senior have to take to something be lucky major ames have not taken to drink felt quite cynical lost first four hole later too late pulled together be poor consolation to win bye only chapter ii mr ames put up black white sunshade a stepped into hot street outside dr evans house about past six on evening of twenty eighth of june proceeded afoot past half dozen house lay between high street in appearance be like small good looking toad in half mourning to state comparison with greater precision be small for woman good looking for toad face have something of sulky satiated expression of harmless reptile mourning be for brother who have mercifully died of delirium tremens six month before scarcely respectable mode of decease did not curtail sister observance of fact be proposing to wear mourning for three month have not seen much of late year a matter of fact thought be much better that inglorious career since be hopeless drunkard have be brought to conclusion mourning in spite of be faithful symbol of regret have have good look frailty of family while be possessed of complementary plainness strength remembered with remarkable poignancy even in fifty fifth year bird nesting expedition with alluring of fish in unpopulous water have shared pocket money together also a child have not be gainer by therefore thought of with peculiar tenderness must be idle to deny that be not interested in riseborough view of blackness be quite well known that be drunkard have stifled inquiry by stating that have died of failure what organ be that failed must not be inquired into one with slightest proper feeling be well aware that riseborough have almost apoplexy of proper feeling must assume that be organ not generally mentioned felt that there be call on to gratify curiosity might happen to be rampant also felt that chief joy in possession of sense of humour lie in fact that others suspect riseborough must certainly have thought very heartless of to derive amusement from thing however remotely connected with brother death riseborough also must have be incapable of crediting with tenderness of memory if have known that have actually died of delirium tremens in stifling weather almost envied who like dr evans lived at top of town where in castle street be situated charming georgian house in garden of for little while only wife for three hour have be entertaining friend detractor at garden party though house be in street not road have garden anybody must expect to belong to road if not place street seemed to imply small backyard looking into back of other house whereas dr evans house did not at back look on other house at extended full hundred yard then looked over railway cutting of south eastern line on open field must feel unkindly disposed be easy to ask whether noise of passing train be not very disagreeable indeed mr taverner in moment of peevishness arising from fact that what thought be champagne cup be only hock cup have asked that very question of millicent evans afternoon in mr ames hearing millicent in most confiding child like manner have given what mr ames considered to be wholly admirable suitable answer indeed do have said often envy beautiful big lawn for everybody of course knew that mr taverners beautiful big lawn be small piece of black earth diversified by plantain overlooked made odorous by new gasworks mr taverner have a be not unnatural coloured up on receipt of silken speech until looked nearly a red a mr altham for mr ames must not even under provocation have made so ill natured reply though be rather glad that millicent have done so to account for involuntary smile instantly mr altham to lunch with next day indeed walking now down high street smiled again at thought mr pritchard standing outside grocery store thought smiled at raised hat mr ames rather hoped saw how different sort of smile kept on tap so to speak for grocer mr ames knew very well manner of speech mr altham have be indulging in during last three week about little dinner party be giving evening for have be indiscreet enough to give specimen of to millicent evans who have promptly repeated to be impossible adequately to convey how unimportant thought be anything that mr altham said fact that have said so much be indirectly connected with asking mr altham husband of course a have rather pointedly added to lunch to morrow for knew that mr altham must be bursting with curiosity about success of new experiment intended to let burst disliked mr altham that lady hostility to herself only amused of course mr altham must not refuse to accept invitation because be point of honour in riseborough that one bidden to lunch day after dinner party must even at moderate inconvenience accept for otherwise what be to happen to remains of salmon of jelly too debilitated to be served in original shape even though untouched still excellent if eaten out of jelly glass so much malice then must be attributed to mr ames that wished to observe febrile symptom of mr althams curiosity not to calm rather excite further mr ames must not naturally have gone for social purpose to house of doctor have not married millicent whose father be own first cousin must have be baronet have be eldest instead of youngest child a be dr evans be on wholly different footing from of ordinary physician for by marriage a by birth be connected with county naturally be crown cream of riseborough society mr ames be well aware that profession of doctor be noble sacrificing one line have to be drawn somewhere be impossible to contemplate visiting dr holmes dentist profession be self sacrificing too did not dine at dentist though manipulation enabled to dine with comfort confident smile elsewhere such line a drew with precision automatic firmness apparently strange case of mr turner whom have induced husband to propose for election at club whom with wife asked to dinner be really exception for be not mr turner who have ever be stationer in riseborough father have be to public school university have since then purged taint of stationery away by twenty year impartiality a police magistrate in london true have not changed name when came back to live in riseborough must have shown greater delicacy of mind present inscription above stationer shop burrow late turner be obnoxious mr ames be against misfortune of father being visited on child riseborough with exception of mr altham have quite accepted mr mr turner who gave remarkably good dinner be quite equal to finest effort of scotch chef at club mr altham said that turner have eaten way into heart of riseborough society sounded almost witty until mr ames pointed out that be riseborough not turner who have done eating on wit in mr althams mot went out like candle in wind may perhaps be open to question whether mr althams rooted hostility to turner did not predispose mr ames to accept before quiet amiability disposed to do so for be neither disposed predisposed to like mr altham mr ames way led through queensgate street have to hold black skirt rather high a crossed road opposite club for dust be thick felt wiser also to screw small face up into tight knot in order to avoid inhaling fetid blue smoke from over lubricated motor car very rudely dashed by just in front of did not regard motor with favour since there be financial reason whose validity be unassailable why must not keep one indeed partly doubt owing to expressed disapproval of chiefly owing to similar financial impediment riseborough generally considered that hired fly be more gentlemanly certainly more leisurely form of vehicular transport mr altham a usual raised dissentient voice said that husband must not make up mind between daimler rolles royce showed very reasonable hesitancy since at present have data with regard to mr ames permitted one momentary glance at bow window of club a regained pavement after dusty passage then swiftly looked straight in front of again since be not quite quite to look in at window of man club have seen several thing husband be standing there with face contorted by imminent approach of sneeze showed that hayfever be not yet over a hoped might be there be general fortescue with large cigar in mouth glass probably of sherry in hand there be also top of bald head peering over geranium in window like pink full moon that doubt be mr turner for one be quite so bald a enjoying privilege have be instrumental in securing for then mr altham passed driving mr ames waved kissed black gloved hand to thinking how very angular curiosity made people while mr altham waved back thinking that be use trying to look important if be only five foot two so honour be about divided finally just before turned into own gate saw coming along road walking very fast a custom be man respected even revered more than one in riseborough must have liked to wave hand to too only reverend thomas pettit must certainly have thought proceeding to be very odd conduct be county too very much county although clergyman being son of wealthy distressing peer lord evesham who occasionally came into riseborough on county business on occasion lunched at club instead of going to son house did not eat club lunch preferring to devour in smoking room like ogre with false teeth sandwich seemed to be made of fish in decline mr ames who must not be called religious woman be certainly very high church be most notable of mr pettits admirer indeed have set quite fashion in going to service at st barnabas be copiously embellished by banner vestment incense indeed went there in adoration of a much a for other reason for seemed to to be perfect apostle be rich gave far more than good to feed poor be eloquent must not have used so

podgy hand in direction for greeting a turned into gate little dinner have so agitated riseborough for last three week gave mr ames qualm at happened at house be right never have reason to wonder like minor dinner giver if thing must go off well since other be responsible for feast be mr ames dinner party be summoned for quarter to eight at half past ten somebody carriage must be announced must say hope nobody be thinking of going away yet in consequence of everybody must go away at twenty minute to eleven instead if anybody expected to play card smoke in drawing room must be disappointed because diversion did not form part of curriculum gentleman have one cigarette in dining room after wine with coffee then followed lady indulged in pleasure of conversation mr ames always sat in chair by window always a clock struck ten re sorted conversationalist be without disrespect parlour trick of most supreme unfathomable kind there be always natural reason why must get up quite a naturally two three people got up too then sort of involuntary general post took place mr ames annexed seat of risen woman whose partner intended to talk to instantly said do tell because be so much interested upon new partner sat down again ejected female then wandered disconsolately forward till found talking to man who have also got up therefore sat down again together one in riseborough must do trick a mr ames must do mr altham have often tried effort always ended in everybody sitting down again exactly where have be before after standing for moment a if inaudible grace be being said mr ames though not socially jealous for being queen of riseborough society have nobody to be jealous of be little prone to spoil parlour trick when be dining at other house by suddenly developing earnest conversation with already existing partner when saw that hostess contemplated copy of famous manuvre yet after be within right for parlour trick be own patent be quite proper to thwart attempted

cardboard slip from top left hand drawer of writing table on of be printed please take in to dinner be presented in hall to men before dinner be unnecessary to write one for husband folded with name of guest in question being written on back while name of woman be to take in filled second line thus there be separate hurried communication to be made in drawing room a everything be arranged already be not so original a other parlour trick at present nobody else in riseborough have attempted then out of same drawer took what took requires fresh paragraph printed menu card there be dozen packet of packet advertising different dinner astounding device requiring enlargement of explanation discovered by chance in military store in london selected dozen packet containing fifty copy kept secret to herself parlour maid have order to tweak away a soon a last course be served so that menu collector if there be such retrospective glutton in riseborough must appropriate thus perhaps ultimately get clue might lead to solution for by portent of ill luck might then conceivably happen that certain guest must find bidden for third fourth time to eat precisely same dinner a odious collection told that have eaten six month before tweaking parlour maid obviated that risk if menu card be still absolutely unsoiled mr ames used again there be one very sumptuous dinner among twelve there be nine dinner good enough for anybody there be two dinner might be described a poor be one of probably mr altham have in mind when be so ruthless in respect to mr ames food poor sumptuous appeared to innocent riseborough world mr ames have menu card printed a required that having constructed dinner sent round copy of to printer to be set up in type probably corrected proof also never called attention to menu seemed to take a matter of course mr altham have once directly questioned about asking if be not great expense mr ames have only shifted bracelet on wrist said be accustomed to use ames took four copy of one of dinner be good enough for anybody propped up two on of long side of table naturally did not want one herself husband also naturally sometimes said what be going to give

parker to wear glove when be putting out silver be not detective be not wanting to trace by finger print parker giggled discreetly somehow mr ames servant adored rather exacting mistress stopped with for year did not get very high wage great deal be required of mr ames treated like human being not like machine may have be only because be so far removed from socially may have be that there be essential innate kindliness in shut up like parasol when have to deal with such foolish trying folk a mr altham mr altham indeed have tried to entice parker away with substantial rise in wage prospect of le arduous service that admirable serving maid have declined to be tempted also have reported occurrence to mistress only confirmed what mr ames already thought of temptress did not add further

garden wine bill cost of annual summer holiday while mr ames budget be responsible for coal electric light servant wage catering bill arising out of arrangement there occasionally arose cloud though bigger than mr ames own hand flecked brightness of domestic serenity occasionally not often mr ames must be pungent about possibility of putting out electric light on leaving room occasionally husband have sent for coat at lunch time to supplement heat given out on too parsimonious hearth such cloud be never seen by other eye than theirs presence of guest led major ames to speak of excellence of

marsala champagne for claret liqueur presented with coffee while on much rarer occasion of one sumptuous dinner always included ice liqueur made first appearance with ice glass of hock partnered fish to night therefore sherry be on offer when dinner being fairly launched mr ames took first disengaged look round observed with little annoyance justifiable even laudable in hostess that harry be talking in wrong direction in fact be devoting attention to mr evans who sat between father instead of entertaining elsie daughter whom have taken in who now sat isolated silent since general

believe when came back here found be nearly half past eleven such hour major ames gave great loud laugh be making fun of mr evans said pon word be making fun of quiet way down at riseborough ill be bound that when be in london half past eleven be more sort of time when began to go out to dance used to go out good deal when be quite young said wilfred used quite to urge to go out certainly people be very kind in asking remember one night in season be asked to two dinner party ball evening party after be natural to take pleasure in innocent gaiety when one be young major ames felt very hot after walk forgetting adventure of hair nearly removed straw hat providentially remembered again just in time upon word mr evans said jovially make feel hundred year old when talk like a if day of youth success be over why one at garden party yesterday afternoon told for fact that miss elsie be daughter of husband first wife wouldnt believe when said be daughter poor sander be mr sander who

for sweet pea mr evans have begun really herculean labour of putting in water grille of wire network fitted over rim of pea be stuck in separately looked up from task at be right asked major ames be not really untruthful man many men who be not really untruthful get through wonderful lot of misrepresentation oh mustnt give credit for that said truthfully so far dodge always used to have at mess so why not at one own house also better than written card take lot of time to copy out again again then see dear amy be not very strong at french doesnt want always to be bothering to tell whether there accent in one word two s in save time trouble mr evans applauded softly with pink finger tip ah knew be said now clearly though almost without intention major ames have gone too far to retreat also retreat implied flat contradiction of what mr evans said knew must have be rudeness from habitual gallantry naturally revolted consequently being unable to retreat have to make a safe a possible to entrench perhaps little extravagance said indeed amy think be never mention subject of menu card to shes apt to turn subject bit abruptly on word menu card dear amy after must be very dull affair pleasant life down here if completely agreed with other gave little sigh shaking head smiling at sweet pea ah how often think that too said at least now say feel have often thought be so true dear wilfred be such angel to see do be sure to think right sometimes wonder whether people who know best really understand be like be like learning thing by heart if learn thing by heart so often cease to

before dr evans arrived last at mulberry tree jove what jolly flower said thats major ames isnt how dedo well little woman how go did well not to come to church awfully hot be very long sermon daddy said elsie twenty two minute timed very interesting though youll stop to lunch major ames wont lunch at one always on sunday now major ames knew quite well that there be going to be at house lunch followed party resurrection lunch of what be dead last night there must be little bit of salmon slightly greyer than on evening before peeping out from fresh salad covered there must be sort of chaud froid there must be pink viscous fluid be debilitated descendant of strawberry ice amy have given there must also be several people including mr altham who have not be bidden to feast last night who since came according to authorized riseborough version of festivity to lunch next day must certainly be bidden to dinner on next occasion also knew well must have to say to mr altham amy have given cold luncheon to day well dont mind cold luncheon on a hot day a be chaud froid of chicken mr altham think youll find that amys cook understands chaud froid time knew that chaud froid meant dinner party on night before so did viscous fluid in jelly glass so did everything else of course mr altham knew everybody knew about lunch followed dinner party even if dinner party last night have be a secret a george fourth marriage with mr fitzherbert lunch to day must have made a public a function at st peter eaton square thought over unimaginable dislocation in routine that absence must entail wonder if ought to said fancy amy told have few friend to lunch millie evans looked up at infinitesimal a be point a to whether must lunch here at home knew that definitely entered against wife at moment ah do stop said if cousin amy have few friend why shouldnt have one got up nearly took off hat again again remembered take a command said be ordered to stop certainly telephone to mr ames wilfred say that major ames be lunching with le ordres de votre majest said brightly forgetting for moment that wife came to for help with elusive language of neighbour frenchness of bearing sentiment perhaps diverted attention from curious character of grammar chapter iv be of course a inevitable a return of day that mr altham must start hour earlier than be necessary to go to church morning in order to return to mr brook who have be dining last night at ames couple of book have be lent month two ago mr brook must recount to unusual incident of harrys taking mr evans into garden after dinner giving gradually growing bouquet of rose torn from father tree indeed be difficult to settle satisfactorily part of harrys conduct be most astounding with such completeness have revolted against beneficiary of fifth commandment cant have be out in garden for le than twenty minute said mr brook shouldnt wonder if be more for have scarcely settled after gentleman came in from dining room when went out im sure have hardly got talking again after came back before maid be announced to be sure gentleman sat long time after dinner before joining notice be always case when general fortescue be at party cant have be le than hour that be in garden now one come to add up mr brook surveyed for moment in silence piece of embroidery not for moment must be supposed that must have done embroidery for own dress on sunday morning be frontal for lectern at st barnabas must make impossible for mr ames to decorate lectern more with flower there be cross crown initial ray of light heart passion flower dove worked on with profusion of gold thread be positively american in opulence hitherto lectern have always be field of one of mr ames most telling embellishment when embroidery be finished soon must be must be driven from lectern in disorder discomfiture very rich effect said mr altham sympathetically hour dear then think said came back with dozen rose mr brook closed eye made short calculation more than dozen said daresay there be twenty rose be very marked very marked indeed if ask what think of mr ames plan of asking husband without wife wife without husband must say like at depend upon if dr evans have come too there must have be walking about in garden with master harry far be from to say there be harm in far hope be not one who condemns other people action because must not commit know be that first time late dear husband asked to walk about garden after dinner with proposed to second time asked to walk in garden with proposed again accepted then be not engaged to anybody else at time far le married like mr evans be none of business be glad to say indeed doe not concern said mr altham with avidity a say there may be harm in at young men be very impressionable even if most unattractive call distinct encouragement to young man to walk about after dinner in garden with receive present of rose im sure mr evans be old enough to be mother mr brook tacked down length of gold thread be to form part of longest ray of made little calculation be not completely satisfactory anyhow be old enough to know better said have noticed that being old enough to know better often make people behave worse mind blame there be nothing detest so much a censorious attitude only say that if gave so much encouragement to young man must blame dinner asked mr altham at least need not ask that since be going to lunch there so will soon know a well a what there be mr brook smiled in rather superior manner never know what be eating said looked a if disagreed with too whatever be be not particularly thrilling for though be generally known that harry have emotional temperament wrote amorous poem appeared to mr altham improbable lothario in case slight interest that aroused in be nothing compared to awaited husband when arrived for lunch at mr ames there have be long standing feud between mr altham hostess on subject of punctuality about two year ago mr ames have arrived at mr althams at least ten minute late for dinner mr altham have very properly retorted by arriving quarter of hour late when next be bidden to dinner with mr ames though involved sitting in dark cab for ten minute at corner of next turning so next time mr altham hoped to have pleasure of seeing major ames at dinner on thursday at quarter to eight asked rest of guest at eight with effect that mr ames husband arrived few minute before anybody else riseborough generally considered that mr altham have scored since then there have be sort of desultory pea shooting kept up such a must harm nobody to day mr altham husband arrived certainly within ten minute of hour named mr pettit who generally lunched with mr ames mr brook on sunday be already there with sister harry be morosely fidgeting in corner mr ames be only other person present in small sitting room where received guest instead of troubling to go up to drawing room instantly to go down again gave mr altham fat little hand then made remarkable statement be not waiting for anybody else think upon went into lunch harry sat at head of table instead of father mr ames be in most conversational mood be not until chaud froid consisting mainly of leg of chicken pasted over with yellow sauce concealed long blue hair root with nature have adorned lower extremity be being handed round that mr altham have opportunity to ask question have be effervescing like antiseptic lozenge on tip of tongue ever since remarked major absence where be major ames asked hope be not ill thought looked far from well at mr evans garden party yesterday mr ames set mind at rest with regard to second point inflamed on first oh said did think looked ill how good of to ask after be quite well mr pettit little more chicken after sermon mr pettit have shrewd ugly delightful face very lean very capable humanly speaking probably abhorred mr ames humanely speaking knew there be great deal of good in quantity of debateable stuff smiled showing thick white teeth before after sermon said also before childrens service bible class can not help thinking that god forgot poor clergyman when defined seventh day a one of rest mr ames hid small portion of little face with little hand always said that mr pettit be not like clergyman at how naughty of said must correct seventh day have become first day now harry gave vent to designedly audible sigh omar club be chiefly atheist felt bound to uphold principle be sort of thing confuses said mr pettit say sunday be called day of rest mother say that god meant what call monday saturday have be behaving a if be tuesday wednesday mr pettit gave kindly glance quite right dear boy said spend tuesday wednesday properly god wont mind whether be thursday friday harry pushed back lank hair became omar ish do fast on friday may ask said mr ames looked pained tried to think of something to say failed mr altham thought without difficulty suppose major ames be away mr harry said even then though intention might easily be supposed to be amiable be not allowed privilege of being replied to for mr pettit cheerfully answered harrys question without shadow of embarrassment just a if did not mind what omar khayyam club thought of course do dear fellow said because lord dearest friend died that day allows to watch pray with hour two harry appeared indulgent curious said mr pettit looked at for just space of time one look at speaker with cheerful cordiality of face then turned to mother again want at church next sunday said with fat purse to be made thin be going to have offertory to finance childrens treat want to send child in parish to sea side for day harry interrupted in critical manner why sea side asked mr pettit turned to with unabated cordiality how right to ask said because sea be made also will build sand castle pick up shell must come too dear harry help to give nice day harry felt that be philistine here who needed to be put in place be not really very rude youth one who felt incumbent on to oppose christianity regarded a superstition bright idea came into head hand prepared dry land said on same supposition certainly a dear mite have always seen dry land said mr pettit with utmost good humour want to show that god thought of something never thought of then there be sand castle harry be tired did not proceed to crush mr pettit with atheistical argument be commonplace to omar khayyam club be not worth argument must only really argue with enlightened people who fundamentally agreed with be sure that mr pettit did not fulfil requirement so indulgently turned to mr altham saw at mr evans garden party yesterday said think be most wonderful person ever met be dining here last night took into garden showed rose said mr altham unable to restrain harry became parody of though might seem to be feat of insuperable difficulty supposed must get about said that be worst of little place like do be instantly known slightly viscous remains of strawberry ice be being handed mr pettit be talking to mr ames sister from pitiably christian standpoint what did hear asked harry in low voice merely that went out into garden after dinner that picked rose for harry pushed back lank hair with bony hand have heard said there be nothing more than did not see home carriage did not come there be mistake about suppose be father who saw home not laid down spoon with have be consuming viscous fluid if hear that saw home mr altham said tell be not true from what have already told gather there be talk going on there be reason for such talk paused moment then line two of intensely swinburnian effusion have written last night fermented in head making infinitely more preposterous assure that at present there be reason for such talk said earnestly now mr altham with wide interest in concerned anybody else might be expected to feel intensest curiosity on topic somehow felt very little since knew that behind talk there be really very little topic gallant misgiving of poor ugly harry seemed to destitute of real thrill on other hand wanted very much to know where major ames be being endowed with persistence of household cat may turn out of particular arm chair hundred time without producing slightest discouragement in mind reverted to own subject again be sure there be reason for such talk mr harry said with strangely unwelcome conviction will be sure to contradict if ever hear be so glad to hear major ames be not ill be afraid that absence from lunch to day might mean that be now harry a matter of fact have idea where father be since telephone message have be received by mr ames father be quite well said be picking sweet pea morning picked great bunch mr altham looked round table be decorated with rose of dinner party of evening before then where be sweet pea asked harry be not in least interested in question dont know said perhaps be in next room showed mr evans last night how la france rose looked blue when dusk fell have never noticed though turn a blue a eye how curious said mr altham didnt see sweet pea in next room surely if there have be quantity of must have noticed perhaps be in drawing room at moment mr ames voice be heard from other end of table then will have coffee outside said harry if will ring bell there be pushing back of chair mr altham passed along table to french window opened on to verandah hear major ames have be picking loveliest sweet pea morning said to hostess must be such pleasure to see always admire major ames sweet pea now be unfortunate for mr altham desired information by speech have only succeeded in giving information to mr ames who guessed without slightest difficulty where sweet pea have gone have not yet known have be picked be already considerably annoyed with husband for unceremonious desertion of luncheon party be aware that mr altham must cause fact to be a well known in riseborough a if have be inserted in column of local intelligence in county paper felt must sooner put there than let mr altham know where sweet pea be have greater objection if have studiously concealed from even to going to lunch in improvising manner with mr evans than if have gone to lunch with anybody else what minded be non appearance at institution so firmly established so faithfully observed a lunch followed dinner party at moment entire mind be set on thwarting mr altham looked interested indeed have be picking sweet pea said must scold if be only that kept away from church dont know what have done with very likely be in dressing room often like to have flower there a admire sweet pea so much pray walk down garden look at will find in full beauty of course be not in least what mr altham wanted since did not care two straw for rest of sweet pea life be scarcely worth living unless knew where particular sweet pea be a for being in dressing room felt that mr ames must have very poor opinion of intellectual capacity if thought that old wife tale like must satisfy in be partly right mr ames have indeed opinion at of mind on other hand did not for moment suppose that suggestion about dressing room must content that feeble organ be not designed to object be to stir to wilder still unsatisfied curiosity perfectly succeeded from by way mr altham emerged full speed like motor car into high road of direct question be sure be lovely said where be major ames lunching mr ames raised piece of face where there might have be eyebrow in other day told one of truth bismarck loved did not tell before went out said perhaps harry know harry where be father lunching now be ludicrous a if be possible that wife in riseborough did not know where husband be lunching harry apparently did not know either mr ames tasting joy of bull baiter goaded mr altham further by pointedly asking parker when brought coffee if knew where major be lunching of course parker did not so parker be told to cut mr altham nice bunch of sweet pea to carry away with pleasant duty of thwarting undue curiosity being performed mr ames turned to mr pettit though have not quite done with mr altham yet for have heard on best authority mr altham occasionally indulged in disgusting unfeminine habit of cigarette smoking mr brook have several time seen walking about garden with cigarette have told mr taverner who have told mr ames evidence be overwhelming mr pettit dont think of mind smell of tobacco said when be out of door so pray have cigarette harry will give one ah forgot perhaps mr altham doe not like mr altham hastened to correct impression at same time have subtle not quite comfortable sense mr ames knew about cigarette be exactly impression that lady sought to convey tactic be sound enough in way profounder knowledge of human nature must have led mr ames not to press home victory with so merciless hand in determination to thwart mr althams odious curiosity have let be seen that be thwarting must not for instance have asked parker if knew of major whereabouts for only served to emphasize undoubted fact that mr ames knew that might be taken for granted that knew that parker did not for otherwise must surely not have asked consequently mr altham erroneously a far a went came to conclusion that major be lunching alone where wife did not wish to lunch alone in next quarter of hour while sat on verandah devoted mind hostess so despised to rapid review of house of description instantly almost wrong scent be following led to right quarry argued erroneously existence of pretty woman there be pretty woman in riseborough be hardly necessary to state that made up mind to call on pretty woman without delay must be very much surprised if did not find there immense bunch of sweet pea perhaps donor mr ames guest soon went way mr pettit sister to childrens service at three althams on detective mission be left to herself except in so far a harry asleep in basket chair in garden can be considered companionship be not gifted with very great acuteness of imagination afternoon found capable of conjuring up indeed be incapable of not doing so certain amount of vague disquiet indeed tried to put away refresh mind with remembrance of thwarting mr altham though disquiet be vague be concerned with thing have at present real existence at whereas victory over inquisitive lady be fresh recent disquiet somehow be of more pungent quality at last faced instead of attempting longer to poke away out of sight millie evans be undeniably good looking woman undeniably major have be considerably attracted last night by undeniably also have done very strange thing in stopping to have lunch there when knew perfectly well that there be people lunching with at home for important rite of eating up remains of last night dinner beyond doubt have taken present of sweet pea of mr altham have so obligingly informed beyond doubt finally be ten year husband senior have be said that mr ames be not imaginative indeed there seemed to be sufficient here when be brought together to occupy very prosaic literal mind be not a if fact be new to disparity of age between herself husband have long lain dark ominous like distant thunder cloud on horizon of mind hitherto have be stationary there not apparently coming closer not giving hint of potential tempest might lurk within now seemed to have moved little up sky though might be mere fancy on part there came from drowsy distant echo of thunder must not be supposed that disquiet expressed in mr ames mind in term of metaphor like for be practically incapable of metaphor said to herself merely that be ten year older than husband that have known ever since married indeed have known before till now fact have never seemed likely to be of significance to yet ground for supposing that might be about to become significant be of most unsubstantial sort certainly if lyndhurst have not gone out to lunch to day must never have dreamed of finding disquiet in happening of evening before indeed apart from harrys absurd expedition into garden party have be markedly successful one have determined to give more of undomestic entertainment principle of assumed strangely different aspect when husband accepted invitation of kind instead of lunching at home that aspect presented in vivid colour when reflected that be ten year junior mr ames be practical woman though imagination have run unreasonably riot so told over late event so that already contemplated contingency that have real reason to anticipate considered what must be practical conduct if remote state of affair must cease to be remote have altogether passed from being in love with husband so much so indeed that must not recall with sense of reality what that unquiet sensation be like have be in love with year ago that still gave sense of possession over have not be in habit of guarding possession since there have never be reason to suppose that anybody wanted to take away remembered with sufficient distinctness sense lyndhursts garden be becoming to paramount interest in life at time sense have be composed of mixed feeling neglect relief be constituent have ceased to expect from that indefinable sensitiveness be one of prime condition of love growing atrophy of demand certainly corresponded with own inclination at same time though cessation on part of imperative need of be relief resented must have wished to continue being in love with on credit so to speak without settlement of bill being applied for year have passed since then to day that secondary discontent assumed primary importance again be more acute now than have ever be for possession be not being quietly absorbed into culture of impersonal flower so seemed possible be directly threatened there be situation imagination presented with practically put proceeded to consider from practical standpoint what be to do have justice to acknowledge that first clear signal of coolness in mutual relation now fifteen year ago have be chiefly flown by have essentially welcomed transference of affection to garden though have secretly resented at least cooling have be condoned by probably have be mistake on part determined now to rectify pathetically enough felt young still to confirm in view took trouble to go indoors look at in glass hung in hall be inevitable that must see there not what really saw what in main desired to see hair always slightly faded in tone be not really grey even if there be sign of greyness in there be nothing easier if must trust daily advertisement in paper than to restore colour not by dye by purely natural mean there have be advertisement of one such desirable lotion remembered in paper to day have noticed be supplied by chemist certainly there be little grey in hair must be easy to remedy act of mental frankness led on to there be certain premonitory symptom of stringiness about throat of loose skin round mouth eye who must keep abreast of time at not know that there be skin food be magical in effect there be one have impressed on not long before actress have written in praise affirming that wrinkle have vanished with three night treatment then there be little just little sallowness of complexion after have always be rather sallow be fortunate circumstance when got hot never got crimson in face like poor mr taverner be going to town next week for night in order to see dentist yearly precaution unproductive of pain for teeth be really excellent regular in shape white undecayed lyndhurst in early day have told be like pearl have told talked nonsense be just a much like pearl still only did not tell so poor fellow have have great trouble in regard might be supposed trouble be over now since artifice have done utmost for be much younger than there though last set fitted beautifully probably millie have seen be not real then be distinctly gouty be not often have heard optimistic assertion that hour employment with garden roller rendered thing of rheumatic tendency impossibility though publicly let random statement pas even endorsed knew array of bottle beleaguered washing stand in dressing room where sweet pea be not silent colloquy with mirror in hall occupied ten minute ten minute sufficed for arrival of one conclusion namely that did not intend to be old woman yet subtle art art of hair restorer be not dye art of skin feeder must be invoked no longer felt at old now that there be possibility of husband feeling young lip salve perhaps lip salve yet seemed hardly necessary few little bitings mumbling of lip between excellent teeth seemed to restore to very vivid colour went back to verandah where little luncheon party have have coffee pondered practical manuvres of campaign of invasion into territory of youth have once be hers lotion for hair a verified by consultation with sunday paper took fortnight application to complete work wrinkle treatment be easily comprised in for took according to eminent actress no more than three day might therefore be wiser not to let work of rejuvenation take place under lyndhursts eye for there might be critical passage in must go away for fortnight fortnight be utmost time necessary for wonderful lotion to restore faded colour return again after correspondence indicated that felt much better younger several time before have gone to stay alone with friend of hers on coast of norfolk there must be nothing in least remarkable in doing again objection loomed in sight if there be reality in supposition prompted desire to seem young again namely possible attraction of husband towards millie evans must be giving facility encouragement to by absence then immediately wisdom of course stronger than objection to presented infinitely wiser plan for be to act a if unconscious of such danger to disarm by obvious rejection of armour of own must either watch minutely not at mr pettit have alluded in sermon that morning to finer of two attitude when reminded that love thought evil seemed to poor mr ames that if by conduct appeared to think evil came to same thing behaviour towards lyndhurst when must come back from millies house followed a corollary must be completely genial must hope have have pleasant lunch if made apology for absence assure that be quite unnecessary charity must carry even further than must say that absence have be deplored by guest that have be so glad that have done a felt inclined must hope that millie be not tired with party that husband must come to dine with again soon must be while harry be at home for be immensely attracted by millie so good for boy to think about nice woman like mr ames carried out programme with pathetic fidelity husband did not get home till nearly tea time welcomed with cordiality must have be unusual even if have not gone out to lunch at to do justice must be confessed that wife scheme a already recounted be framed to meet situation at present have real existence except in mind of wife wedded to younger husband there be data for situation so to speak rather than there be danger of on side be well aware of irregularity of conduct be prepared to accept without retaliation modicum of blame for blame at awaited instead of that cordiality so genuine that in spite of fact that particularly good dinner be provided possible parallel of prodigal son did not so much a suggest to mind harry have retired to bedroom soon after dinner with certain wildness of eye portended poetry rather than repose after have gone father commented in humorous spirit about poor old harry said case of lovely woman eh amy be just same at age until met dear topic of harrys admiration for mr evans mother have intended to allude to have not yet be touched on responded cordially think harry be very much attracted by millie do mean said chuckled well thats not very difficult to see said why rascal tore off dozen of best rose for last night though heart to scold for not bad thing for young fellow to burn bit of incense before charming woman like keep out of mischief make see what nice woman be like a said used to do just same tell about said well there be colonel wife god bless how adored must have be just about harrys age for have only lately joined be woman getting on for forty good thing too for a say for kept out of mischief used to say encouraged dont believe woman like to know shes admired eh doesnt snub boy who take out in garden pick father rose for mustnt have harry boring with attention thatll never do seemed to mr ames of singularly little consequence whether harry bored millie evans not must much have preferred to be assured that husband did subsequent conversation did not reassure a to nice little woman be said thoroughly nice little woman naturally enough dear since be cousin like being treated in neighbourly fashion have great talk after lunch to day im sorry for sorry for think ought to do can to make life pleasant for drop in to tea drop in to lunch a did to day doctor wife know told that day scarcely set eye on husband when did must think of nothing microbe there really nobody in riseborough except with whom feel dear whats that french word yes with whom feel in proper milieu must like to be on such term with being cousin that must always telephone to say be dropping in that must feel equally free to drop in dropping in know thats real thing not to be obliged to wait till be asked to accept week ahead a one have got to do for formal dinner party must like to feel that mightnt be surprised to find picking sweet pea in garden that wouldnt be surprised to find sitting under mulberry tree waiting for to come in after intimacy only begin when formality cease will give soda water mr ames did not want soda water wanted to think husband have completely expressed attitude meant to adopt own adoption of have presupposed certain contrition on part with regard to unusual behaviour gave time for thought proceeded to propose just same sort of thing a in magnanimity have thought of suggesting dinner now said up till last night have always be bit formal about dinner here in riseborough if asked general snookes asked mr snookes if asked

erased there be perceptible plumpness observable in leaner place between bout of tapping dabbing sipped glass of milk brought up to bed with a deviser of skin food recommended drank such glass in middle of morning digested perfectly a external sign appeared grew there went on within accompanying corresponding rejuvenation of spirit felt very well owing doubt to brisk air milk many hour spent out of door in consequence began to feel much younger unwonted activity lightness pervaded limb took daily walk of couple of hour without fatigue be life soul of dinner table whose other occupant be host mr bertram cold grim woman with moustache husband milder with whisker only passion be for gardening seldom left ground thus mr ames took walk unaccompanied mile of firm sand when tide be low subtended cliff on mr bertrams house stood often mr ames preferred to walk along margin of sea rather than pursue more inland route to day after large wholesome lunch physical stimulus of east coast combined with mental stimulus of object in coming here gave appetite of dimension unknown at riseborough took maritime way tide be far out lower sand still shining firm from retained moisture of retreat made uncommonly pleasant walking have abandoned heeled footgear have bought at shop in village where everything inexpensive from wooden spade to stamp sticking plaster be sold pair of canvas covering technically known a sand shoe laced up with piece of white tape be juvenile light easily removable great sea jetsam of stranded seaweed general sense of youth freshness made most agreeable companion felt though mr mr bertram be with charmingly accompanied small toadlike face expressed large degree of contentment piercing pleasant surroundings a smell of syringa pierce through odour of

also picked up be about to give a companion to cornelian when sudden scurry of claw like leg about aperture showed that hermit crab be domiciled within dropped with little scream sense of danger escaped by hermit crab there be attractive piece of seaweed reminded of year when collected finer sort set with aid of pin on cartridge paper spreading out delicate frond fern like foliage there be creamy ripple of quiet sea long winged gull hovered fishing above there be sense of brown hair smoothed face felt year younger felt looked year younger be scarcely le solid satisfaction pleased not acutely viciously to think of mr althams feeling when made rejuvenated appearance in riseborough be quite certain that mr altham must suspect that have be doing something to herself mr altham must burst with envy curiosity to know what be have done although felt very kindly towards world did not deceive to extent a to imagine that must tell mr altham what have done mr altham be ingenious must like guessing that lady occupied mind little main point be that in week from now must go home again that lyndhurst must find young might might not have be right in fearing that lyndhurst be becoming sentimentally interested in millie evans be quite willing to grant that ground for fear be of slenderest might be dismissed now in week from now must have recaptured that more youthful aspect have be hers while be still of loverlike inclination towards what might be called regular good look have always be denied have once have share of youth to day felt youthful still once again believed looked a if belonged to enchanted epoch have intention of using recapture promiscuously scarcely desired general admiration only desired that husband must find attractive for little while a took quick short step along shining sand felt grow bitter towards millie evans sort of superior pity be mixed with bitterness for told that poor millie if have tried to flirt with lyndhurst must speedily find flirting alone very likely millie be guiltless in intention have only let pretty face produce unchecked effect men be attracted by pretty face owner of such face ought to keep curb on so to speak face be not fault rather misfortune woman with pretty face must be wise to make rather reserved so that manner must chill anybody who be inclined whole subject now be obsolete if there have be danger there must not be more did not blame millie must ask millie to dine with en famille be much nicer than en garon a soon a got back might be gathered from account of mr ames self communings deep down in nature lay strain of almost farcical fatuousness be not really fatuous unless be fatuous to have preserved far out into plain of middle age vision of blue mountain of youth be true that for year have be satisfied to dwell on plain now fear that husband so much younger than be turning eye to blue mountain did not belong to made desire to get out of plain ascend own blue mountain again wave to from there encourage advance felt exceedingly well in consequence told that in mind a well a physical constitution be young still while effect of bottle used with such regularity made believe that outward sign of age be erasible seemed to have be granted new lease of life in tenement that be easy to repair whole nature felt to be quickened vivified have gone far along sand tide be beginning to flow again round be great empty space shipless sea cloudless sky beach with living being in sight sudden unpremeditated impulse seized without delay sat down on shore took off shoe stocking then pulling up skirt hastily ran down to edge of water across little belt of pebble tickled hurt soft soled foot waded out into liquid rim of sea be astonished amazed at that idea of paddling have ever come into head more amazed that have have temerity to put into execution for first minute two cold touch of water on unaccustomed ankle calf made gasp little for strangeness of sensation felt that paddling playing like child in willow water expressed tone of mind just a melody of song express word to be set if have have spade must certainly have built sand castle dug moat about smile lit up small face at thought of purchasing one at universal shop furtively conveying to unfrequented beach smile almost ended in blush when tried to imagine what riseborough society must say if became known that queen not only paddled in sea seriously contemplated buying wooden spade in order to conduct building operation on lonely shore paddling though quite pleasant be not so joyous a impulse to paddle have be be not long before sat down again on beach tried to get sand out of small tight place between toe to dry foot plump little leg with most exiguous handkerchief even in midst of troublesome operation mind still ran riot planned to secrete about person one of smaller bedroom towel when went for walk next day felt a if act of paddling must have aided in elimination of wrinkle for who except really young must want to paddle to find that have impulse of really young be even better than to cultivate though with success appropriate appearance way home effervescence of spirit be hers though definitely sprang from effect of lotion skin food tonic air produced in illusion be complete be certainly ascending remote blue mountain again through clarified air must look over plain see how very flat have be that must be changed there must be more variety gaiety introduced into day for year a saw now life have be spent in small joyless hospitality in keeping place a accredited leader of riseboroughs sociality in paying share towards expense of house did not laugh much at home there have seemed nothing particular to laugh about certainly did not paddle be forming plan for paddling there now irrespective of fact that muddy canal be only water in neighbourhood did not encourage scheme there must be introduced into life lyndhursts more of spirit have to day prompted paddling exactly what form must take did not clearly foresee when have recaptured spirit a well a appearance of youth there be fear that must find difficulty in expressing suitably aglow especially a to foot tingled

felt equipped for youth again psychologically felt equipped day since first secret paddling have paddled again in secret from crevice in tumble of fallen rock daily extracted small wooden spade by aid of with many glancings around for fear of possible observer dug in sand making moat rampart first fine careless rapture of must be admitted have evaporated after one architectural afternoon have dug not because elementary pursuit expressed what felt so much a because expressed what desired to feel after did not propose to rejuvenate to extent of being nine ten year old again manner of return to riseborough demanded consideration be not sufficient merely to look up in railway guide swiftest mode of transit adopt for be not quite ordinary entry must never do to take edge off by making travel soiled dusty first appearance so laid down plan bare fact about train be train starting at convenient hour must bring to london short half hour before convenient train from distant terminus started for riseborough be impossible to make certain of catching so wrote to husband saying that must in probability get to riseborough by later train arrived there at eight begged not to meet at station to order dinner for half past eight must be nice to be at home again then came plan clearly must never do to burst on like to sit down opposite at dinner table beneath somewhat searching electric light there handicapped by fatigue of hot journey only imperfectly repaired by hasty toilet must arrive by early train though not expected till later thus must secure quiet two hour for bathing resting dressing if lyndhurst did not expect to arrive till eight be practical certainty that must be at club till that hour walk home in time to welcome arrival must then learn that have already come be dressing must be careful to let go downstairs first minute later must follow must see so in order to catch earlier train from town left cromer while morning be yet dewy have peculiar pleasure on arrival at riseborough of seeing husband from window of cab passing along street to club have moment qualm that must see initialled box on top by grace of punctual providence mr brook came out of

conjugal character put on dress have worn half dozen of time before on one occasion be meet must descend from pompous existence be destiny for year two to come be of daring rose colour most resplendent possible never failed to create impression indeed have on one of infrequent appearance heard lyndhurst say to neighbour in undertone upon soul amy look very well to night amy meant to look very well again all happened a have planned shortly after eight lyndhurst tapped at door on return from club must not be admitted at half past having heard go downstairs followed have not dressed according to custom when be alone major ames be writing note when entered only turned round in chair not getting up glad to see home dear said excuse one moment must just direct kissed waited while

good coast for bathing again looked at a spoke for moment heart beat quickened for seemed that must not see change in then sole required dissection looked at plate again believe be good coast said there be quantity of bathing machine did not bathe very wise be sure one have to be careful about chill a one get on must have be anxious about amy if have thought must be so rash a to bathe instinct of protest prompted there must have be nothing to be anxious about said seldom catch chill often paddled laid down knife fork laughed paddled asked nonsense nonsense have not meant to tell for reasonable mind have informed time that be secret expression of rejuvenation be conscious of have slipped out thoughtless assertion of youthfulness felt did indeed said found very bracing invigorating then for moment certain bitterness welled up within born from disappointment at imperceptiveness see never suffer from gout rheumatism like lyndhurst said hope have be quite free from since have be away amusement though have produced spirit of rancour in have not be in least unkindly be legitimate to find entertainment in thought of middle aged woman gravely paddling so long a have idea that there be most pathetic side to of that have inkling be unaware that paddling be expressive of feeling of recaptured youth just a be unaware that believed to be expressed in face hair remark be distinctly of nature of attack be retaliating for laughter must not resist one further answer might both soothe smart like patent ointment before changed subject well dear im sure be wonderful woman for year said by jove will be proud if im a active healthy a in ten year time dinner be soon over after left a usual to have cigarette glass of port went into drawing room stood looking on last fading splendour of sunset in west momentary bitterness in mind have quite died down again there be nothing left vague dull ache of flatness disappointment have noticed nothing of have caused such tremulous secret joy have looked on smoothed softened face seen difference there on brown unfaded hair found unaltered have only seen that have put best gown on have almost wished that have not noticed that since then might have have consolation of thinking that be ill be not must be premised that meant must find pleasure in indisposition only that indisposition must have explained imperceptiveness regretted more than must have regretted slight headache for for few minute be incapable of more than blank empty contemplation of utter failure of from have expected so much then like star even now be beginning to be lit in empty space of sky fresh point in dreary situation claimed attention be preoccupied with other matter that be blind to letter be true have be uniformly cheerful chatty preoccupied man can easily write letter without betraying preoccupation be only too evident in personal intercourse if be so what be nature of preoccupation be not cheerful star there be green light in star claimed attention be lyndhurst who be blind who saw too much have idea till came to look into matter closely how much grey hair be mingled with brown perhaps have idea restoration therefore must not be affair of surprise admiration wrinkle faced round from window a entered made call on courage conviction though saw so little quickened perhaps by light of green star saw how good looking be for year have scarcely noticed put up small face to in way suggested though did not exactly invite kiss be so nice to be home again said suggestion that meant to convey occurred to very reasonably dismissed a improbable promiscuous caress be thing long obsolete between morning evening brushed cheek with end of moustache well then be pleased said good humouredly will ring for coffee amy be not discouraged do said when have have coffee will fetch shawl for will stroll in garden will show what new flower have come out intention of be admirable actual proposal not so happy since glimmering starlight through fallen dusk must not conduce to perception of colour well stroll in garden by mean said if think will not be risky for a to flower dear will be easier to appreciate when be not dark again put up face towards time might perhaps have taken suggestion at moment parker entered with coffee how foolish of said forgot be dark let go out anyhow unless be thinking of going round to club oh time for time for said expect will be going to bed early after long journey may step round then see whats going on without conscious encouragement welcome on part suspicion darted into mind felt by process a inexplicable a by certain people be aware of presence of cat in room that be going round to see mr evans suppose have often gone round to club in evening since have be away said yes have looked in now again said on other evening have dropped in to see friend lonely old bachelor know harry be not always very lively company good thing boy have gone back to cambridge amy be always

considered not bad thing that must keep harry out of mischief finished coffee rather hastily yes within reason within reason said well if be to stroll in garden have better go out wanted shawl didnt very wise where will find one diverted again to own personal effort there be several in second tray of wardrobe said choose nice one lyndhurst something wont look hideous with pink silk smile a might almost say of coquetry accompanied speech faded completely a soon a left room face assumed that business like aspect softest youngest face wear when object be to attract instead of letting mutual attraction exercise inevitable power even though mr ames object be legitimate laudable desire to attract own husband be strange how common respectable little countenance appeared have adorned to attract admiration coquetry anxiety be pitifully mingled even a may see in haunt far le respectable than detached villa on face from mr ames must instantly have averted own hoped must bring certain white silk shawl two night ago have worn on verandah after dinner at overstrand reflected light from have noticed a stood beneath light opposite mirror in hall have made throat look especially soft

evening of dinner party harry have walked here side by side with mr evans there be only just room go first amy said will can scarcely walk abreast here took arm nonsense dear said there be there not heap of room felt vaguely uncomfortable be not only necessity of putting foot down one strictly in front of other made so anything matter dear asked question be not cruel be scarcely even careless must hardly be expected to guess for perception be not fine also be thinking about somebody else wondering how late be even if have have complete knowledge of situation about be completely ignorant must not have dealt with in more peremptory way dreary flatness to have be so impassive prey directly after dinner sense of complete failure enveloped like impenetrable fog out of fog hooted so to speak like undervitalized siren be only so glad to get back said pressing arm little hoped be glad too be back tell what have be doing time have be away like banns be for third time of asking recalled for day one by one leaving out certain part of even at moment be astonished to find how vivid recollection of be on thursday when have played golf in morning have lunched with evans stated for harry have lunched there too have culled probably last dish of asparagus in afternoon have dined alone with harry night harry have toothache next day consequently harry went to dentist in morning have played golf in afternoon that remembered because have gone to tea with mr evans afterwards that did not mention for have be alone with have talked about being misunderstood about affinity on saturday harry have gone back to cambridge having missed train have made second start after lunch have met dr evans in street that day going up to golf link since must otherwise be quite alone in evening have dined with en garon catalogue of trivial happening took quite long time in recitation below triviality there be lurking significance be not really in love with millie evans assurance to on point be perfectly honest did not put so distinctly to thought that be tremendously attracted by here be appeal to sort of deplorable sense of gallantry so terrible word only can describe terrible mind mentally called poor little lady be pretty too not very happy seemed to be incumbent on to interest amuse droppings in amused when got ready to drop out again always asked when must come to see next droppings in be clearly bright spot to in drab day be also bright spot to for be more interested in than in sweet pea there be situation come into life something clandestine must never do for instance to let amy estimable doctor get hint of probably must misunderstand imagine there be something to conceal have secret joy of bloodless intrigue considering absolute bloodlessness be amazingly wrapped up in be wonder that did not notice restored colour of amys hair rather mr evans have made conditional appointment for to night if possible possibility depending on amys fatigue be going to drop in for primarily chat be to be concerned with lighting of garden by mean of chinese lantern for nocturnal fte mr evans meant to give on birthday whole garden be to be lit since entertainment of illuminated garden with hot soup quail ice under mulberry tree be obviously new to riseborough must be sufficiently amusing to guest to walk about garden till supper time there must be supererogatory diversion beyond bridge table in verandah small band at end of garden to intervene strain between guest shriek of south eastern express already there be idea of fancy dress major ames favoured idea of fancy dress for have red velvet garment sartorially known a venetian cloak locked away upstairs be dazzling affair if white tights peeped out from below knew have leg only lamented scanty opportunity of convincing others of fact lighting of garden have to be planned first there be use in having leg in garden if garden be not properly lit whole affair be a yet pledged secret must not a man of honour tell amy about short notice for fte of sort be of consequence for be to be post prandial entertainment only post prandial entertainment at present existent in riseborough be going to bed thus everybody must be able to be happy to accept rapid rsum of made undercurrent in mind a went through in speaking voice history of last day up down narrow path passed still with hand in arm questioning showing inconceivable interest in passage of day from have left out real point of interest patience came to end before hers upon word dear said getting little chilly will go in do think im sure be tired with journey there be nothing more coming knew that even in midst of disappointment found consolation daylight must show re establishment of youthfulness more clearly than electric light have done one looked about same by electric light though in secret manner distrusted visit to club knew how impolitic must be to hint however remotely at such distrust be much better evening to acquiesce in imputation of fatigue be imputation groundless for failure fatigue one when under same condition success must only stimulate in consciousness of bitterness rose once more to lip mustnt catch cold said let go in be still only half past ten flatness failure have lasted couple of hour major ames a soon a wife have gone upstairs let out of house way lay past door of club did not enter merely observing through lit window that there be good many men in smoking room on arrival at doctor found that elsie father be playing chess in drawing room that mr evans be out in garden chose to go straight into garden found sitting under mulberry dressed in white looking rather like milky way did not get up held out hand to be nice of said how be cousin amy amy be very well said shes gone to bed early little tired with journey how be cousin amys cousin sat down on basket chair close beside creaked with weight must have special chair made for said be so big strong have seen cousin amys cousin husband heard be out here so came straight out got up think will be better then if go in tell be here said might think strange major ames jumped up with alacrity with alacrity be mingled pleasing sense of adventure by mean said then can come out again smiled at surely be playing chess with elsie suppose will interrupt game apparently dr evans did not think anything in least strange on whole be not to be wondered at since knew quite well that major ames be coming to talk over garden illumination with wife good evening major said kind of to come little woman be going to make pauper of im told there elsie what do say to putting knight there check pig said elsie then will go out major ames said millie be coming out wilfred little woman im going to defeat daughter indoors come have glass of whisky soda with before go major went out again accordingly into cool starlight wilfred be so fond of chess said play night with elsie when be at home of course be often out produced exactly effect that meant did not comment complain merely made statement arose naturally from what be going on in drawing room major ames drew inference that be expected to draw glad must come round said now for lantern must have down garden wall not too far apart six foot apart eh now ill step wall can calculate how many will want there think step full yard still not cramped in joint took half hour to settle whole scheme of lighting since major ames be not going to pay for recommended being done in somewhat lavish manner with so large number of lantern must be easily possible to see leg be strong on subject of fancy dress therell be queer turn out shouldnt wonder said expect there will be creditable costume too by jove will be quite event of year amy with little dinner will have to take back seat a say hope cousin amy wont think forward of said millie major ames said that be written pshaw forward cried why be bringing bit of life among upon word wanted rousing up bit why be public benefactor have sat down to rest again after labour of stepping out brick wall under mulberry tree where grass be dry only faint shimmer of starlight came through leaf at bottom of garden train shrieked by noise died away in decrescent thunder leaned forward little towards putting up face much a amy have done ah if only thought be making thing little pleasant said suddenly struck major ames that be expected to kiss leaned forward too think know that said wish must thank for did not move in dusk must see be smiling at looked a if be waiting made awkward forward movement kissed there be silence moment neither responded to repelled suppose people must say ought not to have let said there be harm be there after be sort of cousin have be so kind about lantern major ames be thinking almost entirely about hardly at about adventure intrigue have begun have kissed somebody el wife felt devil of fellow with wine of emotion be mingled touch of alarm must be wise to call halt take whisky soda with husband get home to amy chapter vi mr altham waited with considerable impatience next day for return of husband from club where went on most afternoon to sit in arm chair from tea time to dinner casually to learn what have happened while have be playing golf have be to call on mr ames in afternoon in consequence have matter of considerable importance to communicate must have supported that retarded spate of information though wanted to burst a soon a possible have also question to ask henry on tremendous deal depended at length heard rattle of deposited hat stick in hall went out to meet how late be henry said neednt dress mr brook if doe come in afterwards will excuse dinner be ready let come in at once now be at club last night after dinner told who be there want to be quite sure mr altham closed eye for moment a sat down looked a if be saying silent grace appearance be deceptive be only thinking for knew wife must not ask such question unless something depended on desired to be accurate then opened again helped soup with name to spoonful general fortescue said young morton mr taverner turner young turner be five spoonful three for wife two for be not very fond of soup be there time between ten eleven asked wife till half past eleven there be one else mr altham looked up brightly club waiter said page page have be dismissed for stealing sugar bill be preposterous be how found out did mean to ask about dear do want to know at moment parlour maid left room spoke in eager undertone mr ames told that major ames went up to club last night when went to bed at half past ten said told at breakfast whom found there wanted to be sure call mr mr smith then can go on talking parlour maid came back into room yes mr smith apparently went up to club at half past ten said cant have gone to club for in case must have seen have occurred to that didnt feel well went to doctor seems possible said mr altham not without enthusiasm understanding doctor meant doctor doctor have noticed how many visit have be paying to to dr jones said mr altham during time mr smith be away to pay one on very evening of return look a if a if something serious be matter dear there nothing to show that major ames went to doctor last night said mr altham gave awful glance for parlour maid be in room thoughtless remark rendered diplomatic substitution of nomenclature entirely void useless mr smith must say added mr altham in confusion proceeding to make quite clear to jane in case have doubt about suggest to other reasonable theory a to where be then said mr altham cant suggest where be dear said mr altham finding legal training supported considering that there be evidence of kind bear upon matter to know that man be not in one given place doe not show with positiveness that be at other given place doubt then went shopping at half past ten last night said mr altham with deep sarcasm there be so many shop open then high street be perfect blaze of light mr altham must be sarcastic too though seldom exercised gift quite dazzle one observed mr altham doubt be vexed at husband sceptical attitude punished by refraining from discussing point further from giving rest of news severity punished also for be bursting to tell when jane have finally withdrawn internal pressure became irresistible mr ames have done something to hair henry said have done something to face have good mind to ask what have used assure there be not grey hair left anywhere fortnight ago be a grey a coot coot be bald not grey remarked husband be mere carping henry be brown

marked who care whether be wrinkled not pleasant consideration be discontinued by sound of postman tap on front door since postman took precedence of everybody everything mr altham hurried out to see what excitement have piloted into port unfortunately there be nothing for there be large promising looking envelope for wife be stiff too looked like receptacle of invitation card one for dear said mr altham tore open gave great gasp must not guess in hundred try said then be so kind a to tell remarked husband mr altham read out in one breath without stop mr evans at home thursday july pm shakespeare fancy dress well never for while little silence of stupefaction reigned then mr altham gave great sigh have never be to fancy dress ball said think must feel very queer uncomfortable what be meant to do when get there julia just stand about look at other will seem very strange what must recommend to be suppose ought to be pair mr altham to do justice have not thought seriously about personal appearance for year a got up from table consciously faced looking glass over chimney piece be idle to deny that considered now be not within ten year of mr ames age struck a carefully regarded in perfectly honest glass even taking into full consideration mr ames have be doing to hair face still kept proper measure of difference of year between be yet too early to consider question of impersonation there be other thing suggested by contemplation of fancy dress ball to be considered first there be so much in fact that hardly knew where to begin so whisked everything up together in manner of sea pie in be possibly edible be put in oven baked there will be time enough to talk over dear said for if mr evans think be going to lash out into end of expense in getting dress for party be wrong a far a for one be concerned for matter can put on oldest clothes can borrow janes apron cap can go a darby joan indeed know if will go at though of course one wouldnt like to hurt mr evans feeling by refusing do know shouldnt in least wonder if have seen last of mr ames air of superiority leadership may depend upon that mr evans did not consult before settled to give fancy dress party be far more likely that major ames contrived between while mr ames be away settled what must go a daresay will be romeo juliet must not be in least surprised if mr ames did not go to party at tried to get something up on own account very night must be like be sure whether go not seems to that have seen last of queening over if doe not go must think must be only absentee if doe go a mr evans guest year have never thought of fancy dress party mr altham broke off in middle of address stung by splendour of sudden thought doe staying away on part said dyeing hair painting face mean that knew about along be going to be show figure of must not wonder if be a likely a not major ames will come a hamlet ophelia something equally ridiculous though be sure a far a too too solid flesh go major ames must make admirable hamlet for never saw man put on weight in manner doe in spite of garden rolling expect gardener doe for really be truth of im sure one be so secretive here in riseborough nowadays that never know how many dined at place on night unless actually go to poulterer find out whether one chicken two be sent what be saying have be saying good deal mr altham correctly guessed train of thought desired to recall in spite of secretiveness suggested that served purpose dear henry said wife rapidly accuse one of secretiveness if did misunderstood meant be that when have settled what be to go a will tell nobody there be very little sense in fancy dress entertainment if know exactly what may expect a soon a see romeo can say for certain that be major ames for instance im sure if be to go a romeo must be vastly suitable if mr ames went a juliets nurse be not sure that will like so much finery said mr altham who be thinking entirely about own dress did not care two straw about major mr ames will seem very strange nonsense dear will dine in fancy dress for evening two before will get quite used to whatever be henry do remember white satin gown scarcely wore dozen time because seemed too grand for riseborough be too be sure be quite right have be in camphor ever since used to wear roman pearl with there be three row clasp be of real pearl very thing for cleopatra recollect perfectly said mr altham mind instantly darted off again to undoubted fact that whereas major ames be stout be very thin if have be obliged to describe figure at moment must have said be boyish expense of wig seemed of account well dear white dress pearl said wife be not very encouraging with book of egyptian antiquity can easily remodel dress remember reading in roman history that cleopatra be well over thirty when julius csar be so devoted to by bust must have be much balder than be use denying that be rather heavy blow ever since mention of word cleopatra have seen complete with wig in character julius csar be sixty observed with pardonable asperity see how must make up a man of sixty for matter dear though be sure one must think be within five year of actual age see how must make up a mere girl of thirty why must not go a antony cleopatra ten year later must be better than to go a julius csar cleopatra ten year before mr altham considered be true that must find difficult to look thirty however many roman pearl wore know that be such bad idea of yours henry said certainly there be one in world who care about age want to conceal le than there be something original about suggestion antony cleopatra ten year later ah there be bell will be mr brook coming in there be telephone also upon word never have moment to ourselves must not wonder if half riseborough came to see to night will go to telephone tell be at home not word to anybody henry a to what be thinking of going a there will be surprise at rate however much other people go talking about dress if be being rung up to ask about costume say that havent given thought yet for next week mr altham be thoroughly in element have something to conceal be in delicious state of tension with superficial desire to disclose own impersonation deep rooted satisfaction of not doing so to complete happiness famous white satin still fitted be nearly insane with curiosity to know what major mr ames be going to be what whole history of projected festivity be in various other respect natural interest in affair of other people be satiated mr turner be to be mistress page be very suitable a be elderly stout did not really in least resemble miss ellen terry mr turner have selected falstaff must be recognized anywhere young morton with unwonted modesty have chosen part of apothecary in romeo juliet mr taverner be to be queen catherine almost more joyous than have persuaded mr brook not to attempt to impersonate cleopatra what mr brook feeling must be when dawned on a not inconceivably might that mr altham have seen in striking likeness to conception of hermione because did not want there to be two cleopatra did not particularly concern have asked mr brook to dinner day after entertainment acceptance must bury hatchet if indeed there be such thing a hatchet about finally have called on mr evans who have vaguely talked about midsummer night dream mr altham have taken that to be equivalent to fact that must appear a titania mr evans have distinctly intended that must so take indeed idea have occurred to not very vividly husband be going to be timon of athens again be quite satisfactory nobody knew at distinctly who timon of athens be nobody knew much about dr evans except that be usually sent for in middle of something probably same thing happened to timon of athens indeed within couple of hour of reception of mr evans invitation arrived simultaneously by local evening post spirit of demoniacal gaiety not le fierce than inspired mr altham possessed whole of invited though be gay be certainly demoniacal for quite prodigious amount of ill feeling be mingled with from time to time threatened to wreck proceeding altogether for instance only two day after invitation have be accepted mr evans have issued further intimation that there be to be dancing that evening must open at quarter past ten precisely with quadrille in be requested that everybody must take part be easy to picture private consternation presided over evening how in one house mr brook having pushed central drawing room table to one side alone humming to herself stepped in perplexed forgotten measure how next door mr mr altham violently wrangled over order of figure hummed different tune to show other pranced in different direction for here be bitter affair pain have to be suffered in loneliness for be clearly impossible to confess that practice of quadrille be so long past that memory of have vanished altogether luckily though at moment suggestion caused great deal of asperity in mr althams mind mr ames came to rescue with suggestion that a many of doubt have forgotten precise manner of quadrille proposed to hold class at past four to morrow afternoon when must run through quadrille together there thought a much said mr altham mean that major mr ames can remember how quadrille go forsooth must go teach put that be going to teach be sure will never teach will not go near house require to be taught quadrille by anybody still le by mr ames there be answer added to jane mr altham fidgeted in chair last night have be quite sure be right in point where wife differed that particular setting partner have shown other so often did not come in quadrille at occurred in lancer just before lady chain have insisted that setting to partner lady chain came in quadrille morning however did not feel quite so certain about might send note to mr ames observed tell be not coming answer be asked for said wife excitedly just said there be to be quadrille practice at past four let there be be sure have objection though do think might have thought of doing first henry will like to know how many to expect said henry if be to be at past four must be prepared for tea be equivalent to tea party unless suppose that class will be over before five during night mr altham have pondered view about lady chain must be awful thing if henry happened to be right if on evening of dance presented hand for lady chain chain of sort followed decided on magnanimous course upon word be not sure that will not go said just to see what mr ames idea of quadrille be must not wonder if mixed up with something quite different must be laughable after ought not to be so unkind if poor mr ames feel will get into difficulty over quadrille be sure will be happy to help out doubt have summoned like so that need not show that feel want to be helped will go henry daresay will get out of what mean to dress up a pray remember to say that at rate have not given thought to costume yet on way may a well call in at mr rolands for if be to wear three row of pearl must get few more since find there be good deal of string showing daresay that ordinary pearl bead must answer purpose perfectly have intention of buying more of real roman pearl belonged to mother must not like to add to if will insist on having red stone in cap to make buckle for feather be sure must not do better than get piece of what called german ruby be in shop now suppose anybody in riseborough must tell from real after be over must wear a pendant for pearl if wish will pay half of be couple of pound altogether did not seem really handsome offer henry have sense to accept wanted stone to buckle feather in rather coquettish cap that have decided to be suitable for mark antony did not really care what happened to after have worn on occasion since be unlikely that similar occasion must arise deep in mind have be idea of turning into solitaire knew must not have practical courage of daring conception must want setting also in other house there be fewer anticipatory triumph past perplexity there be also in case wild secret intrigue for instance few evening after mr brook next door sorting out garment in wardrobe from might devise costume must remind beholder of hermione looked from bedroom window where quest be in progress saw strange sight in next garden there be lady in white satin with pearl there be gentleman in roman toga with feathered cap roman gentleman be dubious figure lady indubitable if ever there be elderly cleopatra be mr brook sat heavily down after observing sight certainly be cleopatra in next garden a certainly be snake in grass in moment mind be made up saw why have be discouraged from being cleopatra false mr altham have wanted to be cleopatra without rival must be cleopatra too riseborough must judge between effectiveness of two representation of course one knew mr altham have three row of roman pearl be nothing sort of vitreous enamel mr brook a riseborough also knew have five six row of real seed pearl be impossible to denigrer seed pearl be pearl though small did not pretend to be anything different to what be roman prefix to fair minded person invalidated word pearl besides even a cleopatra without pearl must have be willing to back against mr altham cleopatra ought to be tall be also cleopatra ought to be beautiful be mr altham have urged to go a hermione of course have to revise toilet luckily have progressed no further than sewing of white rosette on to pair of slightly worn satin shoe be equally suitable for of shakespeare heroine week have passed for mr mr altham in succession of so pleasing excitement anxiety have not be without incident to mr ames when by same post that bore invitation to other guest announcement of fancy dress ball reached read out to husband even a mr altham have done towards end of dinner expressed feeling with good deal of pooh ing opinion that at rate be past year of dressing up attitude for have be settled that invitation be to come a surprise to somewhat overdid found to dismay that wife quite agreed with be prepared a soon a dinner be over to write regret reason be not far to seek hope be not what what servant call touchy said indeed be difficult to see what else servant must call must say that considering length of time have be in riseborough number of entertainment have provided for people here think dear millie might have consulted of course lyndhurst in absence a to such novelty a fancy dress ball have wish to interfere in way with little party that dear millie may choose to give suppose since can plan without can also enjoy without be aware be by mean necessary to success of party since think that be little beyond age of dressing up lyndhurst though say agree with think will be happier at home night will write quite kindly to dear millie say be engaged doubt althams must dine with a imagine that must care to get up in fancy dress major ames be not quick thinker saw several thing without pause one be that at rate must certainly go that did not much care whether amy went not second be that having expressed surprise at announcement of party be too late now to say that knew about from first be going to impersonate antony while mr evans be to be cleopatra third be that something have to be done fourth that did not know what will leave to cigarette lyndhurst said wife rising will write to dear millie let stroll in garden again to night passed out of dining room closed door behind went straight to writing table in drawing room above hung looking glass still not in frame of mind servant call touchy sat down to write kind note considerable degree of sunset still lingered in western sky there must be no need to light candle to write by there be light enough also for to see rosy tinted image of herself in glass paused saw there what be aware mr altham have seen afternoon namely absence of grey in hair softened liquated wrinkle of face true not even yet have husband observed at rate commented on refurbished signal of youth mr ames have by mean yet despaired daily a directed tapped in emollient cream rosy light of sunset gave face flush of delicate colour unconsciously claimed for own borrowed enchantment of light then that be not touchiness underwent similar softening to of wrinkle knew have be guilty of sarcastic intention when said be aware that presence be not necessary to success of party must be unkind to dear millie if refused to go for dinner party at home be excuse at must perfectly well go on there when carriage came at twenty minute to eleven also be absurd for lyndhurst to say that be past age when dressing up be seemly in spite of hair managed very well be still young enough in face to excuse yielding to temptation of embellishing venetian mantle must naturally conceal tendency to corpulence doubt dear millie have not meant to put forward in way doubt have not yet really grasped fact that mr ames be acknowledged autocrat in concerned festivity train of thought needed few second for passage a still regarded name of heroine of enchantment sounded delicately in brain juliet ophelia passed over without pang for be not so unfocussed of imagination a to see reflection capable of recapturing budding spring of slim youthfulness of rosalind wanted girlish rle did read into precocious dignity of portia be there not one who came down green nile to sound of flute in gilded barge girl woman in charm of full maturity idea detailed in plan manuvre wanted to burst on lyndhurst like to let see in flash of revelation how bravely must support rle of sorceress at moment drawing room door opened simultaneously began sentence in identical word do know dear ive be thinking stopped gave genial laugh upon soul dear amy said believe always have same thought ill tell be going to say be going to say ive be thinking wouldnt be very kind to dear millie be what must say of course not very kind to mr evans if declined agree with dear doubt must have consulted first if be away might even a suggested have mentioned to can afford to be indulgent dear after be cousin wouldnt like to spoil party poor thing by refusing to go if go why of course will put on one side natural feeling about old fogey like making guy of will dress up somehow think have old costume with venetian cloak laid aside somewhere though daresay moth eaten rusty now ill dress up somehow come with suppose there be old stager in shakespeare must have look at fellow play again even retired old soldier can impersonate falstaff for instance stout old man of sort of speech to say least of be not be to be feared quite absolutely ingenuous then major ames be not naturally quite ingenuous have already satisfied that old costume in question have be perfectly preserved by naphthaline ball be careful to renew from time to time be not in least moth eaten rusty again since have settled to go a antony be not perfectly straightforward to make allusion to falstaff after speech expressed meant to say be only most fortunate utterance can do a much indeed perhaps leaned over little to further side of expression for struck mr ames at moment struck a violently inexplicably a cocoanut falling on head that question of venetian cloak have not come into husband mind for first time that evening felt without being able to explain feeling that idea of fancy dress ball be not new to be impossible to tax with so profound duplicity indeed when gave moment consideration to question dismissed suspicion suspicion have be there met quite way have guessed quite right lyndhurst said think must be unkind to dear millie if did not go dare say will have difficulty enough a be to make gathering will write at once be soon done even a wrote poor mr ames vision of herself grew more roseate in mind must burst upon husband must burst upon supposing preposterous suspicion of moment before be true there be more need for bursting upon for cleopatraizing meantime be wondering how on earth to keep secret of costume hostess must amy proceed to discus costume suggest king queen of denmark a suitable for might even be better to accept situation a such tell mr evans that wife wanted to go a pair so mr altham expressed that be more prudent to abandon idea of stray antony stray cleopatra meeting on evening unpremeditatedly next word caused difficulty to disappear vanished a completely a watch rabbit under wave of conjurer wand mr ames never licked envelope applied water on camel hair brush from little receptacle like tear bottle what nonsense dear lyndhurst said fancy going a falstaff must think of something better than dear be very bold idea of millies really seems to that might have great fun do hope that riseborough will not talk costume over together so that will know exactly what to expect there be little point in fancy dress ball unless there be surprise must think over costume too be not so fortunate a to have one ready got up from table still with roseate image of herself in mind think will not tell who be going to be said even when have thought of something suitable will keep a surprise for keep a surprise for lyndhurst let meet for first time in costume when carriage be at door ready to take to party do not think must be fun must promise dear that will not make up a falstaff old guy else will be quite ashamed of rang bell effusively heartiness of action be typical of welcome gave to wife suggestion ordered note to be sent by jove amy said what one always be for thinking of thing if wish ill try to make presentable figure of though im sure must be more in place at home waiting for return to hear about ill do best ill do best dare say venetian cloak isnt so shabby after have always be careful to keep bit of naphthaline in box with flirtation may not be incorrectly defined a making pretence of being in love yet be almost too solid word to apply to major ames relation with mr evans during week two before ball must be more accurate to say that be making pretence of having flirtation even a when kissed on that daring evening already described be thinking entirely about dashingness of proceeding so in day succeeded same inept futility selfsatisfaction possessed made many secret visit to house entering like burglar in middle of afternoon by unfrequented passage from railway cutting at hour when told that husband daughter must certainly be out secrecy of meeting added spice to felt so deplorable frame of mind almost defies description felt pleasing sense of wickedness be endorsed so to speak by certificate attested to complete innocence a far a be concerned be mere farce of flirtation farce filled with kind of childish glee persuaded that share in be real that by tragic fate woman who be made for other be forbidden to find fruition of affinity be adventure without danger mine without gunpowder for even on two occasion when be paying one of clandestine visit dr evans have unexpectedly returned found together poor blind man seemed suspected nothing indeed welcome have be extremely cordial good of to come help wife over party said what youd do without major ames little woman dont know wont stop for dinner major then after suitable reply digression to other matter major foolish eye must steal look at millie for moment eye must meet flutter fall considering that there be not in world probably worse judge of human nature than major ames be strange thing that mental comment be approximately true dear little woman said to shes deuced fond of chapter vii jupiter pluvius mr j pluvius by name major ames be facetiously wont to allude to weather seemed amiably inclined to co operate with mr evans scheme for evening of party promised to be ideal for purpose few day previous have be very hot particle of moisture lurked in baked lawn so that guest must be able to wander at will without risk of contracting catarrh stain on such shoe a must prove to be white satin moreover by special kindness of providence there be moon so that illumination of fairy light chinese lantern must suffer dispiriting comparison with more potent brightness over large portion of lawn mr evans at major ames suggestion not having to pay for paraphernalia be singularly fruitful in suggestion have caused planked floor

sudden noise in drawing room a if heavy man have suddenly stumbled required more ingenuity than be normally hers to conjecture that lyndhurst be already there have tripped up in novel accoutrement at sudden flush of excitement anticipation invaded wondered what must be like a regard felt profoundest confidence in success of garniture must scarcely help being amazed delighted emotion never keenly felt by a such long outworn shook made knee tremulous felt so young so daring wished at moment must come out for a descended stair must not see how small soft be foot almost before wish be formed be

military moustache be not in egypt in rome here by divine chance without consultation have chosen for character complementary to hers looked up saw looked down saw bless soul said amy cleopatra gave happy little smile bless soul said lyndhurst mark antony there be long awful pause be quite clear to that something have occurred totally unexpected have wanted to be unexpected there be something wrong about quality of surprise then such manliness a there be in came to aid upon word said have got up splendidly amy cleopatra now pearl sandal why youll take shine out of here go eh antony cleopatra who must have thought of cab round dear have better be starting if be to take part in procession not want cloak anything antony cleopatra god bless soul be sufficient to allay immediate embarrassment true have not be knocked over by apparition of in way have meant astonished pause be afraid be not one of surrendering admiration yet perhaps be feeling shy even a be standing here in splendour of shining pantomime might well feel to be a strange to a felt to be to moreover have not only to look cleopatra to be cleopatra to behave with gaiety youth appearance gave right to expect in meantime also have earned compliment for man who think worth while to assume fancy dress have soul so unhuman a to be unappreciative of applause fell back step two to regard comprehensively dear

cleopatra mark antony cleopatra different conception of part a kent chronicle said in next issue cleopatra dim white willowy advanced to looked vexed a ran eye up down mr ames figure like practised pianist playing chromatic scale vexation seemed completely to clear dear cousin amy said how perfectly lovely never saw wilfred make bow to cleopatra antony oh major ames again made chromatic scale starting at top so to speak face with long note dwelling there again when returned to other arrival followed particular antony cleopatra mingled with such guest a be already assembled greater part have gathered mr ames habitual manner bearing suited excellently with regal rle turner family at rate who be standing little apart from others not being quite completely in riseborough society feeling rather hot feverish in thick brocaded stuff suitable to falstaff mistress page king theseus felt more le uncomfortable when made few complimentary remark to than did when with fat prayer book in hand spoke to after church on sunday elsewhere young morton with white face red nose be traditional apothecary mr taverner be so copiously apparalled a queen catherine that be looking forward very much indeed to moment when procession must go forth into greater coolness of night air then stentorian announcement from waiter at crown made one turn again to door antony cleopatra ten year later shouted there be slight pause then entered mr mr altham with high held hand clasped at finger tip stepped rather high holding skirt away from foot pointing toe a if performing pavanne entry have be much rehearsed be arresting to point of producing sort of stupefaction mr evans ran eye up down pair be apparently satisfied dear mr altham said how perfectly lovely mr altham ten year later must not ask to believe that turned to husband spoke quickly with look on face le amiable than usually wore in public wilfred said tell band to begin opening march at once for procession in case there be more

unconscious standard of sterling youth by slightly mature exhilaration must be judged found deficient in genuine natural effervescence thus despite somewhat untoward conjunction of four matronly cleopatra spirit of extraordinary gaiety soon possessed entire party odious comparison might conceivably spring up mushroom like to morrow unmushroom like continue to wax flourish through many day dinner to night so large environment of elderly people gave to one of elderly people pleasant sense of not suffering rather shining in comparison with others even cleopatra be content mr ames for instance saw how sensible be that mr altham must announce a cleopatra of ten year later while mr altham observing mr ames saw how supererogatory titular modesty have be wondered that mr ames cared to show foot like while mr brook knew that everybody be mentally contrasting queenliness of height with mr ames paucity of inch abundance of beautiful hair with mr althams obvious wig while time mr evans whom appearance of fourth cleopatra have considerably upset for moment felt at rate must easily continue being cleopatra for more year than ten after so properly assumed by mr altham in same way major ames with six foot of solid english bone muscle fifth decade of year still half consumed felt that mr altham have provided scale of comparison uncommonly flattering to simultaneously mr altham with laurel wreath round head reflected how uncomfortable must have felt if laurel wreath be anchored on sounder foundation than wig wondered if gardening on principle that flesh be grass invariably resulted in so great growth of tissue pleasant self communings be indeed minor tributary to real river of enjoyment that danced chattered through starlit hour of july night somehow whole assembly seemed to have shifted off natural inevitable burden of year danced mildly flirted sat out in dim shrubbery played on sea shore of life again finding sand castle have become real once more mr ames for

odious self centred satisfaction now thought be le satisfactory be disquieting mildly alarming like fly on fly paper with one leg already englued put down second to get leverage with to free first found that be adhering also mr evans spoke again took such pleasure in preparation said be so much interested in tell cousin that be not disappointed be hardly possible for to do le than what did what

womanhood be there made more real by fantastic setting be kindled to greater warmth than have yet known time dreadful creature in semi puritanical semi immoral brain told that be devilish naughty be a unused to such scruple a be unused to such temptation in curious fashion felt a ashamed of one a felt afraid of other at length summed up whole of despicable conclusion will give just one kiss millie said just one cousin kiss before go dance such early worm next morning in major ames garden a have escaped early bird must certainly have be caught laid out flat by garden roller so swift incessant be journeying for though dawn have overspread sky with hueless tint of approaching day when antony cleopatra be charioteered home again by somnolent cabman though major ames repose have be of most fragmentary kind though breakfast in anticipation of late hour have be ordered night before at unusual half past nine found bed intolerable abode by seven oclock have hoped to expatriate somewhat disquieting thought from mind by application of limb to severe bodily exertion wife have be last guest to leave indeed after others have gone lingered little smoking final cigarette even mr ames have be persuaded to light one convulsive paroxysm of coughing made pear shaped pearl to quiver shake like aspen leaf led to throw away saying enjoyed very much have danced with mr evans three four time three four time have sat in cool darkness of shrubbery have said to several thing at moment seemed imperative to say did not really mean a evening went on have meant more have helpless childlike charm about began to stir sens yet below childlike confiding manner be dimly aware that there be eager woman soul that sought charm be weapon very efficient will wielded same reflected a honest dew of toil poured from forehead morning in hot early sunlight have not said very much have said that riseborough be different place since have said have come there that eye looked black in starlight honestly must not remember anything more intimate than that have made bed intolerable be sense that situation have not terminated last night that boat so to speak have not be drawn up safely ashore be still in midst of accelerating water yet be in own power to draw boat ashore at moment have to take decisive stroke to land to step out beach to return surely be not difficult to normal thought activity for year garden club domestic concern daily paper have provided with sufficiency of pursuit have to step back into safe if monotonous circle look upon disturbance a episodic already have ceased to think of mr evans a dear little woman poor little woman somehow seemed a if have got finger to use prosaic metaphor into work be prodding about among internal wheel spring of mechanism yet be stating case too strongly be that of contingency that be afraid with curious irresponsibility of rather selfish unimaginative man fact that have allowed to prod about in internal mechanism represented to a unimportant negligible detail be only when began prodding about in producing a be extraordinary little whirring racing of wheel have long gone slow steady that began to think that anything significant be occurring after there be nothing like pull at garden roller for giving fellow appetite for breakfast for squashing worm unprofitable reflection though half past nine have seemed late enough for anybody a mr ames have said evening before be not till nearly ten that put extra spoonful of tea into silver teapot for felt that needed more than usually fortifying beverage to nullify disinclination for day routine sight of cleopatra costume also laid upon sofa in bedroom shone upon by cheerful uncompromising summer sun have awakened in mind certain discontent certain sense of disappointment of age of grievance gilt paper have moulted off one of sandal strap spilt dropping of strawberry ice made disfiguring spot on tunic of arab shawl felt vaguely ungilded disfigured cigarette too have so often said in most liberal manner that did not think wicked of woman to smoke only horrid certainly did not feel wicked morning a certainly felt disposed to consider anybody else horrid possibly wicked decidedly cup of strong tea be indicated major ames have gone upstairs again to have bath to dress after exercise in garden came down few minute later smelling of soap with jovial boisterousness of demeanour that smelt of unreality good morning dear amy said how do feel after party ive be up couple of hour nothing like spell of exercise to buck one up after late hour will have tea now lyndhurst asked have now wait till get eh ill have now delicious always say that nobody make tea like now boisterous spirit at breakfast be not usual with major ames a have be said wife easily detected false air about vague sense of disappointment grievance began to take more solid outline be delightful to see in such good spirit lyndhurst observed with faint undertone of acidity sitting up late doe not usually agree with there be enough here to provoke repartee also superficial boisterousness be rapidly disappearing before wife acidity like stain at touch of ammonia doe not in instance seem to have agreed with dear said hope have not got headache be unwise of to stop so late however doubt will feel better after breakfast will give bacon will try something appears to be fish little kedjeree please said mr ames pointedly ignoring innuendo on cook kedjeree be well well live learn if have complaint to make about jephson said pray do so no not at one doe not expect cordon bleu dare say mr evans pay more for cook than do look at supper last night thought quail be peculiarly tasteless said mr ames if be to be grand have pches la melba must prefer to offer guest real peach proper ice cream instead of tinned peach custard say nothing about champagne because scarcely tasted well then dear im sure be quite right not to criticize can say be never want to eat better supper suddenly mr ames became aware that piece of solid outline have appeared round vague discontent reaction doubt think that millies arrangement be perfect in way observed dont know what mean by said rather hotly do know that when woman have be putting to trouble expense to entertain friend friend must show nicer spirit if refrained from carping depreciating amount of appreciation must make tinned peach fresh turn custard into ice cream said mr ames laying down fork with have dallied with kedjeree indeed be sordid sort of creation be foolish to pretend that thing be perfect when be not do consider manner a hostess by mean perfect looked a cross a two stick when poor mr brook appeared suppose thought that nobody have right to be cleopatra besides to be sure poor mr brook looked very silly if everybody who looked silly last night must have stayed away there must not have be much dancing done took several more sip of strong tea while unfolded appeared engrossed in morning paper under stimulating influence saw suddenly distinctly how ill advised be attack have yielded to temporary ill temper be always mistake be true that in mind be feeling that lyndhurst last night have spent far too much with hostess in word felt jealous be therefore abominably stupid from merely worldly point of view to criticize belittle millie to if there be absolutely ground for jealousy at present be humble little green bud attack be uncalled for if there be ground be most foolish at stage at rate to give least cause for suspecting that existed be wise enough now not to hasten to repair mistake to repair slowly deliberately a if repair be going on at must say garden looked charming said after pause did tell lyndhurst whether be husband who saw to lighting scheme be so comprehensive took in whole of lawn there be nothing patchy about suspect dr evans planned looked somehow more like man work look of furtive guilt passed over major face luckily be concealed by daily mail evans told that have nothing to do with said be pretty thought very pretty if night continue hot said must be nice to have garden illuminated one night if dear millie did not think be appropriating idea think must be above sort of thing well dear must go order dinner have wish clearly be wiser from major point of view to accept bouquet of olive branch after amy be far too sensible to imagine that there must be anything to rouse conjugal watch dog be there hastily told that cousinly kiss at moment must willingly have foregone certainly last night have be little super stimulated there be irresponsibility of fancy dress there be knowledge that millie be not insensitive to there be sense of own big shapely leg in tights there be dancing lantern have be potent intoxicant to riseborough for so long have practised teetotalism with regard to such excitement amy have be so far carried away by effervescence of gaiety a to smoke cigarette heaven knew how far removed from ordinary code of conduct be such adventure generously have forborne to brandish cigarette a weapon against during acrimonious episode at breakfast have conscious intention of hanging like damocles sword over head in case pursued critical carping course against millie have said last night have done that without meaning to make use of knowledge knew be in power to do so what must not mr altham for instance give to be informed by eye witness mr ames have blown be no more than on abhorred weed so conscious of position that must make offensive at will accepted olive branch suggested cold curry for lunch breakfast at mr althams reflected le complicated condition of mind husband be extremely pleased with in state of passion with regard to everybody else since attitude be typical of view that riseborough generally took of last night festivity may be given compendiously in rhetorical flight of mr althams with husband be in complete accord in palliation may be mentioned that have partaken of large quantity of food at unusual hour be through body that entry be made by subtle gateway of soul vitriolic comment in morning be often precise equivalent of unusual indulgence night before well im sure if have known said mr altham must not have taken trouble did of course everybody said how lovely dress be simply to make one say same to never want to hear word cleopatra again henry so pray dont repeat fancy mr ames appearing a cleopatra taking trouble to say be antony cleopatra ten year later twenty year before must have be more date if have known perhaps be wrong when woman arrives at mr ames time of life whether dye hair not be wiser to keep foot concealed not to mention what must have looked like in face of tradesman of riseborough who be lining pavement when stepped out of cab thought heard great roar of laughter a be driving up high street must not wonder if be noise of laughing a got out of carriage of course be very prettily done a far a poor mr evans be concerned wonder that dr evans like to spend money like for however unsuitable supper be feel sure be very expensive for be truffle aspic there must have be sirloin of beef in cup of soup took between two of dance strong soup like at dead of night fill one up dreadfully mr brook appearing a cleopatra after have said about hermione well im sure if chooses to make silly of herself like be nobody concern hers looked like nothing so much a great white mare with stagger if be going up to club henry must not wonder if came out with seems to very stuffy morning little fresh air must do good a for big german ruby in cap dont believe soul noticed be looking at mr evans long white arm poor thing be probably very anmic never saw such pallor saw little of whole evening seemed to be popping in out of shrubbery like rabbit time with major ames must not wonder if mr ames be giving good talking to at moment then like rest of riseborough unlike scorpion there be blessing instead of sting in tail certainly be very pretty said though seemed very strange at time can hardly believe morning that be dressed up like hopping about out of door fancy dress ball be very interesting see so much of human nature though looked procession up down henry saw nobody so well dressed a suppose there be lot of jealousy everywhere anyhow mr evans have quite ousted mr ames now nobody will talk about anything last night for next fortnight im sure that when mr ames have conjurer who turned omelette into watch have forgotten about three day afterwards after mr evans be very pleasant hospitable woman wouldnt have missed that party for anything if hear anything at club about wanting to sell chinese lantern fairy light second hand henry if find reason to believe that have hired out for night from mercantile store might ask price if be reasonable get couple of dozen if weather continues a hot a might illuminate garden when give august dinner party at least suppose mr evans doe not consider that have monopoly of lighting up garden henry found quite in accord with spirit of address will remember dear said if hear anything said at club will go up there soon for must not be surprised if most of member spent morning there think will have cup of tea have have two already said wife be feeling little irritable then will make three observed mr evans finally have breakfast in room when came found that husband have already left house on visit be relief felt that if have seen cheerful smiling face morning must almost have hated ordered dinner then went out into garden workman be already there removing dancing floor gardener be collecting fairy light in tray carrying indoors here there be charred burnt place on grass below mulberry tree dbris of supper have not yet be removed shrubbery a last night be sequestered cool sat for hour there on garden bench overlooking lawn little flake of golden sunlight filtered down through foliage laburnum delicate sprayed oscillated in light breeze scarcely knew whether be happy not gave thought to felt more consciously alive than ever before chapter viii discussion about fancy dress ball a mr altham have said be paramount over other topic for at least fortnight after event great question annually became of such absorbing interest during july namely a to where to spend august be dwarfed never attained to ordinary proportion till quite late on in month discussion did not a rule bear fruit of kind since almost without exception everybody spent august exactly where august have be spent by for last dozen year so be clearly wise to consider problem afresh year be prepared in case fresh resort suggested to change habit of year at least to consider doing so list of hotel at end of bradshaw little handbook published by south eastern railway be a rule almost only form of literature indulged in during evening of july mr altham whose imagination be always fired by picture of ship often studied sailing of river plate steamer considered that fare be very reasonable especially steerage fact that be appallingly bad sailor in way diminished zest with studied sailing price thereof subsequently mr altham always spent august at littlestone on sea in completely detached villa called blenheim where capable scotchwoman who to add colour to illusion maintained that name really be churchill boarded lodged on solid food feather bed during july may be remarked mr altham usually contrived to quarrel with cook who gave notice thus there be one mouth le to feed while be away yearly on return have excitement of new surprising confection from kitchen mr ames may be remembered have already enjoyed fortnight holiday at overstrand year last week of july saw still disinclined to make holiday plan have taken sort of bungalow near deal for last year two among other advantage be built in such manner that remark made in part of house must be heard in other part of house be enough almost for to say a finished dressing be ready for breakfast to hear parker replying from kitchen kettle just on boil maam year however have be late in inquiring whether be vacant for august found when belated letter be answered that be already engaged fact broke to husband harry who have returned from cambridge with hair unusually wild lank with tempered indignation considering how many year have taken said must say that think must have told before letting over head like always thought that mr mackenzie be most grasping sort of person who must be likely to take first offer turned up im sure house be never very comfortable have doubt can easily find better without much bother bedroom ceiling always leaked said harry there be nowhere to write at mr ames have finished breakfast got up felt faintly in mind that after fancy dress ball be time for to do something original yet whole idea be so novel riseborough must be sure to say that have not be able to afford holiday after mattered very little really dont know why always take trouble to go away to uncomfortable lodging during august said leave own comfortable house standing vacant major ames have be horse must have pricked up ear at human ear being unadapted to such movement contented with listening avidly have seen little of millie last fortnight be beginning to realize how much missed presence between be true have come near to intimacy have danger really feared more than desired felt with self deception come so easily to who know nothing about that be on guard now meantime missed guessed quite truly that missed poor prig told that have right to cut off gave pleasure must be spartan over own affair if so minded must not play lycurgus to others idea have privately occurred to at time seemed incapable of realization suddenly leaped into possible horizon always complain of dampness of strange house lyndhurst added a harry say have place for writing study why must go away at be sure after excitement of last month must be complete rest to remain here when everybody else be gone have not have moment to myself last month must not be at sorry to stop quietly here major ames knew with sufficient accuracy influence have over wife realized be to say a far a regarded present instance slight opposition on part usually produced corresponding firmness on hers accentuated opposition produced various result sometimes won sometimes mild remonstrance always confirmed view in opposition to have plan of own on occasion determination to remain in riseborough must prove to be in alliance with therefore mildly remonstrated must regret before month be out said for im old campaigner hope can make comfortable anywhere must get bored before end of august amy when get bored digestion be invariably affected must like to stop in riseborough said harry hate sea will go wherever mother settle to go boy said major ames still pursuing plan if wish to go to sheffield for august will go too doubt learn something useful about cutlery dont try stopping in riseborough dear amy at least if take advice wont major ames be not very intelligent highest intelligence must not have done better have learned trick of slight opposition just a stupid dog with conservative master can learn to growl for asquith by incessant repetition when have learned doe right major have done right on occasion see why harry must not have voice in question of where spend vacation said certainly room at bungalow lyndhurst be comfortable enough be only decent room in house in case can not get bungalow for august have other plan a to where must go there be room for little more of policy of opposition well now brighton said why not brighton there club there dare say must get little bridge in evening doubt must pick up acquaintance amy think westbournes went there last year remarkable reason for going to brighton made mr ames almost epigrammatic then must go on to margate remarked curry favour there by mean dear said dare say curry must be quite inexpensive mr ames opened door on to verandah pray let know lyndhurst said if have serious proposition to make be major ames custom to start work in garden immediately after breakfast morning got out one of large sized cheroot instead conduced to meditation established in chair on verandah mental development be not in most regard of very high complex order possessed that rather rare attainment of being able to sit down think about one thing to exclusion of others with most of to sit down think about one thing soon resolve into confused survey of most other thing major ames must do better than for must on occasion did exclude other topic from mind at end return so to speak bringing sheaf with have made definite reasonable plan harry have communicated interesting fact of passion for mr evans to omar khayyam club be of course bound to prosecute nefarious intrigue have already written several galloping lyric little loose in grammar rhyme to enchantress have copied into small green morocco note book title page of have inscribed a dedicated to m e looked narcissus like proceeding to one who did not remember what mr evans initial be afternoon feeling poetic afflatus blowing gale within having nothing definite to say decided to call on inspirer of muse in order to gather fresh fuel for fire arrayed in very low collar showed full extent of rather scraggy neck adorned with red tie for socialism be le orthodoxy in club than atheistic principle illicit love set secretly out have good fortune to find goddess alone be welcomed with rather timid childlike deference that have found so adorable before how good of to come see said when im sure must have so many friend wanting think be so kind clearly be timid did not know power eye be bluer than ever hair be of palest gold a remembered her of old thought to referring to evening at end of june indeed there be poem dated june rather daring one kindness be entirely on side said in letting come longed to say worship did not quite dare have tea with dear be selfish sort of kindness said let go into garden think be very unkind of mr not to come to dance last week of course cambridge men have more serious thing to think about than little country party thought about nothing else dance for day said tutor simply refused to let come down for narrow pedantic fellow who dont suppose ever danced tell about dress like to picture in fancy dress must not help appearing to wish to attract be a much fault of way head be set on to neck of colour of eye a of mind oh quite simple white frock said few pearl wanted to go a cleopatra so silly with grown up daughter husband insisted fancy dress ball have not be talked about at mr ames lately have heard nothing about in two day have be at home parent have reason for letting pas into region of thing be done with did mother father go asked suppose felt too old to dress up oh came a antony cleopatra have not told cousin amy looked so so interesting father be splendid a mark antony then be dr evans mark antony too asked harry no be timon of athens then who be mark antony asked mr evans felt flushing annoyance at made awkward in pouring out of tea felt that harrys narrow gimlet like eye be fixed on see how stupid be said have spilled tea in saucer dear mr harry have heap of cleopatra mr altham be one mr brook be danced with hamlet anybody crude ridiculous youth felt have idea in head did father mother dance together evening asked felt growing impatient of course not everybody danced with everybody have quadrille sort of thing then with mistaken instinct make cautious in wrong place determined to say little more father be so kind to said helped with arrangement must never have managed except for have tremendous day of talking planning about now tell about cambridge harry be scenting sonnet of most remarkable character might be called rival must deal with situation omar khayyam club must certainly feel to be immensely parful suppose mother helped too said be byronic lacerating have to suffer a well a there be pungent line already complete who have suffered a much a be refrain there be thrill in store for omar khayyam club after sufficiency of yellow wine cousin amy be away said mr evans be staying at cromer till just before little dance be not far from cambridge be suppose came over to see harry spared did not press question enough have be said to show that have broken faith with rival must suitably become quite incoherent towards close incoherency be sometimes great convenience for exclamatory rhyme be not rare smoothed lank hair off forehead tactfully changed subject suppose be soon going away now said be lucky to have seen at be going to stop here august think mother doe not want to go away do not that of care about mr evans slight annoyance with be suddenly merged in interest how wise said be so absurd to go to stay somewhere uncomfortably instead of remaining comfortably wish be doing same husband always have to go to harrogate for few week like to be with will think of envy stopping here in charming riseborough like asked harry how must not with so many delightful people being friendly to relation too cousin amy for instance major ames let see if mr ames be cousin surely be cousin harry harry became peculiarly fascinating craned long neck forward oh leave out cousin said how sweet of harry said that so to speak extracted poison fang from projected rival six mysterious postcard be placed by author hand in pillar box that evening consisted of one mystic sentence call by christian name by most convenient circumstance too apt to be considered accidental there have here come to birth octo syllabic line of honeyed sweetness simplicity be not slow to take advantage of moon setting not long before daybreak saw completed gem of m e series mr evans that afternoon like major ames that morning sat thought after harry have left independently of fact that admirer even weirdest always found welcome in pale blue eye felt really grateful to harry for have given information on based plan be quite a sound simple a major ames be designed to secure same object since night of fancy dress ball have only seen once twice never privately greater vitality by wondrous process of affinity have stirred in hungered for sustenance can not be said that be even now really conscious in herself of disloyalty to husband that actually contemplated breach of faith have not at present sufficient force of feeling to imagine decisive situation must at most lash helm so to speak so that action of wind must take boat in direction in wished to go then sit idly on deck saying that be not responsible for course be pursuing wind tide current be irresistibly impelling have nothing to do with rudder having tied did not touch like majority in world of miserable sinner did not actively court danger desired hung about expectant of at same time kept anxious eye on shore towards be driving be really coming closer if so why did seem to have made way lately to day plan betokened more active hand in what thought of a fate unfortunately though be a sound in a major ames be made independently ignorantly of have prompted slight opposition morning so that while plan be admirable enough in two taken in conjunction must if successful result in fiasco almost sublime in completeness manner of be a follows elsie so happened be not at home that evening husband dined alone strolled out in garden afterwards will miss chess evening dear said must amuse to give queen few bishop knight see how long take to defeat will spend little cosy chatty evening together hope horrid people will be taken ill send for so do little woman said be getting to detest appellation a if shouldnt enjoy quiet evening of talk with more than fifty game of chess dear will be glad to get away to harrogate year need month of badly will positively enjoy foul old rotten egg smell gave little shudder oh dont talk of said be bad enough without thinking of beforehand poor little woman almost pity be not gouty too then must look forward to sat down on one of shrubbery seat drew aside skirt making room for to sit beside yes a be not gouty wilfred said be use wishing be do hate harrogate so wonder gave little sigh put arm within well whats little woman wondering now asked hardly like to tell be always so kind to that dont know why be afraid wilfred must think dreadful of if suggested not going with year im sure make ill to be there will have elsie will play chess a usual with evening see morning be at bath usually be out bicycling afternoon with dont think know how hate have begun in shy tentative manner voice grew more cold decided put forward argument like woman who have thought carefully over a indeed have what will do with dear said seems funny plan cant stop here alone sat up taking hand from arm indeed must not be a lonely here a be at harrogate said dont know anybody there if think of be really alone most of time be different for because be doing good a say be bicycling with elsie afternoon play chess together in evening shade of trouble perplexity came over doctor face indictment for be hardly le than be a well ordered digested a if have be prepared for forensic argument calm passionless voice went on think of day there said going into orderly detail after breakfast go off to bath have to sit in dreadful sitting room while clear thing away even hotel must be more amusing than furnished lodging one must look at people going in out if go for stroll in morning get tired must rest in afternoon come in to lunch go off with elsie afterwards be quite right exercise be good for what be use of being there there be nobody for to go to see nobody come to see then have dinner have excitement of learning where elsie have be bicycling two play chess after dinner have excitement of being told who have won here at rate can sit in room doesnt smell of dinner can sit in garden have own book thing about there be people know whom can see talk to got up began walking up down path in front of bench where have be sitting kindly soul in perplexity nothing wrong little woman asked certainly not why must think that imagine there be reason enough in what have told do get so bored there wilfred hate being bored be sure be not good for try to picture life there see how utterly different be from yours besides a say be doing good time a said welcome thought of horrible smelling water still shuffled up down in dusk too got on nerve pray sit down wilfred said walking about like confuses surely can say yes to if insist on going with will go will think very unreasonable of cant say yes like little woman said dont imagine have thought how dull riseborough will be during august everybody go away believe for moment thought of telling that ames be going to stop here then with entirely misplaced caution thought wiser to keep to herself guilty in real reason for wishing to remain here though coherent logical enough in account have given of reason thought grossly wronging that seed of suspicion might hereby enter husband mind there be sure to be one here said althams for instance go away till middle of august particularly care for said be better than nobody day at harrogate have nobody be not companionship to sit in room with elsie playing chess besides westbournes will be at home will go over there great deal dare say also will be in own house be comfortable be fond of lodging at harrogate disgust be oilcloth plush there be nowhere to sit when be clearing away face be still clouded be so odd for married woman to stop alone like that said think be far odder for husband to want to spend month of loneliness boredom in lodging said because have never complained wilfred think havent detested on thinking over seems to more sensible to tell how detest ask that shouldnt go be silent moment very well little woman said at length will do a please instantly cold precision of speech changed gave little sigh of conscious content with often woke in morning linked arm into again ah be dear of said be always such darling to be not man to give grudging consent spoil gift by offering except with utmost cordiality only hope youll make great success of little woman said must be dull for at harrogate so thats settled be satisfied let see if have come in yet laughed softly be dear said again wilfred evans be neither analytical regarding curious about analysis might account for action of others just a in professional work be rather old fashioned eminently safe sensible so in ordinary conduct of life did not seek for abstruse cause subtle motif be quite enough for that wife felt that must be excruciatingly bored at harrogate le acutely desolate here on other hand implied violation of one of simplest custom of life that wife must be in one place husband in be vaguely disquieting to disquieting also be cold precise manner with have conducted case dozen time only perhaps in married life have assumed frozen rigidity of demeanour time have succumbed before in ordinary way if inclination be at variance must coax wheedle into yielding though quietly adhering to own opinion must let have way with calm rigidity rarely assumed have never successfully combated there be steeliness about that knew to be stronger than opposition must bring to nothing seemed to affect argument conjugal command must go on saying agree with in manner of cool water dripping on stone with same inexorable quietness must repeat feel very strongly about think very unkind of sufficiency of always have rendered opposition impotent will when once really aroused seemed to paralyse once twice line have turned out conspicuously ill seemed to make difference cold precise manner be on higher plane than material failure have resulted therefrom must merely repeat be best thing to do under circumstance in instance wondered little that have used manner over matter seemed so little vital a question of harrogate by next morning have ceased to concern further with be completely usual self again soon after breakfast set off to accomplish little errand in town looking in on in laboratory to know if there be commission must do for eye at moment be glued to microscope culture of staphylococcus absorbed without looking up said nothing thanks little woman heard pause then came across room to laid cool hand on shoulder wilfred be such dear to said youre not vexed with interrupted observation put arm round vexed said ill tell when im vexed smiled at dewily timidly thats all right then said so plan be accomplished affair of staphylococcus did not long detain doctor presently after major ames be announced have come to consult dr evans with regard to certain gouty symptom into doctor inquired examined there nothing to worry about said after very short investigation must recommend to cut off alcohol entirely not eat meat more than once day fortnight dieting will probably cure take plenty of exercise wont give medicine there be use in taking drug when can produce same effect by not taking other thing major ames fidgeted frowned little be thinking said at length of taking more thoroughly in hand than ive never approved of half measure cant begin now if tooth ache have out be done with fiddling about for now wife doe not want to go away august seemed to that must be very good opportunity for to go a do think take course of water get rid of tendency dont know eradicate do say to harrogate now be thinking of harrogate if approved harrogate doe wonder for gout doe not doctor laughed be certainly hoping harrogate will do wonder for said go there year doubt many of who be getting on in year must be benefited by symptom be very slight think will soon get rid of if follow course suggest major ames showed strange desire for harrogate well like to do thing thoroughly said like getting rid of thing root branch know see may not get opportunity amy like to go with on holiday in august there be reason why must stop in riseborough havent spoken to yet if must say that recommended harrogate im sure must wish to go indeed must insist on going be often anxious about gouty tendency more anxious a often tell than have need to be aunt of hers have attack went to heart quite unexpectedly killed poor thing think indeed must be weight off amys mind if knew be going to take thoroughly in hand not tinker peddle about with diet only so must be able to recommend to go to harrogate course of harrogate wouldnt be bad for of who eat good dinner night said dr evans think that if tried major ames got up waving further discussion aside thats enough doctor said if must do good know amy must wish to go know what wife be now im pressed for time morning so be sure be by way neednt mention plan till ive talked over with amy about lodging now do recommend lodging hotel dr evans did not mention that wife be not going to be with year for having obtained permission to say that harrogate must do good major ames have developed prodigious hurry few moment after be going jauntily home with address of dr evans lodging in pocket trusted to own power of exaggeration to remove possible opposition on wife part felt devil of diplomatist so plan be arranged third factor in network of misconceived plot occurred same morning mr ames visiting high street on account of advanced melon met cousin millie on similar errand to butcher on account of advanced cutlet for weather be trying be natural that announced intention of remaining in riseborough with family during august be natural also that cousin millie signified remission from harrogate cousin amy be cordial on subject returned home probably must have mentioned fact to husband if have given time to do be bursting with more immediate communication didnt like to tell before amy said because didnt want to make unnecessarily anxious there need for anxiety now mr ames be not very imaginative occurred to that newly planted magnolia have not be prospering real cause for anxiety said fact be went to see dr evans morning dont be frightened dear got thoroughly overhauled by thoroughly overhauled said there be reason for anxiety assured of im gouty dear there doubt of of course remember about poor aunt harriet well there be say harrogate bore of course harrogate cause for anxiety told so twice mr ames gave one moment to calm clear oyster like reflection unhurried unalarmed there be shadow of reason why must tell what mr evans plan be be odd that must suddenly decide to stop in riseborough instead of going to harrogate having heard from harry that ames be to remain at home lyndhurst a suddenly be impelled to go to harrogate instead of stopping in riseborough curious coincidence everybody seemed to be making plan at rate must not add to number only acquiesce in be made dear lyndhurst what upset said of course if tell there be cause for anxiety will not be anxious doe dr evans recommend to go to harrogate now must tell said always go in august do not will be pleasant for be afraid will find water far from palatable major ames felt that have not made sufficiently important impression of course told dr evans must decide nothing till have consulted said seems great break up to leave harry here go away like be be thinking of not whether water palatable not have more than mind not to go daresay will worry through right without again mr ames made little pause must do a dr evans tell to do said be sure be not faddy fussy major ames experience of morning fully endorsed certainly have be neither whatever difference between two might be well dear if dr evans be agreed said mustnt set up against now did tell where to go gave address of own lodging what convenient arrangement now dear beg to waste time send off telegram pay reply well pack off to morrow be sure be right thing to do sudden conviction painfully real that be behaving currishly descended on major ames feeling be so entirely new to that must have liked to put down to obsession of gout in new place conscience for instance for must hardly believe that must be accused of paltry conduct felt a if there must be mistake about almost wished that amy have made difficulty then there must have be compensatory idea that be behaving badly too must not have conducted in more guilelessly sympathetic manner seemed to find inherent improbability in dr evans having counselled harrogate question a to advisability of following advice be almost unpleasant to to have thing made so pleasant then salutary impression be effaced for anything savoured of self reproach must not long find harbourage in mind instead pictured at harrogate station welcoming evans must probably be looking rather tired fragile after journey must have cab ready for tea must be awaiting when reached lodging chapter ix week later mr ames be sitting at breakfast with harry opposite expecting early post among gift of early post letter from husband have written one very soon after arrival at harrogate saying

doe not matter said mother looked up at must take little dose dear said if feel like that heat upset at time will please telephone now harry then will know what to order for dinner mr ames nature be undeniably simple one have misty profundity curious dim lit cleft on round smooth surface of life on occasion simple nature be capable of curious complexity of feeling more elusive because be unable to register exactly what do feel certainly saw connection between non arrival of dear millie at harrogate inflamed letter from husband have suspected also connection between dear millies decision to spend august at riseborough belief that major ames be going to do so too completeness of fiasco sucked sting out of resentment might otherwise have felt be impossible to be angry with such sorry conspirator at same time with regard to husband felt liveliest internal satisfaction at blistering communication read through again thought of own slighted rather unperceived rejuvenescence added point to felt that have be served out not for moment did suspect of anything most innocent of flirtation be disposed to credit dear millie with having provoked such flirtation a there be by time also must have be quite clear to thwarted party that be in full cognizance of futile design clearly therefore own beau rle be to appear utterly unconscious of unconsciously to administer nasty little jab to of with smiling face have be making silly of expressed indulgent verdict on whole affair then in strange feminine way felt sort of secret pride in husband for having have manhood to flirt however mildly with somebody el wife immediately there followed resentment that have not shown tendency to flirt with own when have encouraged anyhow have chosen prettiest woman in riseborough be handsomest man mood changed thought at rate of administering nasty little jab presented in growingly attractive light two silly have be wanting to dance to own tune must dance to hers instead by way of striking up own tune at once wrote a follows to husband dearest lyndhurst cant tell how glad be to get two letter to know how much good harrogate be doing what excellent thing that went to dr evans please remember to that insisted so strongly on taking thoroughly in hand paused moment wondering exactly how strong insistence have be be possible that be not very strong so much more reason for letting sentence stand now underlined word so strongly of course water be disgusting to take declare can almost smell when read vivid description a said in first letter what be bad taste in mouth when know be doing good second letter convinces how right be to go when thing like gout begin to come out naturally make feel little low worried want to stop there whole of august get thoroughly rid of here be getting along very happily be so glad did not go to sea millie be here a will know see great deal of be constantly dropping in en fille suppose must call be in excellent spirit look so pretty be not quite at ease about harry be private be very much attracted by seems to not very wise in way deal with for seems to be encouraging in silliness perhaps will speak to about yet hardly like to again mr ames paused have idea have such brilliant touch in administration of jab what said might not be strictly accurate be full of point remember too what said that be so good for boy to be taken up with thoroughly nice woman that prevented getting into mischief be sure harry be writing sort of poem to because sigh great deal have most inky forefinger for give pumice stone if be not so nice woman so far from anything like flirtatiousness must feel obliged to speak to harry warn seems very happy cheerful daresay feel like be rejoiced to think harrogate be doing husband good write to soon again dear give excellent account of yourself be not queer that settled to go to harrogate just when millie settled not to if be not such good friend one must think wanted to avoid other well must stop millie be dining with must order dinner read through what have written with considerable content will be nastier than harrogate water thought to herself quite a good for then with certain largeness lurked behind littleness practically dismissed whole silly business from mind continued use of purely natural mean for restoring colour of hair tapped dabbed corner of eye with miraculous skin food be prophylactic measure did not want to appear fright when lyndhurst came back from harrogate mr ames be well aware that famous fancy dress ball have caused certain loss of prestige in capacity of queen of society in riseborough have followed close on heel of innovation of asking husband wife separately to dinner have somewhat taken shine out of achievement indeed latter have not be a epoch making a have expected for last week two have felt that something new be required of a be often case found that recognition of such truth doe not necessarily lead to discovery of novelty perhaps paltriness of lyndhursts conduct leading to reflection on own superior wisdom put on path for about time began to take renewed interest in suffragette movement from what saw in paper be productive of such adventurous alarum in london for be essentially law abiding by nature though in opposition to lyndhurst sympathetically inclined to woman who wanted vote have once said that to throw stone at prime minister be unladylike in only drew on perpetrator attention of police to rather than attention of public to problem recrudescence of similar act during last summer have caused to wonder whether have said quite last word on subject thought last thought certainly sensational interest in such violent act have led to marvel at strength of feeling prompted lady apparently whose breeding always word of potency with mr ames must not question be behaving like hooligan matter interested in apart from possible value a novelty for autumn also election be probably to take place in november hitherto that section of riseborough in lived have not suffered tranquillity to be interrupted by political excitement like man in sleep drowsily approved conservative member what if took lead in political agitation what if introduced suffragette element into election be solider affair than that quantity of cleopatra must skip about in back garden have always felt certain interest in movement be desire to make novelty for autumn peppered so to speak by impatience at futile treachery of husband harrogate plan ambition to take line of own in opposition to presented crusade in serious light to militant crusader have hitherto regarded a affected by strange lunacy husband masculine comment ought to be well smacked by jove have ring of common sense especially since added for benefit of such crusader a be of higher social rank theyre probably mad poor thing during tranquil month of august more serious interest be aroused bought though furtively such literature in form of little tract address a be accessible on subject slowly though still desire for autumn novelty must eclipse memory of congregation of cleopatra be moving force in mind something of real ferment began to be yeasty within learned by private inquiry what suffragette colour be naturally introduction of abstract idea into mind be laborious process since life have for year consisted of endless chain of small concrete event have be lived among people who have never seen abstract idea wild more than have seen elephant in real jungle be always tamed eating bun a in zoo just a other idea reached peptonized by column of daily paper wild thing lurked behind obedient trunk wild thing lurked behind report of ludicrous performance in palace yard at westminster august be still sultry major ames be still at harrogate when one evening harry dined with millie since nothing of description happened in riseborough during deserted month introductory discussion of what event have occurred since last met in high street that morning be not possible of great expansion none of have seen aeroplane be believed to have passed over town in afternoon nobody have heard from mr altham then mr ames fired shot be destined to involve riseborough in smoke brimstone lyndhurst said have never agreed about suffragette now that know something about disagree more than ever millie looked slightly shocked thought of suffragette a thought of person who figure in police news indeed often did knew wanted to vote about something be practically knew except that expressed desire to vote by hitting people know nothing about said be not very unladylike be disgrace to sex said harry soon made get out of cambridge tried to hold meeting in back few others went down there well there wasnt much more heard of dont call woman at call female mr ames have excellent reason for suspecting romance in son account of exploit tell exactly what happened in back at cambridge harry said harry slightly retracted there be nothing much to tell said club felt bound to make protest went down there a said seemed to cow bit then did proctor come cow asked inexorable mother believe proctor did come did not wait for made perfect fiasco anyhow told be dead failure heard more about so that be said mr ames quite enough agree with father disgrace sex dear know a little about a father said surely man judgment said millie making weak eye at harry dear man judgment be not of value if doe not know anything about what be judging have read account in paper heard that be very violent chain up to inconvenient place like railing be taken away by policeman sometimes slap policeman surely there must be something behind make like be finding out what be be most interesting say that have to pay rate tax get privilege if man pay rate tax get vote why shouldnt woman be very well expressed seem to to reason just a well a man mean to find out much more about personally dont pay rate tax because be lyndhursts affair if have arranged differently paid for house rate tax why shouldnt have vote instead of from what can learn gardener have vote just same a lyndhurst although lyndhurst doe garden rolling wont let parkins touch flower mr evans sighed seems very confused upside down said do smoke harry if feel inclined will have cigarette cousin amy be afraid have none never smoke harry be little sore from mother handling be not unwilling to hit back never knew mother smoked said do smoke how delightful how eastern never knew be eastern always thought said be not wicked for woman to smoke only horrid do be horrid be sure suffragette smoke mr ames turned swift appealing eye on millie entreating confidence then lied dear millie what be thinking of said of course never smoke harry appeal of eye have not taken effect on night of little dance cousin amy said surely have cigarette made cough said how nice be mr ames wished have not be so ruthless about suffragette at cambridge there be great difference between doing thing once said making habit of think did want to see what be like never said be nice a for being eastern be sure be glad to belong to west always thought unfeminine then knew did not feel again till have brushed teeth rinsed mouth now dear millie be really interested in suffragette demand be reasonable if be unreasonable about granting must be unreasonable too for year have be reasonable nobody have paid attention to be to do be violent call attention to be so well expressed can not fail to be interested wilfred must never let hit policeman said milly dont think must do even if wanted to be not aim of movement to hit policeman said mr ames be very sorry to have to be sorrier afterwards said harry mr ames turned small withering eye upon offspring if have waited to hear what have to say instead of running away before proctor came said might have learnt little about dear be not at sorry afterwards go to prison quite cheerfully in second division too be terribly uncomfortable many of have be brought up a luxuriously a of must not go to prison said mr evans faintly firmly even if must must be very wrong of for be sure must injure wilfreds practice people must not like to go to doctor whose wife have be in prison might have caught something elsie must be so ashamed of mr ames gave suppressed kind of sigh be habitual with when lyndhurst complained that water for bath be not hot although aware that kitchen boiler be being cleaned need not go to prison in order to be suffragette dear millie said prison life be not one of object of movement mr evans looked timidly apologetic didnt know said be so interesting to be told thought brave sort went to prison have breakfast together when be let out be sure have read about having breakfast together faint smile quivered on mouth be aware that cousin amy thought very stupid there be delicate pleasure in appearing quite idiotic like made cousin amy dance with irritation in inside explain more carefully yet yes dear millie said having breakfast together have not much to do with object dont know about said harry there be club at cambridge to belong whose object be to dine together then be very greedy of dear said mr ames suffragette be not like that go to prison do sort of unladylike thing for sake of conviction want to be treated justly for year have asked for justice nobody have paid least attention to now be making people attend assure that until began reading about have very little sympathy with now feel that woman ought to know about certainly what have read have opened eye very much there be quantity of woman of very good family indeed who belong to harry pulled handkerchief out of sleeve of dress coat habitually kept there just now omar khayyam club be rather great on class distinction see what that matter said because man great grandmother be created duchess for being king mistress mr evans mr ames got up simultaneously if anything mr ames got up shade first think need go into harry said mr ames millie tempered wind will join soon harry said if be too long will come fetch have be political to night will be too cold for in garden cousin amy left to harry devoted several minute pitiful reflection to mother state of mind in spite of awakened interest in suffragette movement seemed to deplorably old fashioned with second glass of port thought assumed rosier tone determined to wait till cousin millie came to fetch surely meant to do doubt wanted to have just one private word with have often caught eye during dinner with deprecating look a if to say tiresome rigmarole about suffragette be

prey of paralysing emotion when demand made upon by household duty domestic companionship be removed enter very swiftly into kingdom of process be very strongly at work just now with millie evans

bright have put couple more vas of in dressing room before long cab arrived from station bearing luggage harry occupied so be natural to conclude that be walking down made tea since must not be many minute behind leisurely four wheeler wanted very particularly to give auspicious comfortable return must not think that because suffragette movement occupied thought so much be going to become remiss

sensible man must have done wilfred evans have seen almost immediately on return to riseborough harry be disposed to make ridiculous have given word of kindly warning to wife snub bit little woman have said be having little too much of fairer on boy too youre too kind to woman like so easily turn boy head youve often said be rather dreadful sort of youth for reason took word in ill part becoming rather precise dont know what mean said will explain please easy enough dear he here too much he dangling after laugh at little yawn little mean that he in love with well thats too big word little woman though im sure see what mean think do think suggestion be rather coarse wilfred quite ill founded be one who be polite attentive supposed to be in love with only ask for information think own good sense will supply with necessary information said good sense apparently have done nothing of kind eventually dr evans have spoken to harrys father on subject visit have ceased with amazing

meeting to be held in house now fortnight ago drawing room meeting have exploded in mid career like squib scattering spark combustible material over riseborough appeared that mr ames finding that comprehension of suffragette aim extended to middle class circle in riseborough have asked wife daughter of tradesman to take part in wanted little after to make mr altham remark quite audibly that have not known that be to have privilege of meeting so many lady with whom be not previously acquainted sarcastic intention of word be not lost upon new friend tea seemed to increase initial inflammation interest mr ames have intended to awake on subject of vote for woman be changed into interest in ascertaining who must be most offensively polite very pretty game be not to be wondered at

find difficult to express be rather sad not to be able to show what feel quite frankly prevents being understood by people whom most want to understand beneath profession of incompetence seemed to major ames that there lurked very efficient strength felt being gradually overpowered by superior force force did not strike disable overbear cramped paralysed power of adversary enfolding clinging to

ridiculous enough that tough old campaigner like must feel such thing mr evans put forward chin raising face towards why ridiculous asked must be so much younger than dear cousin amy wonder wonder if feel that too there be there very devilish suggestion more so because in proportion to suggestion so very little be stated succeeded admirably poor dear amy said have said that once before when cleopatra amy be contrasted with cleopatra millie there be significance in repetition of once assumed identity of character have suggested comment now there be assumed character concerned millie amy mr evans put back chin be sure cousin amy ought to be very happy said softly be so devoted to almost think spoil lyndhurst be so romantic fancy being woman a old a cousin amy yet having young man so devoted harry too again billow of confidence tinged with self appreciation surged over major ames after wife be much older than for be still young man youth be being expanded on sweet pea garden roller be stirred into high flight of philosophical conjecture god what puzzle life be observed rose to high water mark might be so simple said must be so easy to be happy then major ames knew where be in one sense be worthy of occasion in did not feel up to that implied rose hastily have better go said rather hoarsely have smoked five cigarette since lunch hoarseness might easily have be result of indulgence did not attempt to keep did make incumbent on to give kiss however cousinly did not even rise only looked up at from low chair a gave hand smiling little secretly a monna lisa smile felt quite satisfied with talk must think over find fresh signal private beckonings in come see again said there be touch of imperativeness in tone looked through lace curtain saw go out into street there be something in gutter of roadway inquired into with end of stick looked like withered bunch of dusty chrysanthemum mr ames meantime have lunched at home gone off immediately afterwards a husband have conjectured to meeting in last month membership of league have largely increased be no longer possible to convene meeting in own drawing room for numbered fifty person including dozen men of enlightened principle even at first a have be seen have welcomed thereby incurring mr althams disapproval several lady with whom did not usually associate now gathering be entirely independent of class distinction wife of station master for instance be one of most active member walked up down platform with large rosette of suffragette colour selling current copy of clarion le remarkable than growth of league be growth of mr ames be neither pompous condescending to person whom couple of month ago must have looked upon a being barely existent except if be in church when must very probably have shared hymn book with of idea for have assembled galvanizing though strictly temporarily into class of existent people now idea brought together in commodious warehouse kindly lent sufficiently

barren barbaric conventionality be bursting indeed be not so much that others not even of class be becoming woman to a be becoming woman have scarcely be one hitherto have be piece of perfect propriety how far have travelled from original conception of suffragette movement a suitable to supply novelty for autumn must eclipse memory of shakespearean ball may be gathered from fact that longer took chair at meeting be ordinary member mr turner have far more experience in duty of chairman have proposed must have seconded a well have such step be in order to day meeting be assembled to discus part league must take in forthcoming election tory government be at present in power likely to remain in office while riseborough be fairly safe seat for tory member who be sir james westbourne before polemical obstructive measure must be decided on have clearly be necessary to ascertain sir james view on subject of vote for woman to day answer have be received be read to meeting be a unsatisfactory a be brief obedient servant have sympathy with so declined to promise support to cause mr turner read out laid down on desk will lady gentleman give view on course be to adopt said dozen simultaneously rose simultaneously sat down again chairman asked mr brook to address meeting succeeded there be complete unanimity of purpose in suggestion sir james meeting speech to constituent must not be allowed to proceed without interruption if have sympathy with cause cause must show marked lack of sympathy with thereafter league resolved into committee of way mean president of board of trade be coming to support sir james candidature at meeting date of be already fixed for fortnight hence be decided to make demonstration in force a discussion went on real practical plan be made that strange fascination excitement at thought of shouting interrupting at public meeting of becoming for first time of consequence began to seethe ferment most of member be woman whose life have be passed in continuous self repression who have be frozen over by narcotic ice of completely conventional humdrum existence many of be unmarried already of middle age natural human instinct have never known blossoming honey fulfilment of nature must have brought to eagerness sincerity with welcomed work demanded justice for sex there be added excitement of doing something at last there be opportunity of expansion of stepping out under stimulus of idea into experience be real in kind be akin to martyr who rejoiced sang when prospect of prosecution came near a martyr for sake of faith thought almost with glee of rack burning so minutely very prospect of discomfort rough handling seemed attractive if by such mean cause be infinitesimally advanced to sincere wholly laudable desire be added more personal stimulus must be doing something instead of suffering tedium of passivity acting instead of being acted on for be only through century of custom that woman physically weak liable to be knocked down have become servant of other sex be fiercer at heart more courageous more scornful of consequence than be only muscular inferiority of strength have subdued into place that occupies that period when for continuance of race must submit to month of tender strong inaction there find fruition of nature there awakes in sweet indulgence for strange childish lust of being master of parading in making of law convention adventitious power of semblance of sovereignty have be claimed by man at heart know that have put tinsel crown on head robed in spangle parody real gold lay woman hand on child head to please say how wise be how strong how clever child be pleased love for there be weakness for most dominant thing in nature be need of being loved from beginning must have be so when adam rib be taken from in sleep lost more than be left woke to find finer self gone from be left blundering bumble bee to rib be taken from clung courage of lioness wisdom of serpent gentleness of dove cunning of spider mysterious charm of firefly dance in dusk to rib also clung desire to be loved otherwise in human race male must be slain yearly like drone of hive strange thing grew from rib like flower from buried carrion desired love there be strength weakness desired love in desire suffered degradation to obtain leanness of soul entered into gratification of desire only when desire be pinched rationed when by operation of civilized law fruit of desire be denied so that blossom of sex be made into one unfruitful bud did revolt come long generation produced germ long generation made active at length swam up to sight from subaqueous dimness feeble violent conscious of justice of cause demanding justice what helped to make desire for justice so attractive be violence escape from self repression that demand gave opportunity for to many who life have be corked wired down in comfort woman care about sealed up in spinsterhood decorous emptiness of day there be justice in demand hysterical excitement in demanding to others in little league of riseborough there be many such prospect of making demand be primarily appalling to none more than to poor mr ames when plan of campaign be discussed decided on entrusted to member of league required almost more courage than idea be capable of inspiring to face even in anticipation thought of shouting vote for woman when good humoured cousin james rose said lady gentleman very possibly a have often happened in cousin james previous candidature lyndhurst must wish wife to ask president of board of trade to dinner before meeting occasion must warrant materialization of most sumptuous of dinner tabulated on printed menu card while sherry must be given with soup hock with fish constant flow of champagne be kept up afterwards until port time in case cousin james must certainly ask to sit on platform must roll richly to town hall in motor blazing with conservative colour while in small bag must be surreptitiously conveying there great suffragette rosette small steel chain with padlock must be sitting probably next mayor who must introduce speaker doubt refer to presence of fair sex who graced platform during must have to pin colour on dress chain up like andromeda snap patent spring lock of padlock when sir james rose imagination must not grapple with picture turned sickly away refusing to contemplate to cousin guest who have just eaten best salt so to speak of table from one who life have be so perfect piece of propriety felt far too old bottle for such new wine sitting surrounded by fellow crusader infected by proximity of undiluted enthusiasm must be difficult enough that must chain perhaps to very leg of table cousin james must soon thump in fervour of oratory a announced tory platitude in so firmly believed must so shrilly interrupt while sitting solitary in desert of sleek staid supporter be not only impossible unthinkable achievement horror fate that gruesome weaver of nightmare might have in store for felt that here be something that transcended imagination must not sit on platform with lyndhurst cousin james mayor lady westbourne do what be required of for sake of crusade curfew so to speak must have to ring that night lyndhurst be dining alone evening after meeting of way mean in state of mind not inaptly described a worried when felt kind cross when felt otherwise have come home hot from walk having sat in room where there be fire when evening fell chilly have have smart touch of lumbago thus there be clearly two cause for complaint against amy third disturbing topic for there be shadow of doubt that be bouquet of chrysanthemum that have found in road outside dr evans house even before lumbago have produced characteristic pessimism have be unable to find encouraging explanation of floral castaway im sure dont know be good of spending august said in filthy hole of harrogate at end of expense too if im to be crippled winter urged to so strongly must never have thought of going there otherwise dear have only be crippled for hour at present observed be great bore if only will take good hot bath to night have very light dinner expect will be much better in morning parker tell to see that there be plenty of hot water in kitchen boiler itll be only warm thing in house if there be said room be like ice house when came in positively like ice house enough to give man pneumonia let alone lumbago soup cold too dear must take more care of yourself said mr ames placidly why did not light fire instead of being cold im sure be laid have just burning up at dinner time said when no longer wanted be still early in course of dinner light fire in drawing room parker said mr ames let there be good fire when come out of dinner get roasted alive said major ames half to intending to be heard mr ames mind have be feasting for week past on thing have solider existence than husband unreasonable stricture since new diet have be hers snap growl have produced effect often annoyed into repartee a likely a not few month ago must have said that claret seemed very poor kind of beverage to night felt not smallest desire to retort be very sorry for lumbago felt inclination to carry war into territory to tell that if people perspiring freely of gouty habit choose to sit down without changing get chilly must expect reprisal for imprudence then will open window dear said if find be frizzling dont think will be too hot evening be chilly in october did have pleasant lunch lyndhurst indeed dont know where lunched ordered curry for sat down at quarter to two a did not come in be so infinitesimal be mental diet have supported for year perhaps after dinner must play picquet garden kitchen for year except for gossip infinitely le real have be topic there have be no joy for in beauty of garden only pleased sense of proprietorship if rare plant flowered if there be more rose than usual for have be vaguely pleased if lyndhurst have taken two helping of dish of have be vaguely disquieted if harry quoted swinburne lunched with evans said by way met cousin james westbourne afternoon when be on walk extraordinarily cordial get when there business ahead that brings into riseborough want to cadge dinner two little notice take of rest of year im sure couple of year since so much a sent brace of pheasant more than since asked to shoot there a say when want to pick up dinner two in riseborough he heartiness saying doesnt see half enough of doesnt seem to strain in trying to see more there seldom week end when that great guy of wife of dont have house packed with people suppose be not smart enough for except when convenient to dine in riseborough then he not above drinking bottle of champagne mr ames be eager in support of husband im sure there call for to open more bottle for dear said if cousin james want to see can take turn in asking harriet be great guy a say with big fiddle head major ames shrugged shoulder rather magnificently im sure dont grudge dinner said in point of fact told must come dine with before first meeting he got cabinet minister with said must bring too might get up little party thats to say if im not in bed with infernal lumbago cousin james will return hospitality by giving seat on platform to hear stamp stammer rant infernal bad speaker never heard worse wretched delivery nothing to say say fifty time over enough to make man turn radical however hell have made at home with mumm perhaps hell go to sleep before sends off of course represented lumbago view major ames have be fulsomely cordial to cousin james have urged dinner that represented now a being forced on have actually asked lyndhurst said mr ames rather faintly did say must come did ever know cousin james refuse decent dinner asked lyndhurst be kind enough to say must like at quarter past seven cool upon word wish have asked if hed have thick soup clear if preferred wing to leg thats sort of thing one never think of till afterwards mr ames be not attending closely there be that below surface claimed mind consequently missed pungency of irony hearing only word cousin james never take soup at said told always disagreed major ames sighed lumbago felt le acute ill temper have found relief in word have long ago discovered that woman have sense of humour on whole be gratifying to find truth of so amply endorsed for moment put into quite good temper im afraid ive be grumbling dinner said will go into other room there little sense in looking at decanter if maynt take glass of port eh be twinge chapter xi be use henry said mr altham on same evening telling be stuff nonsense when ive seen with own eye parcel of suffragette riband being actually directed to mr brook for pen ink be pen ink when be said done tapworth measured off six yard of on counter measure give two foot for gave nine length of put in paper directed of course if nine length of two foot doesnt make eighteen foot be six yard be wrong be right twice two no longer make four there be two other parcel already done up of exactly same shape will see if be not right do suppose that mr brook be ordering just to trim nightgown with never said anything about mr brook nightgown said henry who to do justice have be goaded into slightly rabelaisian mood never thought about mr brook nightgown didnt know wore one mean mr altham made what child must call face eye grew suddenly fixed boiled mouth assumed acidulated expression a if with plethora of lemon juice face be due to entry of parlour maid with pudding be jelly be served in silence mr altham waited door be quietly closed again be not question of mr brook nightgown said since agree that must not order six yard of suffragette riband to trim spoke sarcastically henry interpreted literally a often do be same at littlestone in august when bacon be so salt one day said to mr churchill that little bacon in bath must be equivalent to sea bathing upon must need tell next morning to send bacon to bath room did there be plate of bacon on sponge tray so extraordinary be beside point though what can have thought of cant imagine after gift of being literal may help now why doe mr brook want six yard of suffragette riband why be there two similar parcel on tapworths counter if have have moment alone must certainly have looked at other address seen where be being sent young tapworth be there time one with pince nez ridiculous chin put into errand boy basket told to be sharp about so have chance of seeing might have strolled along behind boy to see where went suggested mr altham went on bicycle said mr altham be impossible to stroll behind boy on bicycle hope to get there in time went up high street must not in least wonder if mr evans have turned suffragette after note to about not having time to attend anti suffragette meeting especially since there be only one said henry in literal mood have be forced on nobody came to that must not have sacrificed very much of time not that ever heard be valuable what can do with day cant imagine said mr altham mind completely diverted by new topic cook told griffith that a often a not doesnt go down to kitchen at in morning shes hardly ever to be seen shopping in high street before lunch what with elsie gone to dresden husband away on round day must be glad when bedtime shes small sleeper too for told that considers six hour good night though expect sleep more than know daresay have nap after lunch a well dear be talking about ah yes be saying must not wonder if have turned suffragette though cant recall what made think so because tapworths boy went up high street on bicycle said mr altham who have great gift of picking out single thread from tangle of wife conversation though after high street lead to other house besides mr evans station for instance seem to want to find fault with everything say to night henry dont know what make so contrary there be saw eighteen yard of suffragette riband being sent out when happened to be in tapworths morning daresay thats tithe of what have be ordered though cant say a to that unless expect to stand in high street day watch a to what mean ill let conjecture for since if told what thought must probably contradict again be wonder that mr altham be annoyed have be thrilled to marrow by parcel of suffragette riband when communicated discovery henry who usually be so sympathetic have seen nothing to be thrilled about have not meant to be unsympathetic repaired error im sure dear that will have formed very good guess a to what mean said tell what think well if care to know said think point to there being demonstration planned for one must not be surprised if looked out of window morning saw mr ames mr brook rest of marching down high street with riband banner theyve be keeping very quiet about at least not word of what theyve be doing have come to ear consider thats proof that something be going on that want to keep secret mr althams legal mind cried out to to put in plea that complete absence of news doe not necessarily constitute proof that exciting event be occurring rightly considered that such logic might be taken to be sign of continued contrariness so gave illogical assent to wife theory certainly be odd that nothing more have be heard of said wonder what be planning election coming on so soon too can be planning anything in connection with mr altham got up letting napkin fall on floor henry believe have hit said now what can be let go into drawing room thresh out best threshing machine in world can not successfully fulfil function unless there be material to work upon can show by whirling wheel rattling gear that be capable of threshing must anything be provided for poor althams be somewhat in position for ration of gossip be sadly reduced two chief source being cut off from for ever since mendacious mr brook have appeared a cleopatra when have a good a promised to be hermione chill politeness have taken place of intimacy between two house since there be telling what trick might not play next while very decided line mr altham have taken when found be expected to meet people like tradesman wife have caused complete rupture in relation with ames suffragette meeting be going on be certain else what sane mind must account for fact that only to day perfect stream of people of not even known by sight to mr altham therefore probably of very lowest origin with mr ames wife of station master among have be seen coming out of mr turner warehouse be ridiculous to tell that have be all making purchase nobody have told such supposition be thoroughly negatived by subsequent discovery that warehouse in question contained only quantity of chair however have be threshed out at tea time fly wheel buzzed emptily against probability of election demonstration be fact that unionist member to whom attention must naturally be directed be mr ames cousin though cousin be vague word mr altham must not wonder if be very distant sort of cousin indeed still must be worth while to get ticket anyhow for first of sir james meeting when president of board of trade be going to speak so a to be certain of good place be not mr ames cousin so far a mr altham knew though did not pretend to follow ramification of mr ames family fly wheel be allowed to run on in silence for little while after meagre material have be thoroughly sifted in case anything further offered then mr altham proposed topic be saying that wondered how mr evans got through time began there be need for to say word not opportunity mr altham stooped like hawk on quarry mean major ames said im sure never pas house what he going in coming out doe good deal more of going in than of other in opinion henry penetrated into meaning of what sounded rather curious achievement corroborated be there morning said on doorstep at eleven oclock might have be quarter past with bouquet of chrysanthemum big enough to do mr ames decoration at st barnabas what be matter dear for mr altham have literally bounced out of chair be pointing at forefinger trembled with nameless emotion at quarter past one few minute later said that bouquet be lying in middle of road let say twenty minute past one because came straight home took off hat be ready for lunch be more like haystack than bouquet im sure if hadnt stepped over must have tripped fallen to think that never mentioned to henry how thing piece together if give chance now did actually see major ames carry into house door be opened to just a came opposite said firmly in went bouquet then somebody must have thrown out again said mr altham held up one hand ticked off name on finger who be then in house said mr evans dr evans major ames otherwise servant how can find work for six servant in house cant understand servant must never have thrown chrysanthemum into street so neednt count servant now can imagine mr evans throwing away bouquet that major ames have brought if so envy power of imagination paused moment can there have be quarrel did tell have too much of bouquet dr evans said henry nodded portentously turned out of house bouquet said dr evans be powerful man major ames for size be mostly fat must not wonder if dr evans knocked down henry have good mind to treat mr ames a if have not be so insulting to that day after be only christian conduct to take round to after lunch to morrow book said wanted to see last july be sure have forgotten what be book will do since only want to be thought that read after must be sorry to let mr ames suppose that anything can do must have power of putting out must like to see if still dye hair after chrysanthemum in road must not be least surprised to be told that major ames be ill then will know dear be eleven oclock already never felt le inclined to sleep henry stepped downstairs to drink mild whisky soda after conversation excitement while be still half drunk felt compelled to run upstairs tap at wife door be not coming in dear said in answer to impassioned negative if find major ames be not ill one will be more rejoiced than henry said in disappointed voice henry went gently downstairs again mr ames be at home when forgiving mr altham arrived on following afternoon bearing copy of book of there be already two example in house clearly remembered having wanted to see book of have spoken together last july be very kind of mr altham to have attempted to supply with beyond doubt have ceased to dye hair for usual grey streak be apparent in proof if mr altham wanted proof did not that artificial mean have be resorted to even a mr altham with powerful observation noticed difference in mr ames hair so also noticed difference in mr ames no longer seemed pompous there be kindliness about be utterly unlike usual condescension though manifested only in trivial happening of afternoon call such a putting cushion in chair asking if found room with prospering fire too hot also led to interesting information be scarcely cold enough for fire to day said husband be laid up with little attack of lumbago be so sorry to hear said mr altham feverishly when did catch felt first last night before dinner be disappointing for expected harrogate to cure of such tendency be not very severe have doubt will be in here presently for tea mr altham felt quite convinced must not hastened to glean further enlightenment must be very busy thinking of election said suppose sir james be safe to get in got ticket for first of meeting morning will be one at president of board of trade speaks said mr ames cousin dine with first mr altham determined on more direct question really must require courage to be politician nowadays said especially if be in cabinet mr chilcot have be hardly able to open mouth lately without being interrupted by suffragette dear hope have not said wrong thing quite forgot sympathy be certainly subject interest said mr ames though a for saying wrong thing dear mr altham why world must be very dull place if agreed with other think requires just a much courage for woman to get up at meeting interrupt can not imagine being bold enough feel must be unable to get on foot utter word must be very much in earnest have great deal of conviction to nerve be not very satisfactory if anything be to be learned from be that mr ames be tepid supporter of cause what followed be still more vexing for parlour maid announced mr evans so sorry to hear about major ames dear cousin amy said wilfred told have be to see mr ames made kissing pad so to speak of small toad face millie dabbed cheek on dear millie how nice of to call parker tell major that tea be ready mr evans mr altham be here by time major ames arrived mr altham be there no longer be thoroughly disgusted with transformation into chaff of beautiful grain that have taken trouble to thresh out night before summed up succinctly to husband when came back from golf dont believe suffragette be going to do anything at henry said shouldnt wonder if chrysanthemum have nothing to do with anybody only thing be that hair be dyed because be speckled with grey again a thickly a yours declare left safety of race behind instead of bringing back again a meant to do henry who have won match at golf be naturally optimistic then didnt actually see major ames asked there be longer doubt about said think be unduly credulous be clear there be nothing matter with except touch of lumbago suffragette business mean nothing at in spite of yard of riband may take word for then there will be point in going to sir james meeting said henry though president of board of trade be going to speak not unless want to hear biggest windbag in country buttering up greatest prig in county must be sorry to waste time over be dining with ames so suppose there will be to look at will be row of on platform swollen with one of mr ames biggest dinner might have gone to bed at usual time last night for use that there have be in talk be saw chrysanthemum from expected so much thought worth while to tell about henry felt too much depressed at utter flatness of have made so fair promise to enter protest against palpable injustice of conclusion major ames lumbago be of laodicean sort hot cold hung about occasionally stabbing shrewdly at time retreating in parthian mode so that be encouraged to drink glass of port upon shot at again have to get back to stew of sloppy diet depressing reflection most of relation into have allowed to drift with regard to millie filled with timorous yet exultant agitation almost if not quite exaggerated indisposition in order to escape from responsibility of deciding what must come of damp boisterous weather made prudent for to keep to house came to see daily behind demure quietness divined mind be expectant sure there be doubt a to view of situation have arisen between have played with emotion of others once too often be caught in agitation have so often excited without sharing in mr ames be generally present at visit when be quite certain that be not looking millie often raised eye to disconcerting conviction lurked behind speech be equally disconcerting for must say will be nice when be well again in manner that quite belied commonplace word force lay behind strangely controlled involuntarily almost answered signal gave lover like privilege of seeming to understand be not said time too perfectly appreciated bad taste of affair namely that woman who be in love with to whom have given indication of most unmistakable kind that be on plane of emotion must play unacted scene in wife house coming there to make pas invalid hour that must take part in be common must not contrast that commonness with unconsciousness of wife occasionally be inclined to think poor amy how little see a often occurred to that be too big to be aware of such smallness a milly be guilty of in reality truth lay between extreme view be not too big to be aware of be quite aware of be big enough to appear too big to be aware of watched scorned for watching fed with suspicion be robust enough to spew forth again also allowed robuster attitude to flourish be concerned with nightmare of own daily grew more vivid unescapable decade of streaming october day passed in trying atmosphere of suspicion uncertainty apprehension of three of be major ames who be most thoroughly ill at ease for have inspiration enabled to bear sordid martyrdom divined that millie be evolving situation in must be expected to play very prominent part such ardour a be felt not to be of adequate temperature looked back over peaceful day when garden supplied not only with flower with most poignant emotion known to nature almost with regret have be so peaceful pleasant in land locked harbour now like steam tug be slowly towing out past pier head into waste of breaker strictly speaking be possible for at moment to cast towing rope off return to quiet anchorage be afraid lacked moral power to do so have let throw rope aboard have helped to attach to bollard thinking so to speak that be tug frail little craft that frail little craft have developed into engined apparatus be turn to be towed helpless at least unwilling wholly uninspired others at rate have inspiration to warm discomfort mr ames sense of justice sisterhood be leavening dumpy existence mr evans fire however strange illicit be burning however common trivial material from spring must still be called love be evening of sir james first meeting mr ames at six oclock be satisfying that nothing have be omitted in preparation for dinner printed menu card be in place announcing be most sumptuous requisite relay of knife spoon fork be on sideboard plate of opalescent glass for ice be to hand there be longer anything connected with terrible feast that to have horror of murderer breakfast on last morning of life must serve to distract mind more millie be to dine with with come to meeting just now did not seem to matter in slightest what millie did day mr ames have be catching at problematic straw might save be possible that mr chilcot must be seized with sudden indisposition meeting be postponed have seen drive by in cousin james motor looking particularly hearty cousin james might catch influenza lady westbourne already have be pleasantly infectious lyndhurst might get attack of really acute lumbago instead felt absolutely well again to day have even done little garden rolling one by one bright possibility have be extinguished now reasonable anchor remained except dinner must acutely disagree with be hardly likely since felt incapable of eating anything that motor be to take to town hall must break down at half past six went upstairs to dress must thus secure quarter of hour before actual operation of decking began in to be alone really face what be going to happen be use trying to face in one piece taken together coming evening have horror unreality of nightmare brooding over have to take moment by moment from time when must welcome guest whom so seemed to be then going to betray till time when perhaps four hour from now must be back again here in room everything have happened have woven into woolly texture of past in place of being in steely imminent future there be dinner to be gone through be only tolerable to think of because of what be to follow in must please to entertain cousin so notable man a cabinet minister clearly then must separate dinner from rest enjoy independently when went down to dinner must have left here in readiness little black velvet bag be not so pleasant to think of yet little black velvet bag have nothing to do yet then there must follow drive to town hall must not be unpleasant in must rather enjoy stir pomp of arrival sir james must doubtless say to scrutinizing doorkeeper lady be with must pas on amid demonstration of deference probably there must be little procession on to platform mayor must very likely lead way with her little black velvet bag then poor mr ames suddenly felt that if thought about more must have nervous collapse at thought inspiration so to speak reached out cool firm hand to at cost be going through with nightmare for sake of inspired be use saying be pleasant be pleasant to have tooth out woman with slightest self respect when once convinced that be better to have tooth out went to dentist at appointed hour declined gas mr ames have very decided opinion about who made fuss over little pain opened mouth held arm of chair very firmly one wanted something to hold on to at moment wondered what must find to hold on to evening perhaps holding on must be done by somebody else policeman for instance there be one more detail to attend to before dressing opened little black velvet bag in be two chain light of steel have be sold with gratifying recommendation that of alone must hold mastiff be more than be required one be of such length a to go tightly round waist spring lock with hasp passing through last link of closing with internal snap obviated necessity of key proposed to put on below light cloak wore before started second chain be rather longer otherwise similar be to be passed through one already in place on waist round object to desired to attach snap lock made necessary connection saw that be in order putting big suffragette rosette on top of other apparatus closed bag be useless to try to accustom to by looking might a well inspect dentist forceps hoping thus to mollify grip cloak little velvet bag must leave here come up for after dinner already quarter of hour be over be time to dress daring rose coloured silk be to be worn on occasion hoped that must not experience rough treatment yet hardly mattered after to night must very likely never care to set eye on again emphatically lyndhurst must find full of disagreeable association then felt suddenly acutely sorry for for amazement chagrin that be about to feel must not fail to be burningly ashamed of to choke with rage mortification perhaps must bring on attack of lumbago must intensely regret did not anticipate feeling in least degree ashamed of herself intensely wished have not got to be now be ready rose coloured silk glowed softly in electric light pink satin shoe went with be on plump pretty little foot row of garnet be clasped round neck there be good deal of colour in face be pleased to see looked so well last time have worn fine feather be on evening returned home with brown hair softened wrinkle from overstrand be not successful evening seemed that rose coloured silk be destined to shine on inauspicious scene now be ready be last moment alone plumped down on knee by bedside in sudden access of despair at what lay before found lip involuntarily repeating word be used in hugest most holy agony man spirit have ever known when for one moment felt that even must not face sacrifice of to drink of cup next moment sprang from knee again face aflame with shame at paltriness wretched little coward said to herself how dare dinner that long expensive dinner brought with trouble unanticipated by mr ames mr chilcot appeared be teetotaler at time never ate anything couple of poached egg before made speech be also owing to recent experience little nervous about suffragette required reiterated assurance unaccountable female have not be seen about true that week two ago received letter asking view said sir james wrote fairly curt reply have heard nothing more about agent pretty wide awake must have known if there be likely to be disturbance thanks major one glass of champagne be allow before making speech capital wine know always say give one best glass of wine to be have in kent hows time by way ah weve got plenty of time yet like to have five minute quiet before going on to platform said mr chilcot yes will be right perhaps might have motor five minute earlier cousin amy sweetbread thanks dear what great dinner be giving awful dismal atmosphere descended mr chilcot thinking of speech frowned at poached egg when be finished at table cloth cousin james refused dish after dish mr ames felt incapable of eating major ames mr evans who be practically vegetarian be left to do carousing wine went round untouched silence grew longer interminable succession of dish failed to tempt anybody except major ames at rate not one whole series of luncheon party must be necessary to finish up untouched dainty of ill starred dinner outside brisk tattoo of rain beat on window wind having got up fire began to smoke mr chilcot to cough readjustment of door window mended matter sluiced cousin james in chilly draught mr chilcot brightened up little a coffee came round coffee be only weak spot in admirable repast being moderately warm put down mr ames tried to repair error im afraid be not hot enough said parker tell to heat up at once cousin james looked at watch really think ought to be off said im sure can get cup of coffee for mr chilcot from hotel might go together unless have ordered something cousin amy motor hold five easily smart chill october rain be falling drove through blurred disconsolate street few figure under umbrella went swiftly along cheerless pavement crowd of very smallest dimension scarce two deep across pavement opposite town hall watched arrival of who be attending meeting there be insignificant queue of dozen carriage awaiting disembarkment a hand of town hall clock indicated that meeting be not timed to begin for twenty minute yet even mr chilcot must not get agitated about possibility of cup of coffee before effort through rain streaked window mr ames must see how meagre owing doubt to inclement night be assembly of ticket holder be possible of course crowd might soon begin to arrive riseborough generally made point of being in place in plenty of time anticipated sparsely attended room mr brook hurried by in mackintosh golosh cheerful turner family who be just behind in cab dived into wet night emerged again under awning mr currie wife of station master with suffragette rosette in paper parcel have friendly word with policeman at door at sight since indicated forcible assemblage of league felt little encouraged then car moved on stopped again opposite awning party dismounted bustling official demanded ticket be summarily thrust aside by just a bustling more enlightened who have recognized sir james conducted to mayor parlour where dignitary received there be coffee already provided anxiety on score be removed mr chilcot effaced in corner with cup note while others notably sir james behaved with mixture of social condescension official deference appears to be right attitude in dealing with mayor then mayoress said george dear have gone half hour will escort mr ames george asked mr ames if might have honour observed will have thin meeting be afraid most inclement for october mr ames pulled cloak little closer round in order to hide chain be more significant than mayor felt little black velvet bag beating time to step against knee walked through stark bare passage with stone floor exuded cold moisture in sympathy with wetness of evening came out into sudden blaze of light faint applause from nearly empty bench heralded appearance disposed on row of plush arm chair behind long oak table mayor sat in centre to right left of sir james mr chilcot just opposite mr ames be large table leg have for significance of execution shed put bag conveniently on knee quietly unloosed latch fastened there be more preparation to be made just yet since chain be quite ready in curious irresponsible calm took further note of surroundings scarcely hundred people be there told face after face a passed eye down seat be friendly familiar mr currie bowed turner family in state of pleasantest excitement beamed mr brook gave excited hand wave be sitting in encouraging vicinity to other be alone a on inexorable sea while be on pier then mayor cleared throat have be arranged that mayor be to be given uninterrupted hearing for be local grocer have perhaps be tacitly felt that might adopt retaliatory measure in inferior quality of subsequent supply of sugar involved in sentence have end must probably have gone on for ever have not with commendable valour chopped off tail when coil threatened to strangle begun again point of be that have honour to welcome president of board of trade sir james westbourne luckily poster with town have be placarded for last fortnight corroborated information reasonable person must longer doubt be rejoiced to see so crowded assembly met together be not very happy sentence have be carefully thought out be pity not to reproduce be convinced that must spend most interesting enjoyable evening must certainly prove to be epoch making politics be taken seriously in riseborough be pleasant to see gathering graced by so many member of fair sex felt have detained quite long enough must detain no longer yes call on right honourable mr chilcot cheer a mr chilcot rose mr turner rose also said in clear cheerful voice vote for woman have rosette pinned little crookedly depending from shoulder immediately wife daughter rose too in sort of gregorian chant said woman right rattle of chain made pleasant light accompaniment from beneath seat mr currie produced banner trimmed with appropriate colour on be embroidered vote for woman fold clung dispiritingly together there be never more dejected banner two stalwart porter whom have brought with also got up wiped mouth with back of hand said in low hoarse tone vote for woman lasted few second there be silence again be impossible to imagine le impressive demonstration seemed incarnation of ineffectiveness mr chilcot have instantly sat down when began though have cause to be shy of suffragette seemed quite undisturbed be smiling good naturedly for moment consulted note again then suddenly mr ames realized that have taken share in have begun so quickly so quickly ended that for time have merely watched then blood courage came back to must not be fault in case if proceeding lacked fire idea have meant so much to during last month seemed to stand by asking aid opened little black velvet bag pinned on rosette passed second chain strong enough to hold mastiff through first round leg of table in front of heard spring lock click rose to foot waving hand vote for woman cried vote for woman hurrah instantly one on platform turned to saw lyndhursts inflamed astonished face with mouth fallen open in incredulous surprise like fish in aquarium saw cousin james frown of distinguished horror mr evans looked a if about to laugh mayoress said lor mr chilcot turned round in seat good humored smile faded leaving angry fighting face hostility amazement so far from cowing silencing seemed like draught of wine vote for woman cried again at that cry be taken up in earnest by desperate effort mr currie unfurled banner so that floated free porter roared out message with conviction put into announcement to stopping train that be riseborough turner family gleefully shouted together mr brook unable to adjust rosette madly waved solid group of enthusiast just below platform emitted loud militant cry have be flat lifeless moment before be inspired vital mr ames have done for moment have nothing glory in heart mr chilcot leaned over table to have idea said when have honour of dining with that proposed immediately afterwards to treat with such gross discourtesy vote for woman shouted mr ames again time cry be le vehemently taken up for there be nothing to interrupt mr chilcot conferred moment quietly with sir james mr ames saw that lyndhurst mr evans be talking together former be spluttering with rage mr evans have laid slim white gloved hand on knee in attempt appeared to soothe at present endeavour did not seem to be meeting with notable measure of success even in midst of excitement mr ames thought how ludicrous lyndhursts face be also felt sorry for a well have sense of being tremendous fun never in life have be so effective never have even for moment paralysed plan of other people be doing that now mr chilcot have come here to speak be not permitting to again cried vote for woman inspector of police have come on to platform after few word with sir james vaulted down into body of hall next moment dozen policeman tramped in from outside immediately afterwards turner family still beaming be being trundled down gangway firmly ejected sundry high note muffled shouting came from outside after few second be dumb a if tap have be turned off there be little more trouble with mr currie few smart tug brought away somewhat flimsy wooden rail to have attached be taken along in sort of tripping step like cheerful dancing bear with chain jingling round after turner quietly put out into night then sir james came across to mr ames cousin amy said must please give word to cause more disturbance will tell couple of men to take away vote for woman shouted mr ames again excitement possessed be rapidly dying from hall there came response except very audible laughter be very sorry said cousin james then with sudden overwhelming wave futility of whole thing struck what have done have merely be extremely rude to two guest have seriously annoyed husband have aroused perfectly justifiable laughter general fortescue be sitting few row off be looking at through pince nez red good humoured face be chink with smile then two policeman one of whom have beat in st barnabas road vaulted up on to platform several people left place to look on from more advantageous position beg pardon maam said st barnabas policeman touching helmet with imperturbable politeness shes chained up too bill bill be slow large fatherly looking man examined mr ames fetter then broad grin broke out over amiable face only just passed around table leg said hitch up table leg mate slip off be too true patent lock mastiff holding chain be slipped down table leg mr ames with fatherly looking policeman politely carrying chain little velvet bag be gently inevitably propelled through door quarter of hour ago have entered escorted by mayor down stone passage out into dripping street rain fell heavily on to rose coloured silk dress fatherly policeman put cloak have half fallen off more shelteringly round better have cab maam go home quietly said youll catch cold if stay here cant let in again begging pardon maam mr ames looked round mr currie be just crossing road apparently on way home carriage drove off containing turner family sense of utter failure futility possessed be cold wet chilly wind flapped awning blowing shower of dripping raindrop on to excitement courage have possessed just now have oozed away nothing have be effected unless to make ridiculous must be counted a achievement call cab for lady bill said policeman soothingly be soon summoned bill touched helmet a got in before closing door pulled up window for cabman also knew there be need to give address rain pattered on window on roof horse splashed briskly along through puddle in roadway parker opened door to surprised at speediness of return why maam exclaimed have anything happened nothing parker said feeling that dreadful truth underlay word tell major when come in have gone to bed looked for moment into dining room so short time have passed that table be not yet cleared printed menu card have be collected coffee have not be hot enough still stood untasted in cup slice of pineapple cut not eaten be ruinously piled together thought of luncheon must be necessary to consume expensive food made feel sick little thing have assumed ridiculous size to mind that have seemed so big be pitifully dwindled felt desperately tired cold lonely chapter xii whats to be done now said major ames chipping bacon high into air above plate if didnt hear said whats to be done now dont know how can look riseborough in face again upon word dont see how can theyll point at in street say thats major ames whose wife made fool of herself thats what did amy made fool of yourself be good of be nearer getting vote than before because youve screamed vote for woman dozen time youve only given proof more of how utterly unfit be to have anything at of own let alone vote passed sleepless night with thinking of folly feel infernally unwell morning clearly constituted climax mr ames took advantage of rhetorical pause followed nonsense lyndhurst said heard snoring enough to make man snore said snore indeed why couldnt even have told that be going to behave like silly lunatic if couldnt have persuaded to behave sanely must have stopped away instead of looking on at exhibition one will suppose must have known about have countenanced ive good mind to write to kent chronicle say be absolutely ignorant of what be going to do youve disgraced thats what youve done took gulp of tea imprudently for be much hotter than anticipated now ive burned mouth said mr ames put down napkin left seat came stood by be sorry be so much vexed said cant wont discus anything with if talk like that be thinking about nothing whether be disgraced whether have have bad night certainly dont seem to have thought about said a matter of fact did said knew must not like be sorry do suppose liked thought most about reason for did did for notoriety said major ames with conviction wanted to see name in paper a having interrupted cabinet minister speech wont even have satisfaction be glad to say cousin james who be decent sort of fellow after spoke to reporter last night asked to leave out account of disturbance consented be decent fellow too didnt want to give publicity to folly be sorry for amy how do like dozen reporter at pound week being sorry for cousin james be equally generous bore malice to shook hand with said saw be unwell when sat down to dinner when man of world a cousin james be say think that woman be unwell know what mean thought be intoxicated drunk in fact thats what thought thought be drunk wife drunk be kindest interpretation must have put upon mad drunk chose drunk hoped must be able to come over day next week help to thin out pheasant very friendly considering have happened mr ames moved slightly away from do mean to go asked of course mean to go show very generous spirit think can account for highest of rocketters want to smoothe thing over be generous hold out olive branch recognizes that ive got to live down folly if known that ive be shooting with will help forgive forget hey will just go over there en garon will patch matter up dare say hell ask over again time doesnt want to be hard on do be sure there be thing man can stand man got to put foot down sometimes even if put down on wife if be bit rough with just now must realize amy must realize that felt strongly strongly rightly weve got to live down what have done well im by well live down together ill make peace with cousin can trust magnificent assurance failed to dazzle mr ames made acknowledgement of instead went back rather abruptly inconveniently to previous topic tell that cousin james believed be drunk said now knew be not seem to have let pas major ames felt that more magnanimous assurance might be in place there be thing best passed over said let sleeping dog lie think le talk about last night better hope be generous enough not to want to rub in amy not to make more uncomfortable than be mr ames sat down in chair by fireplace huge fire burned there altogether disproportionate to day screened face from blaze with morning paper also made mental note to speak to parker about be making very uncomfortable indeed lyndhurst said by not telling what ask did let pas when saw james thought be drunk yes didnt say so in so many word if have said so well dare say must have have made sort of answer mind be accusation made against made excuse for mr ames small insignificant face grew suddenly very firm fixed need to go into said saw thought be drunk said nothing after mean to go over shoot pheasant be that so certainly be be making mountain out of be making mountain out of anything personally dont believe cousin james thought anything of kind what matter be that let pas what matter be must have to tell that must apologize to instead of seeing for major ames got up pushing chair violently back well here pretty state of thing cried that must be telling to apologize for last night degrading exhibition wonder what youll be asking next vote of thanks from mayor shouldnt wonder illuminated address teaching what ought to do must have thought woman must have be only too glad to trust to husband if be so kind a have be a to want to get out of consequence of folly now who must sit there opposite fire fit to roast ox tell must apologize apology be damned there not habit to swear a well know there be occasion apology be damned moment later house shook with thunder of slammed front door mr ames sat for couple of minute exactly where be still shielding face from fire felt chilling effect of reaction follows on excitement whether excitement be rapturous a sickening a last night have be not for moment did regret share in event of evening before in sequel of morning last night have ended in utter fiasco have done best morning talk have ended in pretty sharp quarrel again found impossible to reconsider share in humanly felt beaten ridiculed sick at heart not ashamed have passed sleepless night be horribly tired with tiredness seems to sap pluck power of resistance gradually eye grew dim difficult meagre tear of middle age be so bitter began to roll down cheek hard inelastic sob to rise in throat yet be use sitting here cry lunch dinner have to be ordered whether felt unhappy not have to see how extensive be damage done to pink satin shoe by wet pavement last night have to speak about ox roasting fire also there be appointed suffragette meeting at mr turner house for eleven oclock at past achievement future plan must be discussed have barely time to wash face for be unthinkable that parker cook must see have be cry get through household duty before be time to start dried eye went to window through streamed pale saffron coloured october sunshine stormy trouble of night have passed air sparkled with clear shining after rain frost of few night before have blackened autumn flower chill rain have beaten down glory of husband chrysanthemum so that garden bed looked withered dishevelled like whose interest in life be finished who no longer care what appearance present interest of others in seemed to be finished also be not gardener day here for only came twice in week major ames who must have be assiduous in binding up broken stemmed encouraging invalid clearing away havoc wrought by storm have left house perhaps have gone to club perhaps even now be trying to make light of must almost hear say woman get queer notion into head notion run away with bless take glass of sherry with general wont be by chance going to sir james shoot next week im shooting there one day be talking over somewhere else perhaps not making light of did not know knew be that be alone wanted somebody who understood even if disagreed did not seem to matter that lyndhurst utterly disagreed with what mattered be that have misunderstood motif so entirely that monstrous implication that have be intoxicated seemed to excuse be not sorry what must do since be not sorry be a difficult to answer that a be easy to know what to do moment be sorry indeed then must be unnecessary to do anything reconciliation must be automatic must bring with something yearned after opportunity of making see that cared that woman in reached out towards in different fashion now from that in have tried to recapture semblance of youth awakened admiration to day looked back on episode shamefacedly have taken so much trouble with so paltry purpose yet innocent natural coquetry be not quite dead in woman heart need be so old that no longer care whether be pleasing in husband eye only to day seemed to mr ames that pain have be a disproportionate to purpose a have be to result now longed to take pain for purpose be somewhat deeper than for softened wrinkle refreshed colour of hair turned from window empty garden wishing that rain must be renewed so that there must be excuse for to go to mr turner in shut cab a be there be such excuse felt that must require effort to walk past club window to traverse length of high street female riseborough on warm sunny morning knew must be there in force popping in out of shop holding little conversation on pavement there must be one topic to day for many day yet must be long before autumn novelty lost anything of freshness wondered how appearance in town must be greeted must people smile turn aside a approached whisper giggle after have gone by what of mayor who like honest tradesman be often to be seen at door of shop looking at dressing of window policeman always stood at bottom of street controlling cross traffic from st barnabas road must be that one who have helped to further movement last night almost felt ought to thank then quite suddenly pluck returned again be that realized that did not comparatively speaking care two straw for individual comment by play might take place in high street for accumulated weight there be other thing to care about for cared immensely high street proved to be paved with incident turning quickly round corner nearly ran into bill policeman off duty at hour obviously giving humorous recital of sort to small amused circle outside public house be abruptly discontinued when appeared felt that interest that audience developed in sunny october sky contemplated with faint grin must be succeeded by stifled laughter after have passed few pace further on controlling traffic of market day be other policeman bill who smiled in pleasant familiar manner to a if there be capital joke private to twenty yard further along street be standing mayor contemplating shop window saw urgent business appeared to demand presence inside after that there came general fortescue tottering to club crossed street to meet took off hat shook hand by jove mr ames said never enjoyed meeting so much wife wild that didnt go what lark made feel quite young again wanted to shout too tell to give lady vote monstrously amusing just going to club to have chat about went on way with fat old body shaking with laughter then feeling rather ill from encounter heard rapid step in pursuit of mr altham joined oh mr ames said must die of vexation be not there be really true that threw glass of water at mr chilcot hit policeman fancy that must have be terribly wet night henry just sat at home never thinking that five minute in cab must make such difference sat played patience must have be most impatient if have known what be to happen next be so stupid of not to join league wonder if be too late be quite dreadful mr ames have be prepared for husband anger for pride aversion from people like mr altham what be totally unexpected unwelcome be that be supposed to have scored sort of popular success that riseborough considered dreadful fiasco of last night a achievement something not only to talk about kind of new game more exciting than croquet criticism have begun by thinking of suffragette movement a autumn novelty leanness came very near soul when found that now appeared to others a have first thought of have travelled since then have seen hinterland of idea rose up behind austere beautiful wise that others saw be just hysterical jungle bounded coast to morning after experience of hysterical jungle seemed hysterical jungle if be only by route that height must be attained then that route must be followed be willing to try again be there not somewhere somehow better road be not necessary to be particularly cordial to mr altham held out certain prospect of immediate repetition of last night scene of desire for additional recruit further trial awaited in short walk dr evans driving high stepping cob wheeled round dismounted throwing rein to groom must just congratulate said for millie told about last night ive be telling that if have pluck must be better for hope didnt catch cold beastly night wasnt do let know when will come on again hate principle know love practise will come shout too be perfectly awful nobody understood sympathized with cared not two straw for have prompted to do sensational thing liked sensational thing be fun to be fun to who believed in principle prompted thought of a clown at pantomime wanted to see dan leno be minute late when reached mr turner house depressed not encouraged by uncomprehending applause took a excellent joke manifestation have be directed by so serious purpose what to be tragic necessary be to farce of entertaining quality now must meet co religionist again who knew whose conviction of same quality a hers be of such weight a to make feel that even quarrel with lyndhurst be light in comparison jovial turner family father mother daughter be in drawing room hailed a heroine if have not be for there must have be scene at did policeman hurt mr turner have got small bruise on knee be quite doubtful whether got when be taken out mr turner have lost small pearl ornament be not sure whether have put on before going to meeting miss turner have cold to day be certain that have felt coming on before be put out into rain none of have seen end be supposed that mr ames have thrown glass of water at policeman have hit mr chilcot be quite ready for sir james next meeting must be coward cause scrutiny to be held on who desired admittance mr brook arrived have not be turned out last night have caught cold did not think that much have be achieved mr chilcot have made speech apparently very clever one about tariff reform sir james have followed without interruption telling half empty sympathetic bench about house of lord there have be allusion made to disturbance to motif prompted also have lost suffragette rosette must have be torn off though did not feel go mr currie brought more life into proceeding must get four porter to come to next meeting must make banner a well a ensuring proper unfurling of first have stuck so unaccountably have waved quite properly when have tried hour before have waved quite properly for have be returned to after have be ejected when tried again hour later at home two banner expanding properly must be vastly different affair from one did not expand at husband have laughed fit to do damage over account of proceeding dozen more only of league made appearance for clearly there be reaction cooling after last night conflagration paid meed of appreciation to mr ames little rocket have fizzed spluttered until showed way a mr currie expressed to even be ritual so to speak disturbance shouting sense of doing something rather than belief that lay behind ritual stirred imagination must cause be better served by endurance of hour solitary toothache than by waving banner in town hall being humanely ejected by benevolent policeman there must have be le eagerness to suffer mr ames must so willingly have passed many hour of physical pain rather than suffer heartache troubled morning nobody seemed to understand mr currie with four porter two banner mr brook with cold in head odour of eucalyptus cheerful turner who thought must be such good idea to throw squib on to platform be a far from point a general fortescue chatting at club even a lyndhurst with high chipped bacon slammed front door be game to a have originally presented to autumn novelty for say thursday afternoon from five till seven if only opposite effect have be produced if have taken a poignantly a lyndhurst a cheerily a meantime after slamming front door have stormed up st barnabas road in so sincere passion that have nearly reached club before remembered that have hardly touched breakfast glanced at paper so a there be sense in starving starvation consisting in only having breakfast turned in at hospitable door ordered omelette never in life have be so angry never in amazing chronicle of matrimony so seemed to have man received such provocation from wife have insulted guest who have dined with made public stupendous as of herself when next morning after making such expostulation a be morally bound to make have be so nobly magnanimous a to assure that must patch up for live down with have be told that be for to apologize wonder have sworn moses must have sworn must have be absolutely wrong of not to swear there be situation in be cowardly for man not to say what thought even now a waited for omelette emitted little squeak explosive exclamation almost incredulous of wrong ate omelette seemed to add fuel to rage went into smoking room where over club cigar for have actually forgotten to bring own case with turned to consideration of practical detail be not clear how to re enter house again have gone out with bang made window rattle be hardly possible to go on banging door time went in out for joinery must stand reiterated shock what be to be done even if must devise effective re entry unless amy put into hand unreservedly took back that have said be impossible for to speak to somehow felt that there be few thing le likely to happen than certainly must be no good to resume storming operation for have gun greater than have already fired if be not of sufficient calibre must just beleaguer with silence dignified displeased silence looked up saw that mr altham be regarding through glass door upon mr altham rapidly withdrew not long afterwards young morton occupied retired from same observatory moment reflection enabled major ames to construe singular behaviour have heard of wife conduct be gluttonously feeding on so unusual spectacle a in club at hour reconstructing in monkey mind domestic disturbance must probably ascertain that have breakfasted here be exceedingly unpleasant there be sympathy in covert glance only curiosity one who be not brute major ames be not that enjoys quarrel with wife one who be not utterly self centred be not quite that fails to desire sympathy when quarrel have occurred wanted sympathy now wanted to pour out into friendly ear tale of amys misdeed of own magnanimity to hear own estimation of conduct confirmed fairly confirmed by woman who must see woman point of view a well a smoking room with peeping tom be untenable thought knew where must get sympathy millie be in must see from habit a crossed hall looked to peg where dr evans hat coat seeing be not there inferred that doctor be out that suited wanted to confide be sympathized with felt that evans breezy optimism out of door habit of mind must not supply kind of comfort felt in need of wanted to be told be martyr very fine fellow that amy be unworthy of millie be in green cool drawing room where have sat one day after lunch rose a entered came towards with tremulous smile on lip hand outstretched dear lyndhurst said be so glad have come sit down think if have not come must have telephoned to ask if must not see must have suggested taking little walk perhaps for think must have risked seeing cousin amy know how feel oh so well be abominable disgraceful certainly have come to right place millie understood have guessed must sat down close beside for moment held hand over eye ah have be so angry morning said have given headache wilfred laughed about said also that what amy did showed tremendous lot of pluck be utterly heartless knew how must be suffering be so angry with did not understand oh headache be nothing will soon be gone now faintly emphasized last word stroked so to speak a if calling attention to im broken hearted about said major ames sounded better than to say im in purple rage about im broken hearted shes disgraced no not yes woman cant do sort of thing without world believing that husband knew about thats not upon word im not sure whether what did morning isnt worse than what saw last night millie leaned forward tell said if doesnt hurt too much decided did not hurt too much well came down morning said willing eager to make best of bad job so be james westbourne last night be just a generous asked reporter to say nothing about invited to day shooting next week very decent of a say came down morning willing to make a easy a must of course knew have to give amy good talking to must utterly have failed in duty to a husband if did not do gave blowing up though not half of what deserved blowing up even then when have said say told must live down together be sufficiently generous think for good told that james westbourne said saw be unwell that when man say that mean that be drunk perhaps westbourne didnt mean thats what sounded like must believe just because hadnt knocked down stamped on face tell ought to apologize to for letting suggestion pas well flared up at what man of spirit wouldnt have flared up left house at once went finished breakfast at club must have choked upon word must have choked if have stopped there got apoplexy a be feel devilish unwell millie got up stood for moment in silence looking out of window white willowy can never forgive cousin amy said at length never well be hard said major ames after year isnt exactly return one might expect perhaps be infamous said millie came sat down by again what be going to do asked dont know if apologizes will forgive will try to forget didnt think of if doesnt apologize dont know cant be expected to eat word must be countenancing what have done couldnt do must not be sincere im straight hope if say thing may be taken for granted that mean looked up at with chin raised think be wonderful said to be able even to think of forgiving if have behaved like must not expect wilfred to forgive then be so big so big doe not understand cant understand one thing about doesnt know oh how blind woman be be little wonder that by time major ames be beginning to feel extraordinarily fine fellow be more wonderful that basked in warm sense of being understood from first millie have understood felt that particularly now at moment when amy have so hideously flouted wronged through last summer situation of to day have be foreshadowed have always be in house rather than in own that have be welcomed appreciated have be architect adviser in shakespeare ball while at home amy dealt out absurd printed menu card without consulting garden loved who have so often said sweet flower be really for who on other hand have so often said sweet pea be not doing very well be then looked at millies soft youthful face eye that sought in timid sensitive appeal dim golden hair mouth childish mysterious for contrast there be small strong toad face rather beady eye hair grey brown be also millie understood saw a be generous perhaps to fault big big a have so properly said always made feel so comfortable so contented with be true substance of woman mission to make husband happy to make devoted to instead of raising hell in town hall insisting on apology afterwards youve cheered up millie said youve made feel that ive got friend after friend who feel with im grateful im im more than grateful im tough old fellow ive got heart still believe whats to happen to be emotion real genuine emotion that made millie clever at moment mind be of high order might if thought about thing be trusted to exhibit nothing more subtle than fair grasp of obvious now did not think be prompted by instinct utterly transcended achievement of brain be capable go back to house said be ready for cousin amy to say be sorry very likely be waiting for there now oh lyndhurst got up at once few word made feel completely noble made feel noble likewise atmosphere of nobility be almost suffocating be right said be always be right good delicious have there be question about cousinly relation between so natural spontaneous caress needed explanation house be apparently empty when got back made sufficiently noisy entry to advise drawing room in case that be returned personally ready since did not enter full of wrath like hyperion to accept apology eventually went in there a if to look for paper in case of being occupied with same pretext strolled into wife sitting room then still casually went into dressing room where have slept last night satisfied that be not in bedroom penitence therefore must naturally be manifested by waiting dim eyed for return have not be of peremptory quality went out into garden surveyed damage of last night rain there be need to punish plant because amy have be guilty of behaviour own cousin said be infamous also wanted something to employ with till lunch time a hand worked mechanically tying up clump of chrysanthemum have few day more of flame in golden

of moral law justify that nothing that have done nothing that must do short of violation of essential principle of married life must absolve from accomplishment of one tittle of duty towards for moment in spite of perplexity difficulty of decision mr ames smiled at for mental use of great word like duty privilege over so small incident for what have happened have be militant suffragette on one occasion only at breakfast next morning have in matter arising therefrom allowed to swear at yet seemed to that with pettiness insignificance of great law be concerned for law of kindness be broken by most trumpery exhibition of inconsiderateness law of generosity by most minute word of spite backbiting indeed be chiefly in little thing since most of be not concerned with great matter that violation occur in cup of cold water that be fulfilled for once mr ames did not finish decoration with tidiness precision fact clearly noted by mr altham next day there be suffragette meeting at

harrogate own quarrel on top foolish lie about shooting party made series of data proclaimed conclusion suddenness of discovery magnitude of issue involved served to steady there be authentic valour in nature even a have stood up to interrupt political meeting without so much a dreaming of shirking part so now pause be not timorous rather rallying of force came eager undismayed to summons apparently lyndhurst did not want to be told more did not at rate ask for just then parker came in with mended sponge gave stood with sponge bag in one hand sponge in other will bring up tea maam said to mr ames yes take to drawing room now send cab away major wont want lyndhurst crammed sponge into bag will want cab parker said dont send away mr ames whisked round on parker with amazing rapidity

trembling leg refused to uphold curious buzzing be in ear crinkled mist swam before eye lyndhurst im afraid be going to make goose of myself faint said just help to room get parker swayed tottered only just caught before fell laid down on floor opened door window wide there be flask of brandy in portmanteau laid on top designed to be easily accessible in case of inclement crossing of channel mixed tablespoonful of with little water a moved opened eye again knelt down on floor by supporting take sip of amy said obeyed thank dear said be better so silly of sip then want to make drunk lyndhurst said then smiled must be pity to lose opportunity for humorous allusion to what at time have be so far from humour really drunk time said then tell cousin james be right let rest longer than be physically necessary in encircling crook of arm let keep eye closed though if have be alone must most decidedly have opened first few minute have somehow to be traversed felt that silence bridged over better than speech be appropriate too that arm must be round there be better said at length let get up lyndhurst thank for looking after got on to foot then sat down again in easy chair not quite steady yet said very nearly will be quite ready to come downstairs give tea by time have unpacked little portmanteau did not even look at sat turned away from little portmanteau heard rustle of paper

have one drink in dressing room in comfortable chair there be extraordinary wisdom in minute attention to detail be by that be able to rise to big occasion be necessary that must feel that full intention be to forgive make best of day lay before have great word noble sentiment with to convey impression in measure must show mind by minute arrangement for comfort lingered irresolute have got to trust said do a tell dear have not long to wait after have gone upstairs heard ring at bell next moment millie came into room face be flushed breathing hurried eye alight with trouble suspense resentment lyndhurst began waited then saw mr ames turned confusedly about a if to leave room again amy got up quickly come sit down at once millie said have got to talk so let make a easy a can for

shrieked where be sit down millie a tell said mr ames very quietly there be nothing to be frightened at know everything be going drive began millie again still looking wildly about did not come be frightened came to see where be asked if knew if knew anything about did not why do say know everything suddenly mr ames saw that there be something here infinitely more worthy of pity than have suspected there be question a to agonized earnestness underlay futile childish repetition of nonsense with there came into mind greater measure of understanding with regard to husband be not so wonderful that have be unable to resist face have drawn let behave like sensible woman millie said have come down from station lyndhurst be not there do want to tell anything more millie wavered where stood then stumbled into chair have given up said yes if care to put like that must be truer to say that have saved be not coming with made asked helped to make said mr ames millie got up again want

be driven straight home be perfectly serious hope will not oblige to do that will be much wiser to pull together let have talk understand one thing quite clearly be not going to see lyndhurst tension of wide childish eye slowly relaxed head sank forward there came terrible blessed tear in wild cataract streaming storm mr ames looking at felt righteousness relax have only pity for poor destitute soul who be blind to else by force of mysterious longing in be so divine that though desire disgraceful impossible can not wholly make abominable discrown of royalty something of truth of though more than mere fragment moulted feather came to mr ames now a sat waiting till tempest of tear must have abated royal eagle have passed over a sign of passage there be feather have fallen understood significance slowly tear ceased sob be still millie raised dim swollen eye have better go home said wonder if must let wash face cousin amy must be perfect fright yes dear millie said there be hurry see will send cab back to house have luggage on yes then parker will go with tell to take back to room unpack put everything back in place afterwards when have talked little will walk back with again comfort of having little thing attended to reached millie sense that be not quite alone be like child have be naughty have be punished did not much care whether have be naughty not what wanted primarily be to be comforted to be assured that everybody be not going to be angry with for ever then returning mr ames made fresh tea that comforted too dont see how can ever be happy again said there be something childlike about a well a childish millie said other none of three see exactly will have to be very patient very patient ordinary there be long silence must tell one thing said millie though daresay will make hate more be fault from first led on didnt let kiss made kiss be like through felt that mr ames be waiting for something more knew exactly what be required greater effort to speak of than must at once command at last raised eye to of mr ames never said mr ames nodded see said baldly now a said have got to be patient ordinary have got to begin again have husband so have men be so easily pleased made happy must be shame if failed again helpless puzzled look came over millies face dont see how to begin said to morrow for instance what be to do to morrow will only be thinking of what might have happened mr ames took up soft unresisting unresponsive hand yes by mean think what might have happened said utter ruin utter misery fault led on a said didnt care a did wouldnt have thought of going away with if hadnt be so furious with think of straggler from host of sob shook millie for moment perhaps wilfred must take away instead said will ask if can not do think must feel better if went away for fortnight cousin amy mr ames twisted little smile played about mouth yes said think be excellent plan be quite sure will feel better in fortnight if can look forward like want to be better now must like to wash face after will walk home with chapter xiv be brisk morning in november mr mr altham who breakfasted at half past eight in summer nine in winter be seated at breakfast mr altham be thinking how excellent be savour of grilled kidney be not sure if be really wholesome be playing important match at golf afternoon perhaps two kidney approached limit of wisdom besides wife be speaking of really absorbing thing ought to be able to distract mind from kidney be proposing to deny under sting of so powerful counter interest to think that mr ames isnt going to be suffragette more said met mr turner when took walk just now told about word of explanation be necessary fact be that swedish exercise short walk on empty stomach be producing wonderful result in riseborough at moment especially among female inhabitant now instead of meeting in high street before lunch to stand about on pavement exchange news met there before breakfast when on brisk autumn morning be wiser not to stand about therefore skimmed rapidly up down street together in short skirt walking boot rain sunny weather in first glow of enthusiasm be alike to have bath afterwards exercise gave considerable appetite for breakfast produced very pleasant comfortable feeling of fatigue fatigue be legitimate indeed desirable effect for system naturally demanded repose after exertion hour rest after breakfast be recommended thus getting up earlier did not really result in actual saving of time though made everybody feel very busy went to bed little earlier mr altham found got on very nicely without gymnastics then played golf after lunch be use playing trick with health if be already excellent might a well poke about in work of punctual watch have already have pretty sharp lesson on score over consumption of sour milk have made exceedingly unwell have sliced drive for fortnight afterwards just now weaned mind from thought of kidney gave in equitable half to marmalade wife conversation to enjoy either required silence on part went to meeting yesterday said mr altham so mr turner told said that though have success of cause so deeply at heart a ever must not be able to take active part in be very common form of sympathy suppose from what one know of mr ames might have expected something of sort do remember foolish scheme of asking wife without husband husband without wife warned at time henry not to take notice of because be sure must come to nothing think may say be justified dont know what think mr altham by happy coincidence have finished masticating last piece of toast at moment be at liberty to reply think anything about at present said daresay be quite right why mr altham gave little shrill laugh sprightliness at breakfast produced by early walk exercise be very marked declare said that have forgotten to tell mr ames wrote to ask to dine on saturday have quite forgotten there be something in air before breakfast make one forgetful of trifle say so in pamphlet worry household care vanish becomes joy to be alive dont think have engagement pray have third cup of tea henry tannin combine effect of stimulant narcotic cup of hot water now will never regret let see yes dinner at ames on saturday isnt suffragette longer a said one might have guessed daresay husband gave good talking to after night when threw water at policeman must not wonder if there be madness in family think heard sir james mother be very queer before died lived till ninety remarked mr altham be often case with deranged people said mr altham lunatic be notoriously long lived there be strain on brain wasnt relation of mr ames continued henry mr ames be related to westbournes have more to do with sir james mother than have to do with yours will take tea dear not hot water want to catch up henry said prove be wrong somehow be only saying very likely there be madness in mr ames family be going to add hoped must not come out in must allow that have be very flighty must have thought that elderly woman like must make up mind once for about thing before made exhibition of think be like royal person who go open bazaar then have nothing more to do with hurry away to leeds somewhere to unveil memorial think be sufficient for to help at beginning get advertisement then drop like cold potato hot said henry hot cold be just like play hot cold one day be suffragette next day isnt a likely a not will be vegetarian on saturday will be served with cabbage major ames went over to sir james to shoot wasnt asked said henry reverting to previous topic there be exclaimed mr altham will account for abandoning husband wife theory be sure did not like being sir james relative not being asked never must quite understand what relationship be though daresay mr ames can make out there be people who say be cousin because grandmother niece married other grandmother nephew can be descendant of queen elizabeth of charles second at rate must be easier to be descendant of charles second than of queen elizabeth dear remarked henry mr altham pursed lip up for moment think need enter into said be asking if wished to accept mr ames invitation for saturday say expects sir james wife so perhaps will hear more about wonderful relationship dr evans wife one two others to mind that look rather a if husband wife plan be not quite what expected must be giving up active part in suffragette movement too daresay feel age though goodness only know what be however be clearly going to be grand party on saturday waiter from crown will be there to help parker going round pouring little foam into everybodys glass know where major ames get champagne from never get anything foam be sure wish to be unkind certainly poor major ames doe not look well daresay have worry know of of course there be reason why must speak of to evans too never satisfied a to why went away in october must have be away nearly three week for be only yesterday that saw driving down from station with so much luggage on top of cab wonder did not fall over cant have be yesterday dear said mr altham because spoke of to two day ago will have own way henry said be quite willing that must think be twelvemonth ago if choose suppose will not dispute that went away in october be very odd time to take for holiday of course mr evans stopped here august so say might answer that wanted little change of air for part think there must have be something more though a say can not guess what be luckily be concern of mine need not worry head about have always thought mr evans looked far from strong seems odd that doctor wife must not be more robust when have laboratory to choose from henry lit cigarette strolled to window lawn be still white with unmelted hoar frost gardener be busy in bed putting thing tidy for winter consisted in plucking up anything of vegetable origin carrying off in wheelbarrow thus bed be ready to receive first bedded out plant next may remember dear said henry that once thought that there have be understanding between mr evans major ames misunderstanding between major ames dr evans mr altham brought eyebrow together put finger on forehead seem to remember ridiculous story of yours henry about bunch of chrysanthemum in road outside dr evans house how have seen major ames take in there be afterwards in road seem to remember being so much excited about made point of going round to mr ames next day with with book think at time correct if be wrong convinced that there be nothing whatever in have seen heard anything since make think differently added rather more briskly dear nothing said mr altham got up be glad very glad said at rate know in riseborough that be safe from sort of thing declare when went to london last week hardly slept with thinking of dreadful thing might be going on round dear be nearly ten oclock know whether hour day go quickest be always hour later than expect to be here be in november already will rest for hour henry will write to mr ames before lunch saying will be delighted to come on saturday november twelfth too nearly half november will be gone by then that leaf six week to christmas will be a much a will be able to manage to get through have to be done before with swedish exercise declare feel younger day more able to cope with everything must take to henry by eleven oclock be finished have have rest with little management must find time for everything henry sat over dining room fire considering a have be mentioned did not want to make change in excellent health on other hand little rest after breakfast must be pleasant when be over must be almost time to go to club be impossible to settle question like offhand after have read paper must think about mr altham came hurrying back into room henry must never guess what have seen said glanced out of window in hall on way to room there be mr ames wobbling about road on bicycle major ames be holding upright with hand looked to be a much a must manage yet have time for suffragette must be sorry if thought must ever make such hollow excuse a at age too have time to call dare say will be back soon if care to watch window seat in hall be quite comfortable henry took paper there end richard clay son ltd london bungay
