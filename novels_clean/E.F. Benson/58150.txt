take moment before grasped what prince have said fixed eye on window so long without stirring muscle that prince spoke again doubt have seen document said with little nervousness from few word princess let fall to on subject gathered wrongly perhaps that such be purport of at last prime minister turned briskly in chair that think may consider to be purport of said dont suppose that princess sophia have ever taken more prudent far sighted determination indeed might be even more far sighted than supposes prince knew that be so to speak skating on ice might prove to be thin knew equally well applauded inwardly derisively others caution flatter said prince malakopf silently sincerely agreed with let palpable pause precede answer flattery said be unwilling tribute of wise man to inferior fool to superior dear prince how can flatter for be beloved princess husband indeed have glimmering of sense let approach point with more particularity must consider must not what will be proper place in assembly represent princess sophia a representative take chair whenever be present here legal point come in have seat anomaly a have always felt in assembly at how must be then if absented to day that after reading princess message proposed resolution that during absence must be ex officio member of house then must have seat there position after a representative must make president paused moment with look amazingly frank understand other do not almost whispered approached a near to chuckle a prudence allowed be admirably lucid said petros returning gaze too thought malakopf did not say so ceased chuckling let then act thus continued afternoon will take vote of house on matter be almost unnecessary for to send report for there can be only one conclusion however by six oclock will let know what have happened for matter of form merely official communication dear prince official communication thing must be done in order prince petros rose pray let ask said to throw over other engagement to night dine with alone will tell then how house received proposal be infinitely honoured said malakopf bowing again prince took departure left alone malakopf lit cigarette instead of attending to business seemed lost in evil meditation at length drew paper towards gave one ghost of laugh there be depth of willowness said to about man to frail mind be unplumbable malakopf dined with prince that evening before went in to dinner made most favourable report on way that proposition have be received in house first read out princess sophias communication said be known that royal highness have left for monte have left for few visit to relation house requested to record to sympathy with princess reason for taking holiday hoped that few week relaxation

unanimously may say with acclamation indeed have never said drawing hand over chin have never seen so great enthusiasm in house will do best to merit honour have conferred on said prince checking exultation two dined alone with great state magnificence men wore order on sideboard be displayed gold plate belonging to sovereign during dinner royal band played selection of ravishing air from gallery prime minister petros knew liked magnificence what did not know be that on occasion saw through malakopf be something of gourmand much of gourmet ate somewhat largely very intelligently turtle soup be excellent chaudfroid of quail marvel of art must have liked to congratulate chef nearly wept with joy over haunch of roe deer braised la savarin finally bottle of chteau vryssi drank with dessert be almost awe to be near to feeling sense of unworthiness so far overcame a to be able to drink second bottle petros knew well prime minister weakness for fine food thought that if good dinner must not earn man gratitude so indirectly help nothing must in be right have be possible for malakopf to feel under obligation to anybody must have be disposed to fall in with wish of man who have fed well ore of nature if milled must have be found to contain not smallest assay of gratitude not only have nature not compounded with grain of in mixing have used clean spoon one have never have gratitude measured in be wholly incapable of such feeling all knew be that must certainly dine with prince a often a be invited even indicate ever so lightly that be ready to come again dinner over two sat in south veranda where drank coffee smoked malakopf habitually cautious be perhaps moved to unwonted boldness by noble grape of have drunk so freely after have unloosed tongue to speak first word on subject be in mind of of knew have done right that prince must be tool in hand be thousand pity said that princess be so delicate with loyalty unwavering devotion to royal line of need not remind have sometimes nearly caught wishing that prince demetrius have have son man of iron like who be equal to strain stress of state affair princess god bless have often reminded of fable of sword be worn out by use will not abide in scabbard indeed how persuaded to take little holiday dear prince petros can not conceive miracle of successful diplomacy must encourage to be put in scabbard sometimes said prince indeed felt tired out required little persuasion on part to make go weakness not strength be giver of little victory malakopf shook head underrate power prince petros said be always same with princess be zeal for have in hand have even seen once twice here in palace playing trivial game at card with ardour ardour so thought with follows debate with what act must have thought really cared for romance of little pasteboard piece in guest of le sterling fibre found amusement play still believe prince petros have not patience to continue elaborate farce malakopf have fully intended that first step of importance must be taken by other wraith of smile hovered round mouth a petros spoke again play still a say replied a know have gone to monte carlo royal relation be table affair of state a also know be nothing to fully believe though if have stopped here must have suffered in health through pure boredom be so insignificant to be very dear to want to see rhodop great power buffer state want stopped abruptly got out of seat began walking up down highness want suggested malakopf insinuatingly a softly a thought want rhodop to be nation broke out prince look at material already say thought malakopf did ever see finer men than troop look at coast show fleet must effect landing have seen gibraltar have seen blteck be two gibraltar look at boundary whose be army must invade rhodop england be not more definitely marked out by nature to be great power than be of one race with albanian flower of greek a well a turkish troop completely careless of death with thought country once set in great position here will see what will make of rhodop if be humblest member of chamber must act now be bound with chain of lead hand be tied can hing wife spends money time thought at monte carlo be more than lacquey who stand in ante chamber le even for be useful in way alone be cipher oh malakopf be pitiable man be pitiable prince stood before hand opened out by side handsome mobile face suffused with excitement malakopf put one leg over other suppressed sigh of content have not dared to hope for speaking so plain a there be need for more diplomatic dancing yet have obtained one step to day said have seat in house may well be considered how do say thin end of wedge yes when wife return out come wedge replied prince out come oh lord not necessarily said prime minister prince sat down explain understand said malakopf flicked ash off cigar be so completely master of situation that did not intend to be hurried be true that seat be only temporary at present said one way dear prince petros have managed to become somewhat influential person in state so always tell wife said prince with extraordinary unwisdom thinking to please centipede be infinitely grateful for good word replied other did not mean that have influence in eye of princess to speak to with frankness will nearly equal own care to have with considerable wealth extent of estate not to mention certain personal influence have with large party in assembly influence must be false modesty in to underrate must think manage to secure permanent seat take cigar said prince will do for malakopf smiled juxtaposition of offer of cigar request suggested fantastically enough bribe say must be easy to manage replied might be troublesome affair to speak plainly here laid hand on prince knee looked suddenly in face what be to get by yet said afternoon not having seat in senate be anomaly endorse what said be expedient for personally to attempt to do away with anomaly will make worth while said prince in low voice be enough dear prince said here be light for said prince petros hand shook a held match in windless air chapter vi new member when malakopf went home that night came near to being victim of exultation that delightful emotion always eschewed for considered dangerous feeling one blunts perception deadens acumen have practical significance indeed greatest extravagance in way that usually allowed on conclusion of very successful bargain be pleased contempt at contemplation of wit inferior to own disdainful indifference amounting sometimes to dislike to who have be tool unfortunate adversary to night be strangely moved perhaps be even little dazzled at greatness of stake for be playing perhaps be only much pleased surprised at aptness of tool providence made doubt be providence always look after who look after have so kindly put in hand like prince too be writing private little drama of much same nature chief difference being while prince play be entitled emperor of east malakopfs be more modestly called president of republic variation between two be perhaps worth recording in prince production there be minor character sort of gentleman in waiting called malakopf count malakopf perhaps whereas in president of republic mention be made of petros prince otherwise a tool petros seemed admirable be sharp must be thrown away when done with relation to princess must put in mind of loyal people malakopf valued loyalty in others beyond reach of suspicion for what must be more suitable more gratifying to folk of rhodop than to see husband of beloved princess accomplished rider that finished squire of dame so identifying with affair of kingdom furthermore there be vast deal of underground work must probably have to be done if there be one thing more than in busy brain of malakopf delighted be to make mole delver in dark spring castle on foolish grazing cattle where be least suspected chteau vryssi be sweet though dryer than vintage of thought prince petros be in way wise to trust plan execution of conspiracy for so may already call to malakopf at rate have courage caution constructive ability must warrant decent chance of success be cunning more cunning be pin point to go fighting with on other hand be irredeemably foolish to trust malakopf further than must see must not see far thus be like to fall between two stool inexcusable undignified position end on floor a for malakopf that astute politician have a usual several string to bow scheme a have planned must scarcely fail altogether of success target at aimed be long hazardous shot being indeed le than overthrow of dynasty establishment of republic in rhodop establishment of a president of same have a have told prince petros considerable influence

reigning family have on tip of poisonous tongue clap trap of socialism have what be almost a important real acquaintance with spirit of demand scheme proposed by absurd catchword of three acre cow contained residuum of truth if so enticing phrase be not sufficient must justify to willing ear princess sophia be a knew unrivalled aunt sally for such random weapon extravagance parisian toilette magnificent jewel night spent in ruinous card playing be text ready for ranter did not intend to do ranting must be for whom controlled prime minister with quivering lip firm of purpose must sit in exalted place on assembly find unable to answer such damnation of criticism budget be instrument on greatly relied little judicious arrangement money spent in outdoor relief prominently contrasted with civil list of princess must not fail to tell be method by have long planned to make attack on reigning house still seemed to trustworthy realized that new ally in shape of prince might open to other directer road in case be sound policy to put man of straw in place princess sophia who be undeniably flesh blood occupied in assembly if once must be completely installed there be comparatively easy to turn out leaving so hoped vacancy in president chair delectable conclusion realized must be largely matter of luck be merely prepared to take chance if came in way man with burning audacity be yet cautious personally supposing great stroke of luck occurred have to follow slower method gave dynasty four year by time unholy leaven must have worked must instruct ignorant in way of court life must water growing knowledge with disgust must evolve strongly socialistic class of ignorant content then not till then must clench matter by withdrawal of stock threatening letter to debtor plain speaking to electorate commanded prince petross scheme be far different infinitely le sagacious must get permanent in assembly must during one of sophias absence get trusted by anti dynastic party must be malakopfs business to form must be model of sedulous industry in attendance at house reaping harvest of golden opinion from legislator at end down must come in full spate from mountain of

silence wasting money there child child have be initiated by into mystery of game be told be called baccarat be here to tell that resigned seat in assembly for be in false position did not represent one whom be nominally there to represent represented plain living high thinking position be therefore false to be in false position be more than must bear overcome by emotion torn by conflicting affection must sit down murmur carefully prepared by poor friend prime minister must swell up round then recovering with effort must get up to leave house house must rise to foot voice must say stay go chorus must be taken up next day must write polite letter to sophia saying that have be elected prince of rhodop by assembly while have become princess sophia wife of prince of rhodop such be roughly sketched outline of scheme a conceived by two conspirator working of plot a have be mentioned be entrusted to malakopf prince part being confined to industrious attendance on public business until sowing have ripened up to point at rate plan of pulled with other at point parted malakopf have intention of letting prince make pathetic speech in house of organizing sympathetic murmur prince have intention of official supreme in rhodop throne be to be for child after be unwise enough to give malakopf sketch of what have designed progress of affair to be other have smilingly acquiesced saying be singular how completely identical prince forecast be with own petros turned aside thought to poor dear old malakopf business of securing prince permanent seat in assembly be carried through next week not without little opposition suggestion of princess that husband must take place in absence have be received with unanimous cordiality a coming from further step be not understood to have be initiated where first have be there be who opposed opposition fully suited malakopfs hand did not wish prince petros to think that matter be easily accomplished more felt indebted to prime minister better must be thus le likely to take incautious step on own initiative for malakopf be fully alive to danger of petros making false move thus involving plan of in ruin thing be carried through prince petros who have gracefully absented from sitting in be to come under discussion be informed of success of motion in letter from prime minister who be again to dine with that evening malakopf suggested that must at once tell sophia what have happened since be always wise to be frank about matter be impossible to conceal that must take seat next day a soon a received favourable reply from prince at once telegraphed in private cipher to wife be pleased to get following answer before malakopf arrived that evening be charmed to hear can take great deal off hand be sure will do work well will stay at monte carlo till further notice since there be longer need of at rhodop have lost heap of money sophia be entirely satisfactory malakopf to whom read telegram thought so too clause since there be longer need of at rhodop seemed to both word of good omen last sentence also quite delighted prime minister from what know of princess said do imagine that loss will tend to make come away sooner will be reason more if reason be wanted said petros for making remain oh know a know glove so hoped if loses more if loses money have in hand must borrow of whom malakopf paused be not sure that be not talking with risk decided to chance a have highest opinion of idiocy of fellow conspirator of for choice said at length prince petros flushed did not quite like royal highness must probably apply to husband said stiffly if be in want of money must lend certainly not must request to come home then must be acting unwisely said malakopf knowing have done right to open point do not see that more hopelessly beggar more deeply get into debt to someone by so much more be plan advanced if be to overthrow dynasty dethrone princess sophia mean must meet way must run to meet ruin be sure must not apply to for money said petros not directly at least indirectly perhaps suggested malakopf mean through be what mean said prime minister bridling irritation at comparative slowness of man how must be if when applied to for money borrowed of doe not idea strike a sound must in assembly acknowledge indebtedness to a so finely sketched in pathetic degree must be drawn from how debt be incurred to shield whom from european exposure for indeed not even loyalty of rhodop must stand princess being notorious for not paying gambling debt suggestion seems to double edged weapon must cut against princess must move pity compassion for think be right said prince reluctantly know be right thought malakopf who saw in little scheme hold not so much over sophia must be easily managed over prince petros prince be formally installed in assembly next day a regent occupied sophias place permanent seat when taking part in debate be with other minister in body of house be well received even thought enthusiastically for applause sound loud in ear of recipient made speech thought excellently telling a must sound loyal to loyal to who might not be blind to wife edifying absence from assembly hint even husband deplored conduct have be lot during last fortnight said to have received two very great honour at hand of august assembly last week only be admitted to house to act a regent for royal highness beloved wife moment be very sweet to for showed in how loyal esteem held in adopting suggestion must during absence do very humble best to fill place be unable to tell how unworthy felt how

more personal lord gentleman thank from bottom of heart for be comparatively stranger among have treated a friend have made one of yourselves too with have part in glorious responsibility of furthering interest of realm of rhodop princess sophia have telegraphed to warm approval of step will thus be able said to take few more week of holiday so much need gentleman thank thank can say more prince voice choked with emotion sat down for next week be pattern of sedulous attention to public affair spoke on criminal law amendment act with marked ability rhodop courier referred to speech a locus classicus on psychology of crime short contribution to debate on hare woodcock bill be masterly in espoused cause of landlord against tenant what be not put into ground by tenant clearly belonged to landlord to repeal portion of game law of a have be suggested be surely short sighted policy to abolish close time to abolish necessity for license to kill game be to exterminate have be result of repeal in greece country once a rich in game a theirs be not whole of peloponnese desert of wild animal on question of tobacco growing showed equally conversant with salient point of dispute have naturally fine delivery voice be marvel of tone clearness never hesitated for word never hurried be in seat at opening of debate never left until end be always courteous obliging encouraging like speech of great statesman remark be distinguished by keen grasp of obvious malakopf watched entry into public life with amusement satisfaction tool must have be more apt work turned out be excellent at present growing popularity of prince be exactly what wished to see more shone in state matter dimmer must become light of princess when one have reached necessary brilliance other suitably declined

forty thousand napoleon petros went down to mavromti to meet felatrune seemed pleased little surprised to see must have thought duty in assembly must not have allowed leisure to come said then suddenly laying hand on shoulder how have grown petros said seemed to petros that be in mood to be amused for laughed at own remark seemed to so void of point that did not even remember to repeat to malakopf who must probably not have be amused at chapter vii princess club princess sophia on return to amandos found affair of state more irksome if possible than ever innumerable petty business to have to give attention seemed more than usually futile to there be table handy where after day of unutterably wearisome routine must forget mayor wife of mayor potato tobacco in enchanting uncertainty

be often committee at so assured presence of one of necessary have more than once seemed to that recurrence of committee waxing more frequent than under father noted circumstance a curious one there seemed now that house have risen interminable deal of business to be transacted be more often than not that malakopf be closeted with prince for hour two after dinner again again happened that husband must have just sat down to game when be announced that prime minister be below wished to consult princess on matter of urgent importance on such occasion always asked petros to represent since really must not face malakopf obeyed with cheerful alacrity be during one of interview tiresome after dinner interruption when princess be left yawning to herself in drawing room that idea occurred to so simple in so easy of execution that be lost in astonishment at own stupidity that have not thought of before what must be more obvious than that remedy for terrible day interrupted evening be in

outside garden where wanted to have asylum for decayed idiotic old gentleman pierre will be manager now though malakopf often groaned under slowness of prince petros be not altogether without wit perhaps late interview with malakopf have sharpened indeed seemed to sophia to have acquired certain quickness lately though not at card at rate saw at once sophia be coming to meet scheme way a malakopf have wished must reigning princess winning losing money from loyal subject must not be construed into edifying spectacle made doubt that people of rhodop must agree with must not so thought

assembly be true there have be great outburst of popular feeling have be in favour of a for unfriendly reference in assembly be still unspoken for dared not allude to in hostile spirit prince petross

intelligent curiosity be to say thing be curious about be always worth knowing particularly wished to know how extraordinary innovation struck leading men of state have heard with glow of heart tremendous reception accorded to dear friend princess sophia intensely desired to learn how in command took new evidence of princess popularity whether in fact same question have occurred to malakopf greeting have be merely tribute of loyal people to popular princess whether implied innate predisposition to new amusement provided for be with in mind that when duty of reception be over walked slowly through room with one ear only open to voice of varying interlocutor other wide to catch strident accent of prime minister at last saw though only distantly wide mouthed yellow toothed separated from by crowd of tedious folk a looked in direction so happened that looked in hers eye met malakopfs eye be shifty one at best to night potation seemed to have given greater directness of gaze be with surprise that in answer to little smile of greeting saw moment afterwards move from place make way through crush towards ah lady blanche said unless push squeeze will have chance of getting word with how be that when go to friend house see whole world not friend too be despairing of getting word with replied blanche be delicious night let go on to balcony room be so hot malakopf bowed offered arm be too kind to old man like said be very greedy be quite true sat down in corner of balcony blanche went straight to point there be great change in rhodop said tell how strike malakopf paused moment instinct counselled caution dinner have unloosened tongue longed to let go talk freely to beautiful able woman dont really know how strike indeed confess puzzled said at rate think princess be cleverer woman than have supposed do follow blanche nodded mean of course that success of club have more than justified starting that knew guessed be even cleverer that there be love of gambling in people malakopf applauded gently with finger tip dear lady said have idea what joy be to to talk to people who find intelligible to whom have not to translate now prince petros paused think will advertise for translator added with sigh prince petros have always seemed to man with charm of cleverness brain of fool remarked blanche malakopf considered yes have hit full said at length have always known what have just said though have never be able to formulate be charm of cleverness make one continually think one be dealing with gifted man a continually one be brought up short oh how many jar have received work hard in assembly doe not asked blanche work have always struck like convict remove pile of shot from one place to then back again thus at end of day there be not much to show for hour of toil have seen much of lately have great power of amassing detail when amassed be useless to collect data draw conclusion from perhaps be just a well if did draw conclusion must be certainly wrong one be ambitious must think said blanche quietly ambitious be ambition be discontented in present position indeed who must not be be parody of prince so tell fancy being husband of reigning princess say be wise of then to work hard at humbler duty get perhaps power of sort in country have power snapped malakopf never will have now lady blanche have long entertained vague curiosity about new intimacy between malakopf prince sophia knew detested man be reason more for surprise petros must make so close companion day after day have read in rhodop herald malakopf have long interview with prince that prince called on prime minister in morning remained to luncheon that malakopf remained at palace till midnight up to point in present conversation with talk be mainly random on part a one throw fly over place indeed may reasonably hold fish in ignorance whether fish be there at moment when snapped answer back at forgetting manner recollected curiosity in friendship between two to point not witlessly so malakopf must scarcely suspect even if mood be suspicious that be being plied with pertinent conversation no a yet have power said be sure never will have doe not sedulous attention to question in can interest very slightly tend to make one think that be determined not to be only tame cat about court be wise must say to wish to take active part in affair seems to that be wise in burdening own shoulder with tedious drearier side of politics won must say golden opinion when acted a regent last year moreover be more important princess be very grateful to told so other day gratitude be better worth collecting than postage stamp malakopf be interested showed ah said that to did asked leaning forward in chair spoke with gratitude say with confidence perhaps in prince surely why must not asked blanche with disarming frankness rumour have reached said malakopf that be not altogether pleased that prince must do so much that felt that be little thrust into background hardly knew whether to credit not information have relieved indescribably if one look closely there be colour for idea indeed have supposed that such desire to be a prominent a husband have prompted to take very new step of making casino in amandos blanche detected slight change of tone in voice must have laid odds at moment that have just invented rumour answered without pause be very ingenious to connect building of casino with so ingenious that certainly ought to be true can not say never occurred to before about rumour surely more than have reached malakopf glanced round to see that one be within hearing thought that be getting valuable information out of lady blanche on other hand be sure that be getting out of yes have heard more than that said drawing chair closer to hers blanche nodded felt touch of shame for what be doing for be loyalty incarnate to sophia ruthless to who be not too have heard perhaps that in certain quarter be thought that prince petros be standing on tiptoe to reach throne asked have heard that in certain quarter such attempt be likely to be widely supported what be to make of such thing there can not be truth in speak frankly said malakopf will follow example have heard be true bitter complaint against princess sophia loyalty have compelled to listen to so a so a to be on guard have often be hard work to control indignation when listened have heard civil list way spends bitterly contrasted with money spent on education on poor what be one to say to such thing be loyalty to beloved princess yet put in place of who say thing be candid be there not grain of truth in accusation malakopf spoke eagerly for wanted to get out of blanche what have heard forgetting manner again leaned forward lit cigarette at candle standing close to enveloping face in cloud of smoke blanche observed man be certainly in earnest about something will have whisky soda will not said touch that bell behind malakopf resumed seat two talked of indifferent subject till footman have brought prime minister whisky then spoke again who set thing in currency asked abruptly do do really suspect prince petros of disloyalty to princess what be worse even of disloyalty to wife said malakopf from what tell from what have heard gather there be much feeling against princess much sympathy with husband petros prince petros know feel position acutely more than must not say disloyalty why man be a true a steel voice rang a false a cracked crockery plate conversation be bearing much fruit so thought lady blanche so also thought malakopf lady blanche felt convinced in own mind that rumour have reached malakopf about princess growing unpopularity have with ingenuity led other on to expand embellish invention of a must have be with complete success distrust have ever felt of cunning old man growing distrust with have seen ripening intimacy with petros be suddenly struck with colour felt sure be talking out of own mouth malakopf on other hand be entranced to find airy invention solidified own intuition so flatteringly supported appeared that after there did exist in mind of people that dissatisfaction with sophia must be work petros to foment seed of revolution seemed be already sown to judge by way in lady blanche endorsed tentative word bid fair to flourish be glad to hear say be so true said personally know little of have seen with so much interest growing intimacy between who must know if malakopfs exultation broke bond of caution know cried know a know shape of glove that cover hand indeed be very like glove that cover hand next moment be a if have spoken prime minister have heard got up abruptly a imprudent word be conveyed to turned to lady blanche whom for one minute have forgotten will wish good night said have great quantity of work to get through before go to bed go so early asked blanche good night monsieur have so enjoyed talk when other guest have gone danced pa seul round balcony chapter viii plot counter plot lady blanche have desire to make mountain out of molehill even when surveyed interview with malakopf with coolness sobriety of be still thought that be clearly business to make matter known to whom principally concerned accordingly sent note to sophia asking for audience on affair of importance being granted poured into princess amused interested ear that malakopf have said blanche be good narrator with so admirable memory that have call to draw on imagination account be vivid accurate rarest of combination one for in vain look in page of history princess sophia be far too well entertained by farcical absurdity of conspiracy to be really angry at present with husband malakopf however le simple witted much older be not so lightly dismissed knew man to be cunning one whose investment might be considered safe fumed at idea of centipede conspiring against there be one point perplexes said to blanche petros creature be in league together be certain petros poor dear have doubt throne prospectively over rhodop really married fool after one of requirement be that husband must not be that will get quite indignant with if doe not drop nonsense then where doe malakopf come in be quite certain that be not worth while to overturn in order to set up petros without doubt mean to step in where have mounted a high in rhodop a subject can must not take so much trouble if be to be nothing more must remember have ever treated like insect princess said blanche must not be sufficient reward for to overturn think not said sophia man loathes of course doubt revenge must be incentive doubt revenge being goal perhaps there be wheel within wheel petros be to overturn be to overturn house of gina be to be set of ninepin for centipede worst of be that be almost impossible to find out more said blanche be lapful of luck that know at be clever of blanche said sophia clever people be always lucky about petros will give one chance will let fall word must be warning to something very plain yet meaningless to good conscience then will have talk with blanche sophia glanced at ormolu clock on mantelpiece have just jarred a warning of striking good gracious be nearly twelve said will take stroll in direction in direction of club thank again blanche how earnestly know have be instructive a well a amusing really petros be very impertinent now think over will ask to come here again in day two stay be dining at legation on friday will talk then after dinner opportunity of giving word of warning to petros occurred very evening have dined alone be unusual after dinner be still more unusual prince have proposed game of bezique sophia have intended to go to club changed mind counter ordered carriage for during dinner husband have interested proposal of be now become remarkable never in life have prince be more desirous to please never in life have known have effort be more wildly misdirected futile for during day sophias amusement have given place to anger in conversation have held with malakopf that morning that sagacious minister conscious of slight want of caution night before have laid great stress on two point need not tell dear prince said how essential be that princess must remain entirely unsuspicious have seen great deal of other lately reluctantly propose that meet quite so often for future intimacy might put someone on look out if throw bomb where people be looking will run away be first point second point contains good news already there be widely spread discontent in state at unedifying conduct of wife so seems to people large sympathy with untiring exertion in assembly also know for certain that at present princess sophia repose entire confidence in let be business to maintain that unabated more to increase who told asked petros one who know well lady blanche amesbury lady blanche said put entire confidence in have honour of telling so said malakopf with impatience seem to have have intimate talk with lady blanche be clever woman be not without wit said malakopf chuckling talk be more intimate than knew indeed gave wanted to know with charming navet of child prince petros be silent moment did not feel entirely at ease about interview habit of obedience to malakopfs order must not let speak at length dismissing subject tell how to maintain wife confidence said little bezique in evening must do wonder with said malakopf sententiously thus be that prince petros have proposed game that evening sophia accepted from curiosity during dinner have talked charmingly have related number of amusing experience shortly with point at sophias contempt rose bitter a bile in throat behind back planned revolution before face paid court to amenity of social life behaved with studied naturalness kindness knowing knew miserable little attention seemed to very acme of meanness be desire of studying further made counter order carriage must have taken to club argued very strong desire stood by open window drinking coffee while groom of chamber put out table pack of card when man have left room petros gently thrust arm through hers seems so long since have spent evening quietly together sophia said to at least seems long sometimes almost wish have be poor girl not princess of rhodop that have be able to live quietly together up in little mountain home sophia for moment be struck dumb surely there be never so immeasurable hypocrite a man must not answer since wished to continue gently pressed arm with hers have felt that too dearest continued softly sometimes sophia have thought be little weary of now sweet silence make know be wrong so forgive darling look at lovely wash of moonlight over town lie like benediction over land be just such night be not when first came here bless that day bless hour of life sophia turned from man produced in sense of physical sickness who with fault have never lied to whom falsehood be dirty thing a inconceivable a not washing felt ill at duplicity be angry at for letting speak for moment be on point of telling knew anger surged up again must not forgive have chosen to act crooked part must reap a have sown have promised to give word of warning that must have come petros said at length with assumed lightness of manner bezique bezique really dont know that cottage on mountain must have suited well though be charming of to suggest must not have loved to find thumbing dirty pack of card when must have be mending stocking there be great deal to be said for position of princess of rhodop took hand with charming courtesy kissed who can say enough for position of husband asked played hand two with luck fairly divided petros who seemed to sophia to have recaptured skill be considerable winner at end of hour shortly after that held hand for a sophia declared world be made have early in game declared sequence six time then abandoned have three bezique on table fourth knave of diamond card drew in eight trick before end still sophia have not seen corresponding queen petross heart failed scored three bezique again with extra knave immediately afterwards drew in missing queen sophia be aghast four thousand five hundred gone to dog exclaimed with contempt really petros be beside yourself be fault of generalship admit said sophia looked at very steadily be good opening for what have to say indeed petros be napoleon said must never never carve kingdom for so petros have warning sophia hardened heart against a malakopf have suggested two conspirator saw somewhat le of other for next week two more than once sophia thought to do justice hoped that petros must have taken word of warning to heart nauseating little tenderness solicitude for be not diminished found infinitely disgusting be acting part of be well assured for be not knew man to whom caress be habitual day have long since be over between what then must recrudescence of exhibition have never be natural to mean that wished to keep ever surrounded with tinsel counterfeit of love for what reason must coin token in such profusion except that wished to rest assured of unalterable devotion man be putrid two day after princess husband dined together at english legation lord abbotsworthy of course took princess in on other side sat malakopf a usual figuratively speaking licked ground trod on a usual walked with tip tilted nose in air a if have be disagreeable smell during course of dinner let fall few word interested though spoke to minister not to intended word for ear sucked greedily in will not leave rhodop till october year so malakopf heard say when do go will be away three month at least petros be so admirable manages affair much better than do really give something to do moreover have completest confidence in speech believe be considered most sensible will spend christmas in england think with cousin england be often delightful at christmas dont suppose will be back here till half way through january yacht oh yes love sea a know will go in yacht poor petros be sea sick think how absurd malakopf found much to interest in speech princess long absence be ideal to wish even to most loyal of subject three month sojourn abroad must appear protracted trial to belief in unwavering devotion to welfare never before in recollection have monarch be absent on occasion of great royal fte on new year day when princess always gave immense dance to who have signed name in book great banquet in guildhall to humbler citizen of rhodop there just before midnight went with guest took stand in silence under clock while great assemblage waited finger on lip glass in hand for new year to strike a soon a twelve great shock have proclaimed year drank prosperity to broke glass so that one again might drink from then mingled with crowd spoke few word to everyone came across wonderful memory made easy for to recognise hundred whom have never consciously seen except on night word of inquiry after son daughter made many heart beat proudly likewise if princess be away for december duty of proroguing parliament must fall on petros assembly always rose from autumn session week before christmas be not formally prorogued till afternoon of last day of december on day member attended in court dress from throne princess made speech thanking for labour in past year a representative of petros must speak from seat malakopf made mental note that somewhat telling scene might be planned for occasion that petros also must see great opportunity left dining room foreign fashion together man giving arm to woman have taken in a princess no longer objected even to taste of smoke there be segregation of men when reached drawing room after few word with one of guest beckoned to lady blanche two sat down in corner of drawing room somewhat apart from others have uneasy moment when saw already in own mind have advanced matter so far that did not matter much what princess did running rapidly over conversation with lady blanche found tangible cause for disquietude blanche said sophia speaking in english have made plan have to help so please be very intelligent what have happened asked blanche have given petros warning be over silence made sure that knew what meant told be napoleon to carve kingdom odious little attention to imagine be performed at malakopfs bidding continue think have made up mind not to take warning tant pi for give chance will hardly believe other night only made crawly little sentimental speech to though have done with sort of thing long ago said wished have be poor couple in cottage kissed hand flesh of crept that look like malakopf said blanche well enough of petros went on sophia to night talked rather loud to father so malakopf must hear told must leave rhodop in october not come back till middle of january new year fte asked blanche well deceived father expect will be in amandos before then to speak more exactly expect to be back on december thirty first however that will be seen now before go will give cipher use with petros want to be accurately informed day by day how thing be going will tell father that will be in correspondence with ask to send off telegram direct from legation for malakopf be cunning enough to suspect something if find constantly sending despatch to indeed looked little suspicious just now when saw sit down talk to be too dangerous said blanche dear sophia dont go away for so long anything may happen in so long absence will be business to warn said princess have laid plan carefully must learn a much a can about prince malakopfs little scheme will return at word from will not go to england for christmas a told father be much nearer home by christmas indeed think will be at corfu so can get back here in few hour conveniently enough empress have asked to stay with there will be incognito so of course will sailor of felatrune alone will know be here can rely on absolute silence oh will be a exciting a run of luck cried ah see said blanche mean that expect malakopf will make scene on day assembly be prorogued that seems to heaven sent opportunity for remarked sophia yet perhaps satan be more appropriate derivative blanche burst out laughing now then sophia in spite of great knowledge of english must use sentence of style hopelessly pompous thinking to utter crowning colloquialism laugh closed conversation sophia rose with mock resentment in voice have more to say to remarked will not be laughed at have told be really important with be not necessary to say thing twice dear blanche be true that lord abbotsworthy have hired pierre roulette board for evening how touching attention mark of true hospitality pierre be waiting for highness said blanche seeing that malakopf have drawn near will go to card room thus came about sophia be not unaware of conspiracy be on foot against have given husband fair warning since persisted in childish policy of surrounding with hundred lover like attention thought excusable wise to have policy too sometimes be almost stirred to pity at futility of effort to blind while own seeming security be so illegible to accentuated if possible distaste of state affair half of twenty four hour spent at table of club yawned behind hand at most important confidential communication of minister be even le civil than usual civility to malakopf be never remarkable to prime minister be true that have easier part to play for while petros fished up little attention affectionate demeanour to a man draw water from deep well with effort have to let natural inclination distaste of malakopf taste for play ennui at infinitesimal state concern go unreined effect of be that conference between husband prime minister lapsed into former frequency not day passed be closeted together even astuter malakopf lulled into security by princess negligence of state matter no longer went through formality of asking for when wished to confer with crown yet situation be more critical than knew already there be party in house almost hostile to for sedulity with kept seat in club when must have be in council chamber though successful in object namely that of giving increased confidence to two main actor in conspiracy have have certain effect in alienating from many of more sober minded deputy saw with pain unreasonable passion for card total neglect of duty of reigning monarch saw with silent sympathy heroic effort of prince to cover deficiency of wife well equipped a debater be primed loaded by malakopf contribution to debate be edification yet princess played part with consummate skill trusted to loyalty of people to back up when great scene came yawn be picture of realistic art intolerance of malakopf triumph of sincerity thereby caution of prime minister be slowly insidiously relaxed four year have originally given to dynasty be much abbreviated in mind for in sinister depth be revolving new startling idea suggested to by princess absence in be so simple that almost distrusted a day went on grew more more seductive august cooled into september day of princess departure for necessary holiday be fixed for october be tacitly understood between petros that prince must not accompany such have be success of regency year before now sophia begged never to send anything referring however remotely to state matter be sick of sceptre said to day before left petros be still rather fond of oh remind so much of child dressing up in court finery when come to put finery on in earnest how bored be petros if ever held sceptre in own name must find bad companion of day night sometimes be almost tempted to abdicate throne of rhodop yet what sort of private person must make be princess of royal blood can not help burden will be with always how can say such thing dearest said petros with well simulated warmth be idle modesty make seem to be ignorant of adoration with subject humblest regard of think must not willingly die for true must never be private person more than farmer wife must be queen though think must well therein be better than farmer wife sighed sophia think must be know must not be let have good holiday petros dont send anything to sign to consider consider everything sign what please get through business possibly can so that there will not be so much next session must give more explicit instruction dear said prince be not likely that measure of great importance will come before house what be to do about proroguing will hardly wish to deliver speech from throne why not dear petros said be sitting in deep armchair in shadow fanning slowly under full light of lamp a spoke leaned back watched face intently saw eye brighten flush steal over face right hand clenched a if already held sceptre why not petros repeated because be so essentially prerogative of crown said how be to thank minister for labour in whose name in own name said for indeed laughed quietly to herself have have far more to thank for curse for last year than be far more suitable that must do be sure will do admirably again hand clenched again sophia observed face light up rose with bitter aversion in heart thus no long explanation be necessary said act a if be will be back before end of january now petros must leave have little affair to settle before dress for dinner kindly ring bell for rang advancing to bowed kissed hand queen murmured sophia stood silent watched graceful exit then took handkerchief rubbed place where lip have touched next moment groom of chamber entered go to english legation said tell lady blanche that will come to see to night after dinner leave message with see princess left mavromti next day on felatrune with went little prince leonard petros saw off went on board with wife parted from a soon a gained ship for be to start at once once more pity for treacherous man for so certainly regarded touched leave with fullest confidence said feel sure will be faithful steward for child petross hypocrisy be not finished enough to suggest reply left in silence night while felatrune ploughed moonlit way southward over dim water of sleeping adriatic malakopf dined at palace indeed two conspirator to best of knowledge have solid ground for self congratulation from point of view princess conduct have be impeccable precision with have played into hand be admirable hour of attendance at assembly during past summer must almost be reckoned on finger of one armed man hour of presence at club be more like in number to star of heaven to crown have now left kingdom at time when affair be in full bustle of transaction what must tell against even more in eye of public have decided to be absent on great festal day of year malakopf have have wit to see how skilful be bait have prepared how admirable convenience to plan only failed to grasp little fact that be bait club princess have inaugurated with such brilliance in may have thrived in way that even must scarce have anticipated originally playing room have be open only from three in afternoon till three in morning few month afterwards session never rose gambling instinct in people for so many year void of fruition shot up like aloe flower already to tamper with inalienable right of people of rhodop to gamble in public room must have be more dangerous than to attempt to make penal in england cold bath game of golf be most skilful stroke that ingenuity of devil must have devised when malakopf attempted by very mean to dethrone sophia from popularity have occurred to said prime minister evening when petros be smoking that princess will be absent from rhodop on day that assembly be prorogued have talked to about said petros seemed to very irregular told how to act indeed may have benefit of conversation wished to take place absolutely said petros to speak from throne not in name in own admirable nothing must be better said malakopf did not occur to be afraid to get in black white princess doe not go back on word said petros rather stiffly true must have preferred black white prudence can never be at fault have hand full paused decided to tell prince of plan that have be maturing by thirty first of december fruit must be ripe for plucking said will introduce bill next month to shut up gambling house in rhodop to make even betting offence what do think of again looked at prince to see what must make of petros fairly recoiled be impossible said there will be revolution true there will be revolution thought be working to bring about be insane idea of yours said petros what line be to take for instance be to oppose for if chance be gone unless speak against bill people will have none of if speak for where be combination malakopf smiled grimly thought did not see how valuable be princess command to to act absolutely in name why must have preferred in black white that command be simply coping stone of structure will vote for bill of course will speak against heaven be possible be so slow oh do not see reluctantly regretfully with unimpeachable loyalty will find obliged to act in absence a must have act a told to act must not face situation have run away have left behind to face odium of deed will vote against prince a representative of unworthy wife what sympathy there will be for petros a for wife will at once become most unpopular woman in rhodop people like gambling will not have stopped may be sure be brave like running away why man be very opportunity for speech planned so long ago prince petros have risen from seat be pacing up down room excitedly see see cried yes be splendid idea be of best stand corrected must not be even more telling if introduced bill in name a know bill introduced by crown be carried want bill to be carried said malakopf want thrown out by immense majority minority in fact expect will consist of prince suggestion have more in than malakopf perceived at once than prince perceived at bill such be autocratic law of rhodop introduced by crown passed into law privilege have rarely be used prerogative be practically obsolete there must be no doubt a prince said that crown be constitutionally within right in so acting thus if prince petros introduced bill in princess name stuck to must only fail to become law by reconstitution of power of crown in other word by revolution in way malakopf must be rid not only of princess also of prince who despite speech against must have voted for formed part of original at present undetailed programme be fairly astounded at fitness of opportunity must kill with one stone so after moment corrected be not sure said that be not right after perhaps yours be simpler plan for make revolution inevitable will think over meanwhile may ask for whisky soda night be hot for time of year two be sitting on great north veranda of palace air be
