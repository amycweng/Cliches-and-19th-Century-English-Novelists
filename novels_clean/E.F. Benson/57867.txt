tedious said getting up from floor can only think of one subject in whole world narrow call whats next thing to do two went to window of room on ground floor leaned out sniffing warm night air sky be moonless very clear host of star made that amazing twilight be like other in world for infinite suggestive softness instead of black white of moonlight world be painted in myriad shade of brown from darkest hue of sepia where shadow lay over black to colour nearly yellow where rim of white stone round fountain in middle of court stood open to full galaxy of starlight to right openwork of stone screen separated court from street outside let in white garishness of incandescent lamp did not penetrate far great window pinnacle of chapel opposite long block of fellow building to left be submerged in dim brown sea of starlight there be flower box along window from leaned faint smell of musk mignonette wandered into room thick with tobacco smoke breath of air before bed dont think said jim come on yes just a far a bridge lend coat will must be proctorized for only having cap gown shouldnt probably there blazer two boy strolled into night arm in arm walked silently out on to huge square of grass behind fellow building heavy dew have fallen after hot day surface of grass be covered with shimmering grey mantle of moisture in step made dark rent bird a became whistled gently under breath for time of broke secret sense of intimate companionship by speech breeze stirred in tower of elm to left even willow by side of bridge have movement in slim pendulous finger of leaf reflecting surface of slow stream be unbroken by wandering ripple once twice feeding fish made dim pattern of concentric circle on water still in silence bird struck match to light final cigarette though night be so windless shielded in hand light showed through flesh of finger a through wall of rosy cave for moment face be vividly illuminated then a dropped match over parapet be swallowed back into darkness again from below after interval came faint hiss of extinguished match light close to face have dazzled jim little after have gone out still have before eye faintly swimming in darkness semblance of bird head can see still said though dark why that oh now youve gone bird drew on cigarette havent said im here all right ah listen early though be in summer hot spell of weather have set bird mating suddenly from elm across field beyond bridge there sounded bubbling song of love entranced nightingale liquid clear rose fell with spring behind promise of summer to follow four long note gave broke into torrent of jubilant melody rose to height of ecstasy suddenly stopped good bird said jim appreciatively call sense yes glad came down here im glad badders didnt come too must have reminded of wench in tobacconist shop hed have told about bosom ankle something poor badders do hate sentimental stuff lord wasnt funny about grandmother yes see badders pride on always being in love isnt atom doesnt know what mean doesnt care for girl only care for nose arm if be in love couldnt jaw about bird spat neatly over parapet wonder perhaps there be different way of being in love what gay dog do remember at fair in midsummer common two girl one on knee round neck something female want doesnt care what be know thats whats so puzzling must understand if be one girl wanted isnt old thing will do a long a young well suppose natur shes rum un be natur said mr squeers badders be asleep by time dreaming of id sooner be awake leaning over bridge same here said jim badders be sensual sentimentalist thats what be jims arm be conveniently laid out along parapet so bird rested chin on do do to morrow asked play for varsity blow so do dont blow at really im frightfully pleased that

away youll be father of one family will be father of will look at other wonder if really must have be who sat on bridge at midnight good deal after didnt want anything else rot said jim wish thought be be cant explain properly know be perhaps jim thought moment a drifted on to grass again like said happens to afterwards fact of being friend will be part of built into couldnt get rid of if wanted to must have be other sort of fellow if hadnt tumbled into other now be just sort be have come back on to track have made in dew on way down to bridge jim pointed at like said weve walked right away off grass yet come back to where be when went out itll always be like therell always be old track waiting for when youre seventy nine im eighty be deaf blind rheumatic therell be track there just same fraid ive be jawing well whats harm said bird bad habit to get into rambled back without further speech into jims room where bird discarded friend blazer collected own torn shirt will have good eye to morrow said because ive sat up so late smoked so much way to be thoroughly off colour be to go to bed early have long night make drowsy next day nodded at jim by way of good night went across passage to room just opposite with bird playing for cambridge be obvious that jim must have to spend whole of next two day in pavilion at university ground deny pleasure of attending lecture might have be provided for by college authority be therefore little unfortunate that met tutor proceeding in cap gown to lecture room next morning exactly at moment when came out into court with straw hat pleasant holiday aspect mr butler have appearance of butler be very happy coincidence air of impenetrable respectability mutton chop whisker prided on possession of sarcastic tongue effect of on victim believed to be a withering a sirocco wind for present however contented with awful glance at jim for sarcasm have to be carefully prepared since bird have just telephoned down from cricket ground that university have won toss that be going in third wicket be use to dream of attending mr butler discourse on cicero essay on friendship for real thing called university have made disastrous start when arrived at ground have lost two wicket for eleven run jim made way to pavilion there found bird in very clammy condition of nerve oh hell wish hadnt come up said hate being there when make fool of remedy lie with said jim dont do cant help eye wobbly why deuce didnt let go to bed in decent time last night go on say anything like if make feel better said jim doesnt make feel worse hell there tobin out buck up bird said friend bird waited till dejected batsman have entered pavilion put cap on seat took up bat soon be back observed morosely wont shant see again till lunch oh said bird with wealth of incredulity in voice have word with outcoming batsman who be captain of cambridge team be told to keep steady at cost when knee be trembling inside of hand be damp with dew of anxiety such advice doe not seem to be within sphere of practical usefulness with sinking heart for moment be far out of range of encouraging influence went forth on awful pilgrimage to scene of execution there ensued two three extremely trying minute wicket keep appealed for catch at wicket off first ball received in accent of supreme confidence umpire happened to disagree with next be long hop bird slashed at completely missed third beat a completely must have grazed leg stump if there be thoroughly unhappy pythia out there there be even more miserable damon in pavilion jim wished be anywhere here watching deplorable performance have be possible must have be back in lecture room listening to butler droning interpretation of cicero remark on friendship anything be better than seeing friend behave a if have never have bat in hand before then quite suddenly while bird be waiting for return of ball have so nearly dismissed jims aspect of situation struck up till moment have only be conscious of own nervousness now a by flash realized how jim must be hating must never do ceased to wriggle toe inside cricket boot awaited last ball of over be half volley just outside leg stump about four second afterwards jim picked up from seat on have fallen in pavilion threw out to square leg gave two three wild yell long sigh of relief never be there more confident shot than nobody in state of twittering nerve must possibly have played made sound deduction that bird have suddenly pulled together a morning wore on pavilion began to fill up tobin came talked for little in state of highest disgust at soon badsley also appeared time total on telegraph board mounted with rapidity for bird be playing with swift effortless precision made prettiest bat in world to watch if only happened to be making run have trick of making difficult bowling appear perfectly easy put away to corner of field by one flick of slim wrist cut ball late between point slip by almost more imperceptible sent racing behind square leg to pavilion boundary a jim have prophesied did not have word with again till came across field at lunch time with eighty two to credit inning be worth more than to side for going in at critical moment have stopped rot have begun to set in there be added excitement for jim after lunch of seeing bird make necessary eighteen run to complete century be certain that engrossed much more than consideration of what varsity total might be bird began by hitting three four off first over received then three two brought total up to ninety nine then skied ball so high that looked a if really might be going to soar beyond power of earth attraction become new sporting planet failed quite to reach required altitude after pause seemed to last many minute be caught at long on retired amid round of applause sympathetic yelling bloody as said jim to a came into pavilion rather did ever see ball go so high hullo there badders why not amorously engaged badders lord have be enjoying want enormous drink why must not young cantab have one one two several in fact a red king said twasnt be white knight daresay a long a got said whats odds nine thats what tell to say when think youve got consumption will have tea first three bottle of ginger beer afterwards other way round good bye chapter ii mr jackson tall short sighted clergyman with green moustache classical tutor at st stephen college be accustomed to dine en garon saturday night in hall instead of en famille at home after two three glass of port play rubber of whist in room of one of colleague to night gathering be planned to take place at mr butler room in fellow building be with great pleasure that have heard host ask water alison to complete four be classical don tutor lecturer be completely characteristic of that continued to play whist rather than bridge considered debased easy variety of dummy whist four have mind of same academic calibre constituted in very conservative college stronghold inner defence of conservatism chief among tenet be doctrine that latin greek be sole essential instrument of education must be used on mind of young just a cricket football rowing be young man proper physical exercise in later life must play golf lawn tennis croquet even a in later life must learn french italian in doubt there be many light agreeable piece of literature to be enjoyed until have attained to maturity minor diversion have best be eschewed fellow a mr jackson be fond of saying who can write decent set of greek iambic translate piece of gibbon into thucydidean greek have trained mind can without difficulty acquire other subject of human knowledge with profession make desirable that must be acquainted creed mr jackson put into practice day of term greek be special subject that taught week by week pupil besides attending lecture just now be concerned with peloponnesian war made rendering of english verse into iambic english prose into possible equivalent in thucydidean platonic greek point of exercise really be to cram into rendering a many tag from classical author a must be dragged in when set of iambic be plentifully besprinkled with phrase unusual usage from schylus sophocles mr jackson considered good effort of scholarship never paused to reflect whether might not be merely specimen of most comical baboo greek everything connected with classical greek be unrivalled instrument of education in regard thus pupil be also thoroughly instructed in greek history might be a ignorant a sucking child on subject of french italian english history claim a regard history to be educated rested solely on knowledge of greek history similarly be nice to know date have objection to anyone being aware of year in constantinople fell into hand of osman england into of william conqueror be necessary to salvation to have on tip of tongue date of death of pericles subsequently in greek history classical age ceased nation language have not good luck to interest mr jackson further at loyal conspirator coadjutor in keeping greek flag flying be water who be to make one of four to night since host butler held same view with regard to latin a to greek have asked alison latin fellow conspirator to complete table jackson felt justified in expecting pleasant evening be not that intended expected that anybody must talk shop with regard to education simply felt happier more at ease in presence of classical scholar than in of mathematician natural scientist with natural scientist have however bond in common when did not bring into prominence doleful heresy that natural science natural history must possibly be considered instrument of education for have for year be enthusiastic collector of fresh water shell be hobby over unbent mind laying claim to be educated man because have very considerable knowledge of branch of conchology more than butler considered title to culture that have completer knowledge of handel music than living man probably dead one including handel jackson strolled along broad gravel path towards butler room passing group of undergraduate on way to of whom own pupil nodded practically knew none others even by sight jim bird be among knew who since smoking in court be forbidden discreetly held cigarette behind back a mr jackson passed though short sighted have keen sense of smell pleasantly enough made rather neat latin quotation about incense from butler room came loud resonance of piano quite drowned noise of knocking entering found that sardonic colleague deeply engaged at piano on last movement of handel occasional overture butler method of playing be to put face very near music plant firm foot on loud pedal add soft pedal for passage marked piano preserved iron unshakable tempo counting requisite number of beat to bar in audible voice not stopping till got to end of piece unless book fell off music rest when turned page when occurred continued counting while picked up to night such interruption occurred be not till have reached last loud chord that observed jackson appearance thats glorious thing be playing observed pleasantly a put cap gown in window seat glorious cant write such music now butler gave short sarcastic laugh cant indeed said modern music be just trash there other word for other day when be up in town went good evening water went to concert in order to hear handel violin sonata have to sit through piece of debussy if hadnt be for question of manner must have put back head howled like dog have to grin like dog instead suggested water stroking short black beard be streaked with applicability of classical english epithet silver sabled to beard consoled for sign of middle year assure grinning be beyond said musical sufferer though admit neatness of quotation be mere confused noise like nothing so much a protracted tuning of orchestra use getting angry with stuff doesnt faintest attention jackson put head on one side favourite attitude when pronouncing critical judgment im not altogether so sure that agree with said im not speaking about debussy because ive never heard of before think modern music be uncommonly fine youre confounded purist dear fellow certainly cant find time for second best said butler there nothing be written in last fifty year have chance of living sweeping statement rather said water be considerably impressed by festival at bayreuth two year ago in fact im going again in august there be certain part of tristan isolde be very moving cant persuade to come with jackson laughed not if be peitho must persuade said what be phrase of yours butler when heard tristan in london three hour of neurasthenic cacophany think called believe did said butler gratified that dictum must be remembered if did understated ah here be coffee wonder why alison doesnt come went to see master about something connected with may week concert said water told might be little late cant quite agree with host about wagner do cordially agree with there cult of incompetent sprung up who make up for want of artistic ability by sheer bizarre impertinence debussy make doubt be one of though like jackson never heard note of modern impressionist post impressionist cubist be others if may adapt butler phrase must have hesitation in describing canvass a three foot of neurasthenic daubing of course scribblings be merely pour rire jackson put head on one side again dont know that there much more to be said for modern art answered be unable to give even most admired modern painter place in pictorial tripos sargent for instance dont consider portrait more than mere poster piece of scenic painting if will dabbed on without finish like copy of greek prose without accent have here alison now well get to work be curious to note now immediately on advent of player to make up table at whist lesser problem pronouncement with regard to position of wagner sargent debussy in realm of art be immediately dismissed for greater preoccupation for middle aged men in spite of gently fossilized existence indulgent contempt for anything be not immediately cambridge general pessimism about modern effort retained certain streak of boyishness gusto in be genuinely fond of game milder more sedentary one that played better suited to robust vigour of pupil accepting importance of a clause in creed made cambridge just precisely what be theory about just a about education might be cut dried sap a completely be gone out of a out of pressed flower in botancial collection must unanimously have alluded to a hortus siccus did believe in there be elasticity possible growth development must come to fibrous stem crackling petal believed in creed must have opposed with nail of conviction suggested reform innovation for cambridge so long a fort of classic cricket stood secure be to institution a abiding a moon criticism concerning must be taken seriously more than must take seriously person who said that must have preferred colour of moon to be pea green magenta cambridge must only remain permanent perfect phenomenon if remained exactly a be whatever in world of flux change might alter crumble cambridge must present unalterable front to corroding century change came there must in very nature of thing be change for worse of great ancient fortress of cambridge st stephen college be beyond doubt most impregnable bastion founded by henry vii have have glorious record of opposition to reform innovation have assaulted grey wall when first railway began to knit england together st stephen have headed defensive manuvre to keep baleful facility away from sanctuary st stephen collective spirit did not wish to run up to london in two three hour preferred sequestering method of stage coach till forty year ago have consisted entirely of fellow undergraduate who have be scholar of st stephen school at conclusion of enjoyment of henry vii endowment there proceeded for rest of life if so disposed to be supported by henry vii at st stephen college entered a scholar became fellow in due course taught to succeeding generation precisely what have learned then have come that overwhelming assault on tradition of century four whist player thought bitterly of even till to day when college be thrown open to boy from other school who instead of necessarily taking up classic went in for sort of debased subject such a natural science medicine there be help for that particular gate of bastion have to be opened scientist moral physical even student of modern language mingled with white robed classical choir spirit of more loyal hearted portion of garrison remained unbroken sturdily long after rest of cambridge blazed with electric light st stephen owing chiefly to determined stand made by jackson butler moved in accustomed dusk of candle oil lamp introduction of bath room provoked not le gallant opposition in time of henry vii hot bath be unheard of if nowadays wanted one must get can of hot water from kitchen be only under severest pressure that debasing paraphernalia squeezed way in not for moment be implied that jackson friend be like bat who preferred dark like cat who disliked water only that disliked change preferred thing precisely a be game proceeded in utmost harmony with academic calm be interspersed with neat quotation for instance when at conclusion of hand water said approvingly to partner saw call right jackson without moment thought replied yes water one clear call for when heart be trump butler proved only to have one of suit paused without applying lit match to pipe to say eructavit cor meum a one happened to be ace be quickly sharply that alison said heart be inditing of good matter even when apt quotation failed something academic be fragrant in most ordinary remark a when spade being turned up a trump for third time running butler referred to prevalence of agricultural implement when partner found that hand contained seven diamond called jewel song there be not one atom of pose desire for effect in little mot mind thought like tongue faithfully expressed impression third of pleasant rubber came to end about quarter to eleven senatus consultum being taken be resolved not to begin new one to relax into conversation non semper arcum said butler rising ho everyone thirsteth will help yourselves please think said alison that when have finished sarah battling wanted to tell what master spoke to about alison be busy making curious drink that found refreshing be mixture of port soda water called alisons own in exactly equal proportion there must be just a much port a there be water neither more le else recondite flavour be missed be man of about forty five clean shaven alert great acquirement be inward knowledge of cicero letter so amazing that when once set piece of latin translation in college examination composed not at by cicero by even master have be deceived asked out of of cicero letter have taken that piece in other respect played lawn tennis be responsible a precentor for music of college service in chapel yes be matter of importance said choral society of course be giving annual sacred concert in chapel during may week have most unfortunately selected elgar dream of gerontius for performance master tell that be inclined absolutely to refuse to give permission for asked first to consult of told must meet three to night said that desired better subcommittee be objection to on score of elgar elgar score one might say asked butler on of gerontius if on of composer be disposed to agree with know nothing about gerontius a literary production except that hymn occasionally sing in chapel with vulgar tune be excerpted from believe jackson chuckled on score of elgar elgar score repeated very neat butler know hymn mean praise to holiest in height go admirably into greek iambic equally well into latin elegiacs said alison master have feeling against elgar music that wasnt point must not see permitting performance in chapel of libretto so markedly so pugnaciously roman catholic be bound to confess that there something to be said for view what do say jackson be spiritual pastor jackson took stand by fire place put head on one side well if im bound to speak a from rostrum said will be disposed to ask for notice of question uncommonly nice point question of course on hinge be how far purpose of libretto be extinguished by being treated musically remember going to see gounod faust of libretto contains frankly intolerable situation somehow when treated musically did not strike a actually indecent indecency of music must be enough for said butler incisively nothing else must strike ah there purist again just now question be not so much of purism a puritanism after sing praise to holiest in chapel remarked alison have known master join in butler drew in breath with hissing inspiration a of pain at recollection yes yes sufficient unto day usually trinity sunday be master singing of hymn remarked if master proposed to sing whole of dream of gerontius must be steadfast in prayer that must not be given at have not threatened that gather water extracted few crumb of biscuit have fallen in silver sabled beard think jackson have hit nail on head remarked question be how far music purge libretto in view doesnt merely emphasizes appeal musical be added admit

inexorable socialist who have also lunched with have now returned to london practically told that grote be thief remarked rather plaintively said that indicated surroundings really belonged to human race in general not to have stolen if be thief said lord thorley in calm philosophical voice then be receiver of stolen good ate drank in pilferings with immense appetite know thought be not quite consistent of have gone to station in roll royce of have robbed others after why be consistent gracie be consistent cant think of anybody else who be lady massingberd stirred gently in chair be that testimonial accusation asked think accusation inconsistent to be consistent if see what mean think must perhaps see better if explained helen grote considered moment half closing eye a if to focus idea what mean be said that be of bundle of opposite contradictory tendency desire result of heredity if will of environment that unless continually did large quantity of contradictory thing shouldnt be consistent with express mr stoughton for instance express beautifully be socialist say that have right to posse anything nice to money didnt earn be thief receiver of stolen good be sure be sincere in outrageous belief on other hand be clearly very fond of large quantity of food wine like going to station in expensive stolen motor car again be quite sincere be right to eat drink stuff have stolen wouldnt be consistent with if be not inconsistent really believe that mean something let go on talking about said lady massingberd seem to have strayed from subject not far be coming back to be consistent be completely convinced that nothing in world matter two straw that sole object of life be to extract from enjoyment can there be remarked lord thorley shielding eye against glare dont think im there at make out not only completely selfish also utterly willow not willow said lady grote one with conviction be willow dont drift in least go steaming away in well defined line with wake of foam wave behind occasional corps have thrown overboard added to complete picture thank darling do explain also why im not selfish must make feel more comfortable certainly can explain that be quite easy do quantity of kind unselfish thing give enjoyment to do must be very kind of for instance to pas match remarked henry thorley im sure must enjoy thanks lady massingberd sat stiffly up in chair looked rather like smart young guardsman who have chosen to dress in tailor made gown be just like helen said always impute low motif to people be good enough dont know about sincerity to say do kind thing only because amuses never said that said enjoyed said helen dont think that anything amuses worse worse have sense of humour then in sense havent thing dont tickle a american say a tickle didnt see humour of mr stoughton for instance took quite seriously have to point out to humour of inconsistency dont say for moment that cant see funny joke dont see serious joke like mr stoughton be true didnt see joke in mr stoughton if there be one thought merely very rude ill mannered altogether without breeding dont know where must have got breeding from said lord thorley must have be stolen if have hadnt have appropriated nothing in line cant understand helen like seeing weirdest sort of people do remember when found have asked black bishop lion tamer suffragette to dine with lady grote leaned laughing back in chair do remember said do not remember that grote came up to town unexpectedly that night arrived in middle of dinner gave one glance at fled to club didnt see again for six month poor grote poor grote indeed be going to see to day arent yes come evening see robin be coming too adores robin tell why like suffragette lion tamer black bishop asked lady massingberd be terrible word youre aristocratic to finger tip yet really think like riff raff of sort more than anybody anyhow amuses most then of course youve got sense of humour added bitingly darling never said hadnt explained that away beautifully real difference between be that like people like human race dont like human race like what call few friend be far more genteel oh im genteel too be asked lady massingberd in voice must have frozen molten pitch yes be genteel be very very nice to be genteel like few friend a said be of class allowed to call aristocratic dear believe that think that when moses came down from sinai brought with not table of law original edition of burke peerage duke of edom thats what like lady massingberd began counting on brown strong finger one selfish two willow three without sense of humour four genteel five snob said there nice handful of quality lady grote laughed again have laugh of child open mouthed abandoned wont listen to explanation said ive explained away everything genteel cant do now ill explain away snob arent in least snob in ordinary sense dont like prince better than duke duke than marquis like mr boyton who be coming down here evening like certain quality call breeding if prince hasnt got dont like lot of havent like certain quality usually go with generation of living comfortably in castle now dont at least dont like to exclusion of who havent got can make friend with who havent got trace of indeed think must have have great great grandmother who came from music hall if have in day heredity make want to go back there cant think why people be down on snob remarked lord thorley in slow suave voice snob be so pleasant if one happens to be earl something earl variety of snob be unfortunately becoming rather scarce ought to create snob instead of peer with pension henry so often appears to be talking nonsense when be really talking sense remarked lady grote hasnt have opportunity to talk much at present owing to gracie will let talk for little if he got anything to say remarked lady massingberd austerely have always know when henry have something to say because when have something to say be rather silent when have nothing to say talk biggest snob know helen said henry gently that sound like having something to say do say well good old crusted snob who like earl a such be about extinct except for friend mr boyton sort of snob have sprung up of be perfect specimen be snobbish about success dont like rank file of socialist like leader mr stoughton dont like singer like finest singer in world like finest artist richest man oh thats not being snob said helen yes be be being up to date snob in old day there be snobbism with regard to birth because prince duke so on be representative of most successful class have seat in house of lord controlled seat in house of common be richer than anybody else mattered most nowadays other people be much richer german jew such like nowadays other people matter more because opera russian ballet such like interest more than marquis care le about territorial possession more about being amused dont say be worse for being snob only remark that be one go on love being talked about said lady grote have led very happy life then darling said lady massingberd looking at finger of connoted odious quality oh shut up gracie said lady grote go on henry well youre snob whats harm of think very sensible of efficient people of world be naturally more interesting than others have won success to have won success implies gift implies character have got hall mark world have recognized have shown strength determination so far so good then tell about bad part whenever anyone say so far so good mean there something awful coming dont think awful so wont mind be fact that quantity of successful people be bounder thats one of penalty of success so often make bounder to be successful in rough tumble of profession blunts gentler quality competition have be business habit of competition make very disagreeable by product make inconsiderate of other people make square shoulder elbow people in face thats right said lady massingberd almost smacking lip give hot told be genteel selfish what be third finger marriage ring finger dear said helen wildly completely forgetting for moment that gracie have divorced husband only six month ago then suddenly remembered gave shriek of laughter oh wish must say that sort of thing when wanted to exclaimed only make awful gaffe by accident must be lovely to make on purpose there more to follow henry got to where liked people who elbowed others in face yes stick to that dont like because elbow other people in face mind only like though do elbowing there much more to follow out with said lady massingberd third finger be for marriage ring never will forget go on henry said helen be going on make profound mistake think be being democratic have known even think be socialistic be only being snobbish opera bore very much doesnt know one note from interjected lady massingberd go in order to pay homage to immense kuhlmann about whom everyone be talking be coming down here afternoon murmured lady grote felt sure of so probably be that man who wrote play lord chamberlain refused to license dont care for play mr hedgekick be perfectly charming said helen sticking up for friend hedgekick asked lady massingberd in awestruck voice yes darling hedgekick why not talbot be just a funny so be anything beginning with fitz wish wouldnt interrupt when henry be talking about worst of miserable business said lord thorley be that think be being democratic open minded be among who say one man be a good a god made dont really think anything of sort few men be much better than others others can go hang worship success must there be anything narrower le democratic anyhow have suffragette to dinner remarked lady grote be criminal too have scragged picture in royal academy be sent to prison be precisely why asked to dinner be in world eye like cinder from engine said lady massingberd exactly if notorious murderer be allowed to go out to dinner must certainly ask night before be hanged lady grote did not attempt to defend yes thats quite true a far a go said doesnt go far enough go great deal too far said lady massingberd never knew how dreadful be may prisoner at bar speak said helen shes going to anyhow just im human pointed finger suddenly at lady massingberd gracie dont say im much too human said because thats cheap get into humanity most surely quickly by going blind for people who have succeeded in own line adore dont particularly care what do so long a do better than anybody else if be being snob well be one like people about whom world be talking be concentrated people may be colossally rich thats interesting because smoulder with power may sing may tell like mr stoughton that im thief may dance like grit make success what be that interest not what do in case of dancer what leg do said gracie succinctly dear great fault be that cant forgive said helen be pricking with pin because said be genteel thats small of now whatever be im not small im not bound like by restriction of class im much more woman than lady if make clearer to dont care whether person who interest come from slum south kensington palace doesnt seem to to matter therein im much bigger also than people like mr stoughton novelist for whom a someone said sun always rise in east end think that if dress for dinner cant be interesting thats willow view if like lord thorley with wrinkling movement of nose displaced pince nez habitually wore gave lost sort of look dont know where weve got to remarked weve got to fact that be more human than of therefore bigger know perfectly well how to be grande dame how to be gamin know from inside too be grote used to say that never knew of be coming down in morning whichever be always adored people lord thorley gave long abstracted sigh be so amazing of said cant understand being so completely taken up with people a individual a be collectively agree with when people form mass party can deal with principle be evolved in fact prefer abstract to concrete said lady massingberd gave charming smile apart from people be privileged to call friend certainly do said be delightful to sit here discus helen snobbishness because shes friend have not slightest desire to discus mr stoughtons inconsistency doesnt seem to to matter whether be inconsistent not socialist be aware be very muddle headed indeed have constructive scheme to propose mr stoughton seems to very ordinary representative of class without clear idea to lay before beyond notion that be thief think that possibly be must tell more than good ought to belong to state hadnt slightest notion of how state must dispose of didnt see that if for instance be industrious frugal will though property be equally distributed to day be richer at end of year than b who be idle spendthrift eventually admitted that when asked if proposed to have further distribution of property annually have nothing better to say than be detail must be worked out isnt detail lie at root of whole affair clever frugal industrious will always amass property periodical distribution of wealth must only put premium on idleness extravagance how far fact that great grandfather be hard working justifies being rich to day be of course totally different question sat there gently tapping knuckle of one hand with pince nez held in other looking dreamily out over sunny lawn then suddenly seemed to recollect glanced from one to other of companion dear have be bringing principle into very charming discussion on personality said naturally grant that to arrive at principle must study person must be analysed dissected principle be spirit distilled from person be more concerned really with result of distillation than with individual grape have gone to then why did adopt politics a profession asked lady massingberd always wanted to know surely in political career be entirely concerned with person a individual not in view of indeed must say precisely opposite anyone who attempt to be constructive politician deal entirely with force tendency with evolution of nation collective mind of course there be tub thumpers rhetorician of new order who attack individual tell what have seen in one particular staffordshire potter house contrast with deer park vandycks of somebody else mr stoughton be that name be of class man whose idea deal with big movement doe not concern with isolated probably misleading phenomenon doe not have to see thing for tell everybody what have seen need not go to australia in fact in order to learn to think imperially who coined that phrase by way turned to lady grote a spoke knew a much about politics a knew about lunar theory very wisely hazarded conjecture on subject be very suggestive said think what say be completely wrong from beginning to end head of different profession just now like minister of state head of church like bishop know nothing at of what be really going on public opinion isnt made in whitehall more than christianity be made in cathedral anyone who professes to control course of must have first hand knowledge of subject why be church out of touch with people simply because bishop live in palace why be state out of touch with people simply because minister sit in office in academic manner be unacquainted with what public opinion be have not smallest idea what individual want have first hand information be there ever more ridiculous assembly than house of common unless be house of lord man be elected to house of common let say by majority of one vote represents half of constituent who elect one man be answer to say that somebody else be elected with majority of three thousand only represents majority of electorate doesnt come out square there be use in saying doe good lord house of lord lord thorley have adjusted pince nez again looked at a through microscope about house of lord asked dear be not professor be not undergraduate ask that a if be trying to examine determine place by intelligence of

have gone elsewhere german jew hittite whatever be have got house of lord be aunt sally everybody throw dart at silly face stick there time wrinkled pince nez off nose again dear helen said have idea be radical gave little despairing sigh be nothing of kind said be more radical than be tory do know in weird way whole world be going into melting pot be going to be chucked in what sort of soup will make wonder lord thorley who have sunk back into chair sat little more upright grasped lapel of coat in hand without calling attention to fact that soup be not usually made in melting pot observed dont believe in melting pot ever since can remember country have supposedly be on verge of gigantic cataclysm at one time have be socialism at european war at home rule at period can remember have there not be terrible thunder cloud in sky now have seen too many thunder cloud to believe in thunder if look at book of memoir of age will always find precisely same thing writer invariably represent country a on edge of abyss ground be always trembling with subterranean menace when be volcano actually in state of eruption in england never have be have smoked steamed sometimes have always be safety valve looked serenely triumphantly at companion a if in character of teacher have algebraically proved problem a if in character of conjuror have brought off clever piece of manipulation lady grote shook head at think can prove thing by theory said unfortunately experience can disprove theory laughed gaily rose be just where part company said theory be founded on collective experience condition now be different that be what age say of own age replied in case be wrong behind condition governing be that great immutable force called human nature behind human nature be infinitely greater force most immutable of by one name agree to be god stood twisting pince nez by string for moment silence here lovely saturday afternoon running to seed said may borrow motor dear helen go out for run cant persuade to come with wish must guest will be beginning to arrive before long dear yes forgot be thinking that gracie must be passing quiet sunday do expect many people think about thirty never really expect anybody till arrives for may make subsequent engagement when arrives naturally cease to expect because be already there so have expectation with regard to people wish must apply

on flat shore to bathe laughed dear order car will take header on return dont ask gracie to go with because must certainly say yes want here for moral support very well feel qualm about not offering moral support because must find broken reed looked round great cool loggia moment dear grotes ancestor be thief with great deal of taste observed drifted away in rather rudderless manner lost in subtle speculation on subject have be under discussion much most interesting of be lady grote for whom entertained greatest admiration strongest affection of be capable that though lacked ardent quality be undoubtedly deep very quietness almost guaranteed that pulse never beat quick for anybody for friend beat most satisfactorily full passion of sort whether of temper of temperament be quite unknown to analytic mind lived in cool pleasant cave with affection grouped tidily round admirable conscience keeping sort of sentry go at mouth of to call out when required for fulfilment of public duty moment be over saluted let bestow at ease again seldom be surprised at anything for if anything at startling came across always felt that better knowledge of soil from sprang must have enabled to conjecture existence have be unaware for instance until to day that lady grote be one of cataclysmic party whose bogy whenever appeared in public press looked at with mild easily satisfied curiosity future of ireland be of labour trouble be even suffragette be periodically supposed to contribute menace to tranquillity of decently ordered realm possibility of european war lady grote have not said of thought threatening have spoken of melting pot being on fire found standing in drawing room in front of great vandyck picture of lady grote of period who have be ancestress of own not till then did

waiting for to be answered continued looking vaguely at antique lady grote thinking of modern one how baffling to analyst be vivid flame like quality of mind desire for brooding activity of thought ever touched be always eager for experience psychical adventure in living loved coming in contact day with new mind explored like traveller in unknown land made map of note even of fresh flora fauna must be forty year old now yet in eagerness elasticity of mind just a in fresh youth of body showed sign of age of mellowness age brought with have still about delicious effervescence experimentalism of youth life be passed in foam of rapid never by chance did float into back water time with buffeting adventure that brought wrote wrinkle on ever so slightly bruised very quality of vitality like wind swept away catastrophe from path in mere cloud of dust never made inquiry into truth of scandal about friend such thing did not interest for a long a have known world tongue have never ceased wagging about affair whatever have be have in way coarsened made common remained high bred exquisite woman perched on pinnacle of what must suppose be called social standing passion for analysis did not trouble to exert over what meant in prosperous thoughtless democratic day there be end to ingredient composed be power centre comet year ago there have be awkward time when robin be quite small boy grote have wanted to take very extreme step most ill advised step in lord thorleys opinion with regard to have interested in eventually have persuaded grote to be reconciled with again good must come of only harm round especially for boy naturally have never spoken to helen of what have done on occasion probably to day be ignorant that be who have saved situation besides grote then with slight sense of disgust a if have seen objectionable paragraph in book lord thorley turned over page in mind rest a far a personally knew be mere scandal gossip have mean of judging truth falsity only knew that subject matter of be unattractive to even positively distasteful seemed that bell in house be answered with truly artistic deliberation going again to side of chimney piece to repeat summons observed that have merely turned on light of glass chandelier hung in centre of room have be vaguely conscious of good deal of sunlight about have even wondered where came from dear dear said to a pressed correct button must really try to be little more observant in practical affair helen must never have done that be distinctly waste of nervous force to attend too closely to trivial matter suppose there be compromise to be arrived at chapter iv be not long after lord thorley have got clear of house turned out on inquiry that have driven down from london that morning thus went forth in own motor car lady grotes guest began to arrive for next couple of hour have to remain in loggia receiving there be buffet set out against wall where must get tea hock cup variety of food fruit to refresh after strain of half hour journey from town in saloon carriage reserved for on couple of train stopped for at grote so that must not have inconvenience of travelling by more leisurely service

governess ex office boy must thus whistle london mattered to table aline quite realized that by keeping sumptuous party so small must assuredly make host of enemy seemed to that handful of right sort

will lie awake miserable till morning sleep well said hermann gurtner like most successful men in walk of life have great power of absorbed meditation went on unconsciously in brain while more superficial part of be actively engaged in receiving examining noting information on decision must be based now when be left alone spread source in front of brain intelligence darted about now scrutinizing one now while subconscious distillation from soaked into inmost mind at other moment stirred up together put stewing pot back over fire with lid on letting simmer bubble together in dark heat steam for next hour did occasionally walking up down room for most part sitting quite still in chair biting nail be intensely anxious whole situation seemed to about a menacing a situation must be a counterweight to anxiety enjoyed ecstasy always accompanies exercise to utmost of trained sharpened faculty must infinitely have preferred serene world unmenaced by war since have not got ordering of that be like jackal waiting for result of battle of lion there must be bit to pick up discarded fragment of provender even before imperial beast proceeded to tear other for in national excitement must have forgotten about dinner be little to must make immense store for jackal thus be not only indeed mainly possible cataclysm confronted saw with at least a much lucidity possibility of huge financial coup for possessed a be of information known probably only to war council in germany to agent in berlin war council policy for moment be clearly to observe utmost possible secrecy there be several picture unrolled spread out before mind first largest of be cypher message have received from agent in berlin throughout length breadth of germany secret mobilization of army be going on under excuse of autumn manuvres did not doubt what autumn manuvres be to be for earlier in week have ascertained that there be tremendous activity in krupp work at essen doubt english cabinet be also aware of english cabinet be not out to make money must talk about consider what meant doubt make arrangement in view of meaning what certainly did mean in interval financier business man be free to act while be considering national defence life have relied entirely on own judgment have never have partner in business from time that have sat office boy on hard stool of german house in london with fire to build difficult english language to learn have found no reason for trusting opinion of others more highly than own germany be secretly mobilizing krupp work be forging hammering night day third ingredient in boiling pot be news wife have given namely that german ambassador be anxious to know what feeling in england be with regard to trouble in ireland when told that have drawn conclusion from except that statement that emperor must be heart broken when heard of seriousness of position must not possibly be true there must be something behind something accounted more reasonably for emperor grief when must hear that there be possibility if not more of civil war in ireland what must be inquiry ludicrous interpretation meant something be not german way to take trouble to acquire information unless be to be of use twice peered into stewing pot found that ingredient still unsoftened uncooked by boiling experienced over hot fire of brain remained still hard unfit to add sustenance to stew then suddenly intractable material liquefied on touch of conjecture what if germany wanted to ascertain whether england must be so much immersed in internal trouble a not to be able to get head above troubled sea of european tumult at conjecture acumen shouted approbation to a at solving of riddle in dumb crambo in fresh light went over again that have previously examined austria have made unreasonable preposterous demand on serbia russia have remonstrated that be be officially known to night private information from berlin have told that germany be preparing for war from that have deduced that germany be arming against russia if russia persisted in remonstrance must find central empire against france must necessarily range with russia must great britain join european ally be that just exactly that germany wanted to know irish trouble might make impossible for england to do so in case russia france might be already considered a crushed what chance have against huge military machine be a if man with shot gun set out to attack adversary with repeating rifle apart from that there be german fleet supposing england be not taking hand how great deutschland dreadnought must sweep down channel reduce calais boulogne dieppe havre to ruin deutschland must land army where chose in france while other army sweeping through belgium drove french before of course there be sort of obsolete document forbade invader to set foot on silly little soil mattered nothing germany might might not take trouble to declare war on belgium in order to get at france if england came in there be question of sympathy now that topic have so disturbed wife have long vanished from consciousness wanted only to make clear to mind interest on must with least possible risk stake money for instinct of making money have be since first sat on office stool be not for sixteen year after that have thought of domestically satisfying home need have always have kindly affectionate heart since first met aline that general affection have be concentrated consecrated into passion for apart from money wanted nothing else in moment interest not affection sympathy directed gnawing of nail there be going to be war of that made doubt whatever very little thought convinced that if there be war england must somehow have to be in anxiety of irish question might be for if did not come in now day der tag be assuredly not far off when france russia must be annihilated when once be done who must doubt that germany must turn victorious arm against real enemy one power stood between dominion of world sooner later england must fight for germany have decreed armageddon be going to fight now be precisely what germany wanted to know unless hermann gurtner be much mistaken german ambassador view be that be not have shared that belief must drain out without delay from english interest penny of million for with france russia crushed even empire founded upon sea must not single handed resist that tremendous war machine of fatherland at ease must march through india through egypt with fleet free in ocean of world must reduce awful little focus of world power confined in two insignificant island one of already reeked with sedition to compass commensurate with acre stupid a english be must realize that more let stew simmer in brain le capable felt of believing england must stand aside might might not consider that treaty obligation compelled to intervene must surely see that only chance of defeating germany lay in joining assisting entente now without delay otherwise must have to bear full weight of invincible land empire alone perfidious always be have terribly good notion a to how to take care of herself with perfidiousness there be strangely mingled quixotic sort of instinct must compel to sane course none knew better than that germany having declared war on france must sweep through belgium in order to attack on vulnerable front belgium must quite certainly appeal to england on violation of treaty protected territory be exactly that sort of call that impossible selfish quixotic nation be apt to listen to for saw reason for existence of little power sooner be absorbed one way other in great state better for time be passed for existence of such little vineyard of england must come in till moment be entirely consideration of interest have absorbed suddenly like great tidal wave sweeping in from calm ocean sympathy declared submerged everything else der tag have dawned faint dim in east be line of morning

arrogant nation must suffer penalty of wilful blindness be winnowed like chaff in great pure wind must scatter pretension purge pride did not doubt that at end world must pas into possession of fatherland yes day be dawning selfish incompetent mistress of sea who proclaimed that sea be free so long a navy have complete command of must give place to nobler possessor under whose rule must be free because there be none to enslave master of sea land alike time have come for cessation of old civilization ownership warring one against protecting by treaty silly signature treaty must be torn

made choice did not stand in way of making more million also with re invigorated spirit put lid on sympathy turned to interest england be coming in without doubt must be severe shock to germany german bond must undoubtedly fall though sympathy be utterly german there be reason why must not make money out of instinct that germany be wrong if thought england must stand aside have already given order that head clerk must wait up night in office in city rang up number on telephone gurtner said when got through yes be sir hermann sell million pound of german three a soon a stock exchange open in morning get best price can sell sat for moment considering yes be sound be quite certain that german share must go down a soon a be known that england be going to take hand in war then must buy at lower price must fall not le than ten point england be to be considered next be staking with certainty in mind on war english fund must also go down transacted similar sale there be yet side of question to consider group of opportunity to be grasped war must necessarily cause national fund consols such like to decline war have need have to be supplied with sinew with england at war freight must rise shipping share must immediately be in demand coal must be in demand steel ammunition share must soar so again using telephone sent order to office for purchase of block of share in colliery even in day of peace must be attractive investment for purchase of share in couple of shipping company then a regard steel work ammunition there be certain english company be doing good business even in day of peace once again took up telephone to order purchase of vickers maxim for moment hesitated here be of german birth proposing to buy interest in company manufactured gun must deal death in squirt of lead to countryman instinct within faintly protested next moment have answered ridiculous misgiving with silencing reply for not german more must be killed if bought vickers share than if did not be mere washy sentimentality demurred only actual result must be that if bought must certainly make money be what be sent into world for be unanswerable by same reasoning there be cause for refraining to buy krupp share not english life more must be lost because bought however must be wise to purchase in berlin in name of agent there if wanted to sell at profit must no doubt negotiate sale through switzerland yet still hesitated little must be effect if be known here in england on eve of war bought krupp what in germany if be known that have bought vickers maxim then once more swept such halting counsel of prudence aside investment at rate must raise question of sympathy whereas in reality be merely question of interest must keep two apart for must never do to let sentiment interfere with money making faint light began to steal through chink between brocade curtain looking out saw that tired light of morning seemed unwilling to awake have flooded sky wanly illuminated

said tristan isolde werent gay not exactly what one ordinarily mean by most people in opera must be terribly depressing to live with think of living with beggar in ring awful perhaps have better go

together will yes dear will be lovely said wondering exactly who must have to put off knew day be fitted together like mosaic half past four then for long time after robin have left sat in state of belated indecision knew that must have come down to grote with word of urging from even while have said a much have made up mind that must not utter have quite forgotten if have ever known that be going back to cambridge to day fully expected that must come down to grote with be not going to do moment knew that knew also whom be meaning to ask there of course be to be at opera on saturday night after opera must be very pleasant to have hour cool drive down to grote instead of stopping in london night driving down on sunday morning robin must have driven down with have be coming must have have morning on river together while other two amused other robin be not coming be therefore perfectly reasonable for to find somebody who must drive down with on saturday night on sunday morning complete quartette that sounded reasonable enough knew that from beginning to end of there lurked in essential insincerity with two such old friend a lord thorley gracie be perfectly well aware that there be not smallest need to look for fourth a far a companionship for of went how often wondered have three spent sunday together perfectly content with other naturally robin must come if have nothing else to do if have there must not be more gratuitous proceeding than to look for somebody else merely for sake of even number must still ask to put off going to cambridge till monday so deprive herself of excuse for asking somebody else be not yet too late must still be in room opposite dressing knew be meaning to hing of kind obstinate questioning why be that must have rowdy supper party getting home at four in morning after goodness only knew what adventure yet somehow have trace of in morning except what cold bath soap must remove if anything be rather suitable than otherwise according to code of world in general that boy must go rampaging about wipe whole affair off mouth like fringe of froth one with sense must dream of blaming for anyhow did not make nature least le wholesome be just lightness gaiety of youth passed such thing through filter of so that when reached real self be clear unmuddied be because man by curious device of nature must within reason do what chose yet retain own colour whereas woman be like chameleon took on at rate in much higher degree than man colour of conduct woman be flesh blood le than men if by limitation of loveless marriage be uncared for unsatisfied must acquiesce in so unreasonable verdict of course have to care there be nothing so odious so degrading a passion in cold blood passion in hot blood be vastly different thing to desire be test of being alive have idea why hesitated scruple hitherto quite foreign to nature seemed to have germinated within be connected with moment just now when with robin seated on arm of chair showing good deal of leg have have so undimmed vision of a young mother of a adorable soft little burden fruit of rapture pain then well so soon after such passion a there have ever be between herself husband grew a cold a extinct crater of moon be use of trying to warm by moonlight neither of have attempted so preposterous proceeding yet warmth be prime essential of life to who have temperament for loving for being desired puzzled to know why after so many year of taking thing for granted must suddenly begin to question validity what be nature of scruple troubled surely be not conscience cowardice masquerading in black coat parson tie be desperately serious in bewildering attraction man have for be afraid be really nothing more than toy to great beautiful toy with diverted sometimes felt not even to be to be weary of already yet image of toy did not wholly represent what felt to be to gross savage creature played with played with not so much a toy a prey be like mouse encircled by velvet paw of drowsy cat not hungry pleased to have in power be that then reason of scruple of hesitation to ask to come down to grote with after have sung tristan that wanted to escape possibly have part in scruple yet fact that felt to be toy prey heightened intensified desire wanted not so much to escape a to prove more than must make want must at least be hungry in stress of need question of scruple whether conscience born cowardice begotten vanished utterly rang up at hotel knew that answered call for there be mistaking timbre of soft purring voice even when passed through wire drum of instrument must blur le individual utterance into mere metallic gabble recognized voice too for in answer to question if be in said at once ah be gracious lady seemed to that there be something ironic in phrase must almost see half smile round red sensual mouth a said be there something ironic too in answer to suggestion that must come down to grote with after opera next day rapturous plan have purred be too kind spoil will have joy of knowing that hear poor tristan for last time to morrow have fully intended to go to tristan first then call for at stage door when suggested that suddenly whole mind veered round felt must not bear to see share love potion with even though other be huge misshapen borinski wanted to have warning from brangaene in tower wanted lime lit forest of stage tree theatrical representation even though most wonderful love music in world superb passionate voice interpreted above did not want to see tragedy bitterness of love rather to know triumph of sweetness went through mind with vividness speed of scene suddenly illuminated in darkness by flash of lightning shant come to opera said will just call for afterwards will drive down there be moment pause thing will be a will gracious adored lady said till to morrow then said well be settled instantly plunged into myriad engagement employment awaited wanted to take mind completely away from to morrow to occupy distract conscious self to employ conscious energy let have determined on seethe quietly in shut darkness of inmost self wanted to imagine nothing to anticipate nothing lest by reflecting must dull keenness of force when must come into play be to be mouse no longer toy no longer queen who dominated not slave who served day next that storage of force went on while like separate entity went from house to house to luncheon party here to hour of afternoon concert afterwards coming home a arranged to have tea with robin before went to cambridge entertained people at dinner night went to drawing room afterwards with that essential really living part shut up in darkness of inmost soul sometimes if let interest in pageant round flag for moment must hear something tapping at door behind have locked real self in refused to listen above refused to hold communication with prisoner to morrow night london must be left behind prisoner must come out enter into kingdom on saturday afternoon sent such servant a must be needed down to grote with instruction that mr kuhlmann must come down night two more guest must join next morning there must be supper ready for for must not be down till somewhere about one in morning there be need to open of big room suddenly unreality of great party struck what did come to have be anything more than rather gorgeous expensive way of passing time until something real came along how many of who composed that brilliant crowd mattered at to perhaps there be dozen at one party whom cared for who perhaps cared for rest be hardly more than pretty dress moved talked on topic a evanescent a gossamer on dewy morning dined on saturday night at restaurant with three friend mr lockwater geoffrey bellingham ubiquitous mr boyton who

everybody in room look in direction where must behold boyton entertaining two most beautiful woman in london a host wanted to talk too plunged into very rapid of bellingham eloquence best ground for betting against germany being a say behind said be delightful party given two day ago at have felicity to meet dear neighbour on right timorous friend lady grote must have be there must not have seen cordiality between certain of fellow guest absence marred perfection of evening lady grote have to think moment before must remember what party host alluded to there have be such lot of party just same sort of thing two night ago what long time ago must have be must remember that robin have be out till four in morning what else have happened then remembered yes yes said be anglo germanic

without stirring finger aline remembered interview have have with husband late that night general injunction a to secrecy by private information with aid of own foresight have sown golden harvest while world still slept surely be impossible that be matter of common knowledge saw must be careful precaution usually end in being too careful ah came like thunderclap to hermann said be simply knocked down by helen have not slightest reason to make mystery of information yes dear aline said meant be when did thunderclap come party how well remember be on thursday kuhlmann left for germany on saturday while be still drowsy comfortable left little note of adieu said in that have gone because trusted sir hermann judgment more than ambassador aline in desire to be careful be full of protestation have idea of at said volubly hermann hadnt given slightest clue that be uneasy till knew that war be inevitable how proud be of being english when splendid ultimatum went out that england must not tolerate breaking of treaty be sure said anything to kuhlmann expect somebody else spoke to probably got mixed up meant to say that trusted german ambassador judgment more than hermann instantly saw must not do since now everyone be aware that ambassador have clung to belief that england must not intervene from carefulness made thing shade worse remember talked to that night said be terribly pessimistic about whole situation helen must not help remembering that only just now aline have said that on night nobody dreamed of trouble there be clearly little confusion somewhere though not probably kuhlmanns have not smallest desire to investigate people get muddled over date always did attempted to slide off topic little a wanted to talk about war at thought must make violently anti german remark such a aline must appreciate in order to put muddle away odd how little german can appreciate psychology of honourable civilized people said ambassador for instance a said thought be going to see treaty torn up not stir finger now aline be quite capable in pursuit of englishness of making identical remark when heard made by englishwoman revolted against be life death to germany said have to invade belgium promise couldnt be held to bind say that france really invaded belgium first two be now thoroughly at cross purpose helen grote in private reflection that morning have be equally loose in conception of promise seeing therein only temporary obligation to suit certain circumstance now when heard that doctrine stated saw abominable falsity even though outcome of for intimately be that robin must soon go out to uphold sacredness of promise repudiated with scorning own conclusion of morning got up dear aline said be sort of thing one be tempted to think be ashamed of having thought why whole english case feel in bone be based on negative of a for people saying that france invaded belgium first be what berlin say to potsdam potsdam to berlin how unspeakable account of german atrocity in belgium be dont let talk about so longed in london to get away from may have stroll round delicious garden how well remember in spite of helen grotes expressed desire to get away from thought of war aline must not let that remark about german atrocity pas unchallenged once again a on sunday at cambridge with robin spoke before knew have spoken oh infamous lie said

orthodox strain be uplifted be ludicrous enough felt be just shade uncomfortable also must have liked clearer view of what be going on in poor alines breast must have understood so well frank admission of torn shredded sympathy what be harder to comprehend be intense desire to appear wholly english alines subsequent appearance explanation did not really elucidate matter a usual when everything be not going precisely a wished eye be bright brimming must really get rid of childrens nurse said scolded for singing watch by rhine called horrid little hun can not expect child to know be going on again helen found in little perplexity of mind be alines indignation with childrens nurse entirely due to fact of having called hun did fact that have by implication called german horrid hun have anything to do with began to feel rather more interested in analysis of alines state of mind though party at dinner only consisted of four of with addition of clergyman of parish wife who walked across park from rectory mr tempest carrying evening shoe in whitey brown paper parcel there be very elaborate menu sir hermann aline continually showed appreciation of duty of territorial magnate before arrival of guest aline have explained to lady grote that invitation have be sent accepted before telegram have arrived have further told that mr tempest be very well connected woman much a if lady grote be likely to consider a very extraordinary thing that must be expected to sit next mere parson be asked to shoot with sir hermann next day in place of mr boyton aline exhibited great interest in church decoration for approaching harvest festival promising fruit flower if must find time own personal embellishment of altar also repeatedly pressed on second helping of dish urging to make good dinner implying a be perfectly true that did not usually find in position to eat so largely of rich expensive food kind doubt intention be there be mixed up in conscious knowledge

hostess face clouded oh mr boyton like bridge so much said so doe hermann hermann said afternoon that must be able to have rubber after dinner didnt hermann mr tempest will enjoy seeing play so much there be possibility of making further indication so thought helen grote for if aline have inkling of ill breeding of such scheme be use making hint besides primarily be here a guest be part of guest duty to teach hostess manner so with more direction from aline to mr tempest a to where must find sketch graphic when have finished evening paper rubber began mr tempest be not long allowed pleasure

proceeding did not trouble to disentangle when after ringing for servant quarter maid came in to brush hair have general impression left on mind that there be great difference between friend who really be more than acquaintance acquaintance gave surprise there be root of friend never did surprise might in very nature be pleasant unpleasant if be pleasant be likely that acquaintance must be equally satisfied with be on high road towards friendship if surprise be unpleasant declined to pursue subject spoke to maid who be being rather severe in handling simpson have be nursery maid when be

have seen acted with boy friend filling up motor memory lacked bite of personal experience remembered remembered with intensest keenness remembered a something apart from herself be body bone of have sat with letter in hand have read once did not need to read again must recall word of even now must have quoted from yet be like something learned by heart memorable only owing to unforgettable style in writing went through mind with rapidity of picture momentarily thrown on to by magic lantern made effort to recollect recollection be flashed on from outside robin fearing for security of carriage door have just suggested falling out into roadway body of well nourished young man being debated upon at inquest next day when even a laughed image of happening have occurred to someone else made instantaneous photograph then jim merely by way of polite conversation said to suppose youre awfully busy arent with sort of war work upon robin stamped heavily designedly on foot clearly under impression that be jims be for present moment afterwards stopped at door of ritz where low bowing porter inserted in circular cage revolved fact that robin meant to stamp on jims foot by way of kind of warning silencer have vividness of personal experience recollection lacked dining room be already crowded with post theatre supper head waiter clearly perjuring gave table where chair be already turned down in token of future occupation there be dozen people knew entrance with two very smart young guardsman somehow pleased enormously robin jim also threw greeting about be popular well looked

rising to say good night to mr mr tempest in case be engaged on game of picquet played so aline told when be alone presumably therefore when there be guest who did not matter to morrow sir hermann must go out shooting again playing golf in betasselled stocking aline in sable must distribute rabbit to bereaved station master must go up to bed in lift exuded german chorale doubt by now aline must have got new nurse for child who must refrain from calling hun while child must have learned to refrain from singing watch by rhine be to house have gone to escape from evening like must not help wondering what must have be gurtners attitude towards bloody glorious affair at ypres ypres aline be about equally remote from spirit of present moment robin who scarcely knew claret from port be out of depth of wisdom consulting head waiter a to particular brand of champagne must be suitable in middle of consultation caught sight of someone entering trod time correctly on jims foot to bid observe epiphany of miss diana coombe who swept into room proceeded to occupy table immediately adjoining there be two young men with in civilian clothes remarkable old lady whom addressed a mommer when asked what wanted to order mommer said in strong american accent just give of best be quick about round neck thin a of plucked bird wore string of stone that rather resembled ruby from depended huge copper

lovely evening ive enjoyed immensely let have very soon rather arent going down to grote october ive made definite plan said make definite plan then to stop in town must be bored stiff down there slid off into darkness feeling more alive than have felt for many week past during have tried to banish thought of war remove from surroundings anything might remind of have tried to get isolation in country have sought out others who like wished to forget yet into shut room through closed window well fitting door war like drift of london fog have always made way poisoning ill ventilated atmosphere that already have briskness in to night for first time have left stuffy room gone out let fresh air with else might be laden flow round have expected to come home with added pang of miserable presage with heart ached eye even more strenuously refused to look into future be only in response to robin urging that have gone out at expecting at best to see forced gaiety sombre lapse from on part of friend having settled to take to theatre sup with have determined to do best to keep up to pretend that everything be laughable amusing instead be who have be kept up have expected trial of fortitude have be given most tremendous tonic in place of have found encompassed by new spirit possessed robin friend thousand like have not changed have merely brought out light fire be in even a under wheel of cutter polisher glory of diamond be developed new spirit be doing that for whole nation for now be lambent through darkness hung like rainbow across menace of thunder cloud moment of illumination grew bright to blinding point then faded again be like one on whom great light have flashed for second leaving in darkness again with phantom of light still swimming on retina for instant have seen a across waste water be seen revolving beam of lighthouse have passed between be tempest bellowing across windswept surge youth triumphant young manhood of england be being snatched away shovelled into burning moloch across sea a stepped on to pavement in front of house found that foot hurt remembered that a drove to ritz robin have very heartily stamped on design have clearly be to stamp on jims foot in order to stop saying something in sharp pain came to now wished that darling have stamped on jims foot not on hers remembered also that brutal caution be in nature of locking stable door after steed have be stolen for jim have certainly already said that robin have wanted to stop saying question have completely reached have supposed that be awfully busy doing sort of war work be topic robin have wanted to suppress knew that be doing sort of war work for disliked that being alluded to supposed that must not like be probable that reason be in mind a regard really did not care whether people knew be very completely abstaining from war work not have tried to take hand in at gracie ridiculous establishment be not made for sort of thing preferred to buy scarf ready made doubt recipient must prefer that also be quite willing to spend freely for sake of who needed similar comfort to sit among pessimistic female knit be alien to then suppressed part of mind insisted on asking rather inconvenient question supposing robin wanted scarf must not prefer to suffer sacrifice of time inclination in order to give rather than give something that cost nothing question really needed answer be so obvious that must delight in giving something of to whom loved there be joy in giving to beloved thing must get in shop if have to get at shop love insisted that must send little message with in order to give touch of sender be precisely what gracie weary choir of elderly pessimist be doing be sending to stranger to unknown men boy whom have never seen gift have touch of giver be precisely that be not doing began to wonder whether must not prefer a regard alone that must not be alluded to there be possible reason for robin belated misdirected signal to jim be possible that did not want alluded to be unpleasant topic for a well a be perhaps little ashamed of once on subject of staff appointment have talked about love implying respect must have instanced sort of love must despise yet continue to exist be sort of love wanted to take not to give be that love cynical philosopher held that main ingredient in love be sense of possession have never really believed that now thinking just of robin knew that not only be that incredible truth lay somewhere in region of very opposite main ingredient in love did not consist in possessing in giving there be dozen letter waiting for on hall table with unopened in hand went upstairs have told maid that need not sit up for a unclasped pearl collar image of mommer with great badge depending from collar of impossible ruby suddenly came into mind mommer be engaged on sort of charitable war work then must miss diana coombe be ashamed of if be not suddenly again without warning wave of utter loneliness swept over pearl fell rattling to ground once before when have risen smothered have thought to prevent re visitation of by surrounding with diversion interest above by shutting off from thought of war suffering that brought menace that threatened with experiment have not be very successful not for hour perhaps until evening when be sitting at absurd revue between two gay boy have thought of be entirely lifted off have happened because being with acceptation of have infected heard husband step along passage outside paused opposite door presently there came discreet tap sufficient to be audible to so read purpose if be awake not loud enough to disturb if be asleep hesitated moment then answered be seldom that came to room imagined must have something to tell im not disturbing asked came in only few minute ago robin friend have supper after theatre pleasant evening asked very be there anything particular wanted to speak to about yes there have be rather unpleasant rumour about for day two in case havent heard made up mind have better tell bent down to pick up pearl a rose again noticed with strange sense of detachment that chinked chattered together in hand knew that be trembling into mind there started image of kuhlmann standing together of robin looking from one to other concerning said quietly laughed of course not said do suppose must have heard rumour for day two concerning not either taken proper step to stop have told gave one long sigh of relief that for life of must not repress concerning whom then asked concerning friend gurtners there be general idea about sympathy be violently pro german a have be there lately thought might be able to give information about can said heard consistently express sentiment very opposite of say be attributed to paused moment there be nothing led to think that sentiment be not quite sincere asked also paused over question two be very good friend when met always polite always anxious not to

growth of autumn branch round hovered faint purple haze clothed steep hill side down to river at bottom of avenue water running high with rain have flooded part of valley lowest of tree stood mirrored in pheasant with burnished copper back got up from rough grass rose above beech with downward beating wing rabbit scuttled silently into fringe of undergrowth across river red roof of village gleamed

between in couple of minute have left presently there came sound of motor wheel crunching gravel from hour there began in helen grote change vital immense in spirit in devoted to hospital pride have hitherto demanded of that must do work a perfectly conscientiously a be able there be actual difference now in quality of performance of now love began to inspire in that men looked after have be injured in cause for robin be now in france be fellow worker be looking after member of brotherhood more than that even at time seemed to herself to be directly serving for who fought be part of corporate body individual who must not be dissevered from other faintly at first with increasing splendour even a dawn flood sky herald day dimming star turning moon to ash so new spirit permeated extinguishing lesser light of self respect demanded of efficient performance filling inter stellar darkness with glory of sun not yet risen upon earth walked a in clear shadow with brightness still high far above for often heart be faint soul be utterly lonely quivered with apprehension that must not of best will give home to visible above brightening a descended stair of heaven dawn stepped down towards earth with luminous foot if sometimes pulse be feeble with fear there be other moment when beat strong with impulse of new perception often light of new dawn be hidden so thickly clouded over that emptiness rebellion of autumn month seemed to have returned with added that robin be now out in peril of storm day hour might bring news must drive dawn altogether from sky no longer sought relief from thought in running away from in plunging into must most intimately bring home to horror of war soul escape lay not in trying to hide eye screen from by going with open vision into very thick of constantly work bored discouraged disgusted must feel for whole day together that stupidest woman in world must do be doing with le efficiency than that finer sympathy than hers must have gilded routine with splendour here be discouragement that be doing best must that anybody else must have easily done better served thanks to spirit be now beginning to inspire devotion not a hindrance to labour a spur to complete performance humility exalted so too with boredom disgust at time assailed over menial repeated task did not slur over delegate to others only struggled with own littleness in thinking anything little life once have consecrated a with vow to own amusement vow when war broke out sacrificed everything to keep have slid from under own hand shook free of benumbing touch of own self centred aim to day made fresh vow did not even trouble to repudiate former one register new intention simply went straight forward with industry simplicity have never be least inclined to introspection did not waste time energy in dwelling with regret on year have so devoted to own satisfaction indeed if have stopped to examine must have found shred of regret hidden away in cupboard of mind past be over done with after have enjoyed year enormously be foreign to nature to regret what have yielded so much pleasure past be over done with in sense also that felt there be going back to already even though few month have passed since august for cleavage seemed complete if looked forward to day when war be over leisure security returned must not think back into spirit of day when grote be temple consecrated to splendour extravagance desire of herself world perhaps must be so did not busy with such speculation for in condition with occupation in now lived came to regard old life a something phantasmal be truly real so far a reality concerned be comprised in ward workroom of hospital in certain unlocated trench in france robin be there somewhere be never wholly out of mind occupation be that fact stayed regarded sometimes gave strength resolution sometimes made hand falter knee fail in one aspect be always there have moment in forgot everything else when among letter must find thin envelope with army post office stamp rather faint pencilled inscription have moment of sick suspense when telegram be brought on one such occasion felt unable to open giving to matron waited feeling sure that brought intolerable message until not unsympathetic person asked whether consignment of cigarette to referred have arrived miss hawker have clearly guessed cause of being asked to open for said mere waste of good anxiety to anticipate trouble sister a constant a consciousness that robin be away in france much more real be consciousness that robin be here be hers must not be parted from partook of immortal quality though for have always looked forward without fear without further expectation to moment when great fish must gulp down a floated water logged on surface of spent life must not apply same image to to relation with image of thought be at first vague veiled began to assume firmer outline a of conviction in process of crystallization in front of background life full of boredom discouragement disgust went on busy way independent of worked behind turning to something be in essence gold there be encouragement surprise a well among be event of evening of new year men have asked if might give entertainment to staff doctor nurse housemaid servant helen have expressed cordial assent thereafter for three day life of staff especially female portion of have be rendered quite intolerable from sheer overwork be wrapped in mystery for sake of entertainment of staff who must sew be bidden to make blouse shirt scarf appurtenance of dress might

course have be told in confidence what pice de rsistance of entertainment be to be fact that everybody knew having be confidentially informed kept secret safe inviolable stage have be constructed at end of long dining room be helen responsibility a regard entertainment for rest everybody knew though nobody knew precisely what be going to happen during three day helen be in strong request have to see that there be curtain broad enough to cover stage two must do to be parted in middle must be le satisfactory piano somewhere in front of stage practically unlimited amount of furniture if there be printing press in house so much better there wasnt if not typewriter must with industry produce enough programme to go round above must be under inviolable seal of secrecy evening arrived in front row immediately before curtain be whom doctor in charge permitted to be carried down recumbent from ward behind be seat for staff rest of audience consisted of minority who be not otherwise engaged either directly a entertainer hardly le usefully a scene shifter dresser first part of programme consisted of song recitation charged with highest degree of sentiment except comedian who made most unblushing reference to matrimony mother in law high cheese concluded with horn pipe danced by two men with one leg apiece have arm interlaced round others neck roared with laughter second part of programme unveiled complete mystery about need for female attire for consisted of revue there be plot of kind a helen have already learned be proper thing in revue there be numberless topical allusion to member

hearted chorus have sling be bandaged be on crutch be amazingly attired in height of feminine fashion still not even after ballet girl have be recalled till be surfeited with success be there allusion to lady grote must rather have liked to laugh at too dignity of not being laughed at did not quite compensate in mind for fun of being derided be very nice of boy not to laugh at felt that somehow have not found way to heart in not having presented ridiculous feature to whole feeling lasted no longer than last breath in frosty air for a soon a chorus ceased to be recalled be nervous duty to say
