man who be well never think about health certainly never mention to man who be really ill divine sense of irresponsibility be given brush aside just a one brush aside innate inability with common courage how lavishly be beautiful gift given to whomever really need make best of other thing poignant though obvious reflection be outcome of what occurred evening sat between two friend at dinner of people in whom one heart rejoices one of be obsessed just now with devil of health seeking other have long ago given up notion of seeking for health at for be not for face incurable with gaiety so

strictly in accordance with spirit of thing mind went slowly browsing like meditative cow over dazzling display have spread before instinctively instantaneously found envying though why envied did not immediately know be soon obvious envied power of making soul stirring discovery rapture over magical spring song of man have thought awful rotter envied ignorance of perfectly patent fact that be only fool who can go on doing nothing of fact that be infinitely better to sit on stool do arithmetic for stockbroker than to hing at youth doe not know think envied youth yet so often doe one contradict knew very soon that did not envy of thing after still went on making soul stirring discovery propose to do so until very end of life when will make most soul stirring discovery of be death to envy fact of having just discovered magic of swinburne spring song must be exactly same a envying appetite of somebody who have just come down to breakfast when be half way through egg bacon be delicious fact that have eaten make impossible to wish for again must make only delighted that other people keep coming down to breakfast till end of life will do unless world come to end first thank god will find egg bacon delicious too hungry fresh in morning of life be becoming slightly too active in mind for proper observance of sunday morning given of course that have chosen not to go to church for real attitude be state of tranquil bemusedness be too late to stop now what in fact did want did want to be twenty again go through day hour of fifteen year once more yes did if world must be turned back for fifteen year must gladly take place there go through good bad together just a have happened must encore delightful song in fact be content that must be sung again not song of course if one must start again at age of twenty ten for matter live over again with knowledge infinitesimal a be that one have gained now imagine that vast majority of world must put hand of clock back on thousand of occasion on one have acted stupidly unkindly evilly have probably suffered for without delay for be mercifully ordained that have not long to wait before punishment begin especially if have be foolish must now do differently remembering that did not pay to put thing at lowest to be ass knave apart from that must have same beautiful flawless day again when so can not think beneficent power have somehow come very close to surroundings by neighbourhood have given series again again repeated of hour in have be unable to imagine anything better than what have got have wanted with eager happiness that wanting give have obtained before leanness of soul have entered have wanted again have have happiness not content since implies end of wanting content dwells not in present only looked forward have idea whether on whole be happier than average of other people since there be thermometer yet invented that can register do know must choose to go back live over again a have be with little experience little knowledge must inevitably come with year whether one be stupid not imagine that everybody must choose to go back wish to state distinctly must go back without suppose be that made just now feel envied leg dont do really for reason supposing that what must choose because really must be given what then must arrive again eventually in mere measure of year at point where be now different better worse must like to go back because have be such fun there be better than ahead of be completely convinced there be a many if not more think there be more entrancing discovery from middle age a there have be from youth be convinced again that if one happens to live to be old there will be a many more after to re read life again must be like re reading first volume of absorbing book one have revelled in first volume naturally want to revel again what be going to happen there be nothing that interest so much a to day even in quiet domestic life of ours there be hundred thread leading out into unknown country of if one life one will follow up big tiny alike be so stupendous if to take forward view must see in mirror now what where people few of doubt friend who really matter must be in year time how must seize magic reflector gaze into incomparable a have be romance of life up till now be known to to peep into second volume sun in full blaze of leg have laid peeped over top of elm in shade of have seated not being leggish shifted chair again to consider point be question of scale be here concerned though scale seems to to be unreal one if happened to be emperor of russia magic mirror be given must look eagerly out for own figure see if still wore crown must scrutinize face of around to see if war hell hag of revolution have be shrieking through illimitable country interest be not soul stirring to anyhow not of european importance so must look to see who sat on lawn year hence must ask for short survey of embassy at paris to see if leg be attached must visit dozen house so if be allowed to put clock back fifteen year must have to wait longer for so must reconsider choice be afraid must reverse must be understood that choose not to be twenty again merely because will take longer to be forty fifty want second volume so much here helen voice broke in have come back from church have seated on grass believe that half of what appeared to be soliloquy be actually spoken to be wonderfully patient be youth want said have got till cease to want be only people who dont care about grow old be there more than be wanting to go on learning that keep one young dreadful misgiving came over be dreaming said did tell other day showed sign of wishing to teach laughed be quite true will tell when cease to wish to learn will say quite quite clearly took off hat speared absently with pin have awful sermon said about grim seriousness of life opportunity will never come back doe seem to be most absolute waste of time to give thought to shant go to church next sunday dont feel fortified by thought like much better for to know that must put clock back live over again about looking forward oh jack think shouldnt look in magic mirror if have chance what if one saw alone one must live in dread afterwards what if saw cradle in room said looked up at quickly then put out hand for to pull up perhaps must look in mirror said poor leg a have said left by very early train next morning helen moved by sudden violent attack of vague duty went with access be quite indeterminate thought merely that one ought to get back to town early on monday so a to have whole day there instead of splitting up personally followed reasoning example intended to spend day in dignified inaction in country not split up by going to town till after dinner to owner of motor car train appears degraded sort of business greatly daring meant to start about nine in evening be monarch of road for when there be other traffic car becomes chariot of triumph helen may remark love motor when doe not want to go anywhere particular when doe take train think in fact that be proposal that must drive up together after dinner be direct parent of sense of duty so when came down at not unreasonable hour of nine to breakfast found have house to myself be not in least ashamed of confession found that prospect of absolutely solitary day be quite to mind believe to be unsociable morose now then confess that like day in see nobody be not that one be busy want to get through one work for on contrary when have great deal to do hugely desire presence conversation of friend in interval of doing occasionally be very good thing to chew ruminate to be surrounded by quiet green thing of earth give best without waking corresponding instinct to exchange idea to give something of yours to meet theirs for intercourse with one fellow men especially with one friend be like rapid interchange of present everybody everybody at least who have smallest sense of sociability search in mind for little thing may be there give friend while friend accepting give something back from that can not call effort since be so completely spontaneous on side be well to be free occasionally to lie so to speak under pelting rain of life be ever poured out from voiceless eloquent bright eyed happiness of nature to make plan to contemplate contingency to drop sort of fencing rapier that wield when be with fellow men lie like log with one eye open may be be rained upon by thing live be clothed nourished without toil spinning be aware that great strenuists from mr roosevelt downwards must hold up toil hardened hand at exclaiming mean be better now then to be cow than man precisely so cow be not nearly a inactive a man on occasion ought to be eat too long switch tail stamp foot long stupid bovine gaze be moderately correct at least have never detected shadow of intelligence in cow eye if there be man who occasionally becomes cow must be careful to get rid of must be cow too often be fatal if be cow for one day in six week think will find proportion be about right so day literally day sat when sitting became too fatiguing lay on lawn nothing happened that did not always happen be worth observing in purely bovine manner without intelligence little brown twig occasionally fell from elm once twice withered yellow leaf came spinning on own axis a if be screw of unseen steamer stag beetle walked slowly down from wooden paling came ten yard across lawn stopped there about hour must think doing nothing then turned went back on to paling again robin took about same length of time to make up mind be quite harmless eventually pecked at bootlace be undone took enormous time to decide with head cocked sideways whether tasted nice not eventually settled did not for did not peck again then jackdaw sat on one of pole of tennis net said jarck seventeen time after began to count began to say eighteenth time stopped in middle ate incautious earwig be almost too exciting

to face on blocked staircase in drawing room unwillingly silent while somebody sang now take same childlike pleasure in long day of solitude may take solitude in pair in company with friend who for time being be friend at bitter be to be hoped disappointed golfer may lie out day in heather with silent stalker a have be fortunate lot for last ten day may spend long hour with sandwich fishing rod gillie in angling over coffee coloured stream windswept loch oldest inhabitant never remember anything like summer be bad evidence because memory be probably very defective owing to age what be more convincing younger people whose memory be le impaired never remember anything like so there have be little of coffee coloured stream for personally instead long quiet day by wonderful loch supposed to hold trout of fabulous dimension a far a can make out nobody have ever caught though one agrees that be there then came wonderful day with more than trout wonder in came up here to remote lodge alone for trio of usually go own way in holiday time leg in case have to go to germany to learn classic guttural tongue helen always make visiting arrangement independently of other unless be bidden to house to want to go stand to reason so seemed to that husband wife probably have same friend be a absurd for to stay at house because host be great friend of mine a be for to stay at house because hostess be great friend of hers coincidence sometimes happen in go together otherwise make own arrangement can not bear of friend find almost impossible to tolerate of mine with shout of laughter agree to differ then in september october trio will come together again will talk at once describing simultaneously while nobody listens delightful adventure started from lodge that morning after early breakfast gillie having already gone on with lunch what hoped must be apparatus of death for first time during last week be soft cloudy morning with warm wind from south west sufficient even in cup of hill where lodge stand to set tree tossing branch to strip red ripe rowanberry from stalk upon unsheltered top then where lay dark coloured loch with fabled inhabitant there must be ripple enough for fishing purpose walked unencumbered for field glass always carry for nothing during period of waiting in half hour follows sandwich be so fascinating a to spy out busy animal life on empty moor find three four mile away two three little human speck moving very gently up hillside after deer sitting there patiently till untoward affair suspicious hind foul wind be lulled into inactivity first have mile of pine wood to climb up steep slippery needle strewn path with bracken already yellowing on side making sea of russet green while from overhead in thick arching bough there came a be noise of aerial sea hiss of ripple on sandy shore a wind whistled through stiff springy foliage now then rabbit scuttled through fern once saw quite close at hand roe deer with flicking ear startled eye that a caught sight of gave one shy look of woodland then galloped off cutting way through tall bracken path sometimes led by side of stream came out of loch to be bound dryness of summer have hushed voice trickled down way be wont to prance along in spring here there tree of tamer woodland beech stripling elm grew among primeval fir looked a if have wandered here by mistake have strayed member of later civilization into settlement peopled by of older world a walked something of same feeling of strangeness of having gone back to earlier age of world came over also like lost beech there be none of kind here felt though in immeasurably greater degree what one feel when one stand in valley of tomb of egyptian king round here be thing far more ancient than ons before pharaoh oppressed child of promise there stood here on hillside ancestor in direct line of woodland knowledge of dawn of world when be still little time since god have bidden green thing to live upon earth have be transmitted to citizen of hillside to time have be little thing thousand age be a yesterday a ascended farther more remotely into heart of wood sort of eager tremor desire to see that knew be there must be so overpowering in immensity began to grow on wild silent life bubbled hummed round eye watched from beneath fern looked down on from over arching fan of pine ear be pricked at footstep strange wild smile broadened into laugh at intruder at child of immeasurably later age sometimes seemed to a if ancient consciousness of wood be scornful contemptuous so quickened pace longed to get out of dark room at other moment truer one knew better knowing that too be of manifestation of life piece of pine wood brother of bracken there be myth grew so close to heart of thing a story of pan

gain strength wing expansion completeness when sun of have seen reflection image be revealed be to see pan killed mortal body of psyche soul when saw on hill top by river heard note of reed float down to soul who have burst flimsy barrier of death into life join in music day make more compelling drop by drop ocean of life made up of life have be rise in bowl in god dip hand touch drop wood in front have grown thin be nearly out on open heather of hill just here path crossed stream bed great grey cliff of rock be above in pattern of lichen have found crevice for root pine tree waved solemnly overhead miracle of running water perhaps greatest miracle of chuckled eddied a slid into brown pool quite seriously waited to see pan fern must be pushed aside merry face must smile at for pan though kill be kind must put pipe to lip world a have hitherto seen must swim away from just before put pipe to mouth hope will say yes begin be ready will stop ear shut eye to hope not fern waved only water ran be going fishing suppose have not gone more than hundred yard after pause when execrable event occurred seemed a if dreadful celestial housemaid suddenly woke up went on with work shut window be to say wind dropped began to dust dusted cloud away in ten minute there be not one left from horizon to horizon there be sky positively egyptian abominable sun shone with hooligan ferocity be going fishing said what must not say with such extraordinary distinctness emphasis rapidly took out field glass swept untenanted field of heather to see that there be one within mile two expect roe deer heard sandy be waiting for at near end of loch when arrived there quarter of hour afterwards scotchman be never cynical must otherwise have suspected of cynicism when saw that have be at pain to set up rod be soaking length of gut brilliance of sun from polished untarnished field of water be thing to make eye dazzle so be cynical in turn from pure cynicism nothing else at put on for sake of curious astonishing fly with green body bound with silver zulu be shade too cynical to go out in boat for think sandy must have seen through a be impossible that fish must rise at anything in state of affair fished from shore fishing at be idiotic proceeding so incredible happened wish to call attention to incredibility of since happens to be true here be then on still windless morning with blazing sun overhead looking glass loch in be supposed to be monstrous fish whose shyness apparently increased in ratio to weight for nobody have ever seen before have only heard about second hand like ghost story dozen cast carried out convenient length of line fell so appeared to on glassy surface of water like cane of angry schoolmaster resonant cruel then at end of cane where zulu be there came boil just underneath looking glass rod bent reel screamed for one moment knew so thought for boil came just a be preparing to cast again that have hooked stalwart weed perhaps snag of tree trunk then knew have hooked fish be clearly insane to have taken fly at what mattered be that be large lunatic thought knew also that be first act of what must turn out to be tragedy tragedy be not for again for sake of curious will give weight turned scale at five pound six hour later so imagine be about five half when came out of water with zulu in mouth be mad turned fierce bedlamite eye on dare say be more impatient than true fisherman when have cast fly upon water for three hour without hint of rise sit down feel incumbent on to rise again unless condition change so when at about two oclock nothing further have broken surface of loch except cane of schoolmaster felt after eating sandwich be not unlikely without incurring contempt of sandy to prolong interval wanted also after mi tryst with pan that morning vaguely also after day of bovine observance of nature have spent week two ago in garden at home to sit up take notice instead of nirvanic contemplation wanted to focus surrounded not to see stag beetle advance ten yard then go back to place advanced from to see activity of to be alert to collect not to be lazy to soak yes be wonderful day almost immediately spied two little human figure on adjoining forest creeping creeping up steep brae mile below saw pony moved so slowly that be only possible to see moved at because passed out of field of glass deer must not find then after watching for ten minute more saw stopped stealthy movement went on then came sharp crack of rifle before report reached have jumped up ran into hollow of hill where lost be like being at sea having news twitched out from receiver of marconi apparatus hardly have that drama be played to curtain when started call of startled grouse come back come back come back sounded close at hand be followed by yet sandy have remained by edge of loch when climbed hillock for lunch since then have be very quiet so must not imagine what have caused commotion on hill a stalker be not on beat at to day must account in fact for movement of human being must have disturbed grouse for mile two then looked up to enormous sky saw above close so must see outspread feather of wing be golden eagle a watched saw be not vaguely circling looking out for prey employed in stalk even a on other side of valley ten minute ago have watched stalk be sweeping wide circle of moor driving up towards gully of hill behind fowl of mountain flying in low ever narrowing semicircle so that must seem to terrified grouse black game huge winged danger threatened from quarter that yet still must not guess what plan be when have driven there then saw straight down from grey crag of cliff rose on west of gully into have driven bird there dropped mate savage hungry seeking meat from god aha grand mistress eagle be dinner time merrily well have old cock grouse lived in heather lying warm in sun filling with good thing of moorland to day pan sends to table in swift hissing down rush of wing hears pipe pan will play for too day grey film will cover over fierce yellow eye be wont undazzled to behold sun in strength strong hooked beak gasped for one breath more of aromatic moorland air will close be hungry more crooked horny talon will relax next year maybe will find whitened bone on hillside perhaps crumpled up under feather eagle feather will not be so foolish a to say have found for do imagine that be there be of that life spirit have be blown out like candle know better than for indeed there be other explanation possible of incessant war death murder butchery in nature fair hand be steeped stained except by one supposition that spirit of bird beast escape at moment of death from splendid sunlit prison of beautiful world have bright eyed hour for bar otherwise world becomes mere intolerable shamble viler than chicago at rate can not believe otherwise must sceptical reader at point ask to sketch out for subsequent movement of wasp have just squashed in tongs trout have just landed hasten to assure have not slightest idea about that doe not invalidate explanation in least disturb complete belief in know what weather will be day year make manner of doubt that there will be weather of kind only insist that with tongs with zulu fly can not destroy life one can not even destroy matter how much le then lord master of matter think have never be in house where absurd gaiety gaiety of friend of health of outdoor spirit be so rampant a here whose house be who be leader of ludicrous be a may have guessed who in june have asked to come here for last time that evening when got home found sitting out in garden enjoying last half hour of sunset beckoned to across lawn true said have caught original trout have gone mad from old age riotous living came to fly when sun be brightest wind be dead wish wouldnt use such beautiful language said how much doe weigh about ton have gone to be weighed now anything else not fin no more bite a somebody said last night chattered with rage did what have be thinking about asked pan chiefly to be honest think have thought about fish most pan next turned rather slowly on long wicker tired aching body for moment usurping use of eye ah dont let talk said be tired suffering at laughed more reason for thinking about something le inferior than one own health said what coward be nowadays why forebear in elizabeth time used to go smiling to rack for sake of small difference of dogma snivel when have opportunity of showing by contempt for pain truth of thing matter much more if bravery in abstract cheerfulness be not worth being brave cheerful for dont know what be in case what conclusion did come to about pan oddly enough have be thinking of too let compare note see if mean same person told more le have already written down on subject at end nodded at with quick eager gesture be so characteristic of hurrah said have guessed same so perhaps guess be right put to myself rather more personally though sound conceited so much more vividly than be only natural know pan concern much more immediately than concern hope image of suggested to appeal to more than figure of fern being pushed aside hand with pipe in being raised to smiling lip listen sun have dropped behind big tree to west of lawn leaving in shadow though still shone on hill to east of house evening be coming without chill whisper of autumn in in northern latitude night be short in august be a if already saw dawn jim child said friend be shipwrecked so must seem to anyone who did not understand on little rock surrounded by infinite sea one alive in world be there too a matter of fact friend somehow be so big to stranger acquaintance so small in comparison that really be seen by be own immediate circle huge thumping sea surround rock for occult reason have to sit exactly where be while wave rush up moment sweep somebody away cant move place go higher up on rock have to sit look at big wave poor shipwrecked people so man who doe not understand must say know that wave next will wash off be ignorant view of situation most pessimistic so will answer at once even if be right what then supposing be shipwrecked round be howling sea of death must not be much better until wave swept off to make best of to talk laugh be pleasant with friend instead of looking with terror stricken eye at hungry sea how much nicer even for ourselves to be amused talk little while instead of being frightened how much nicer for friend when be swept off a certainly will be to know that before be swept off be moderately cheerful picked up bit of seaweed played with shell say nothing of moral aspect of because if once bring in there be question more about matter since in one case be brave in other merely cowardly given that be shipwrecked that sea of hungry death surround will soon pick off how much better on lowest possible view of affair to play about to be kind gentle even if to morrow there will be end of utterly for ever yes be using beautiful language too be talking of beautiful thing well view be silliest most incomprehensible possible how did get on absurd rock if only death surround did come from death into life be impossible since scientifically cant produce life out of dead thing did ship founder on sea of death did swim to shore where will live until wave sweep off again be possible then what be ship on once be passenger for time anyhow until foundered if did founder rode over wave be serious question there be only one answer to ship must have be life in form image doe not seem convincing doe what be left then only that sea surround on little rock be not death at life just a day without doubt wave will sweep off rock again so there be doubt that once wave of sea put on rock where now be if there be wreck at be land wreck wreck put on shore from great sea of life have be washed up for little moment on to little rock soon will be received back into life again in interval though in new sense be wrecked how interesting be rock how full of dear people pink shell divine thing of sea life not death cast up round nourishes by spent water of wave how utterly idiotic must be not to collect eagerly little bit for when go back into life will see forest from come sapphire cave in really dwell little bit of life grouse that eagle ate be cast up close to to day will particularly ask when wave take off again where came from will go see place certainly will see mistress come back courage huge natural courage like absolutely unassumed absolutely instinctive may have one of two effect on beholder of may make weep for admiration of may make laugh out of joyousness of heart for same admiration at least laughed oh be sure to show place when come said be certain that mistress eagle will have nice house have said there be many mansion looked at in silence moment be not so certain of thing when first knew be so soon to see said at first though be never exactly frightened be dazed stunned saw nothing clearly must use image for say day passed a one see landscape pas through railway carriage window be blurred by rain must see nothing clearly be dim rain streaked then without conscious effort on part except perhaps little exercise of patience passed train out of scud again soon glass cleared saw green valley sunny hillside just a have always be again paused have not told anything of importance yet said have said be really quite obvious now think of pan a smiling face peep from fern presence assures suffering thing that be kind when pipe to even though sound mean death surely be more than sort of pagan mythical aspect of always think that suffers too pain seems to inflict be only reflection of pain in own universal heart although still smile be from cross that smile at september season of mist mellow fruitfulness have indeed be close bosom friend of maturing sun for last three day before leg went back to crammer in town helen spent prostrated existence heat that in july invigorates be utterly intolerable if occurs at end of september just a crisp winter day must be so welcome in january descending to earth a usually doe in june produce merely amazed horror at weather probably cold superficial view that suffer because be improperly clad for climatic surprise view helen put forward other night be beside point during day if be improperly clad be only because have so little on in fact only ten minute before

to what be german wife make unable to like wife make incredible quantity of jam again be innocent pursuit charlotte daughter talk german to leg who be more like goethe whole family in fact a may have be already perceived appear to to be simply intolerable attachment also have already led to equivocation on part of leg pretend that talk to charlotte because be so good for german know that be not so know be not so think know that know be not so really look at moment unless marry other there will be broken at rate cracked heart only hope will not be leg dont care least what happens to charlotte heart may however be only flirtation in case there probably will not even be crack leg will wake up one morning after handling precious withered flower will wonder what on earth ever meant to throw in fire charlotte will do something equally desperate be hope fear be that be falling in love with other narrative must be understood be gist of what have be saying fragmentarily to helen considers cynical view alarm since hold creed that cynic be properly irretrievably damned to night leg went to bed early with dishevelled hair wakeful eye gale of sigh came upstairs to talk to helen about while brushed hair be quite ridiculous about said because happen not to like amp have agreed on abbreviation think that be unlovable leg have proved contrary besides what on earth doe name matter if be

egypt on occasion bray of donkey be to trumpet of seraphin be dreadful experience since implied being out of touch with life must be glad to know if there be anything world hold be more enraptured than sense of being lost with one other person to feel world swim away be dissolved so that comrade be with be quite alone to feel that there be existence except existence of who be lost with be helen hair thats world side there wonder lover understood everyone saw helen hair best be when glide from out cross step two of dubious moonshine come out on other side never must quote correctly point be that beloved have face face turn to lover one else see be blind to keats even moment ago thought that one must see helen hair now let see wave of sunlit sea not breaking unless break be where put hand inch above thanks dear said soon brush much better than maid now will talk for five minute then must go to bed have hideous accumulation of various fag end of work to do at end of five minute might be ten went downstairs again to begin at rate dreadful patchwork of odds end be still be almost sorry to observe only just eleven since have with eye open deliberately firmly wasted hour of day uneasy conscience told that have better if be to have ease craved not think of leaving chair for couple of hour at least argued point with lost minute for told that be extremely bad for to work at night that took more out of one than work in day work done under circumstance be never good work doctor recommended one never to work at night go peacefully to bed before evening fever might be set in then there ensued short spirited dialogue most sensible said conscience give word that will get up at six to morrow then work for two hour before breakfast have leave to go to bed now shant wake at six said servant have gone to bed will wake said conscience conscience be quite capable of odious feat cant work before breakfast said make feel must not think of word for moment oh yes faint well feel faint then said conscience must sooner not implies weakness of heart not to do work implies weakness of character shut up said let begin then must swear that conscience gave self satisfied chuckle for hour waded wearily knee deep only so to speak in work like man who want to swim have to trudge out over level sand most people fancy even laziest of like working when get up to neck better even out of depth in wading be weary work worst of be that fact have to wade so far be entirely own fault for whole of last week have never taken trouble to finish up one job now there waited for several bill to pay since few morning ago have sat down to pay bill have paid except two three several letter to write of have to begin either falsely ie have just found letter of th apologetically ie havent answered letter before because then there be half corrected proof of unfinished article badly written originally what be more written without conviction be on subject did not particularly interest have only written because misguided editor of magazine have offered for very much wished to buy seal top spoon cost exactly that sum knew perfectly well have right to buy so saying to myself must write article must not otherwise have done have bought here be dismal price have to pay for namely that wretched article be piece of literary dishonesty have to fudge vamp over trying to conceal nakedness of land by ornamental expression be brought home to now be bad cheap stuff though most of be continually turning out bad cheap stuff not knowing be bad cheap such manufacture become criminal when do know a long a work be honest from workman point of view be only misfortune when doe not know valuelessness when doe know valuelessness sin by intention be forger be one by forgery have bought seal top be not thought that when tacitly agreed to work for two hour to night tiresome conscience must put head under wing leave alone found now that be broad awake again chirping like canary be going to do chirped be going to send out rotten forgery everybody who know anything will detect be going to tear up be left with purchase that know cant really afford remember that must get new dining room carpet too promised helen must chirp chirp chirp be bound to say that enraged whats use of making row said conscience who have to settle havent slightest idea said conscience fault wouldnt listen to when told that have right to accept for dreadful article didnt say so loud then said heard right said conscience hardly heard said spoke so indistinctly yes did hear chirped with sort of devilish cheerfulness knew quite well what meant now suffer for hurrah wonder if be cursed in matter of conscience beyond majority of mankind often often will swear to in house of lord if necessary conscience be hardly audible at at time when do anything ought not to do omit to do anything ought to continue simile of canary really fit case when actual choice come be a if canary have thick green baize cover round cage only hoarse muffled note reach very often indeed be sorry to say dont attend to say be only cat in consequence do what must not then moment be done baize cover be whisked off infernal cheerful chirping so sound succeeds to wrong choice weak omission burden of chirping be always same told so told so now be in mess be going to do now chirp chirp chirp hurricane of dry deafening note follows sat there with column of stupid twaddle in hand conscience watched with bright bird like eye much a like bird hate eye because remind of conscience be beady absolutely unsympathetic frightfully quick to see without particle of pity in conscience never pity one at be foe be of man household always gloat over one mistake thing be more than mistake only say here come master with whip new lash see time what thin shirt have got on when whipping be over doe conscience sympathize told so told so say there be soothing ointment of kind in house ate up wasnt that beautiful new lash well tore dreadful nonsense up wrote apologetic letter be getting quite good at to morrow be what make conscience mad will tell helen about telling be not pleasant never be a soon a helen know conscience have simply to retire doe not understand why suddenly becomes so unimportant give fit of impotent rage do quite understand though be nearer to explanation than conscience be understands at least suppose so else must not be able to put green baize cover on again then what with apologetic letter drawing of two three cheque stupid attempt in matter of dishonest article to produce something out of nothing by covering up nothingness by more ornamental expression eventual destruction of found that two hour be gone have kept promise to idiotic canary have ceased chirping from experience when told be going to confess to helen night be intensely hot through long open window of room in have be working breeze entered though september have quarter more of course to run be like sultry july midnight portending storm for when went out to take night breath sky be thickly overcast so that direct ray of moonlight of starshine came earthwards serrated outline of elm at end of lawn be scarce distinguishable against scape of cloud low land of water meadow be blanketed in mist be only just visible by whiteness against black blot of hill behind fifi who have very sensibly decided to sleep on veranda did not stir when came out though heard instinctive thump of short tail on tile natural politeness of dear dog though really must not stand on ceremony with to length of getting up so maliciously be afraid since thought slightly cavalier conduct said pus though there be pus of sort a far a be aware malice be again thwarted for fifi just tapped again with tail in courteous recognition of stale old joke just to show that appreciated intention made not smallest further effort towards activity so be half asleep world dear blessed world be so full of merriness simple innocent pleasure despite fulmination of fashionable priest be quite asleep not stirring scarcely breathing just sleeping sleeping be not yet hour when just before hold of night begin to tremble be weakened in sky living thing wake for moment mysterious moment when sheep take bite of grass cow twitch grave ear horse stand up for minute before settle down to light morning sleep dissolve with day when even indoors if sleep with dog in room happen to be awake will hear stretching of limb on bed on carpet long sigh breathed into blanket plant flower so truly believe feel same thing though there may be wind perceptible to if be abroad a sometimes be at hour will hear just at moment when cattle move sheep take bite of grass stir go through tree hushed whisper lisp in flower bed at moment too need not credit though be absolutely true though have rained night till then will rain thereafter steadily soakingly till morning rain cease a suddenly a if tap be turned off time again have tested that a have said that mysterious moment be not due yet be still two hour short of everything be still asleep even in last minute two fifi have fallen fast asleep too after have sat down in wicker chair on veranda for when called there be tap of response to night too sleep of world seemed to feeling a one doe by sixth sense still exists dormant in be most awake at night to be extraordinarily deep be sleep of world be very tired with long hot summer there seemed pulse stirring in at a may find stir in light sleep in nature indulges in june still more in dark wet night of spring when secret boiling up of life begin again from hidden root to budding tendril so that if lay ear to trunk of tree seems that effervescence of young year be audible sings within even a telegraph pole be resonant with wind hum in wire must hear when rose walked across lawn even though dew be heavy on grass hiss of startled worm withdrawing from approaching footfall black too lifeless be oblong of house except where light burned in room in have be trying to be long herbaceous hedge be black lawn be black helen window leg be black went back to seat have just left lit cigarette meaning to go upstairs to bed when have smoked fifi still lay motionless though generally excursion into garden at time of day night set scampering then quite suddenly quite unexpectedly for nothing be further from thought became aware that though physical world be asleep there be enormous stir activity going on in occult world surround permeates yet be perhaps wrong expression for same activity stir always go on in unsleeping realm must express more accurately by saying that part of be able to perceive be suddenly quickened be possible of course since confess to being able to go to sleep whenever choose often without delay when at moment fell asleep whether fell asleep not doe not make slightest difference for there be clearly part of brain awake made eye think that saw ear think that heard that immediately followed a far a be aware in case sat down again in rather creaky basket chair lit cigarette match with lit threw on to gravel path in front of since required further proceeded to burn prosperously by light must see fifi with nose between paw saw also that shoe lace be untied then heard name called from garden in voice be perfectly familiar to though for moment must not say so elusive be ear whose voice be that called be not helen be not leg be not then remembered whose voice be called by name once only in voice have said be from cross that smile at think be frightened simply for purely personal reason to there be nothing to be frightened at match still burned on gravel path so short have be measurement of in world of time must still see fifis nose buried between paw then raised looked out into garden with terrified scrutinizing eye focussing on something invisible to gave one long howl there be moon be at something else howled then confess a if bomb have burst within terror flooded whole mind submerging sprang up simultaneously heard sort of strangled scream from room above scurry of unshod foot overhead next moment sound of opening door came to ear quick stumbling tread on stair ran indoors reached door leading from room into hall just a handle be seized shaken by someone on other side of leg burst into room hair tumbled erect face wearing such mask of terror that for moment recognized only because must be who be that in garden said someone in white who looked up at window fifi howled at must never do nerve be most infectious thing in world unless took step there must knew be standing here two babbling lunatic be dozing in veranda said fifi woke by howling woke too leg dont be as pull together if there have be anything must have seen leg be a white a sheet whiteness somehow showed through freckled sun tanned skin be swaying to fro on foot a if must fall put arm around deposited in chair then poured out wineglassful of neat whisky dont speak word till have drunk that said then will count ten slowly then may speak fifi have followed in sat close to door whimpering with heart in mouth perspiring forehead went across to window a counted shut locked pulled down blind nine ten said little colour have begun to come back to leg face have drunk whisky beverage detested like water frozen fear of eye be le biting then a suddenly a have come on terror left whatever be that have heard whatever be that leg have seen fifi perceived there be nothing to terrify besides within now that cowardly disorder of nerve have passed believed knew what be that have made presence so strangely perceived by mortal suffering of dear friend be over already be ashamed of having told leg have be asleep have seen heard anything leg lied just now said heard name called from garden in margarets voice mean be dead asked gently last account have be better thought im sure be then for moment like sudden squall white terror passed over leg face again be not saw said hoarsely be death thought have come for fifi saw too sat down on arm of chair yes old boy said think that fifi saw manifestation of what heard there be nothing to be frightened at how be be at window have gone to bed hour ago know couldnt sleep so got up sat by window sat there for time after by degree leg recovered from collapse soon instead of terror mere sleepiness invaded face once

be record of telegram came out to one morning in late september showed leg after abandoned game went to house may have more for yet corner hoop more mean than memory of have spoken joy sorrow may be so keen so poignant on day yet hid behind veil of future when will be looking at till day of death will never again be seen by mortal eye without rousing immortal imperishable memory be thus in manner antimaterialistic so to speak that men material thing be woven into psychical web of life so almost before eye have seen have sent message of secret significance to brain everywhere wherever look tangle of subtle thread be spread even a on summer dawn myriad spinning of gossamer make network on grass so that be crossed intertwined with woof of others there be bank where lay one hot july day doing nothing thinking nothing just lapped in tide of living thing have gone home that bank hour passed there be part of now even a feel that be part of have to look at now to bask again in absorbing stupor of midsummer there in blade of grass shadowed turf be written doing for day bank hold in kind safe keeping so that when god inquires of have done with day that gave bank will be able to answer for doe tell secret to croquet hoop hold to clematis on day be heaven full of purple star spread over trellis there be nothing in treasure of summer so beautiful so triumphant a what to now be memory of clematis memory of friendship be over at least be looking at when know that somebody have loved trusted be trustworthy lovable be a if friend have pushed back carpet from board of room where have so often be merry intimate together showed with sort of secret hideous glee that sewer flowed beneath floor poor clematis be sick at heart thin bare stalk shiver mournfully a golden afternoon begin to turn little grey with chill wind of evening ah if only have said be sorry if only have said that knew be wrong that flesh be weak if only have even contemplated step to extent undoes wrong have be done think clematis must have shed single one of purple star of saint sinner do dreadful thing memory of be sufficient to make long to sink into earth for shame only smiled behind hand with whispered gusto told about licking chop of memory be that matter that corner of garden have delayed long be already getting dark when have gathered up fingered gossamer thread lay so thickly down border led to gate from descend step of rose garden there be so many message there bare stalk of phlox campanula oriental poppy hollyhock japanese anemone iris have something to say memory be little vague faint dim even a odour of phlox be tall resplendent like hollyhock be vivid a poppy then went through gate of rose garden stood there there be nothing there rose tree there be one there helen so tale of garden be told by time be finished dusk have begun to deepen cheerful beckoning light be gleaming from house be time to go in to take up with what love alacrity pleasant hour of present again for be not ever good to linger too long over memory for however short time to indulge in regret unless regret be to be built into fabric of present making stronger more courageous other regret other regarding of past say be past be irretrievably done be enervating poisonous paralyzes energy indeed be better not to be sorry at for unwise unkind mistaken thing have done if sorrow tends to unfit for doing better in future just a crossed lawn going towards house memory started up out of dusk so clearly that almost thought that heard name called from garden almost expected when got indoors to hear again sound of shuffling unshod foot on stair memory of mysterious midnight hour though have not spoken of again be seldom out of thought doe not sit so to speak in front row in dimness that lie at back of one mind out of come vague vapour be if have body enough eventually condensed into thought just a out of thought be coined speech action there in dark kitchen of mind know that thought of night have ever be simmering on fire something within be not content with fact that even at moment that voice cried from garden at moment when leg saw white face smiling at dear soul passed to other side there be more to come yet else here be vapour taking shape of thought at last else why did leg who scarcely knew receive that warning echo of memory of night strangely also have ever come back to know more about now than did next morning when asked if have be sitting up late talking have told helen about have told too for there be nothing so wild fantastical must not tell that there be uneasy guest sitting at hearth who stay in shadow so can not see face answered with serenity be almost reassuring saying that if something more be coming there be still whatever be nothing to fear if otherwise uneasy guest be moonshine of imagination seems to cover whole ground fact be that be afraid of fear thing for be idle to try to find excuse be leaving quite early to morrow morning so when entered house that evening after tour of garden have definitely finished with country for week to come so too have helen leg for tea have already gone into drawing room even a locked garden door behind heard sudden gust of wind come shake pane a if calm golden day have be sent just for that moment have finished with wind overdue kindly waiting for began to drive cloud flock out of south west be coming of rain long delayed even while sat at tea sheet of be flung with sudden wild tattoo against pane there hissed on to log of open hearth few stray drop leg paused with mouth full of crumpet make feel twice a comfortable a be before said must be so beastly out of door leg have just uttered thoroughly lucretian sentiment when door opened mr holmes be announced have refrained from mentioning mr holmes before because expected must come in about now big with purpose be kind little gentleman about forty five year old who life with sister doe not do anything whatever be generally known a bun hander because tea party have ever be known to take place for mile round at mr holmes be not handing refreshment to lady be strength forte weakness be just a amiable though perhaps hardly so useful for weakness be

maintains that come to see for personally can behave beautifully when mr holmes find helen alone be rather nervous if leg happens to be in room for be quite unable to take eye off mr holmes stare at in sort of stupor of wonderment once be year ago now left room very suddenly choking muffled sound be heard from hall stamping of foot helen talked very loud to overscore trust mr holmes did not hear when leg be there be afraid be sort of nightmare that will be overtaken too with helpless giggling if begin helen will go off can imagine way of satisfactorily terminating interview because if once began laughing at mr holmes see how must ever stop appearance voice conversation be quite inimitable be small inclined to stoutness have fierce little moustache so much on end that look a if have just seen ghost not long ago have teeth to speak of now be a dazzling continuous a mr wordsworth said a star shine have rather thin brown hair will swear used to be streaked with grey be so no longer wear three ring with stone in one be emerald so magnificent that be almost impossible to believe in be dressed in very height zenith of provincial fashion must no more be seen in shabby clothes than must be seen without stay yes maintain even helen who be perfect st thomas about for long have admitted that occasional creak proceed from mr holmes person for be difficult to offer other explanation be

cork tipped cigarette lady size then go home to lunch after lunch drive with sister in hired fly else if be very fine go round lady golf link be good deal shorter than men have tea at club sits there

window shut door in town hall have be put up in memory of something be entertained to luncheon afterwards by corporation on eye opening occasion helen be sent in before wife of younger son of baronet in consequence wife of younger son of baronet cut afterwards a with knife yet knife be word for averted eye be more like scimitar before assembled company when helen went to shake hand with after lunch cut turned from revolving on own axis like eternal star upon very properly after two day heated discussion great demand for debrett public opinion sided with wife of younger son of baronet on ground that helen took husband rank in case happened to be none at what made worse be that duchess who must have known better being old friend of helen came to tea with afterwards in motor car covered with coronet for world to see may imagine that fat be in fire after helen have idea why wife of baronet younger son have cut perhaps might never have known have not mr holmes dropped in only yesterday told adding that be sure must clear up be not at home when interview took place when entered room afternoon after having called only yesterday be certain that must have come on subject have book in pocket made unusual bulge leg be steeped in wide eyed contemplation a mr holmes have tea from time to time glanced at saw that corner of mouth be faintly twitching eye travelled from mr holmes face to jewelled hand lingered about clothes came back loverlike to face in few minute have learned about everybody how lord lieutenant of county have driven through in motor not daimler new panhard yesterday afternoon stopping only at fishmonger taking london road afterwards how there have be party at barrack last night at there be music not very good music mr holmes be afraid how bishop have not influenza at only bad cold how pine have be taken by hon alice accrington who have cork foot so sad rhinoceros have trodden on original one have ceased to be able to look at leg here heard give little whimper a dog doe when want door to be opened for helen time have be of impeccable behaviour have asked just right question appeared so genuinely interested that felt have never known before of what depth of hypocrisy be capable then mr holmes wealth of information began to grow thin even a star burn thin at daybreak knew that be going to dawn that true reason for came be going to break forth put down cup on tea table took cigarette suddenly creaked if can imagine sneeze cough spit strangled wheeze caused by fish bone in throat noise empty siphon of soda water make when press handle combined will faintly grasp what leg did effort to swallow whole of mixed convulsion be most praiseworthy though must think dangerous came to ear only a if someone have done mile away mr holmes be sure heard nothing time leg left room with handkerchief to mouth in manner of mourner in second coach at funeral there be sound outside soon after muffled tread overhead where be bedroom then for moment caught helen eye looked so inexpressibly grave nearly asked who be dead then dawn came mr holmes have high cackling voice bulgy volume in pocket be whitakers almanack must have come before said wanted to

be table of precedence saw eldest son of younger son of peer underlined look at next column said sister take rank of husband elder brother now see where younger son of baronet wife come far away below eldest son of younger son of peer in outer darkness below even member of fifth class of victorian order saw that obscure relationship emotion of various kind almost suffocated helen be justified before world be turn to cut wife of younger son of baronet if chose so talked very pleasantly for quarter of hour about movement of aristocracy then mr holmes rose to go cab be waiting helped on with very magnificent fur coat in hall in somewhat indistinct light seemed to be made of purest rabbit skin in dimness of landing above thought must see obscure shadow leaning over banister resembled leg hope after wife will take proper place said mr holmes of course everyone know duchess came here to tea lit cigarette heard banister tremble slightly a if from infinitesimal earthquake be so kind of to have taken so much trouble said firmly be nothing be sure need have further anxiety went back to drawing room helen face be buried in sofa cushion leg came downstairs in three jump so laughed till be time to dress for dinner occasionally seemed to be recovering then somebody said creak baronet fresh relapse took place pity poor soul who know mr holmes be so sad for sadder than lady with cork foot oh think of triumphant vindication of helen be wrong by way will last long long time have be campaign triumphantly concluded must not in least wonder if have bottle of champagne to night after time excitement will die away fading like golden sunset will settle down to ordinary life again read paper in morning go for little drive in afternoon have tea toast at club afterwards in spring panama hat will come out rich fur coat be put away will hand strawberry instead of bun iced coffee instead of tea perhaps play little croquet week have be great week for really have if want to understand gloriousness of mr holmes must take word for that nothing so engrossing have happened to for month december once happy family have suddenly returned to pit whence be digged be impossible to imagine more depressing spectacle than present dawn in faint flicker be beginning to shine on wreck occasionally for moment two though may be over sanguine helen can dimly imagine being happy again leg can not do yet be still midnight gloom with intelligent reader will scarcely need to be told that be influenza have blackened world like helen began leg followed within twenty four hour that somehow be relief to since feel did not give a if mattered where came from besides personally must rather catch from than anyone else leg have have worst visitation because after be quite certain have got persisted in attending last night of autumn opera season did not enjoy at of course by reason of splitting headache be really ill for day two be infinitely wiser a soon a nymph touched with fairy hand went firmly to bed turned face to wall like hezekiah stopped there till fever be over after five day tottered downstairs to find old old woman sitting by fire be helen think be most dreadful day ever remember told again again how ill looked until be goaded into sort of depressed frenzy said couldnt possibly look a ill a have beef tea in middle of morning to horror when be brought be brought not by raikes man who be a indispensable to house a be carburetter to motor car for wont run without by awful thing never saw before in answer to inquiry be told that raikes felt very ill have asked awful thing to bring beef tea instead of so sent back to raikes with thermometer that be to be so good a to put under tongue for one minute then return came back recording degree gave awful thing thermometer to wash instantly dropped on floor be of course broken into twenty million fragment remembered that though be worm be christian worm said never mind please tell raikes that be to go to bed instantly then picked up twenty million fragment cut severely said damn quite softly helen winced be merely intended to annoy succeeded admirably so there sat exactly like awful picture called le frileux in old man old woman sit apart under leafless tree ground be covered with dead leaf soon will die too be impossible to depict dreariness of morning outside sort of jaundiced day showed soupy mud flooded sloane street through motor bus once thought so fine splashed way few sordid people under umbrella bobbed by window a darkness increased man with long stick began to turn up lamp then instantly got rather lighter man not same one with long stick came turned down again upon egyptian darkness settled down over town must suppose that first man have caught influenza for never turned up more helen be not reading be sitting by fire looking mournfully at coal must not do at in interval of paroxysm of coughing asked how be leg morning worse said helen took up daily telegraph read list of people who be dead knew one of slightly then cut finger began to bleed again reminded of awful thing servant be so ridiculous tiresome said must think maid might have found time to bring up beef tea instead of dreadful girl dont know where get servant from barton went to bed yesterday with influenza said helen wheezily be very feverish worse than leg cant say why news made feel rather better so lit cigarette tasted exactly a if have be made of green weed grows on stagnant horse pond felt much worse again at once be quite sure temperature be going up must not have mournful satisfaction of knowing that be true because thermometer be broken finger continued to bleed blood be very bright red probably arterial yet be happening seemed impossible that thing be a desperate a thought made excellent determination to do something will disturb if play piano asked helen not least attempted to play etude symphoniques beginning with last variation by reason of sky scraping spirit of dont think played correct note at helen again to annoy made noise tiresome people make to show that wrong note get on highly sensitive nerve consists of whistling intake of breath though have only played dozen bar white note in treble be spotted with blood a if be jew piano be lintel of door on passover night be absurd to go on playing on blood boltered piano even if must play right note must not so again with laudable idea of doing something staggered upstairs brought down moistened towel proceeded to clean key struck note from time to time helen kept on wincing be that necessary asked at length yes because have bled over piano besides im cleaning with soft pedal down door be flung open awful thing appeared dinner said left door open went downstairs dinner in raikes indisposition be huddled on to table there be piece of moist fish under one cover there be ginger pudding under there be large potato under third under fourth rich red beef steak then despair descended on be cook ill too asked of awful thing yes sir who cooked rather didnt please sir did then quite suddenly for helen dawn began to break for little here be three quarter of establishment incapacitated awful thing be calmly doing everybodys work a well a own be that of housemaid helen cheered up at once please give fish said to look quite excellent helped largely sumptuously understood other at moment put thumping helping on to own plate helen greatly daring took greedy mouthful spoke to awful thing who be beginning to beam largely on delicious said to have idea must cook so beautifully neednt wait will ring must have help in at once will telephone to mr watkins agency asking for paused know be going to say cook housemaid awful thing smiled from ear to ear moment afterwards heard insane ringing of telephone oh couldnt send for cook just moment said helen when girl have left room be bursting with pride at having cooked if eat will be sick what be to do girl in enthusiasm have built fire three quarter of way up chimney though day be muggy warm beyond telling into heart of blaze stuffed large piece of fish burned with blue oily flame now ring said helen girl returned after long pause please m mr watkins hasnt housemaid to send by reason of so much illness can send cook said face fell such pity when can cook so well said helen must have somebody cant do work char must manage m said changing plate with awful clatter oh not with mr leg ill said helen will have knocked up next where must be then radiant smile returned to girl face give steak jack said helen potato how delicious smell awful thing again left room leaving a be fragrance of smile behind made attempt to eat of second course put two large slice of steak two potato big spoonful of perspiring cauliflower into fire piece of ginger pudding followed to burning ghaut soon door again opened coffee be brought in be after thought fancy though ill inspired gritty there be coal scuttle be afraid relapsed again after lunch though for time shining example of housemaid who have done work of everybody else inspired to attempt to play piquet bezique piano be hopeless did not seem worth while dealing in point of fact attempt at duet came to conclusion at end of first page for helen only groaned said cant turn over that be thankful to say be low water mark sunshine began to shine more strongly on wreck when leg two day afterwards came downstairs with cheering remark that felt so ill that be sure couldnt be a ill a felt soon after burst into hoarse laughter will cheer up when have counted ten remarked well on whole when be put simply firmly like that seemed best thing to do leg took change of cheering process ordered basin soap three churchwarden pipe blew soap bubble though may not be in work of high endeavour have at least result of making do something be always good thing so when be over in order to contribute to wholesome atmosphere of employment brought in read to helen what have written that morning have designed to appear in book be now reading be will not deceive string long one of cheap gloomy reflection on mutability of life reality of suffering certainty of death have taken trouble with most poignant searing sentence made leg simply roll in chair with laughter be noiseless merely because throat be in such state of relaxation that must not make sound with eye streaming in strangled whisper said oh do stop moment till dont hurt so much with laughing then read again looked at helen have handkerchief to face shoulder shook with incontrollable laughter much funniest thing ever wrote said isnt now begin again at pain sorrow with be surrounded oh before something about be when be racked with suffering oh leg isnt heavenly leg have recovered little still drummed with foot on carpet never knew must feel so much better so quickly said felt mere worm when proposed soap bubble want again from beginning where what thought be sunlight be barred with strange shadow o lor so gave intellectual must say spiritual treat once more then threw manuscript into fire amid shrill expostulation of others leg made heroic attempt to save fruitlessly indeed must print here a warning to who feel very well to postpone meditation upon life death until feel little better also think that one reflection on subject be likely to be of much value unless be founded on sort of experience to be quite honest have founded view that morning on mutability of life anguish of world on depression be result of feverish cold be depressing enough think that be of sufficiently solid foundation proved be true extraordinarily cheering to helen leg one can not be certain that rest of world must be equally exhilarated might be taken seriously though helen say need not have be afraid of man even pessimist be supposed to have perfect right to form own opinion if have way there be not least likelihood of must establish censorship of press must be in hand of six young cheerful optimist who must decide whether such opinion be fit for publication quite rightly literature of indecent nature work may be supposed to have tendency encouraging to criminal be not allowed to be disseminated must put similar prohibition on dissemination of discouraging book book might be expected to suggest foster opinion that world be poor sort of place that god isnt in heaven at even if be proved to be true must count criminal to attempt to convince anybody of must be murderous assault on happiness of private individual law doe not allow one to poison man bread with impunity so how much more stringently must forbid poisoning of inward health of soul nothing harm ever came from dissemination of depressing truth nothing good from dissemination of innocent joyful belief even must be proved that have foundation whatever for if world be dreary painful place so much more need be there of courage high heart to render least tolerable if be to be snuffed out like candle when come to end of few evil year how much more be part of wisdom to snatch little happiness out of circumambient annihilation to think that only morning have actually tried to commit crime be only saved from by leg unutterable laughter to be truthful felt little offended when first began to laugh inwardly hoped that must soon grow depressed thoughtful a continued to tell rosary of discouraging thing need not have indulged that hope be forlorn from beginning instead made helen feel much better be so content to leave at have hoped have indeed when wrote depressing page wish to heaven have not burned that possible reader might see part of serious side of thing under discouragement of winged word now two day later be far more content that two darling must have laughed at what be written with such seriousness than into whose hand printed record of manuscript might have fallen must have sighed once over jaundiced view about life death sickness mutability of course death be extremely solemn affair seems to now be recovering fast be drinking hypophosphates beginning to be greedy again that solemnity of ought to have be discounted long ago if be going to be solemn at everyone of course be at liberty to take life solemnly from time begin to think at attitude towards life be same ought to be attitude towards death whether believe that there be continuance of life afterwards whether be so unfortunate a to believe that there be quenched candle for in one case death be opening of door into fuller light thing be true may affect one for moment since from weakness of flesh cling to what know while in other death be just extinction consummation pessimist must fear since while lived have held so poor opinion of life so whether regard life a pleasant interlude in something else whether regard death thing unthinkable to a extinction of consciousness can not believe that be not guest who be welcome when come personally want to come for long time since be delighted with world must be most annoying to die now when one be just recovering from influenza hope to go to richter concert to morrow one belief about future be can not see that there be essential horror about death can conjure up horror of kind about going to dentist about looking up train in bradshaw since print be so execrable connection so unruly go journey go to dentist get to destination be relieved of troublesome tooth life doe not seem to least troublesome be true let take that by death get to destination in case get nearer besides how frightfully interesting did not die went to richter concert instead leg wished to go too be clearly idiotic so helen tossed up a to of must go remain at home won went there be isolde in high chair probably intelligent critic will say that isolde be woman mean tristan dont waved little wand

temple of dream in garden of thing man may conceive may not realize then came there gracious young knight sachs heard that of have dreamed song taught by bird choir of nature to ardent heart of youth

from time to time for rule of cache be that may use what find there provided only replace with something else potted meat for instance one must not expect to go undiscussed can not personally conceive

how can argue about thing of know nothing indeed think that proper argument be based on ignorance if know anything on subject of be talking produce fact of kind knock argument flat be only possible to reason rightly on subject concerning fact except phenomenon be ascertainable have asked clergyman why sat in snow must probably have told subject must have ceased to interest conversationally a be held heated debate upon just a if be education bill for long time unusualness of merited attention conjecture think how divine opening for conversation at dinner party if know nothing of neighbour have not caught name did ever see clergyman sitting in snow that in fact be outcome of argument theory about must really hold water be probably conversational gambit might lead to much for instance in answer to question interlocutor might reply in five obvious way once saw clergyman be not sitting in snow have seen snow never saw clergyman sitting in once saw clergyman being snowballed yes what be view about best treatment for insane such strange thing happen at grindelwald did know yes be probably conversational opening made manifest to mortal eye anyhow when returned be not sitting there if have be real probably must have be at least if once sit in snow there be reason why must ever get up obviously be mtier now everybody who life in fog rainy place will fail to understand anything of last deplorable page if go to thin clear air of alp in winter will know that sort of thing given have luck to see clergyman sitting in snow be invested with supreme importance when hot sun shine on

if found place at tree might have be cut down since last year whole cache might have be rifled by imperceptive hand there be end to list of untoward circumstance might have despoiled so went through wood came to end of there be tree of many one a mr wordsworth prophetically remarked on root be cut humble initial be certainly tree oh quick quick said helen let know worst root have arched little since saw last moss snow be plastered on in manner scarcely natural plucked bandage away with hand trembled found pencil something sticky believe to have be caramel empty potted meat tin with wisp of

five franc piece wrapped up in paper on be written took away little wooden pill box containing very small moonstone think be very moderate in exchange be right since must always leave cache richer for presence merely took away pencil poem on wetterhorn leaving handkerchief reel of cotton copy of shirley below question whats point wrote none if cant see added founder wife visited cache on january saw clergyman sitting in snow selah then awful thing happened even while treasure be openly sumptuously spread round down path there came merry swiss peasant about hundred year old looked at treasure with curiosity contempt then burst into perfect flood of speech of of understood one single word when stopped said politely ich wei nicht just like parsifal began something like over again with gesticulation added in rather louder tone a if be talking to deaf man until torrent of gibberish be let loose on have idea how much there be in world did not know so with desire to reduce opinion of also addressed in english said god save king right through a much a must remember of to be not to be from play called hamlet have just begun on when hound of spring be on winter trace when suddenly turned pale crossed though be protestant canton fairly fled down path make doubt that thought have met devil anyhow have met match at unintelligible conversation be clearly use running risk for more of merry swiss might come down path who be conceivable might not be so much impressed by unintelligible sound hurriedly reburied treasure ate lunch turned bow of toboggan homewards since proposed to skate afternoon be year since have be shod with steel burned for frozen surface be right to see to cache first there be thing can not wait for spent three week in divine futility if anything so utterly enjoyable can be considered futile for part believe can since a have already said to enjoy thing very much supposing always that doe not injure anybody else be gilt edged investment of time for enjoyment be not a be falsely supposed finished with when thing be done over for be just then that high interest of though gilt edged begin to be paid until one forgets about by merciful dispensation one remembers be pleasant far longer far more keenly than what be painful subsequent day hour be enriched therefore made more productive by pleasurable memory be here think that wonderfully fresh vivid student of human mind namely r l stevenson go all wrong when say that past be of one texture seems to one be only responsible for one own experience to be of two texture one strong other weak strong one be memory of thing have enjoyed of happy day other of time when for reason other pain anxiety fear light have be low sound of grinding not low loud human mind in fact be more retentive of pleasure than of pain in moment of happening may seem top note of acuteness echo of one indisputably live longer than echo of other though consciousness if care to look at way be largely haunted house of dead hour yet happy ghost be in preponderance seem solider than shadow of dark place also think too be indubitable anticipation of happiness be more acute than anticipation of corresponding pain in future there be two texture also a in past since return contrast have be rather markedly brought before there be many thing much look forward to at same time there be something ahead be dreading what be know think must dread le if did be though quite certain quite vague connect however with evening in september when heard name called when leg saw something have since be expunged from memory here be contrast happiness that lie stored for in hive of future be more potent than bitterness be there be coming of be sure among many very happy thing know expect feel there be something yet know be happier than be futile to guess at one might make hundred guess must seem feasible of accomplishment there at back of mind be two transparency so to speak one other stormy be through that event of day be seen by colour of do happy one be predominant one neutralize other be there to full despair at giving coherently so elusive picture a make in own mind though elusive be intensely real for first time can do desire to speak to helen about thing be so often in mind be incommunicable after swiss week there be not much time for to think about a be imperatively demanded by reason over have control must exercise mind on extremely difficult art of composition of english prose incidentally implies doing two thing at once for not only have to invent lively inspiring tale have to tell in certain way may choose at beginning way of hundred that there be of telling in key in be originally pitched in key have to remain time a matter of fact probably doe not go wandering about in other mode scale book ought to be in one key in open just a picture ought to be in one key be within writer liberty of course to write other book in other key think be perfectly justified in largely contradicting in one work what have unhesitatingly affirmed in in point of view have to be consistent throughout thing be not quite so easy a sound be further complicated by very real difficulty story be worth reading at be bound to record change in character general attitude of people with whom deal jaded author have to keep eye on see that behaves after atrocious battering with fate have visited in different manner than before visitation took place if be living in sense of word event will have altered will view thing differently therefore behave differently yet time be same personality be better for that must be a adamant to blow of circumstance than that inner essence be individuality must be uncertainly rendered like dexterous mr maskelyne with spinning plate scribe have to keep eye on puppet to see that none lapse into stagnation to poke up with industrious pen be here that complicated question of consistency come in just now be worrying to bewilderment dreadful stinging event be happening to most favourite puppet of mine providence be dealing with in cruelly ironical manner in way make poor distracted lady take quite fresh view of world thought so warm kindly yet must be same personality have to be shown sitting behind changed feeling directing be consistency have to be observed otherwise cease to be one story becomes series of really unconnected short story with technical absurdity that heroine in have same name yet there be also take sort to make world at least world otherwise constructed must be extremely dull one life lie somewhere in middle of be centre to approach sort make world view very differently though be looking at same object here simile thing usually unconvincing may assist what if in centre there be something like great diamond blazing in ray of sun from south see soft blue light in from west see great ruby ray coming out of heart of on north say diamond be emerald green while from east seems of transcendent orange so far be quite certain that be right for world so to speak refracts god making many hued even a white light be refracted by triangle of prism then let suppose circumstance enter shift who have be on south where saw blue to west where see red whole colour of world be changed to yet there be inconsistency same ego honestly see changed colour there must on other hand when place be shifted by circumstance be grave inconsistency if continued to declare still saw blue eye tell be red just now eye told be blue have not changed have great diamond changed be merely that refracted light have taken colour be just must perceive in telling of story person who see blue life probably see nothing at nothing anyhow in least worth recording be bound a wheel of circumstance go round to see thing in other light be not inconsistency be truly consistent who want after for ever to draw same conclusion from same premise only fossil possibly mollusc pity sorrow of story teller quality of red have to be of same quality a blue same fire strike to south will indubitably strike to other point of compass when x be wheeled north will not see same green a y see there saw through alchemy of own mind will be green nobody el green if be have individuality to speak of at least belongs to type see everything through eye of others be generally labelled conventional there seems reason to change name how laboured during last ten day of january how little result there seems to be only console with real labour of writing doe not chiefly consist in effort of putting thing down in moral effort of rejecting there be nothing easier than to fill page page with improving reflection inspiring event having done that be necessary to sound tuning fork see if a said at first story be in tune if key be kept usually be not on fire ought to make to momentary beacon waste paper basket be replete pile of numbered page must in case be starving that a matter of fact be sole argument have justified existence during ten day have really worked great deal waste paper basket must say how generous have be diet have really left out very great deal hasten to forestall critic who will say must in order to act up to excellent standard have left out rest agree with key of have spoken have to be preserved not only in matter of consistency in character drawing in style a well if lead off with verbiage from orient east must continue submit to dye paragraph till last page be turned though may have also at command pure well of most limpid simplicity will have to reserve for other immortal work will not mix with incense heady draught from east must fancy mysterious delphic mode of diction delphic must be to end a if be not so difficult that like dr johnson almost wish be frankly impossible interwoven in delphic oriental narrative there must be totally different woof namely thread of spoken word speech that put into mouth of various character written word be remembered be never like spoken word two vocabulary to begin with be totally distinct though must not go so far a to affirm that spoken word ought to be ungrammatical must if be to recall human speech be colloquial conversational in interchange of idea by mean of mouth real people use fine language especially when emotion be strongly aroused then instead of becoming high flown ornate in speech real people go to opposite extreme instinctively use only very simplest word when be stated seems natural enough will find very seldom practised novelist have tendency to let puppet employ magnificent high sounding word to express intensity splendour of great emotion in fact may gauge strength of emotion a rule by sonorous quality of adjective believe very opposite to be truth of matter people in grip of passion use beautiful highly coloured word above like mr wegg drop into poetry yet nothing be commoner than to find prose degenerating into blank verse in spoken record of emotional crisis a if blank verse be sublime form of prose little nell be continually half way between prose poetry so also be nicholas nickleby when indignation be roused in fact in of scene with ralph forget so much in passion that torrent of decasyllabic line flow from lip on other hand language of narrative must undoubtedly grow more coloured more vivid in such description a be setting of very emotional scene yet must not depart from original key well a mr tulliver said puzzling work talking though day have be so full have seen everything everything through two transparency seem drawn between external happening february season according to literary artistic view of thing have be rather out of joint year autumn be not time of mellow fruitfulness at because green thing upon earth have exhausted in long hot summer have more spirit left to be fruitful with then january in england have be of usual warm mugginess mist poet say be characteristic of autumn in reality characterize winter indeed doubt if winter be ever time of hard frost sparkling snow be artistic ideal be disposed to believe that version of be really brought from germany by prince consort popularized by charles dickens then after mist came mellow fruitfulness for saw strawberry in flower on february on february helen came in saying have found real strawberry be strange enough though perhaps finding of unreal strawberry must have be stranger still so said where said on strawberry bed silly therefore started up leaving most important epoch making sentence unfinished have never be able to remember what end of be going to be because wanted to see strawberry write to field about so said be going out already said yes just to see strawberry write to field saying have then pointed to half way down person since be so abstemious of word indicate anatomy below throat said must x ray help being extremely clever that morning of course understood reviled for eating unnatural phenomenon be criminal might a well have found sea serpent north pole eaten a usual be artful led conversation away to daffodil be behaving in manner nearly equal to of strawberry plant one indeed be in bud thing incredible true supposed have eaten that too led back to strawberry again be not even sorry about for said be far more interesting to be able to write to field to say have eaten strawberry on february than must be able to say have seen so very kindly gave pen said write quickly said oh be only woman cant wouldnt put in wish hadnt put strawberry in said think will wish too before long said only mention in order to show utter unreasonableness of wife if want to write to field say there be strawberry in garden on february will allow to say that though did not see ate certainly must not have eaten if have seen will not write to say ate like true woman say doe not matter added with changed voice that be afraid might did for fruitfulness of season be not so mellow a might have be wished yes once again spring have begun to stir in fiery heart of world once again breath of life blow ember seemed winter to be grey lifeless cinder from centre glow spread till that grey surface of ash be alive with flame again a flame shoot upwards be like rocket rising from over whole face of world at present be going upwards slender line of flame be sap be rising through branch leafless stem until reach very end of twig then rocket will burst in star of leaf opening flower till vast illumination be again complete in warm soft february morning though feel know that be so can not help thought going back to other side of thing of illumination of last year be quenched dead even while world be getting ready for next one there still lie broadcast ash fallen stick of last rocket shower however many more gladden world even though to infinity life be incessantly beautifully renewed yet can not forgive perishing of single flower know well that material be indestructible that of life death of be born fresh life so that be quite right to say that life can not be destroyed what of individual rose what of one purple star of clematis twinkled on end of stem hold in hand though may be transformed will be transformed into myriad other thing so by death be transfused into hundred other flower course through vein of life for ever yet that individual object will be seen more individuality be completely lost figure in new form not own be quite certain also that same thing happen to body grass grows thick on graf of have loved root of rose penetrate deep saw once on crumbling sea devoured east coast of england thing under very eye made real to in way that nothing have ever done before for churchyard stood there on very edge of sandy cliff one night with noise of huge murmurous thunder acre of slid down into sea next morning visited place there sticking out of cliff be bone of dead have be buried there ruin of rose have sprawled trumpeted over churchyard gate have be plucked in half by fall lay on ground wondered how tree have not slipped with rest of landslide until saw root have lain just where fracture of earth occurred in exposed face of new cliff saw anchorage one be wrapped round thigh bone have made network among rib be horrible revolting have happened to million dead who have lived loved whose limb have be swift to move who have drawn rapturous long breath of keen sea scented air whose eye have be bright mouth eager when met lover beloved be ruin of red rose on grass there be nothing in world more certain than one may a well face will die will die one of will die first other will sometimes see grave with grass green over rose triumphant thereon for have settled most thing at one time manner of funeral what happens after have passed under discussion have decided definitely against cremation because seems such waste of tissue be of going to be properly buried one close to other so that same rose may bloom from will have rose strawberry on grave so that sunday school child may pluck eat while on other hand be going to be spring man have daffodil for feel no leaning a have said towards sunday school here lie difficulty want rich clayey soil for rose strawberry daffodil will demand not clay sand also be going to plant purple clematis by head clematis like sand too have not yet perfectly decided where be going to die seems probable that survivor will stay in same place a survived want purple clematis since be when saw that knew somebody whom have thought to be friend be false indeed have done must to forgive think clematis feed on may make surer funeral will shock neighbourhood be afraid be going to have flat fugue prelude blared on organ be time somebody began to learn to play at distressing moment when coffin be wheeled out of church simply to show have enjoyed enormously great heaven must a soon think of having dead march of kind played over a must let play work of mr mendelssohn will have have happens immensely good time seems to much fitter to return thanks for than to remind people that poor body be dead knew already why did come to funeral service a for requiem will have none of happens body at least can not possibly lie quiet in grave dear flower planted there will see to oh god god what unanswerable riddle set even body what happens to be so occupying subject dont really care what happens to mine may be set up in anatomical museum if will teach anybody anything helen somehow when come out of valley of shadow something of must wait for if have gone through passage first will not know unless at end of when darkness lift little will see grey eye looking at procession of passing over meeting mine saying somehow be here must be there be not so waiting on eternal shore for there must be cant help what believe be one thing in one can never change

smile be ready to break from dont want incorporeal presence want dick crooked nose margerys smile then on warm february morning must suppose that went down into hell dead leaf flower be certain be transformed into fresh living form bone too flesh of dead animal of men woman passed again into great machine of life be served up in new transformation so of individual body nothing at be left be bad enough will never see margery dick again a used to see helen will pas too into other form be bad enough be infinitely worse what of individual soul spirit that love will too a analogy grimly insists be put back again into principle of eternal life from came so that identity too be lost life only a autumn leaf of last year live in verdure of next spring with everything else that happens body of love even cruel thing surely certainly true be used up again to make fresh form of life why must suppose that god make exception in dealing with soul of men individual other form of life us re us world be lump of modelling clay with beguiles leisure of eternity making now one shape then crushing up making so be that promise of eternal life amount to that will pas back into crucible issue forth again a bit of somebody else seems to very mean affair frankly seems swindle be poor trick to make puny little creature love one try to be kind console ourselves for evil day sorrow of world with thought of everlasting day that will dawn for if everlasting day be nothing more than day be here already if soul whom have believed be at rest in ineffable peace content on other hand through further suffering be getting nearer ever nearer to perfection flower of being have already passed into other form of life so dante beatrice be no longer a must call have be infinitely divided into soldier sailor tinker tailor in sense may be said to be alive still be very paltry sense what mistakenly call be a dead a if have never be be very well to say that dante be immortal by reason of deathless

now let try to thank god for what have be know what leg be to sort of son sort of brother afternoon sat there hearing london rumble distantly around little stirring creaking came from different part of room now blind flapped now curtain sighed a often happens in spring time board of flooring gave little sharp rap infinitesimal particle of sap still lingering in perhaps hearing herald of spring blowing horn outside only from bed there came sound at be still sunk deep in sleep doctor hoped must join be one with death if woke at there be chance that must suffer blinding excruciating pain on other hand might come to just at last moment of when pain must be already passed doctor be saying in hushed whisper with speak in chamber of death though there may be real reason why must not speak openly when heard little stir from bed looking round saw that leg eye be open that be moving way that a if in search of something helen have seen too next moment be by recognized for there be welcome in eye then turning head little saw doctor meantime have moved to head of bed looked at leg face very intently then made little sign to that must come up to bed went stood by window looking out understood then leg spoke in ordinary voice wasnt bad luck said bicycle skidded omnibus what be happening to asked quickly be helen laid hand on head yes darling said be not afraid be for moment pupil of eye contracted then grew quite normal again no said quickly ive have awfully good time oh be great success shakespeare know then shadow seemed to pas over face eyelid fluttered now be coming now said yes darling said again kissed leg lay quite still for moment with closed eye then quickly opened again made a if must raise head buck up two wont said from outside there came dim roar of london little noise crept about room from bed came sound at two day afterwards went down home again arriving in evening body rested that night in own room down here to be taken next day to churchyard sun blesses more than other place have ever seen over grey norman tower keep watch last charge to have be to buck up know how be seemed to a if be still liking to buck up so in so far a found possible did what leg wished to do to night must have be here making third of merry table when servant have come in for last time bringing coffee be not possible not to remember helen rose when spoke voice trembled be very foolish of asked do think leg will mind feel a if cant face to morrow unless go look at place where will put be quite warm outside jack oh let go out look at will seem more natural then think will buck up better if see first so went across garden through place of rose through gate on far side through field bounded churchyard there be great yellow moon just risen shadow be sharp cut so that there be doubt when came to place have be so newly dug uncle helen father lay there two graf be side by side so sat there in silence for time very still for rat ran on to mound of earth by graveside sat there smartening up brushing face whisker with nimble paw shadow of tower swung just clear of place sharp cut in light be that oblong hole in ground there be nothing a yet to be said for helen be cry quietly to herself must not stay loving tear once said to oh let buck up then silently wept again see know helen knew that there be nothing of bitterness in cry tear of sort be not opposed to bucking up leg did not mean that wanted not to miss dear companionship only wanted to stand up be cheery not be bitter broken since helen felt must face to morrow better if faced scene of why be right be bucking up then in few little sentence talked of next day there must be flat fugue funeral march must have funeral hymn just one psalm lord be shepherd one hymn after have to be done be over so then must sing adeste fideles helen thought for be always christmas since first christmas day helen just moved a sat there on edge of grave when have settled a if to go home again then told have thought three morning ago doubt merged into certainty logical conclusion whether then at moment inclined more to side of devil of god know in case told then put arm round yes dear said in hell be there also be there sometimes be lowest step of beautiful stair to heaven moon have swung behind tower sat in darkness of shadow be so simple said depends upon what believe not what think what reason about do believe that bury leg to morrow do believe that be dead that have ceased to be individual may reason about ask a asked how will recognize if body have become grass flower be quite content to say have idea see one doesnt know god plan quite completely sometimes be apt to think that if one doesnt know plan about certain thing hasnt got one put intelligence above be mistake sat in silence again then helen spoke asking extremely simple question what doe faith mean if be right about said mean nothing be without meaning be prepared to abide by again there be silence sat little apart from so that question came from darkness be put impersonally so to speak not by helen just by voice do believe that margery dick be nothing now except grass flower perhaps little bit of life of other people do really believe be leg nothing now be quite still have come to very sequestered corner of great house of life to talk about thing in front be shadow of grave over now lay shadow of tower once from graf side few pebble detached fell rattling to bottom have answer to three day ago have asked same question what call brain answered now gave answer something suppose have made uncertain how can wheel of omnibus hurt leg asked can do more than hurt body then came closer to again what doe love mean said think leg must have enjoyed funeral next day because be so extremely funny think by time that know enough about helen to allow to be amused at have sent note to vicar saying that must like flat prelude psalm hymn have mentioned came in person not to remonstrate to put on to correcter attitude death be solemn occasion there be none so solemn hymn ancient modern provided very suitable verse to be sung now labourer task be oer for instance leg labourer who be most gorgeous player at life have ever be seen besides surely christmas hymn be out of place when must be ash wednesday in time said feebly that christmas hymn be surely always in place dear mr eversley looked pained helen at once yielded be sure that labourer task be most suitable then about psalm there be two psalm already provided for burial service surely lord be shepherd struck different note so said vicar be undeniable when must sing that psalm then helen be firm said that thought must go back into church at end of service well just sing be rather good to end with mr eversley looked even more pained than before have never heard of such thing being done point be left undecided for moment for there be clearly something even more crucial to come came ever since organist have heard of leg death have be most diligent at chopin funeral march of have of own initiative bought copy in order to be able to perform organist in question who be also schoolmaster have have sort of distant adoration for leg ever since year ago have seen drive golf ball two hundred sixty measured yard since then leg have played with once twice giving enormous odds distant adoration have ripened into nearer one be such pleasant young gentleman be upshot of dear man have bought chopin funeral march since wanted to play something more uncommon than dead march in saul here helen be completely at one there must be flat prelude be to be chopin funeral march there remained question of twenty third psalm oh yes must strike different note be quite true so there must be going back into church must have chopin funeral march now labourer task be oer vicar did not exactly beam when thing be settled be visibly relieved shook hand with said terribly sudden terribly sudden at two precisely oh leg how must have enjoyed that did too for told to buck up be so funny after have planned vicar call have be made quite early be scarcely twelve when went away to seemed a if leg have be waiting somewhere upstairs till went in order to laugh over with be a if have be waiting on landing fresh from bath with just dressing gown on so that must not appear when other people be there might come down barefooted when have gone must have be so amused at how must skip into drawing room afraid of prowling housemaid to find alone say sorry havent got much on have to come down after bath yes after bath be so that seemed to that wholesome spirit have be washed thought by what be called death be fresher more jubilant than ever on vicar departure down came to join again have other word for there be more to come for hardly have vicar gone when be announced to that mr holmes have called might see one of for moment only felt that leg be cornered now must have to stop here hide behind piano something hoped must behave not make laugh so mr holmes came in never saw anybody so wonderfully attired be in black including glove stick above small neat buttoned boot when sat down saw black sock may only have be accidental accident must account for fact that cuff have neat black border about inch wide wondered if have blacked over like enthusiastic impersonator of othello have ventured to intrude on grief only for moment here helen dropped handkerchief bent down to pick up knocked head together almost thought heard little stifled gasp from behind piano mr holmes have received notice of funeral have understood be to be to day did not know if wished to be quite private if not must esteem privilege to be allowed to pay last respect here little mr holmes gave great gulp must not get on did like so much said after moment two thank can let out walked away on tiptoe a if be most important not to make noise be one of sparkling february day sunny windless air be full of chirruping of bird there be moment pause at gate of churchyard moment silence inside church organ ceased then came great simple word be resurrection life march helen have failing though may not have thought that thing be possible be foolish weakness for old bit of rubbish can of without anguish unutterable rendings bear to throw old useless thing away weakness have to be got over sometimes keep putting work of destruction off just a one put off visit to dentist with result that when come to pas find that must have be far better to have done long ago however if did not occasionally tear thing up throw thing away house must become uninhabitable so morning vowed to other to spend hour till lunch in work of destruction rubbish collect chiefly in room be called mine where have knee hole table with nine drawer opened one after other be full despair seized cant said here be nine drawer quite full of heart blood o jack look brought across to photograph have taken of leg jumping lawn tennis net be sitting in air apparently in easy attitude one knee seemed crossed over other mouth be wide open will be harder than ever year said half to herself there be nine drawer full circumscribe drop of heart blood a come said dont think there be nine drawer full only keep thinking of particular thing have to be kept thrown away oh only fact that there be nine drawer full that make possible to throw anything away at said hush woman said personally be extremely methodical over work of destruction clear table dump upon pile of heart blood sort into three heap one of be for destruction one for preservation one for further consideration proceeded to do so now there be many piece of string throughout year keep piece of string because know will use a matter of fact when want piece of string cut off helen ball never use of bit have saved because dont know where be must prove to be wrong length if did so on day of destruction consign to dust bin begin to collect again immediately then there be pill box full of soft yellow powder leg have collected from little cedar cone at house where be staying in autumn put on to heap of destruction transferred to heap of consideration then there be dozen little bit of verd antique have picked up year ago on beach at capri have periodically tried to throw away never must manage morning knowing be useless to strive against irresistible made attempt to steel to destruction put at once into pile be predestined unto life there be chunk of amber have picked up at cromer equally imperishable yard yard of indiarubber tape be filling of rubber cored golf ball small bottle with glass stopper clearly impossible to throw away since might come in useful day how foolish must feel if afternoon wanted bottle with glass stopper have to send into town for one whereas if have be le iconoclastic might have airily produced exact thing needed out of left hand top drawer then came little tin box full of pink powder concluded be rouge be puzzling when did use rouge asked helen dont know be leg do think when acted red queen last year no couldnt throw away red queen have be piece of genius next came telegram from to saying that have passed into foreign office then there be vile caricature of myself at top of so called swing at golf quite unrecognizable assure then came mass of letter receipted bill account rendered account rendered always fill with suspicion have to hunt among unpaid bill to find item of account rendered a feel moral certainty that be attempt to defraud be invariably correct receipted bill have to be docketed tied up together in bundle took time probably however must tie up with one of many piece of string have so diligently collected by rare happy chance found one must do exactly tied up with beautiful hard knot put on predestination heap moment afterwards found several more to join same packet split nail over trying to untie beautiful knot have to go upstairs for nail scissors to cut smooth brought down to cut knot other piece of string in collection must do so cut piece off helen ball for have left room for moment then came upon large quantity of box of fusee partly empty how happens be go to play golf on windy day of course have to buy at club house box of fusee on return what remains of methodically put in drawer on reaching home by oversight forget to take out again when play next day so buy box similarly place in drawer if play golf four five time week on down where there be almost always high wind follows that in course of year amount of partly filled box of fusee collect about be nothing short of prodigious did not know how great supporter be of home industry methodical mind saw at once how have to be treated of course throwing away be out of question right thing to do be to produce out of dozen of partly filled box eight nine completely full plan began to put into practice at once be necessary of course to find how many match full fusee box contained be awkward to pack seemed to hold ten others only seven so when helen came back table be covered among other thing with fusee so waved arm violently said will not be because female nose male nose if be unaccustomed to tobacco smoke like positively like smell of fusee to anyone who smoke tobacco smell of be for reason perfectly nauseating be why only use in open air then helen mean nature asserted said oh forgot dont like smell soon after not at once mark called attention to non existent object of horticultural interest out of window turned in moment have fusee positively inhaled sickening perfume of only wished have inhaled upshot be that took turn on lawn while room with open door window recovered from degrading odour how be getting on asked not very well decided to destroy string nearly destroyed pill box with cedar flower dust in reserved at least think did why leg collected know leg wouldnt have thrown away so cant helen be silent moment then do miss leg very much asked bodily presence mean of course of course

artfulness be glad to say that have often said before so that be not particularly stupid of not to guess that meant anything especial with artfulness changed subject to happened to be thinking about thus making transition gave up said found thing be so connected with leg couldnt destroy be just what said want to keep young thing in house since be getting old use saying pouf cant destroy anything connected with so will move rubbish straight into leg room make sort of young museum then when feel particularly middle aged can go up there sit among young thing if dont do that must clear out room a

more than husband who be father of nothing besides make book be father to what do do order dinner yet seems to so strange now did not see there be bitterness in word thought be that there be bitterness in voice face smile did not quite understand that remember helen have told since that did not mean to wanted well plan evolves then took arm again be nearly month since dear leg went away said since have actually heard seen last heard be that wanted to buck up do know think have bucked up have be doing that singly have somehow lived rather apart dear surely be better to buck up

over nursery during day concentrated there young thing of house when be finished be motley room there be photograph of leg everywhere paper be kept everything have connection with leg with youth be crammed into when be finished found that sat there together instead of paying secret visit to room played at noah ark sitting on carpet played at soldier clearing low table have be helen nursery table for can not play soldier on floor since stagger on carpet pea from pea shooter sent whole row of grenadier down like ninepin must neither of ride rocking horse so instead tilted backwards forward pretended be charging foe of course reasonably minded reader will say be two absurd people of disagree altogether for have to judge of proceeding by effect effect in case be that leg injunction that must buck up became habit inimitable youth leg gave home bodily presence have gone somehow atmosphere be recaptured played at youth at childhood till became real again for household without youth in be dead household puppy kitten may supply old man of eighty may supply youth of kind must be part of one environment else world withers thing have happened to personally have said that at beginning of year looked forward into future through two transparency one sunlit other dark now dark one can express in other way have be withdrawn dear leg death be not quite identical with for be not withdrawn then during month followed gradually melted away can trace just two cause for first be in ineptitude of spirit have reasoned to myself that death of body logically implied merging of life into one central life after death leg became to spirit more individual than ever second cause be establishment of nursery though youth might have passed for oneself still lived one be wrong too at least be in thinking have passed from else how did feel so singularly annoyed when helen shot down with wet pea whole regiment of life guard be annoyed be still be perfect fluke that colonel on horseback fell in such way that more than decimated own regiment be sure helen shook table else why must brigadier general posted in extreme rear have fallen off table altogether won meantime in first week of march wind be roaring out of south west for while day together sometimes squall valkyrie maiden might have bridled to make steed for swift going came in unbroken procession from atlantic helen be lover of sea gale coming out of waste of water touch something within a mysterious a sixth sense of animal who feel be excited by thing that five sensed mortal be unaware of to day however be quiet calm stormed steep ascent of down till stood on highest point of beacon look down on other land towards south west so that river of wind flow from atlantic come here unbreathed untamed by traverse of other country get fresh salt a be when left ocean in interval of quiet weather there be nothing to be perceived by ordinary sense sniffed air like filly at grass wind be coming said great wind from sea dont care whether little barometer have gone up not what doe know of wind will be at home before come will tell then a sit close to fire what be happening in big place be quite right though silly barometer have gone up be through dinner when wind have be no more than breeze afternoon struck house a suddenly a blow wood fire on hearth gave little puff of smoke into room then thinking better suddenly sparkled a if with frost a passage of air above chimney drew up at helen eye be alight ate more sat with elbow on table while who have not sixth sense went gravely through mutton anchovy on toast orange then brought in coffee shook head to meantime that first warning of wind have be justified niagara of air poured over screaming hooting making mad orchestra of sound at time ceased altogether long pause of conductor then before one heard wind at tattoo of drum of rain sounded on window pane then heralded by drum whole mad orchestra burst into great tutti of screaming hooting sobbing so much must hear be of somehow something secret sensitive within vibrated to uproar have seen in grip of wind a express perhaps dozen time always make vaguely uneasy be le than possession yet can think of one whom must have imagined le liable to thing can imagine surrounded by terror of fire shipwreck catastrophe overthrow reason make men mere panic stricken maniac keeping absolutely calm infecting others by self possession now then wind take possession of becomes like pythian prophetess oh to be alone with sea gale to night said jack what splendid thing be happening in great empty place of world have be brewing out on atlantic for couple of day by now there be thousand of mile of great white headed wave rising falling in darkness calling to other dancing together up above a in gallery of ball room be great mad band of hear little in stuffy house will play to night to morrow wave will dance without ceasing growing bigger a dance like nightmare oh can imagine nothing see so clearly mr mr wave family dancing dancing young though white headed growing bigger a dance be cannibal too big wave will eat up little one make bigger yet wind love to see that give great blare of trumpet when see cannibal wave oh must have happened moment scream meant well done wave be big one swallowed sometimes see ship coming along love playing with ship because proper ship like being out in atlantic ball room wave crowd towards seeing can lift highest whiz cant hear screw racing a wave lifted stern run away from under how mast strike right left across thousand star for sky be quite clear wind have turned out cloud a turn out chair table from room where dance have gone up to leg room after dinner a talked went quickly from place to place now pausing for moment to look at photograph now putting coal on fire drawing aside curtain to look into night oh there be eternal youth of world said song of wind dance of wave think soul of little baby be born come to land in blowing from sea be by that vitality burn higher fruitfulness of world be renewed million of blossom of life be rushing over land to night ready to drop into lonely home ah dont dont said helen come sit down be quiet paused for moment opposite looking at with wonderful shining eye not not said still paused still looking at still waiting for to join a be in pause sudden faint far away light broke on have said word must have awoke in even a awoke in most keen poignant sorrow can touch who love other yet be still smiling eye shone got up something of huge joy transfigured be wrapping round also thrill rapture in be enveloped began to encompass do mean asked be for to tell said must be done way said ready to drop into lonely home said so that be filled with laughter said then knew be here said nursery at that excitement exultation slowly passed from face of beloved for there be room there for more than motherhood though wind still bugled trumpeted outside heard more wildness of dancing wave grey headed growing wave passed by outside blossom ready to drop filled heart with tenderness of infinite deep love of mother that will be sat there on floor at foot with arm round knee head pillowed there have got to confess too said though be not ashamed of confession dont allow to be hurt jack just hold on for minute without being hurt will find that be not now will hide face speak to like have known quite long time before leg died knew well have to hold on for minute two not be hurt if think over will agree be rather hard task have be set on other hand about big thing about thing really matter must take word for helen be never wrong have not be forbidden to ask question then why did not tell said head with sunlit billow just stirred moment did not look up spoke with hidden face because through week darling have be struggling against bitterness of soul have made light of to have to be quite sure have gone from before told know what be be doubt talked about to when sat one night at edge of dear leg grave when be dug empty have to be quite sure have passed from before told have not be sure till now wanted so much to guess nearly guessed felt when arranged heavenly nursery then again there be silence think never knew till then how desperately difficult be to be honest with be so much easier to be honest with other people at first glance told have got over bitterness blindness of have spoken when talked together over leg grave gradually became aware that have not somewhere deep down so that while day passed concealed from that bitterness have still be there in book have tried to be honest will dare say find trace of since night have not probed deep enough have be there think day when arranged nursery finally expelled to night at least believed be gone since helen believed so too perhaps be right about witch diviner have known so much better than have known along took time for process of honesty with be slow there be difficulty about matter perhaps if head love best in world be pillowed on knee be stimulant one must imagine so at last said yes done came closer yet like mr holmes talked below breath in whisper a if afraid of disturbing great joy have come floating down on borne on sea spray borne on wind tide borne a will so that only came here then very soon after went to bed be left sitting in nursery with new significance yet be not quite new have a helen said half guessed before wondered now knew how imagination have halted half way have not clearly seen star on helen eye be fixed yet who must have known have be so full of art in wording even that master word have used nursery seemed to have slipped in have thought meant only a indeed have said that be to be room of young thing where must sit when shadow of childlessness be chill with aid of memory of youth play keep mist of middle age from closing round frost of old from settling too stiffly on later year of travel room be to be palliative tonic a will consolation for thing be not to be for now showed face be not past of spoke future suppose sat long over ember of fire be hour have escaped from hand of time be not to be computed by scale sometimes threw log into open hearth of fireplace ah that open hearth must be altered now must never do in nursery sometimes plied industrious pair of bellow for most part sat idle looking into fiery heart of blaze for news that helen have made guess be at first unrealizable though knew to be true have to absorb digest since great joy be a stunning thing a stroke of sorrow gradually a gradually a working of process of beauty began to feel not only to know name of room where sat be nursery helen be wrong about one thing have said that wind must play to dancing of wave night next day before went to bed that wild orchestra of storm have ceased work be done for have blown bud of blossom of life into house so longed for be strange how quickly event of life become part of one next morning woke in full possession of new knowledge there be question uncertainty a to what be made rapture of waking with same suddenness real knowledge of what life have be before knew have passed from must no longer in least realize what have felt like before moment came when helen have made guess though moment be so few hour away yet must no more conceive existence without than one can form mental picture of what life must be without gift of sight hearing be not that huge event destroys went before so stain back through turned page of past that be coloured suffused with how blackbird thrush sang on that march morning have awoke before dawn to hear early tuning up going on in bush before long since be too happy to sleep got up dressed quietly went out tuning up be just over bird be busy with breakfast for must know a soon a wake get in singing trim for day before bright eyed quest listening with head cocked a scuttle over lawn for sound of worm moving be so close to ground that can localize to within fraction of inch then in go spear like beak poor thing be dragged out of soft dew drenched earth be not quite tidy eater dear minstrel of garden for point be to get breakfast inside beyond recall with least possible delay swallow gulp swallow thing be done then give one long flute like note of satisfaction listen again for second course one can not exactly say that have bad manner at table for extreme sensibleness of plan excludes other consideration also bad manner at table irresistibly suggest greediness bird be ever greedy have excellent appetite when have have enough stop eating instantly begin to sing be just at end of bird breakfast that got out be to say still wanted minute to sunrise lawn be gossamer webbed shimmering with dew a if thin layer of moonstone transparent pearl have be veneered over emerald felt almost vandalism to walk over removing with clumsy foot whole patch of thin inimitable jewellery three hour gale of night before have vanished to give place to morning of halcyon calm augured one of rare exquisite day march sometimes give day of warm windlessness promise of spring straight in front of rose beacon still submerged in clear dark shadow high in heaven above dawn have come for made golden fleece one such a never jason handled of little cirrhus cloud that gale have forgotten to sweep away dawn must soon strike beacon too before hoped to stand on top see huge embrace of day night melting absorption of darkness into light even river with waving water weed aqueous crystal did not detain gave ten minute to ascent for wanted to welcome dawn from high place to stand on roof of hill to greet slowly dawn descended from sky quivering palpitating with light great golden flood came nearer nearer earth a yet caught reflection from radiant heaven hung moment hovering bright winged iridescent bird of dawn just above head then sun leaped up vaulting above eastern hill level shaft of light swept across land mantle of gold while in valley below clear dusk still lay like tideless water down hill side strode day throwing bright arm about night enfolding encompassing in miraculous embrace looked to where home be already big elm in garden be pillar of flame then roof burned suddenly window blazed signal like dawn have come that be not miracle light have awoke hill be gilded with sun at touch of gilding lark innumerable sprang from warm tussock of down grass aspired hundred singing speck rose against sky infinitesimal so that seemed like little mote that swim across eyeball be living thing with open throat hailed sunrise perpendicularly rose wing quivering throat tremble with song till eye lost against dazzling azure of day only enraptured voice from air made heaven musical a if morning star sang together heaven made holiday company of sweet singer gold of sunrise be one thing dawn dear god dear god how thank for indestructible minute knew now what sunlit curtain lay between future be very morning after have known let see from high place birth of day in physical world there be reproduced that golden sunlit curtain made visible to what heart knew to on top of beacon window of home flashed beacon to be of making sun mounting skylark down below tree of garden beaconing flushing window of beloved fruit of womb when come to die want to remember truth life be there way also what be sum of three thing yet be content even then good heaven there be many beautiful thing yet to be glory of gift just lie in that there be always something better to come great bran pie of earth never give to little groping hand best present there be always something more heart desire be given at moment of giving heart be enlarged ask for something better yet if want enough get only difficulty be to want enough for be not given so take thing that have not really desired sort of bonus come in pleasant surprise solid dividend be for man who will there be fluctuation of course to look upwards without doubt be gilt edged affair correct that edge be gilt so be rest of gilt be laid over gold be thus that looked from top of beacon with mist of song of invisible skylark round blazing reflection of window of room in valley there among skylark seemed that leg joined be of use to deny be there simply because be silly to deny there be french word revenant to express presence even solidity of word failed to do justice have never gone away so must never have come back be with time rejoiced in arrangement of nursery even a have be so hopelessly amused at correctness of mr holmes on morning of funeral at moment of expected open vision life death birth three great fact be so near realization again expected to see pan peep over brow of beacon to hear flute like song be not of skylark be ready dear god be ready so thought for moment before next have beaten knew be not wanted more more of divine world more of what next few month will bring must be well when summer come think must choose to die now moment thought that knew unreality want to live through beautiful year will come want to have son at eton daughter who turn head of eligible youth want more than die who talked of want to have full nursery want to see helen old grey headed with grandchild round youngest of want to live through whole of beautiful life till old age though be called winter of life there be need that must be so last day of man of eighty must be most luxuriant of autumn before touch of winter have blackened flower for be only thought of death make think of old age winter together thought doe that conceives falsely of death so anyhow seemed to on midsummer morning of march knew that be be kind pan smiled without cruelty if smiled from cross be from throne of ineffable light that smiled also one by one skylark sated with song dropped down again

decorate parthenon who have seen sketch for frieze can see now in british museum said that be not bad so after breakfast friend strolled towards acropolis talking a athenian talked of new thing in fact talked of several new thing being athenian got quite hot about since have being athenian that keenness of soul that never say dont care about take interest in everything be intensely interesting be hot morning plane tree by ilyssus looked attractive there be company of people there whose talk might be stimulating to day be too busy have to see athene promachos bronze statue by pheidias forty foot high after lunch lunch be going to be rather grand because new play be coming out pericles be going to be there perhaps aspasia be going to schyluss new tragedy called agamemnon friend who be alcibiades be giving supper party in evening socrates be coming man who be really very pleasant only listened made note seldom talked name be plato alcibiades be rather profane sometimes spoke of great god a if did not really believe in knowing so well knew that did that be only puck like spirit made in talk make light of what believed up step of propyla be though amusing rather profane then came through central gate be yet unfinished straight in front of be statue jest know not what died on friend lip great grey eye suddenly became dim with tear at sight of beauty mouth quivered a said mighty lady athene goddess with knelt down on rock in front of where stood prayed to wisdom of god refused to go to grand lunch after insisted on remaining up here till be time to get to theatre quoting something socrates have said about cleansing power of beauty so will not soil just yet with intrigue must hear about at lunch go straight from here to theatre so bought from peasant cheese

actor be come watchman went up to tower looked east saw beacon leap across land to show that ten year siege be over that troy have fallen then slowly began to be unfolded tale of stupendous tragedy home came agamemnon with captive princess cassandra riding behind in chariot of triumph clytemnestra wife met at palace door with feigned obeisance lying word of love welcomed in leaving cassandra outside then there descended on princess spirit of prophecy in wild word shrieked out doom be coming quickly came from within heard death cry of king palace door swung open out came queen fondling axe with have slain doom of god be accomplished then afterwards went round to green room found schylus there alcibiades in impulsive way tell have feeling of woman must kneel kiss hand wrote wonderful play socrates be there too putting absurd question to everybody about difference between muse of tragedy muse of comedy a if anybody cared so long a schylus wrote play like however got plato to listen to soon made contradict be what socrates chiefly care about pericles came in too with aspasia to whom kindly introduced certainly be extraordinarily beautiful have great wit called attention to physical charm too much be silly since be quite capable of calling attention to afterwards since only alcibiades have seen wonderful statue strolled up to acropolis again to look at sunset socrates came too after have examined admired bronze goddess again went sat on step of temple of athene tried usual game of asking question till contradicted ourselves before long of refused to answer more saying that be aware that be totally ignorant of everything that there be longer need for to prove to then exactly how arose dont know think be from question answer have already passed began to weave most wonderful fable showing how that thought beautiful here on earth be reflection pale copy of beauty be eternal round outer rim of earth star said ran living stream of great river indeed be heaven

light still lingered shone like river of beauty socrates have told about till faded also from top above deep night be starry kirtled helen be most delightful person in world to tell story to however lamely tell be absorbed in never asks about weak point a other child do might for instance have asked if be correct about date did agamemnon come out in year that promachos be made instead who be asked dont tell be aspasia because dont like what told about no be not aspasia said rather hurriedly rather think have have turn in greece at other time didnt know then except perhaps in myth for be not sure that be not electra be nice asked helen be very nice to orestes oh dont who be orestes what nice name be sister thats about mythology just now plain quivered under sunlit haze of blue to

resisted albanian though flickering spirit of old grandeur flamed again when people rose against turkish rule in early part of last century what be to say of spirit of people when twelve year ago again fought ancient ancestral enemy turk strolled slowly southward from north of thessaly only intervention of power prevented greece again becoming turkish province hellenic battle cry went shrilly up to heaven hellenic army trotted like flock of sheep before foe until power said that war must cease only year before there have be revival of olympic game there have be race from marathon to athens

april so after have dined run like two child from room to room in house first to greet precious thing of home with fifi like animated corkscrew performing prodigy of circular locomotion round found that there be still large part of home to greet so went out into garden to see what april have brought forth there sudden riot conflagration of leaf flower like have seen blaze over lower slope of

to say perceive be freaked with jet a one who have highest appreciation of milton remarked to appreciate milton be reward of consummate scholarship be certainly very pleasant reflection for perhaps if be better scholar must think with appreciation of pansy freaked with jet a be merely conclude that milton be flower blind sad affliction helen be absolutely ultra japanese in observance of flower festival of mark dozen of red letter day in year can not of course be celebrated on fixed day since owing to vagary of climate there might not be single lily to be seen for instance year on actual day be lily day year ago wait instead like japanese until particular flower be in zenith of blossoming then proclaims festival other flower naturally sometimes be at best on red letter day of a observes be canonically correct since st simon st jude st philip st james be celebrated together be not therefore least surprised next morning when after short excursion to garden came in to breakfast saying

after long time helen spoke oh oh said that about expressed heart with pleasure fill added may always seems to matter for wonder why astronomer julius csar whoever be who took trouble to divide time up into month year must have made day of new year come in middle of winter probably have got something to do with solar eclipse lunar theory movement motion quite unintelligible to ordinary mind must easily have point of beginning new year in spring for instance on may day when season be clearly suitable for beginning again to make fresh start by candlelight in fog on first of january implies more vivid effort of imagination sterner resolve of spirit than most of able to manage might a well try to make up for misspent year by selecting blackfriar baker street station a place to start afresh in personally though think st of may must be quite reasonable occasion on to begin new year must prefer rather later date when summer be more certain be for reason that when formed hope harmless little project of putting down quiet happening of year of life began in june month by month kept diary will see when come to end of month of may that plan be endorsed by what happened then that new year must in future always begin for helen on first of june even with early day of may summer descended on mr holmes panama hat neat new suit of yellowish flannel made due appearance to confirm fact soon if go on will be handing ice instead of bun at tea party have often seen lately on lady link playing golf in little buttoned boot came to call yesterday told of charlotte engagement announced fact that archdeacon call mine because of what happened at dreadful sunday school be giving garden party on th wife of younger son of baronet have not be invited fact of garden party on th be not new to because have be invited oh revenge be sweet gloated over discomfiture of foe mother have be governess too be new fact that mr holmes have gathered in last half year just governess not in noble family even in employment of retired tradesman accounted for fact that daughter spoke french so well wonder since mother have to teach knowledge of language scrap of constantly introduced into conversation have always puzzled mr holmes now knew how have be acquired indeed have come rightly by poor thing none of grudged be wonder now to mr holmes that looked so thin probably have never have enough to eat when be child that indescribable air of commonness about be perfectly accounted for indeed mr holmes became so sardonic that must have thought that family be one a dare say be compared to plantagenet be parvenu helen changed subject thought be pity a wanted to hear ever so much more about lady obscure origin chatted very pleasantly for long time learned that morning post have said in little paragraph during past week that close county recommend that expression military be doing here be going to be very gay indeed there be already absolute clash of entertainment during week of cricket next month so that mayor be forced to give luncheon party one day instead of mere tea must probably not like at since if ever there be mayor who collected candle end be one did remember that be called champagne at famous lunch have already be spoken of in fact mr holmes shook head over general trend of affair spoke quite bitterly about wave of radicalism be passing over country county club so said have always prided on being little exclusive be tainted with commonness now have positively disgraced at last election by letting in three new member be nobody local nobody one son of doctor father of doctor third nobody at must believe there have be veterinary surgeon up for election a well luckily club have pulled together over given smart shower of black ball doubt club be in want of fund why then have built new billiard room how much better to poke butt end of cue into chimney piece a have always done when playing from over left hand middle pocket than purchase increased cue room at sacrifice of standing a county club if did not draw line somewhere where be to draw line be unanswerable said what be written tut looked very proud helen consider looked prouder than mr holmes disagrees with having seen own face in looking glass over mantelpiece true have not natural advantage mr holmes aquiline nose conferred upon assumed curl of lip be superb looked like duchess in own right how slowly beautiful day of may passed for when one be very happy very expectant time seems to stop exactly opposite happens when one be spending day be full of pleasure living entirely in moment for then hour day pas on unregarded so that be saturday again before know week have really begun happiness bungle with word over thing be obvious to everybody who know difference between happiness pleasure be thing quite detached from present moment just a sunlight flood down be not of happiness ever brood on wing swing high above thing of earth like poised eagle like sun illuminates what look on turning dew to diamond striking sapphire into heart of what have be grey sea be independent of material concern be world to be withdrawn extinguished must shine still true shine on dewdrop turn into wondrous prismatic colour thus common surface of life be always iridescent when be happy happiness that golden high swung sun doe not think particularly regard jewel make out of common thing own bright shining perhaps weave golden haze between what shine upon be somehow thus think that thing be with during first fortnight of may below golden haze be entrancing fact have just recorded about archdeacon party frightful disclosure concerning mother of wife of younger son of baronet growing plebeianism of county club helen must focus attention on for though a have said time went so slowly yet there be not time enough to regard belonged to different plane to on be living must penetrate down into giggle then attention wandered before knew have swum up again like bubble through water to sunlit surface there took place in fact revision in list of joyful dreadful affair one must appreciate humour of mr holmes more than helen did a have said must not attend to now must attend to perfectly hideous fact that greater part of ceiling in dining room in sloane street have fallen that tenant have quite reasonably demanded to be released from tenancy of there be still six week to run since house be uninhabitable did think must have cared if ceiling have smothered a sat at dinner dreadful earthquake in china failed to move so did church crisis in france for certain other thing cared more than ever though must have said be little enough growth of spring time made eye brighten ever grow dim again must dream over tiny bud of rose garden with smile be sped to mouth from inmost spring of happiness spread fat heliogabalian feast for bird since wanted nourishment now that be so busy over nest many dyspeptic bachelor spinster expect reeled daily from table laid on lawn to sleep off result of excess loved sun too more than have ever loved shade also day night firm great force of world not le too did love little thing of little room now never sat in drawing room with reynolds print went always to nursery with rocking horse noah ark lead soldier play table when there when playing silly game of soldier helen have be wont to play a if eternal salvation depended on nice adjustment of small tin cannon when pulled string shot pea have change of mood most disconcerting at first now again shot down generalissimo posted a must be out of possibility of attack almost in very rear of army by inconceivable ricochet must few week ago have filled mouth with laughter now when unspeakable fluke occurred upset heaviest soldier in brigade instead of being delighted be sorry apologized to injury be bad enough added insult be worse said be afraid must win now there be curious thing helen look over shoulder a write agrees that though still love to play soldier want to win consider before wanted to play game more childish game le worth while must have thought to play if did not care about winning besides be so exceedingly unlike be looking over shoulder more not to play game a if life death depended on now applauds skill luck apologizes for own then when game be over duke of wellington on one side julius csar on other lie dead still sits on ground beside low play

have laid banquet in dining room have arranged lady gentleman on stair so one must see at once that be going down to dinner from attitude tendency to lean against other wall might have thought that be trying to get upstairs after banquet that helen told be foolish since face be turned in direction of downstairs answer be that have indulged even more freely than have supposed be trying to get upstairs backwards yes did extremely childish thing so far from being ashamed of set down here for to laugh at if like merely to be bored with thing like playing at soldier at doll retained interest just a did spirit of blossoming summer when mr holmes discovery fall of ceiling in sloane street lacked calibre to interest if come to think of though thought explanation must be difficult nothing in world must be more simple thing about child birth growth be clearly only affair must concern one morning remember be found that foundation of cathedral be in dreadful state that must probably fall down told helen a be engaged on preparing gargantuan breakfast for bird only said oh what pity be cared for historic norman pile with kind of king queen buried inside there be nothing more to be recorded of month since only thing seemed to to have real importance be just childishness of have already given such amplitude of specimen until morning of last day of may rule of house be that there be rule of sort a regard breakfast anybody who came into dining room at most hour of morning must find breakfast perennial bread butter sugar milk morning paper marmalade on table must on ringing bell be given annual ie fresh tea hot dish similarly anybody who did not come into dining room be supposed to be breakfasting elsewhere not at so on last morning of may on coming down rang bell read paper till bacon came hour before have just looked into helen room seen that be still asleep bacon be rather long coming that morning try to reconstruct day exactly a happened have already skimmed news

for immortal principle of fire one hoped must not become swollen in head fortunate volcano whose cone have be blessed at moment heard step outside be not from kitchen be coming from upstairs came very quickly then instantaneously terror seized for time place be no longer now here be evening when heard name called in garden thereafter heard leg running downstairs quickly a step came seemed to to go on for ever yet have only just time to get up when there came fumbling hand on door helen maid came in if please sir must send at once began nurse there be quicker way than sending next minute be flying up road on bicycle mind a think must always happen with mind in such moment seemed curiously inactive though somewhere there be inside little bit of tissue so to speak that agonized hoped prayed for most only thought of one thing once before have gone on just same errand from same house up same road to fetch doctor for dearest friend o margery go quickly to god tell want then tissue that agonized prayed sank out of sight again be just speeding up sunny dusty road on a got nearer town traffic became denser once butcher cart pulled suddenly out into middle of road in front of
