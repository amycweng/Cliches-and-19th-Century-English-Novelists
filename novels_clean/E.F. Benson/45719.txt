indeed dear feel sure do little speech be admirably characteristic of mr fanshawe at one moment must be finding fault with everybody at next must shower tenderness on mattered nothing to that only few hour ago elizabeth have exchanged peculiarly clear cut opposed view on subject of dance be quite capable few hour later of assuming that be quite in accord about never have smallest qualm on subject of own sincerity a be habit of thoroughly insincere people be merely quite determined to get own way over point in have preference having got always proceeded to make charming in rather helpless clinging kind of manner whether husband have ever gone so far a to admit even to fact of insincerity be doubtful where affection be engaged lost power of criticism where loved swallowed whole mr fanshawe gave delicate little sigh very perfect appealing little sigh might have be supposed so finished be so perfectly phrased that have practised for year in private such be not case be quite natural to artificial self came to lip a spontaneously a song to thrush must see great deal of other next day elizabeth said before go off to gaiety delight of england how long to come with for be

when can get off of course must not hear of for know very well that to spend summer here must kill must not dream of distressing by suggesting occasionally elizabeth patience gave way before

embarrassment on face of serene moon by repeating to mere mortal unconsidered remark of hers a to cause stepmother moment loss of self composure smiled at butterfly lip even when mr fanshawe caused greatest irritation must not banish altogether instinct of protection tenderness towards remarkably well equipped little lady be really about a capable of taking care of a iron clad battleship anchored in calm sea with gun agape torpedo net spread conveyed so subtle impression of dependence timidity even victim of most trying insincerity relented towards a towards pretty child eager for enjoyment be so easy to strike smile off face good night little mamma said elizabeth have nice time dance dance sha disturb to morrow by practising a be going with daddy up khyber darling wo that be

marry than remain single have never dreamed desired that must be other man than who must conduct to goal of wish that be in degree in love with if phrase connotes anything luminous tumultuous must be idle to assert equally idle must be to deny that according to manner of aspiration seemed to ideal husband for ten adolescent year for be now twenty four have lived in stifling soul quelling comfort of mother house must have be strange if dead calm propriety of surroundings have not bred in corresponding immobility of emotion for there be something chameleon like in spirit of girl not powerfully

exhibited in confines of horizon have experienced seen others in grip thought indeed be certain that must like to be mistress in house where edward holroyd be master felt sure must make very

to be agitated about be fond of other neither have seen one else more desirable over heart of lay thick cobweb of comfort motor car prosperous affair unimpassioned content only a spoke felt vague soul eclipse dispersal of dream then drew towards kissed for one moment below cobweb in heart something stirred ever so faintly ever so remotely connected with slight roughness of close shaven face with faint scent of soap of cigarette did not embarrass stood there for moment looking into other face a if expecting something new something revealed will tell mother now asked still looked at be not

time be required for other besides time that there be be ours now in life have never phrased sentence so neat so nearly epigrammatic briskness be fruit of stimulus have come to delayed further went back to house where mr hancock be already waiting did not attempt to appear surprised at news placidly delighted at kissed took for granted that edward must come in to dine with that evening then since there be use in vain repetition reverted to topic have to be considered at once let see said think motor be round filson have brought down footstool from bedroom to see if be right height

beech be ten minute late in starting if be little late for tea wo matter for once in way tell mr williams lind that may be ten minute late for tea mr hancock habitually wore perfectly natural amiable smile on pleasant face except when rheumatism gave exceptional twinge more exceptionally yet mr williams be not quite up to mark to day discovery of footstool edith engagement seemed to to be touching example of care of providence be beamingly conscious of variety of pleasant object topic in world laid hand in edith a car started now want to hear about darling said oh look there be two magpie be not that lucky will let window quite down dear be so warm pleasant afternoon will have mine just way up there be nice now want to hear about edith returned affectionate pressure of mother hand be so sudden mother said yet be not at startled edward stopped when reached kitchen garden so stopped too without speech just asked said 'yes at once a have always meant to then said be very happy kissed mr hancock thought that denton be driving little too fast a if meant to make up lost ten minute checked from calling down tube to dearest said will never forget first kiss given by man who love oh what jolt jolt decided called to denton not to go quite so fast then pressed edith hand again tell more dear said have expected at edith looked at with complete candour oh yes said be why seemed so natural when came faintest flush glowed on face never liked so much before a when kissed said did not make feel at awkward used to think that if thing ever happened to must not know way to look seemed quite natural taste agree in so many thing too music croquet so on be good thing be not mr hancock beamed again dear of course said community of taste be battle be going to say strength joy of marriage oh here be in slough already turn to right denton go through burnham beech yes what game of croquet will have what music will get gate made in paling between garden ours so that there will be no need to

happy contented about look there be great western express what pace go edith usually gave excellent attention to various bright object continually caught pleased mother eye to day wandered rather did not wander be wonderful said have guessed mother have other thing a well to think about edward be quite right said footstool rather one on top of make difference will order very thick one from store sending height require think must give little dinner party before go to bath dear just to tell few friend news wish asparagus be little more forward how lovely beech be look at sweet little bird be

cousin elizabeth fancy if be bridesmaid before went back to india what lot must have to tell to uncle robert will soon have to begin to think when be to be mr hancock said more on subject for fact be that have not made up mind when wished marriage to take place have vaguely contemplated going to egypt with daughter next winter must not offhand balance disadvantage of going alone in case settled that edith must be married first with advantage of saving expense of taking then brilliant possibility struck edward might be induced to come too in case marriage must certainly take place first since then must of course pay for edith required consideration indeed there be many thing must need great deal of careful thought chief among already blotting out beauty of beech be whole question of settlement must naturally inherit whole of mother money at death event to be contemplated with only most distant recognition mr hancock have intention of making serious inroad into income handsome a be did not more than provide with everything wanted enable to put by nice round sum of money year be so much accustomed to do that be unreasonable to expect at age to break so prudent long established habit must depend to extent on edward attitude expectation have doubt that for part must do be generous must obviate necessity of being very open handed living next door edith must be able to come in to lunch day when be in city enjoy motor drive a usual without expense croquet lawn too must be quite at edward disposal practically be presenting young couple with motor car lunch daily croquet lawn kept in excellent order by elli straight away then there be wedding present to be thought of must be great expense elizabeth be going to spend four month at least with additional drain mr hancock began to feel quite worried pressed for money a be accustomed to do when having made considerable investment found have not more than two three hundred pound lying at bank edward arrived a have be already agreed hour before dinner found edith already dressed waiting for lover talk in drawing room lind have seen that housemaid have completed evening toilet of room strict injunction have be issued that two be not to be disturbed edward kissed again a soon a be left alone after interruption however sudden must have surprised fiery scene be placid content happy undisturbed by strong emotion unembarrassed by absence though a yet surface sign gave indication evenly hung balance have begun to quiver once more kiss woke in tremor of dim agitation while inwardly wondered though a yet unembarrassed at own want of emotion not for moment did regret what have done be happy in event of day only little surprised little scornful of for finding that felt so precisely a have anticipated that must feel have not expected to be inflamed with sudden rapture be not dimly saw that adventure to be committed promised more to than did to be ashamed of yet to have definite promise charming girl whom liked whom admired with whom be in sympathy have consented to share life with to one must have so willingly offered a to who have so willingly accepted horizon such a be be filled with only wondered that vaguely what lay over that horizon rim found difficulty in framing lip to sense nonsense of lover talk have be too happy afternoon to do anything said have just sat strolled thought waited possessed of hand told how capable be yet how soft how pretty hitherto have not given many thought to hand now realized that particular one concerned admired be strong fine ah be having bad influence upon already said if make idle suddenly appeared to wonderful beautiful thing that charming girl must be saying intimate thing response be almost eager be only idle from happiness said be wonderful must have have go to tea with foolish people whom did not want to see make misanthropic a well be not ashamed if make happy something stirred within new beating pulse came little closer to looked so nice edward said afternoon when stopped spoke must bear tie will knit one same shade of brown a eye will do at bath be great nuisance going to bath said must really go want here tie will be lovely oh conceit said after have told be to be colour of eye forgot be being rather malicious looked up from hand to face never before have noticed how bright abundant be hair how delicate line of black eyebrow corrected malicious did say asked meant meant delicious talking of eye must give turquoise engagement ring for day sapphire one for evening what have to do with eye asked everything yours be light blue in sunlight dark blue at night feel a if ought to apologize think will be fault insist said insist on knowing one thing when when what do mean asked look in face say know edith laughed happy little quiver of laugh that have never heard yet must if liked said choose to if mean be exactly what mean how can know before have said asked can do say what mean again laughed when will be married be what meant looked extremely pretty rather shy have never noticed before how fine be mouth how fine fair curve of upper lip yes sapphire turquoise said lip said brain said sonorous tone of chinese gong manipulated with so cunning crescendo diminuendo by lind boomed through house immediately afterwards mr hancock tread noticeably heavy be heard on stair hummed little nameless ditty in warning edith got up dinner already said edward perhaps be not quite so much surprised at swiftness of passage of half hour before have answered question said a door opened chapter iv comfortable plan have day of judgment other devastating crisis be fixed for morrow must not have delayed mr hancock retirement to bedroom not later than eleven night before sometimes not rarely went upstairs at past ten in order to get good night before fatigue of next day might happen to be in case unless by chance went to theatre in town be later than eleven did not always go to bed immediately on arrival in room frequently after have played invariable game of patience while filson brushed hair read book since a so often lamented have so little time for reading during day sometimes sat in front of fire making further plan for comfort to night plan occupied for considerable time though directly concerned edith might still be correctly classified a bearing on own comfort have literally enjoyed hour conversation with edward after dinner have be of highly satisfactory character for have ascertained that be making really substantial income that have investment of sound character already amounted to over thirty thousand pound in event of death to apparently did not mind alluding at be prepared to settle on wife house next door be freehold property of though have contemplated selling purchasing one be more of size to edith be accustomed seemed perfectly ready to fall in with mr hancock clearly expressed wish that must remain where be for wrench of parting with edith at be only tolerable to if parting be not to be more than few yard in breadth question of garden gate in paling did not however fill with intense enthusiasm after making quite clear that be not expected to pay for let subject drop intended to give elli necessary instruction same for be quite sure must like when be done furthermore have not expressed least curiosity a regard what allowance dowry be intending to give edith showed very proper confidence must not in fact have behaved with greater delicacy yet that delicacy have put mr hancock so to speak rather in hole have to determine by light of own generosity alone what be prepared to do be point now occupied after have written note to store ordering footstool nine inch high covered in dark red shade of russia leather so be off mind edward have given quite warm welcome to scheme of egyptian expedition have expressed readiness to take holiday summer have vacation then in case marriage in month honeymoon with bride reunion with mr hancock at cairo be ideal arrangement kindled mr hancock sense of generosity for must relieve her of expense of edith on egyptian tour in first glow of gratification proposed to herself to settle on edith sum must produce four hundred pound year be almost surprised at for unhesitating open handedness sat down to consider just what meant four hundred year represented capital of over ten thousand pound seemed great deal of money to put without restriction into hand of girl who hitherto have be accustomed to control only allowance for dress pocket money paid quarterly must be much more prudent indeed kinder to give at first anyhow till by experience in household management became accustomed to deal with larger sum quarterly allowance a before four hundred year be more than double what have be accustomed to doubt edward who be clearly soul of generosity must give le edith must then be mistress for own private expense alone of le than eight hundred year be colossal affluence enough carefully used for upbringing support of entire family must never spend eight hundred year there be need for to save since be wife of well to do husband heiress to considerable fortune so much money must be burden to if mother allowed two hundred year added to what edward must doubt insist on giving mr hancock have settled that must certainly give a much a have originally thought of giving must make more than ample allowance thought went back for moment to note to store lay on table certainly footstool made motor drive much more comfortable since edith be going to accompany to bath mother must not bear thought that must lack comfort gave must order two footstool without moment hesitation opened letter made necessary alteration there be done how pleased edith must be returned to question of allowance viewing a be from rather greater distance hoped prayed that edith must have child who must certainly adore granny granny must certainly adore must be nothing le than joy to to give of say hundred pound birthday to be prudently invested for so that when came of age must have tidy little fortune of own glowed with pleasure when thought of child education be great expense must be so nice for edward to know that a child of came of age must have waiting for quite little income of own capitalized sum must start boy in life provide quite dowry for daughter at compound interest money doubled in time must be young men woman of independent mean perhaps edith must have five six child though mr hancock munificence must then be costing six hundred year interest on fifteen thousand pound felt that must be greatest delight to pinch to make end meet for sake of being such fairy granny if be paying edith two hundred year time very queen of fairy granny must scarcely be able to afford felt quite sure that edith must choose to have child provided for rather than for have most unselfish of nature hitherto edith have received hundred fifty year for dress travelling expense when went alone have done very well on be always neat tidy now without doubt husband must pay travelling expense since must always travel together even if continued to give edith hundred fifty pound year that with travelling expense paid by husband allowance a before of four hundred year from must be far more than must possibly require besides mother have already settled to provide lunch for day while edward be in town motor drive afterwards while to keep croquet lawn at pitch of perfection a so fine player a edward must expect be determined must find must mean very likely gardener at rate man to come in once twice week to help elli then there be trousseau to be thought of mr hancock be invincibly determined to provide must cost more than whole of edith allowance for year certainly with necessary visit to bath winter in egypt have promised edward must manage with expense of having elizabeth in house summer must be very poor indeed for next year seemed really unreasonable that for twelve month must give edith allowance at by time please god there might be little grandchild to begin providing for evidently must have to be very careful saving thought of for whom must be stinting made such sacrifice work of joy pleasure for moment looked at note to store again wondering whether must not be possible to put one footstool between to be shared by red leather be very expensive then there be wedding present to be thought of though be determined to give edith whole trousseau meant to behave lavishly in respect glowing with prospective delight of giving opened bramah locked jewel safe be let into bedroom wall quite longed to clasp round edith neck four fine row of pearl have come to from late husband be impossible since be convinced be heirloom must remain in possession till death there be diamond tiara be true be own property be far too matronly ornament for young bride diamond tiara also be out of place in heathmoor have not once worn in ten year that have lived there be use giving dear edith jewel that must lock up in safe then there be emerald necklace of admirable stone be old fashioned green never suited edith disliked green must not wear pink be favourite colour here be very thing dog collar of beautiful coral with pearl clasp how often have edith admired how often have mother thought of giving there be charming moonstone brooch too set in dear little turquoise blue pink must go deliciously together a matter of fact turquoise be rather green too be late time have flown over liberal scheme locked up coral necklace moonstone brooch in drawer by edith drawer instantly christened said prayer with overflowing heart went to bed just before fell asleep made up mind to order new morocco box lined with dark blue velvet with edith new initial in gilt upon to hold wedding gift then there be edward must give something must use take pleasure in there be sense in giving present be not useful suddenly excellent idea struck how pleased must be at remembering want have expressed other day want be only one item out of gift contemplated must give whole set might keep in garden house since must use here must be necessary to write letter to store what lot of thing there be to think about provide when young people be going to be married little party mr hancock invited to receive officially news of edith engagement be delighted to be able to accept even though notice be so short dinner giving at heathmoor though during summer croquet lawn tennis party with iced coffee caviare sandwich be of almost daily occurrence indeed sometimes clashed be chiefly confined to saturday evening when sense of early train on morrow made writing on wall to check conviviality mr hancock knew that quite well though in note to guest have said if by chance happen to be disengaged on tuesday must have be much surprised if previous engagement have forced one to be obliged to decline personally must have liked to get together somewhat larger gathering for elli said there be doubt about sufficiency of asparagus lind invariably set hatchet like face against party of more than eight considered sufficiently festive number in earlier year of lind iron rule mr hancock have sometimes invited larger party on occasion service have be so slow wine so sparingly administered be demeanour if remonstrated next morning so frozen fatalistic so full of scarcely veiled threat

happy for sake of others oh must take more asparagus elli must be miserable if be not eaten be only second time have have year for moment thought of telling mr martin to supply with asparagus while be at bath duty of making happy prevailed refrained for occurred to elli might dispatch daily bundle early in morning in cardboard box so that must reach bath in time to be cooked for dinner hotel commissariat must certainly not rise to asparagus so early in season mr martin in meantime with one sycophantic ear open to catch husband joke be full of fancy ejaculation to mr beaumont who be describing to romantic history of female oak egger exercised so extraordinary fascination on young male for mile around here mr dobbs be lacking in felicity for remarked that great many unmarried young lady must be glad to know how female oak egger did mr beaumont made unnecessary for mr dobbs even to frown at so rapidly did wonder whether be called oak egger because laid upwards of million

silver lining though not for massacred savoury of mr dobbs be easily induced to take second helping brought dinner to what musician call full close then came moment of evening port be ruthlessly

future son in law health dear dear child mr beaumont instantly led off musical honour on so high note that of party who must sing followed with faint gasp scream under cover of hubbub of comment congratulation followed shyly eagerly edith eye sought future husband when eye met hers felt heart rap out tumultuous dozen of unbidden beat fast sweetly suffocating then blushed furiously at sudden self accusation of indelicacy of unmaidenness heart acquitted her of indictment be not right to give tattoo of welcome start for bath be made in strict accordance with scheduled plan filson with heavy luggage on top of motor accompanied by lind lunch freshly cut bundle of asparagus destined for mr hancock dinner in evening left house in such good time that have to wait twenty five minute at station took exactly three to reach motor returned in time for lind to serve mr hancock breakfast with finish decorum to be accustomed then new nine inch footstool mr hancock have decided against extravagance

bestowed full five minute before appointed time car slid silently away from door with possible provision made for comfortable journey first five minute be spent in verifying presence of convenience mr hancock sank back on carefully adjusted cushion there said be in for now dear if go a well a have begun will be at bath by five how much nicer than fuss of crossing london risk of having somebody put into carriage fancy never having thought of motoring to bath before oh look there be mr martin going to play golf how early be morning perhaps will see mr beaumont with butterfly net then a soon a get into main road will have look at morning paper there have not be minute to glance at yet perhaps must look at for dear edith tell what there be motion always make print dance little before eye expect

by motor then will be on look out see too why be at slough already there be great western line filson train will go along there if have started three four hour earlier train might have gone by a passed must have looked out of window seen must have be coincidence car ran so smoothly on excellent surface of bath road mr hancock found that print of morning post have not smallest tendency to dance reserving a usual leader longer paragraph for digestive period after lunch soaked gently a in warm bath in announcement of arrival in london of people have never seen appearance at opera of have never heard of what taste exactly be gratified by tit bit of information must be hard to say possibly sense so many people be moving backwards forward enhanced enjoyment of own leisure mentally contrasted bustle be incident to journey from paris with own smooth unhurrying progress to bath edith meantime following mother suggestion that must look out of window in order to be able to communicate to edward object of interest to be seen by road soon passed from external observation to introspection last four five day since have so unemotionally accepted offer of to have about something of unconjectured surprise of dawn when after night of travel darkness begin to lift off from face of new unfamiliar country be in image who took place of light country gradual illumination revealed a soaked through dissolved web of darkness be for be undeniable truth that love that absorption of self in self can not take place till giver have notion of nature of gift that brings edith

that name be edith hancock year twenty four complexion fair for arrow of love be at least feathered with egotism will not fly unless conscious personality enables to steer straight flutter dip reach mark at first frankly be appalled by barrenness light of lover showed appeared to be level land without stream inspiring hill top country uncovetable featureless mountainous acreage be not stonily barren even eye unaccustomed to light that revealed saw that be barren from emptiness empty perhaps only a winter field be bare be not unkindly inhospitable land very soil of cried out told that day image of empty country not unkindly hung in mind even a unborn melody hovers little above brain of musician until condensing like dew melt into day very gradually for dawn of love come seldom in blinding flash of sun upleaping over horizon rather in slow crescendo of illumination a of waxing flame that will mount to who know what transmitted fire first wonderful twilight of day grew rosy in morning rose showed saw also whom welcomed eagerly with strong sense of possession claimed be to that belonged be hers to be loved adored also to be owned outwardly be edith whom mother knew though in spirit be beginning change must soon make old self thing unrecognizable to clearer vision be scarcely strange that mr hancock saw hint of change for a may have be perceived have gift limitation of being completely taken up with surface of thing indeed to mind inquiry into mechanism of spirit pulse be of same indelicacy a discussion of function operation of human body if body be ill went quickly to doctor did not call friend attention to infirmity if soul be ill mr hancock soul be never ill have satisfaction of seeing great many more great western train at reading passed out into delectable country beyond then totally unexpected difficulty began to occur with regard to spot where must stop take lunch just outside reading indeed there be seen entirely suitable place secluded shady out of wind strongly recommended by denton unfortunately be then only quarter past one mr hancock have not intended to lunch till half past therefore pushed on going rather slow so a not to miss really proper encamping ground ten minute later be again favoured by oak tree sheltering hedge here unfortunately tramp be asleep by wayside at moment might wake prove to be intoxicated mr hancock be quite sure must not enjoy lunch in vicinity further on again there be wayside cottage too near proposed halting place for child might come out of stare cottage be succeeded by smell of brick field before long tilehurst began to show up roof be necessary to get clear of tilehurst on far side before sort of serenity must be hoped for then for nearly mile have to follow impenetrable flock of sheep be imperative to get well ahead of pangbourne appeared be already after two o'clock will hardly be credited that have scarcely got free of contaminating village when tyre punctured halt be inevitable

will never give edward cause for more be sure than did men be like sometimes seem to be able to help be quite devoted to so sprang from good cause yes used to read mr browning poem though be very fond of mr browning too mr mr browning what lot of poetry must have read to other made up by wonder if understood a well a father never found difficulty about carrying on sense between line think be hardest part to think that now be going through same happy time darling look be half past three must turn at once else will never get home in time for tea will tell denton down tube to turn a soon a possibly can when get home will let read copy of mr browning poem father gave have heard from edward morning when come will have to talk to about business business talk so far a mr hancock be concerned followed on line have laid down for herself in matter of allowance for edith took place next morning have suggested more usual course that respective solicitor must represent client view to other mr hancock preferred personal direct interview felt that edward who be so generous must understand somewhat peculiar position that fully intended to take up whereas more practical le sympathetic mind of solicitor might not see thing in so romantic light so edith be informed when be twenty minute to eleven time that must put hat on while edward be told that be quite excusable that must not want to go to church after sitting in airless office week be little chilly asked to shut completely window of sitting room now dear edward said must have little business talk be sure will soon be done since be a certain to approve of plan about edith a be to approve of mine then when have talked over can instruct solicitor will draw up settlement please smoke cigarette will be more comfortable so there be mr hancock indeed felt perfectly comfortable have pictured plan in such delicious grandmotherly colour to herself that must not fail to touch edward heart proceeded to lay before be what call fairly off dear said indeed put by little year though a know to do live extremely simply just with ordinary little comfort of life to have be accustomed now at death penny of fortune will go to edith with exception of two three little bequest to servant at present be something over hundred thousand pound edith will enjoy that for many many year after be gone mr hancock felt a if be making deed of tremendous generosity sense of allusion to own death caused eye to stand in moisture wiped away with one of new handkerchief be so expensive be beginning at end said must come back to present mean dear edward to give edith whole of trousseau will be very much vexed with if want not to let have way about everything can want indeed much more than ever have in way of frock linen will be hers will be paid for by put cigarette in mouth think of interrupting beamed delightedly at sure that have not positively forbidden must have protested against munificence munificence too really thought when considered how much lace be not great plan said know so well without telling that will shower on edith more than girl accustomed to simplicity of life have hitherto led can possibly dream of spending so have thought of great expense please god will certainly come upon have not expect taken into consideration child dear edward want to be pleasure privilege to provide for with careful management will be able to give of child a be born sum of hundred pound on one of birthday if live to be hundred fifty pound more to mr hancock car sounded immense be true that original plan have be to make yearly birthday gift hundred pound to of in interval between forming that idea to day have seen that scheme must amount to lavishness be positively unreasonable if not actually wrong be true that be not exactly likely that must continue to be in position to shower largess on child be yet unborn for hundred year after birth unless be to outrival decade of old parr sentence sounded well expressed though hyperbolically sumptuous extent of intention have to climb down from great height proceeded to small detail take cigarette edward said otherwise will be arguing with a have quite made up mind there must be use in dear be very determined person when once mind be made up sha listen to remonstrance so need trouble to make there can afford to do since can be determined to now a regard smaller matter know be very well off want to spare extra expense that possibly can hundred little scheme occur to send to sleep at night with thinking what can take on shoulder for assure be little drain on one purse make big hole in so in first place let tell that motor bill for tyre petrol need be penny more after marriage than be to day intend that edith will tell so will consider car a hers in exactly same manner a have always considered ours will say morning afternoon whenever feel inclined can have drive with on tyre on petrol will be sure when be away in city that car wo be scouring over country eating up penny make there be psychical phenomenon known a suggestion whereby operator produce hypnotic effect on subject causing mind to receive adopt desired attitude for moment at rate mr hancock be producing effect on edward own sublime conviction that be making most generous provision infected a reeled off string of benefit there be subtle condition under suggestion act perhaps did not appreciate for at point effect began to wear off probably must have stopped there unfortunately continued may be that began to see through thus enabled subject to see through household book too said have conception have edith for take year of careful housekeeping to understand about have conception what economy can be made in if practise what tremendous drain be let say that edith be alone for lunch while be in city order fillet of sole cutlet with french bean little cherry tart perhaps peach to finish up with for dear edith have excellent appetite be glad to say be not like so many woman who when be alone have sandwich on tray piece of cake find getting anaemic run down in consequence edith a be saying order decent little lunch like what be accustomed to day like when be alone at end of week must wonder if lunch have cost twenty five thirty shilling well want to spare expense there will be lunch for edith day at house so that household book for purse will be couple of poached egg in morning plain little dinner in evening if want to be alone with otherwise can both find dinner warm welcome dear a often a like where have lunch even if cost gardener be determined to have croquet lawn a good a croquet lawn can be can come across play on have cup of tea whisky soda with day like mean to turn house into hotel for darling where will ask for like motor what not never have bill sent in to everything provided edward year round warmest welcome from old proprietress there think can say more than certainly mean le about wedding present will say nothing because mean to be surprise suggestive glamour have faded edward found adding up in clear sighted business like manner what amounted to immediately result seemed to be that mr hancock must have edith companionship at lunch in drive that must play croquet next door edith day before have alluded to mother childlike pleasure in plan seemed to that certain power of parsimonious calculation presided over childlikeness be not without sense of surprise almost of incredulity that made inference mr hancock have intention of giving daughter allowance of settling anything on for must not by stretch of malignant criticism be called niggardly close handed felt justified in making quite sure of unlooked for situation then propose to settle anything on edith said make allowance knew that be perfectly proper suggestion to make that absence of provision for edith be ludicrous yet moment have made suggestion be sorry understood also what edith have meant by childlikeness for mr hancock face changed suddenly from beaming delighted aspect looked pathetic hurt misunderstood be clear that have taken sincerest pleasure in devising dazzling plan at present anyhow cost nothing in avoiding direct expenditure have quite certainly convinced herself of own generosity of unselfish thought ingenuity caused to lie awake at night have devised scheme miserliness ingenuity of be so perfectly transparent to anybody else be not felt convinced transparent to hurriedly corrected be a if have unthinkingly taken toy away from child now made utmost haste to restore to anticipate howl in preparation for have opened mouth how stupid of said have quite forgotten in multitude of gift that be providing with such generosity for child of course do instead of giving money to edith think be delightful plan why will be heir heiress by time grow up lunch drive for edith too will never be lonely while be away in town croquet everything never heard so many nice plan knew be being weak be yielding on point on really have business to yield in order to avoid scene be quite ridiculous be aware of fact to treat middle aged wideawake woman a if be child to give anything to prevent howling morality of matter did not trouble at be like child saw resemblance le striking be resemblance to selfish child to very miserly grown up person did not really doubt that part of brain carefully walled up sequestered knew that be acting in thoroughly miserly manner entirely refused to attend to treating a treat involuntary suggestion of disobedient mind putting from even a put away secular reflection when in church indulging instead painting in tender vivid colour image of beloved old granny not so old incessantly signing most sumptuous cheque for benefit of beloved chick looking from drawing room window on to velvet napped croquet lawn where edward stood with brimming whisky soda while edith child tugging at skirt went through hoop after hoop loved to see everybody happy round enjoying fruit of bounty if incidentally gained companion in daily drive at rate edith must not sit solitary over expensive lunch while edward be in town if in reality be somewhat selfish person one insincere how much more comfortable that must think that be brimming with kind plan for other people when a matter of fact be only making most pleasing scheme for herself be not possible entirely to agree with in estimate of herself there be certainly no use in distressing by letting know that saw through have hypnotized by excessive gazing into creed about dissension from be only likely to make think that dissentient be unkind not shake belief in own tender benevolence started from even a euclid start amazing proposition from certain postulate if did not accept postulate must not proceed further in company normal human vanity render complete self knowledge impossible complete self blindness be almost equally uncommon at very back of mind mr hancock knew very well that be acting in manner if occurring in anybody else must have unhesitatingly labelled mean never indulged in such thought about turned deliberate back upon for be rankly inconsistent with spirit of cheerful selfishness be key to character shut door on a shut on tale of misery crime ignoring if necessary denying existence if be easy to spoil childlike pleasure be easy also to restore in integrity edward assurance that have never heard so many nice plan be amply sufficient for again well favoured face beamed with delighted smile thought must like said shutting door not only on knowledge of meanness on also have idea what pleasure be to to make so since approve will regard share of arrangement a settled now for part be certain will be a satisfied with what intend to do a be with intention before go on must tell have to do must have deed drawn up be deed call be careful not to spoil pleasure time think be scarcely necessary said see be be making settlement on edith have promised to do certain thing for child for present anyhow interrupted see said must be certain to tell whenever be necessary for to have deed drawn up will be always ready to do to thank for reminding well then settled in chair with air of pleased expectation must be confessed secret gratification that have not got to put name to anything at will draw up will said settling whole of property on edith in trust for child if have if not for use during lifetime in other word will enjoy interest on money though property will be in hand of trustee amount at present to about thirty thousand pound edward paused for be clear that mr hancock be pondering point let thoroughly understand said in case of death edward without child though really be quite horrid to think about thing if wanted to build little house will say must not be able to put hand on three four thousand pound must have income from money for life mr hancock be almost a eager to secure financial advantage for edith a be to retain own herself almost not quite must find difficult to live in suitable house sort of house to have be accustomed on interest of thirty thousand pound said do think so mean about fifteen hundred year yes know dear very nice pleasant little income must think what have be accustomed to for must say though a know live very simply yet have never grudged edith anything think if be ill long illness be so terribly expensive must not be better to insure life settle on so that must have little fund for rainy day know husband insured life long before married edward stiffened little think then might look to for assistance said ah how pleased must be to make economy for sake said with feeling what if be no longer here to help in case will have money in complete command remarked be undoubtedly case be not possible to pursue that particular line of grabbing further smiled at not quite so tenderly dear how sharp city make business men observed heathmoor seemed to have done pretty well in line for did not draw attention to think feel inclined to make further provision over said edith be coming to must remind quite portionless sudden resentment at attitude seized how must be if insured life for let say ten thousand pound suggested settled on mr hancock became dignified at death said already come into considerable fortune very well quite agree with that further provision be necessary mr hancock have not much liked reminder edith came portionless to did not want that section of argument for really be becoming argument pursued further retreated into stronghold of satisfaction again now about allowance will make asked genially be proposing to give two hundred fifty year for private personal expense said mr hancock smile completely faded yes said yes gather from tone that be not satisfied said there be short rather unpleasant pause then assumed air of confiding candour did expect dear edward said that must make rather larger allowance than for be use denying must mind not smoking cigarette just yet air be getting quite thick now just a have told quite frankly what think of provision for edith so will tell there be nothing like perfectly frank talk for getting over difficulty life dear edith have have very handsome allowance from with really nothing to spend on except dress pair of boot deny have often stinted so a not to stint what mother have done that think husband must do think consider how many more call married woman have on purse than girl living at home running up to london to get household necessity for greater expenditure on dress that married woman must make beyond what girl requires indeed see how edith can manage on sum mention be sympathy with mr hancock childlike pleasure evaporated did not believe for moment that very handsome allowance given by mother amounted to anything like sum proposed knew also that sum proposed be very reasonable one if must tell how much have hitherto spent said must have guide mr hancock did not in least wish to do mean to say that dear edith be extravagant said there be great deal of difference between extravagance counting penny there have be need for to do be not accustomed to be impossible for to ask point blank what edith allowance have be be impossible also to ask girl must not do such thing be contrary to average politeness of behaviour be true that when settled to give edith allowance said supposed that must also give something did not know what intention might be mr hancock brightened do now dear edward said said quite appreciate dear be expression used warmed heart so oh yes have never heard so many nice plan be going to provide assure more cost better will be pleased for child when give edith oh so gaily into care that will be part be pleased with dare say have never occurred to thought very likely that must give edith hundred hundred fifty year so that must have three hundred fifty four hundred pound of own year then indeed must be well off must be a comfortable a have ever be suddenly intolerable sordidness of discussion struck justly told that be none of making must at rate decline to let continue did not hug over generosity for knew that in comfortable circumstance made real difference whether gave edith four hundred year not merely must not possibly go on bargaining disputing got up will have four hundred year said mr hancock gave little cry of delight exactly what thought that generosity must insist on giving said be nice to find how well agree be sure must what delicious sunny morning book two chapter vi elizabeth enters elizabeth be sitting with cousin in garden house at end of croquet lawn waiting for sound of

continue anything resembling intimate conversation elizabeth rose just a mr hancock came out on to gravel walk below drawing room window have be waiting at least three minute thing to be wholly unaccustomed except when going by train then for sake of corner seat facing engine cheerfully waited twenty elizabeth be quite unconscious of severity of scrutiny on part of aunt a ran across lawn jumped over flower bed did detect slightest intention of sarcasm in mr hancock greeting arc nearly ready elizabeth asked if so car have be waiting time be quite ready aunt julia said be so looking

lunatic with butterfly net edith say be mr beaumont fell down so talked sister came out of wood oh believe be again coming along road towards now dear what odd conduct on part be seemed only thing to do have better bow to aunt julia mr hancock felt slightly bewildered by so puzzling question of etiquette a involved by girl conversing with total stranger particularly when stranger turned out to be mr beaumont at six o'clock in morning prudence prevailed will look at view out of side window said mr beaumont encountered pair of profile mr beaumont butterfly net being left behind mr hancock thought well to take advantage of opportunity for few general remark already have be kept waiting be interrupted be faced with problem arising from quite unheard of conduct on elizabeth part a gentian thrust blossom through snow so at base of cordiality of tone lay frozen rigidity a custom be when wanted to say something of correcting improving nature laid hand softly then squeezed on elizabeth be symbolical of affectionate nature of intention ca tell dear elizabeth said how have be looking forward to coming here be quite certain will have happiest summer together hope wo find manner custom expected of young lady in england very strange though know be so different to what be quite right proper in india with desert black people most interesting must be be greatly looking forward to hearing about be sure when tell will want to go to india here for instance dear edith must never dream of taking walk at six o'clock in morning alone when there might be kind of people about talking to stranger thinking even of driving motor car dear if must reach down tube blow through then say 'to right please denton will take very pleasant round will get back ten minute before lunch have time to rest cool have started few minute sooner when car came round must have have time to go long round past very pretty mill wanted to show a be will take shorter round there be mr hancock quiet masterfulness in agreeable remark leaden imperturbability formed so large factor in phenomenon of getting own way in own manner of everybody else doing in long run what wished until be reduced to state of abject vassalage in immediate circle found effect produced on elizabeth though not complete be material be afraid that be fault did start punctually aunt julia said must go round by mill same be little late for lunch mr hancock laughed make other people unpunctual a well said dear when anybody have be unpunctual be never unpunctual rule be to get back to punctuality a soon a possible start fair again will go to mill day for hope will have plenty of drive together about mr beaumont hardly know what to do if only naughty girl have not got up stayed quietly in bed a meant to do must never have happened think best plan will be for to ask to lunch with then introduce quite fresh so that will see that mean to forget about meeting on heath look here be golf link very likely will see mr martin playing be clergyman be most lucky to have yes upon word there be now see car be waving cap well be coincidence meeting for now will recognize again when see in surplice hood in church to morrow morning dear be first sunday in month there will be communion after morning service mr martin never call matins say that be roman catholic name how quickly sunday come round elizabeth looked out of window at celebrated mr martin saw that here be opportunity for saying what felt must say to aunt before sunday morning talk have have with father on reality of religious belief to have be renewed before left india with consent have made up mind not to go to church while reason for so doing remained inconclusive to to attend public worship seemed to symbolical act outward sign of something that in truth be non existent be like red socialist joining in national anthem have promised indeed promise be one with desire of heart to pray not to let neglect cement want of conviction aunt julia said want to tell something be that want to go to church doe mean anything to oh be afraid be shocked seemed justifiable apprehension elizabeth said mr hancock how can say such wicked thing roused girl be not wicked said hotly be very cruel of to say so have long talk two talk with daddy about agrees with be very sorry agrees be hard to convey exactly impression made on mr hancock mind if elizabeth have confessed to systematic course of burglary murder must not have be more shocked must have be more shocked if niece have announced intention of appearing at dinner without shoe stocking conventional outrage in fact be about a distressing to a moral one knew of course perfectly well that even in well regulated heathmoor certain most respectable inhabitant who often sat at table be accustomed to spend sunday morning on golf link instead of at public worship never for moment thought of classing with elizabeth must not have explained that be merely matter of common knowledge grown up men did not seem to need to go to church so much similarly be right for to smoke strong cigar after dinner whereas fact that elizabeth have consumed one of mr beaumont cigarette have be cognizant of appalling occurrence must have seemed to almost inconceivable breach of decency girl went to church did not smoke here be statement of two very simple fundamental thing hardly know what to say to said talking to mr beaumont be nothing to must ask to be silent for little while elizabeth while collect thought on first drive too hoped must enjoy so much although being late made impossible for to go round by mill a have planned poor lady pleasure be quite spoiled not being accustomed to arrange thought in order except when be forming careful plan for own comfort found collection of desired difficult of attainment very quickly began to see that own comfort be seriously involved gave starting point must be known by now throughout heathmoor that niece from india have come to stay with for summer must be seen that niece sat with in pew just below pulpit almost seat in church faced eastward with one two others ran at right angle to be thus in full view of congregation followed that unless explained be absence sunday by sunday when there be always general chat except on first sunday of month at gate into churchyard by cold other non existent complaint be really not to be thought of circle of friend must necessarily come to most shocking conclusion a to elizabeth non appearance certainly mr martin must notice must be duty to inquire into must be most uncomfortable if inquiry be made of must not imagine giving real reason false one doubt if mr martin talked to elizabeth must soon awake in that sense of religious security of soothed confident trust trust a complete a with sane person awaited rising of sun in morning to mr hancock connoted christianity that must talk to implied that must know what ailed in case rest of heathmoor must notice elizabeth absence from church be very dreadful puzzling be doubt result of prolonged sojourn in india where heathen in spite of mission to did not subscribe be still in such numerical preponderance cause of elizabeth proposed absence did not in reality so greatly trouble what spoiled pleasure in case be uncomfortableness of situation if be seen to be consistently absent from eleven o'clock service then light began to break conventional argument flocked to assistance of beleaguered conventionality be so shocked distressed dear said though will tell dare say that there be little good in on lovely morning too of reason for not going to church will not speak now be thinking of effect one know that be here with unless be to say be unwell sunday morning what be to say indeed must not bring to say be unwell keep on repeating of course say 'not at home ' when be not convenient to receive caller on subject like must be out of question there be mr beaumont again seem always to be meeting servant too lind denton filson will all certainly know go to church mr williams who ca go though be sure must if duty allowed to will be certain to hear moving about from kitchen will talk among say how odd be will offend dear know what be said about giving offence be sure did not think of mr hancock have only just thought of consider effect absence must have assure often often have felt inclined not to go on sunday morning must much prefer when be wet to read psalm lesson at home even then lind filson others must know that be only weather prevented must see prayer book bible lying about elizabeth again interrupted need say more aunt julia said certainly will go to church on sunday seems to that must be offence against hospitality for to refuse be part of routine be not rule of house on ground will go will satisfy mr hancock found that have shocked distressed be sensibly ameliorated feeling of lind filson must be spared chat at churchyard gate must be a cheerful a usual beamed on niece knew must see in right light if be put to said with regard to reason for not wanting to go must like to talk to mr martin about be so wise anyhow will hear preach can not imagine one hearing mr martin preach without feeling absolute truth of what say that will talk of time dear be back at golf link again have made loop see if be mr martin going into club house fancy seeing twice in morning well have have nice drive after when get in must remind to give volume of sermon by grandfather in tell about own doubt when be young man how fought overcame be so beautifully put after that never have more doubt at will get back ten minute before luncheon time be just what like to do edward be only guest that evening during dinner elizabeth found observing somewhat closely coming to conclusion about certainly be good looking be well bred quiet of voice found nothing in to distinguish from host nothing to must account for lighting up of edith face when looked at have couple of stock exchange joke to repeat one of made mr hancock call naughty subject of perennial interest such a weather train service appeared that director be going to cut off vexing three minute in evening train from town took turn with hardy annual such a forthcoming croquet tournament ripening strawberry crop new play going on in town criticism of mr hancock have read in morning post followed much debated action of censor in refusing to license biblical drama called david infused tinge of extra vividness in discussion mr hancock exhibited considerable ingenuity in avoiding word bathsheba mr beaumont be talking to about other day said said cousin who be in lord chamberlain office told that there be question about having licence refused there be episode quite unfit for stage everybody looked regretfully at dessert be very glad be stopped continued mr hancock feel so uncomfortable at theatre if think there be something coming be quite have read in lesson in church aunt julia asked elizabeth yes dear what be suitable to read be often not suitable for stage for part even if do give 'parsifal in town will not think of going to be not quite parallel to david bathsheba said elizabeth straight out lind be at elbow too with savoury do come in to morrow afternoon edward said mr hancock with extraordinary presence of mind play two young lady at croquet smoking of course be not allowed in mr hancock drawing room edward be firmly shut into dining room with injunction not to stop there long word be said regarding elizabeth awful lapse did silence reproach one swift change of subject at moment of crisis have called sufficient attention to table with patience card be set ready mr hancock over coffee got instantly occupied superficially absorbed in game before long edward a commanded reunited now give usual treat dear edward said mr hancock building busily from king downwards in alternate colour play something beautiful piece by schumann now where keep coming in again from indication edward be quick enough to conjecture first of noveletten opened steinway grand covered with piece of italian embroidery on stood lamp two vas of flower four photograph frame edith moved round to other side of card table where must see player elizabeth with flash of delighted anticipation shifted round in chair put down evening paper adored piece kept coming in again knowing well felt musician intense pleasure at idea of hearing what somebody else thought about somewhat to surprise edward put music in front of more to surprise did not show slightest intention of moving lamp vase of flower photograph frame then began with loud pedal down a composer ordered elizabeth listened amazed to awful conscientious correct performance never be there so many right note played with so graceless result one must have imagined there be so much wood in whole human system a edward contrived to concentrate into ten finger finger elizabeth noticed looked so slender athletic for purpose of striking note properly be a efficient a row of wooden peg made piano bellow made shriek made rattle when played with le force made emit squeak little hollow gasp a for phrasing there be of course none at chord be played a written sequence made up phrase played with laborious precise punctuality to one of musical mind result be of most excruciating nature must have be have not entire performance be so extremely funny a parody of how quite accomplished unsympathetic pianist performed novelette be beyond praise elizabeth rocked with noiseless laughter so much for sound then elizabeth looking at face in twilight of shaded lamp saw that in be that hand lacked feature at dinner when somewhat studied have appeared so meaninglessly good looking be irradiated transfigured heard that finger must not make others hear eye saw danced with seeing abounding grace colour lay in melody hand be incapable of rendering then in three inflexible leap a if wooden marionette jumping down from platform to platform of rock piece came to end edith gave great sigh oh be splendid said mr hancock triumphantly put knave of heart on to queen of club thank edward said like where come in again there believe be going to come out faced round on music stool to receive compliment eye still glowing met elizabeth look perception flashed between two wordless infallible knew for certain that knew knew exultant music meant to knew entire incompetence of rendering got up went to play said speaking rather low ca take taste of out of mouth elizabeth almost laughed for pleasure at complete understanding so instantaneously established between yes what will play asked if only happened to know that first novelette said raised eyebrow will really said think know wo give that other delicious one said mr hancock plastering card down one like next best be sad in middle elizabeth did not answer went straight over to piano have shut book from played did not open for though suspected might not be note perfect intended to play not to practise mr hancock absorbed in patience really be coming out did not notice that have reply to question click of triumphant sequence of card continued edith who have not heard what have passed between two remembered that elizabeth be fond of music felt surprised slightly nervous at thought that must think of playing when echo of reverberating performance still lingered in air elizabeth edward seemed to heed elizabeth sat down then half rose again gave twirl to music stool then paused for moment with hand before face without preliminary excursion plunged straight into first novelette again have be in edward brain must not communicate to hand streamed from firm soft finger tip image imprisoned in brain broke out peopled room with colour with fire banner waved throng of laughing youth passed jewel decked in wonderful procession down street of noble palace at corner fresh member joined for on joyful morning whole world of spirit presence kept festival whether sang not whether marching melody be sound of joy knew not innumerable a laughter of sea glittered along until by wonderful transformation be wave on spring morning over song floated be field of daffodil over scent of blossoming hovered from sunlight passed into clear blue shadow out of a out of water came strain from shadow into sunlight again passed from sunlight into wave with singing sea bird flashing white winged over once more sun banner in sunlight fountain of water aspired where under hand wooden doll have tumbled from rock to rock bouquet of rainbowed water fell from basin to basin of crystal be first novelette mr hancock have noticed change of performer though not at first for only occurred to edward be playing same piece over again struck very soon that be not keeping time with such precision a usual moment afterwards that be altogether different from tune kept coming in again a rendered before then looking up saw be elizabeth at piano there followed couple of obviously wrong note how foolish forward of girl to play after edward to play piece too make mistake in when tune came in again did put force into edward did certainly have not edward touch masculine power stamped out time with such vigour natural geniality prevented saying even hinting at of thing be extremely encouraging thank elizabeth said what coincidence that must be learning one of edward tune now have heard played have be sure will get right in time must play to edward again next week when have practised will see how have got on ah do play again to next week said before next week now edward said mr hancock do let have tune get sad in middle turned to with face that music still vivified after that tune must be sad said beginning middle end wo miss fanshawe play again mr hancock thought that charming of be so tactful to make elizabeth think have played well poor elizabeth with wrong note that one with ear must detect a matter of fact did not care one particle who played if anybody played so long a patience came out perceived nothing of situation guessed nothing about fire from girl finger tingled in brain edith saw more saw at rate that something in elizabeth playing have enormously pleased excited lover have said that be surely who lay behind melody whom sought went to elizabeth gently pushed back on to music stool do play again dear said give such pleasure elizabeth a father knew be conscious of little else than german johnny when there be singing in brain sat down at once do know said quite short touched key once then again a if to test lightness of finger then broke into twelfth etude of chopin letting piano whisper privilege so seldom accorded to belaboured instrument even mr hancock responded to laid down card spoke what delicious tune dear said tum ti ti tum ti ti tune be still hovering poised elizabeth put hand firmly down on suspension stopped what abrupt end said mr hancock yes said elizabeth turning round on stool when mr hancock have have enough patience conversation secretly rang electric bell be fixed to underside of card table upon lind brought in tray of glass soda water be rightly regarded by guest a stirrup cup signal occurred rather earlier than usual to night for be likely that two lover must wish to say few word to other in library before parting be made completely easy for by mr hancock suggestion that edith must find edward hat coat for a lind doubt have gone to bed have left soda water tray about three minute before two went out together word of parting be short edward still tingling with music still inflamed by lambent fire went back to house in musical matter despite own incompetence in matter of performance have excellent judgment knew that have be listening night to real thing there be question a to quality of elizabeth playing have authority without most agile execution be more than mere facility of finger acquirable like nimble manoeuvre of conjurer in a devoid of artistic merit magic like be matter of mere manipulation more constitutes pianist than doe power of pronouncing word without stammer stumbling constitute actor behind elizabeth playing sat master who understood by virtue of perception meaning of music by virtue of hand co ordinated with burning perception must interpret above felt that in music spoke language uttered idiom understood must not give voice to soul be native of same melodious country not foreigner to other told honestly believed that there be more than a if be not enough in hour have spent in mr hancock drawing room be not even sure whether liked elizabeth not certainly be a different a might well be from type of marriageable maidenhood have so greatly so sanely attracted that rejoiced to know that future life must be intimately entirely bound up in hers through dinner elizabeth have meant nothing at to have noted rather than admired vitality for certainly be like light brought into dusky room dispersing shadow completely somnolently brooded in corner restoring colour to mere grey outline be not very sure that desired appreciated unusual illumination have of got on very nicely in dark where if dozed little there be not much probability of being detected of late have sat with chair close to edith so to speak listened with tenderness to mr hancock talking on in sleep into have come with vivid bull eye lantern got in one eye little be slightly disconcerting so have be until played at moment in regard found simply utterly adorable poured out homage for a must have done for splendid brunnhilde awaking hailing sun knew nature of homage brought so a yet confidently told homage a sexless impersonal a prompt presentation of wreath to elderly perspiring conductor at close of act needed not brunnhilde to evoke that for be merely tribute to artistic interpretation manifested by man woman responded to by who must appreciate mr hancock deplorable ejaculation of tum ti ti tum ti ti be of same nature be not tribute to elizabeth be abandonment of to spell at most be tribute to finger for music flowed from how must have worshipped that gift in if only have be edith who played have sat down in broad window seat of drawing room looked out into garden tree that fortnight before have stood made of ebony ivory in blaze of may moonlight on night when house next door have be empty to night be tenanted tenanted by girl who within few month must come across so short space of lawn make home with tenanted also by dark vivid presence of who have made music to in drawing room where sat empty blazing with electric light for unaccounted impulse have made turn on switch stood big black piano with inviolate top standing open how must elizabeth awake soul in even a siegfried have by kiss awakened brunnhilde by magic of comprehending finger almost must see there with profile little defiant little mutinous cut cameo wise against dark grey of wall with eye kindling a listened to music in brain flowed like virile tumultuous heart beat out of finger how well understood tramp colour of novelette yet knew understood quite a well how unerringly finger marwilled painted in be secret initiation oh how much meant in also be mysterious power of communication be not one of incomplete soul who be born dumb a so many be must speak others be born empty so power of speech be bottle of senseless sound of flat wooden phrase then with shock of surprise to became aware that be thinking no longer about music elizabeth made elizabeth who made chapter vii intermezzo business on stock exchange have be a be not uncommon somewhat slack during month of june edward found easy to get down to heathmoor by train arrived soon after five instead of started hour later be natural for after getting rid of habiliment of town to come round next door where must find mr hancock edith ready to give slightly belated cup of tea in garden house adjoined croquet lawn a rule elizabeth be not there whereabouts be indicated by sound of piano for be practising with energy of enthusiast found hour when house be empty must escape from sense of disturbing being disturbed most congenial time in to make a much noise a chose to practise particular bar in endless repetition mr hancock continued to believe to reiterate edward be maestro that elizabeth followed faint pursuing in wake of victorious finger often asked how thought be getting on frequently dined there with regularity characterized insisted on playing one more of piece when have smoked cigarette detained in dining room on occasion eye be wont to seek elizabeth in tacit apology though word have passed between on subject situation be quite clear to more than once have attempted to convince mr hancock while must only strum abominably niece played perfectly incredulous thought be nice of to be so modest to encourage elizabeth so protest being utterly useless played with elizabeth in confidence sense of secret between for edith shared mother belief in maestro gave peculiar so still told inexplicable satisfaction with knowledge enjoyed rather than otherwise own long drawn murder of classical author completely understood dimpling smile fluttered light winged over elizabeth face a performed ruthless deed during last fortnight life at arundel have pursued to outward appearance regulated emotionless course characterized existence at time of strawberry have come therefore also time of garden party quarter of hour after arrival of evening train from town well laid road be thick with hurrying flannelled figure carrying lawn tennis racquet croquet mallet for latter game be taken with extreme seriousness nobody among regular player must have dreamed of trusting to mallet of house elizabeth naturally have share in invitation be source of never ending surprise to see young athletically limbed men of same specie apparently a who in india spent leisure in polo pig sticking pursuing laborious way through hoop after hoop talking about game afterwards with greater gusto minuteness than if have be tiger shooting chief amongst hero of lawn be edward a did justice to observe preserved reticence of accustomed conqueror sat silent when vicar mr dale lived triumph o'er again elizabeth felt that to be like made admission grudgingly fact that grudged such credit be symptomatic of feeling towards in especial of feeling did not admit though must honestly have denied be fighting again again not knowing why assured that be very ordinary young man that edith must be blind so to speak to see anything in except in one point told that there be nothing there that lanky frame be beyond power to deny inch crowned by vacant face be harbourage of insignificant soul spent day among money bag evening on croquet lawn found that sufficient for be not nearly worthy of edith of edith inexplicable adoration be not even so appeared to elizabeth eye in love with must have be foundation for worthiness seemed indulgent of kind to sometimes little impatient of there elizabeth did not wholly acquit cousin of blame set willy nilly on pedestal on pedestal for did not deprecate plinth be bound to stoop must have stepped down from pedestal must not have consented to be edified into statuesque here be ground of elizabeth censure of in fine reminded twenty time day of reason for belittling to own mind cousin betrothed concealed from herself that belittled be affair of instinct instinctively knew though whispered not to herself why did for feared to give rein to liking for one exception made in policy of self defence in one thing gave due for never attempted to deny belittle validity of musical passion be fingerless passion so to speak between brain hand there seemed to be total want of co ordination be paralytic must not doubt intensity of perception be alphabet babbler when tried to communicate when played to knew by glance at face whether did ill well thus ironically mr hancock judgment of a maestro elizabeth a pupil be strangely correct girl did not attempt to conceal from that be of opinion that thought when practised with greater diligence fire than have ever be hers before music understood loved so discerningly day by day slaved exultingly at piano thought that must appreciate progress became inspiration to at present reverence for gift be like insoluble lump in cup of cold indifference towards neither sweetened embittered beverage certainly through be beginning to get closer day to ineffable spring spirit from that bewildering beauty of sound be poured forth dweller in innermost one glance from whom sends beholder mad with melody on one afternoon at end of month graciously exempt from garden party elizabeth be alone in house for hour after lunch have be too hot for mr hancock drive whole curriculum of day have be upset tea having taken place at very unusual hour of half past four so might enjoy cooler progress between time dinner dislocation of affair have not occurred since year before last heat be so intense that really hardly cared at whether denton lind thought odd not punctually at five have set out with edith leaving message with lind that if mr holroyd came round be to be told that be out must be back by half past six thus here denton became concerned must have time to go round by mill proceeding very slowly where road have be newly mended so forth if here lind be attentive again mr holroyd came by six o'clock train might be offered whisky soda asked to wait if by five o'clock train original message must be delivered then filson brought out light dust cloak heavier blue one be taken out then be put back again in case evening got chilly passed over bridge by station moment after five o'clock train got in edith thought saw edward stepping out of be not sure edward saw motor passenger without doubt whatever went straight to house out into garden there from open french window of house next door piano be plainly audible elizabeth be playing first of brahms intermezzo air sang like bed of breeze stirred flower in le than minute have rung bell in answer to lind message have said must come in wait in spite of fact that offer of whisky soda applied only to six o'clock train lind suggested edward said wanted nothing turning handle of drawing room door very softly entered elizabeth utterly intent on music heard nothing of coming sat down in chair close to door knowing that be doing rude ill bred thing knowing too in heart that be doing worse than for be definitely indulging infidelity even though infidelity be in fact no more than listening to girl playing knew quite well why listened be not for sake of music alone be to allow unseen unsuspected for there be in questionable conduct something of self effacing quality of love to see incarnated dream from have roused when month ago engaged to edith for year of youth have cherished unrealized vision fondling in dream now when too early have told that time for dreaming be done must awake to average humdrum satisfaction of domesticity with delightful partner dream incarnate have walked into waking hour sound of what played have be magnet drew here now that have come be scarcely conscious of music throughout month have be that attracted to now be a if have done work for have brought heart to nature law of attraction threw aside like discarded instrument for first moment that sat here scarcely heard sweetness of melody then seemed to that strong tender tune be elizabeth soul made audible played thinking be alone a have never played before seemed to reveal then struck that have done be doing what be equivalent to looking through keyhole at somebody who thought be alone shame awoke in for shame passed be swallowed up in intense consciousness of of elizabeth tune be elizabeth finished sat still for moment with finger still resting on last chord then gave long sigh turning round saw cousin edward said almost incredulously feeling exactly what just now have felt namely that have be looking through keyhole at got up only dimly conscious of rebuke in voice came in after have begun that intermezzo said did want to disturb know how hate interruption paused moment dead to else except fact of never heard play like before said be still looked troubled think must have done that said did lind tell that aunt julia edith be out yes if think ought to have come in be sorry ca help rejoicing have heard play like suddenly seemed to elizabeth that be ridiculous of to object to what have done have often played to alone before what difference did make if on occasion did not know of presence reason be at variance with instinct smiled at be nothing said be absurd to mind be glad thought played well have have tea will go into garden saw danger slipping away from have to make commonplace reply must be past saw dream have become incarnate slipping away from also at moment meant everything in world to be reckless on fire came close to stammered little when spoke for last fortnight said have thought of nothing else loyalty cowardice mixed caused to stop saw amazement utter surprise flood elizabeth face saw also faint a reflection of far away lightning something responded to something leaped towards instead of recoiling from rest of be lost in pure bewilderment only wanted to get rid of did not even answer with finger following eye pointed to door beg pardon said quickly please go said girl sat down on music stool have so lately left while waiting for brain to work again struck random note two a far a felt anything felt surprise then in flash came indignation that while be month old in engagement to edith must speak thus to following instantly on like burglar violently breaking into mind came unbidden thought care for tried to eject called for help so to speak burglar contemplated quite calmly a if have right to be there seemed to speak to to say will have to get used to in turn looked at ceased calling for help something inside that without doubt edward have seen faintly behind first amazement surprise seemed to recognize to smile at elizabeth ceased from being surprised at edward became surprised at what be to be done beyond doubt answer be clear there be nothing to be done at at rate there be nothing for to do be ludicrous to contemplate telling aunt julia must not have be more ludicrous to tell edith nobody must know nobody must ever so faintly conjecture what have happened edward be going to marry edith on eighth of october there be to be six bridesmaid of whom be to be one elizabeth surprise at waxed grew surprise be due to fact that be not in least shocked made one unsuccessful attempt to tell edward have not meant what said swiftly gave that up being quite aware that meant much more than have said trembling voice finger plaited together told that be quite in earnest then a suddenly a if have be shaken out of deep sleep obtained complete control consciousness of be not shocked because welcomed what have said because responded to shame secret rapture overwhelmed burglar went neck crop out of wide flung window of mind be not till have turned out that struggle in own mind began knew now why have made habit of belittling criticizing to herself have be defending against now have to defend against a well have to inquire into fidelity of own garrison knew that there be traitor among still be not least shocked certainly must be turned out executed drawn quartered crime against did not anger against practical aspect of situation engaged again saw now that there be just one thing to be done namely to obliterate altogether what have happened not to think of more at doubt be very bad that edith affianced lover must have said what have said must have meant so much more than said that must not have be horrified at only surprised when surprise be passed that must have found that there be response to in soul must be expunged if must not forget must remember only a queer distorted dream that in reality be nonsense though while dreamer still slept seemed so intensely real felt must answer for in matter that be quite competent to seal affair up in mind a bee seal up in wax intruder to hive edward must also see that to whole episode be no longer existent since non existence be undoubtedly best fate for thus manner to must be exactly what have be before have made unfortunate intrusion hardly le important be that edith aunt must remain unaware that anything have occurred between edward gave reason more for treating quite normally only how did treat before how did look at did usually smile when spoke to felt that to meet again now without consciousness of what have just happened must be like meeting perfect stranger have got to be done to admit in bearing to that recollection of scene still have place in mind to indicate even by coldness of manner aloof demeanour that must keep distance be impossible for edith must be sure to notice above everything almost be essential that edith must be utterly unaware of hardly knew what to call understanding misunderstanding between over three minute there must be pasted sheet of white paper seemed to well within power to do must continue to make mind fight belittle criticize ought to be easy now that have done what knew to be despicable thing unfortunately did not despise for being despicable at most reason did not instinct heard sound of motor wheel crunching gravel felt perfectly prepared to resume not only natural manner normal consciousness swung round on music stool began intermezzo again getting up a aunt entered with edith well hope have have good practice dear said mr hancock very cordially have have pleasant drive not so dusty a expected must be hurried back sooner than intended originally because there be huge black cloud coming up denton said must be surprised if came on to rain very suddenly so think will sit out in garden to get little more air edith might have game of croquet expect edward will come in when six o'clock train arrives dear be after six perhaps have be edith went back lind will know then can three play croquet if touch bell dear elizabeth found natural manner perfectly easy came in said went back to house again think be practising suddenly found wondering whether manner be quite natural glanced at edith who be touching bell doubt did not want to disturb practice said mr hancock who always liked to remind herself of comfort showered on other people for have given strict order dear that be not to be disturbed when be practising perhaps be in garden will call to over wall want to come in to dine will play to afterwards wonder if must not get nice duet with easy part for dear must play together look have begun to rain already denton be quite right be glad advised to turn though be edith who saw big black cloud first there be end to going into garden to croquet be afraid will send note round to edward think be flash of lightning perhaps must write note for edith give to lind oh yes lind there will be note yes there be thunder quite loud clap what blessing turned be wooden face looked inquiringly round when be told that there be note for edward to be

no went back home aunt julia said came in when be practising a told told be out ma'be repeated lind said must wait elizabeth felt wild exasperation there be nothing to explain yet have to go on explaining went away again repeated yes dear quite understand said mr hancock saw be practising did say must come back if so need not send note seemed like plot of inquisition no said nothing remarked elizabeth rather shortly feeling that perfectly straightforward visit be somehow becoming suspicious did stop long asked edith quite casually five minute ten perhaps said elizabeth really did not time mr hancock always kept feather in small vase of water on writing table with smeared gum on flap of envelope in preference to more ordinary use of tongue on such occasion seemed to slightly indelicate to put out tongue even tip of in public besides who knew what gum be made of who have be touching genteel observance singularly annoyed elizabeth be privilege to snatch away envelope from aunt lick with so to speak yard of tongue protruding rather than allow use of horrible feather here saw opportunity with complete resumption of natural manner up to moment have not be complete success upset feather water brought end to senseless catechism lind be obliging enough to take note prepared for expedition of about forty yard by putting on cap mackintosh golosh providing with umbrella there be need only for verbal answer waited five minute before acceptance came by time rain have completely ceased edward from window saw put up umbrella again doubt to guard against dripping from tree

a sailor in such sea have completely upset in other sense to night have told must reach port already have rounded pier head within few hour now must put elizabeth ashore pier be decorated for reception flag waved band played must part with splendidly go back to boat where edith must await for lifelong cruise in calm pleasant water have made so honestly believed honest decision though honesty be virtue be so much taken for granted that be ranked rather among postulate of life than among acquirement honest decision be not always made without struggle difficulty felt for elizabeth actual flesh blood spirit of what have only hitherto imagined in dream few month before have settled to have done with bitterly with more poignancy of feeling than have thought capable of regretted precipitancy in abandonment in few month more must have seen realized must have have human chance of attractive boy with girl to have made true have not waited have shaken awake with full sense of what be doing have made love to be accepted by girl knew liked admired to day acknowledged responsibility have intention of shirking week of what be not le than spiritual anguish have resulted in decision in one direction be pulled by honour in other by love have previous engagement have settled took rank before anything else whatever believed without smallest touch of complacency that edith loved believed also again not grain of odious emotion entered into belief have be free elizabeth must have accepted since deplorable lapse week ago have treated with friendlier intimacy than ever for have have further word on subject interpreted to mean out of generosity of nature have completely forgiven obliterated occurrence that friendliness be meant to show how entirely trusted for future in be absolutely right be right also in corollary instinctively added that must not have adopted attitude unless be fond of must quite correctly have kept at arm length must have continued to manifest that slight hostility to have previously characterized behaviour have not have given greater warmth friendliness than ever before so far must let thought bear without shame secrecy there went on beneath tow undercurrent though suppressed refused to regard be what have caused in main soul storm in have be buffeted week believed there be more than friendliness in regard for with terrible sharpsightedness of blind love a if one of eye saw nothing while other be gifted with portentous vision have not missed sign little sign look word movement be feeler of love waving tentacle of infinite sensitiveness that threadlike invisible to ordinary beholder shrivel spring touch instinctively without volition on owner part one fairly impartially judging must say that elizabeth have behaved to except with friendly unreserve to seemed to reserve much to reserve in spite of edward a waited on platform for arrival of train have doubt that be doing right in following demand of honour have killed dream so to speak when engaged to edith to night to sound of flute violin be going to conduct funeral did not see that in reality be intending to bury alive that dream be not smothered by burial rather like root of plant grow flourish beneath earth sending up sap feed blossom did not contemplate future with dismay believed that edith must have very pleasant comfortable life together according to heathmoor pattern with touch of cynicism be unusual with added a train steamed in be more than must be said for many marriage then before train stopped saw elizabeth get out look round for with shining excited eye heart beat quick at recognition of three met with jubilance drove straight to savoy for there be not more than time to have tea dress day like last dozen of predecessor have be dry dusty roadway in front of hotel have be liberally watered stepping out of motor edith slipped fell heavily foot doubled under bravely tried to smile bravely also tried to get up smile faded in agony of twisted ankle be helped into hotel seemed at first that might be wrench of little consequence pain of must be assuaged by ten minute rest ten minute did for be to give badly swollen ankle show utter impossibility of setting foot to ground then swathed in wet bandage lying on sofa in sitting room took peremptory line with others two must go said if wait here longer will be late if be of ready to start in quarter of hour will go bandage if have to hop there ca spend evening alone said elizabeth sha spend evening alone because will have supper together dinner too if will be awfully kind edward have up here with instead of in restaurant edward have already yielded in heart yielded with secret exulting rapture fate though at edith expense be giving splendid farewell to elizabeth must be alone together for did not let thought progress further than if insist began be not insisting dear be dreadful bore must make best of be kind order dinner here instead go to dress elizabeth be left alone with cousin aunt julia said what will say have thought of mother must know must coach up when come back will have sprained ankle when came back to hotel at end forget oh do go get ready elizabeth be settled ca bear that edward must be disappointed in not seeing beiegfried ' indeed that must must be perfectly senseless that must stop at home because ca go cost elizabeth something to argue against wanted passionately to see opera if dream wish fairy wish for thing be impossible must have be presented to that morning must have chosen to see awakening of brunnhilde alone with edward wild blurted speech when intruded upon practising week ago have buried so complete since then have be discretion if thought of at thought of only a momentary lapse unguarded exaggeration since then have not defended against by coldness of manner unspoken belittlement of have arrived at franker more affectionate intimacy than ever before did not inquire conjecture what secret emotional history be be safeguarded enough from by engagement to edith while from own integrity of purpose seemed sufficient shield yet argued against edith insistence on fulfilment of fairy wish aunt julia must like said ca help said edith want so much that care what mother must think besides wo think anything will never know edith paused moment flushed besides dear said if asked edward even wanted not to go what reason must there be for must appear so so odious a if ca say oh go dress unspoken word be clear enough contained that elizabeth be conscious of must have be odious that of must harbour thought that edith must not put into word be sufficient two came back to dine at end of first act full to brim of music intoxicated with beady ferment of sound drama little beside with excitement at present music that alone held in flame of common passion a yet paid little heed to other except a sharer in elizabeth hardly touched food be silent bright eyed exploring new kingdom with return to hotel to common need of food drink above to edith took poignantly back into actual world again once again more vividly than ever before choice told be already decided be set before a sat with elizabeth silent strung up on one side with edith intelligently questioning with view to subsequent catechism of herself on other question seemed idiotic interruption must barely make courteous narrative then mime told about youth then began to forge sword yes be palstecher who played siegfried be in excellent voice did not revoke choice ceased to think of wanted only for present to hasten tardy progress of hand of clock to moment when must be time for to go away again alone with elizabeth aspect of evening a farewell to be ousted in mind by prospect of next hour two thought le of what symbolized more growingly more of what be even a thunderstorm burst without menace of gathering cloud so thickening intensity of emotion warned with utterly disregarded caution that force of savage import be collecting have friend laid fact possibility danger before asked opinion a to what man must do under such circumstance unhesitatingly must have advised without regard to other issue that must not go back alone with elizabeth let take waiter from hotel stranger out of street rather than trust alone to keep steady head firm foot in precipiced slippery place have believed that elizabeth have touch of more than pleasant friendly feeling towards might have be justified in believing in be very spring foundation of excitement expectancy did not so believe fancied rightly wrongly that have shown sign of warmer regard for than still a unconvincingly a parrot cry kept saying to edith trust therefore trust did not even feel be doing dangerous thing felt only that have irresistible need to be with elizabeth in isolation of darkened house when brunnhilde awoke performance viewed artistically be magnificent from height to height mounted second act till sound of noonday murmur of forest grew from scarcely audible note to full triumphant symphony of sunlight living thing pervading embracing bringing voice of nature to endorse heroic deed at same time to bring to hero knowledge of human need to even a to siegfried woke in heart irresistible need of love of ideal mate of woman of dream who sat beside once only a clear call of bird rang through hushed house did elizabeth take eye off stage turned dewy with tear bright with wonder on said word unconsciously moved chair little nearer laid ungloved hand on knee have one moment hesitation one moment in be in power to check there be just one branch of tree so to speak hanging above rapid down be hurrying be just possible with effort to grasp made such effort deliberately if anything in fervour of growing madness must be called deliberate let that moment go by deliberately rejected image of edith awaiting return aflame acquiesced with will in anything must happen deliberately cast rein on back of flying steed not again did sense that have choice in matter come to last atom of manliness be absorbed in manhood elizabeth hand lay on knee finger bending over inwards gently pressed with other knee felt response have sought that touch to assure be in tune with one with over miracle that be looking at on moment felt there be more than in pressure of hand own response to be too absorbed too rapt to care nothing mattered except siegfried fact that edward be together beating with one heart blood about presently afterwards brunnhilde lay beneath pine in shining armour through flame vain obstacle barred approach to came siegfried of avail to be armour of maidenhood for while slept loosened of avail to stay approach be fierceness of flame girt resting place at kiss kiss sealed strong throb of blood beat again in body eye have so long be shut in unmolested sleep be unclosed sat up saluted sun saluted day earth myriad sound sight odour told be born into life again siegfried have stood back in awe at wonder holiness of awakening turned saw once more elizabeth turned to edward eye met in long glance to at moment to le than to be drama of own soul be unfolding in melody love song before needed to look at for one glance of recognition for there on stage learned a saw immortal lover together immortality of love whole air rang with supreme expression of violin flute glorious voice of brunnhilde spoke for be companion here in box with who bore rapture higher who completed made perfect indeed there be greeting in farewell if said vale to sang ave also vale be le now than mutter below breath sat with arm resting on front of box till last triumphant note rang out through applause followed still sat there unmoving there be before after for then consciousness moved upon limitless infinite plane have left place when turned be standing close behind again eye met in long look question be in saw answered by smile shy solemn shone in hers then still in silence went out into crowd filled passage entrance porch be crowded with efflux of house waiting for carriage to arrive elizabeth saw surging glittering scene with strange hard distinctness seemed remote from a if be enclosed in wall of crystal crowd be more to than beehive of busy moving little life altogether sundered in intelligence interest from herself edward whole world have receded on to insect plane crawled skipped jostled about be infinitely removed from aroused in just vague wonder of man idly gazing at disturbed ant hill hardly wondering what bustle be about here there stood member of throng waiting quietly in corner taking part in movement just occurred to that in room in savoy hotel there be such member of queer busy little race waiting return even thought of edith barely found footing in mind be specimen under glass night be quite fine in moment two have made way out of door be walking down queue of carriage to find motor have suggested that must wait while hunted brought up preferred to go out of crowded insect house to look for with street be full also of vague throng also seemed utterly unreal utterly without significance must scarcely have be surprised if light people house high swung moon have collapsed melted away leaving only mountain top girt with flame rose fell with gust of sparkling melody must not be alone there whole self completed self at least must be there self have seen so often have criticized belittled till evening have never known to be now knew nothing else rest be mimic world full of busy little insect motor be soon found stepped in followed by edward have heard give direction to chauffeur about driving down to embankment going to entrance of hotel slid out of queue turned so intensely did feel presence that seemed to bring nearer to when took hand in when heard whisper brunnhilde awoke yes siegfried answered arm be round for one second clung close to a kissed then even while fire burned close to so that mingled with own blaze while ringing of music be mystically one with drowned other sound real world actual world have quite vanished from consciousness stood round again menacing reminding appalling real self integrity honour pointed at in amazement in horror so through eye not through eye of passion saw what be doing what be permitting what be rapturously welcoming memory loyalty honesty cried aloud at though seemed that be tearing part of away wrenched free oh what be doing cried be mad oh why did let why did make possible for let go edward have seized again ca said be mine know be have dreamed of life dreamed have awoke to night to find be true again time easily shook free of for in have struggled before have planned evening a farewell to came to aid for moment elizabeth far stronger than in will be wholly against against have honourable traitor in own house dreamed to night of impossible thing said have awoke again began to tremble violently a struggle to maintain that first flush of true vision seized have come to with flashing stroke of impulse now here be difficulty have to keep hold of edward see a do really said know have be mad mad ah thank god here be motor have stopped by hotel door already porter be coming across pavement to ca leave like said let drive on for little just for ten minute elizabeth be on near side of carriage tried to prevent getting up come to sens said be impossible to meet edith like said will see considered that for moment what if did see be not exactly what desired elizabeth interrupted wo because must said can do share must do yours get out please next moment followed into hotel at door of sitting room paused moment feeling suddenly tired incapable looked appealingly at a joined edward do help said rely on tremendous pressure at have be living day helped elizabeth now for reaction have not come yet at moment have be set to do must have done with ten thousand horse power made rush of across room to where edith lay dropping fan glove handkerchief on way seemed that edward help must chiefly consist in listening oh dear cried have gone quite mad edward there be nothing in world brunnhilde siegfried kissed edith went on breathlessly turning deep tumult of soul into merest froth siegfried brunnhilde brunnhilde siegfried felt be brunnhilde darling be rather surprised that edward did not kiss will now if like remarked edward taking cue unerringly yes do be dear for having taken perhaps have better not though be little late must have done earlier besides edith might not like must consider edith now after thinking about own enjoyment evening how be ankle ask out of politeness dear really care in least how ankle be only care for siegfried oh do let have supper at once have dinner to mention be brutally hungry be effect of emotion after daddy be charged out pig sticking be nearly killed ate largest lunch ever remember ah be bringing will never go on hunger strike happens to siegfried be quite in tune oh edith now help to pull sofa up to table edward then need move at how be ankle do care really remarkable series of statement question must hardly be called conversation served purpose in starting social intercourse again edith turned to edward be mad asked be mad too yes have got dumb madness said elizabeth have said word evening occasional sigh oh wish have be there edith yes certainly soup for third time inquire about ankle looking up caught edward eye for moment be eagerly gazing at a siegfried gazed at brunnhilde be in opera have once seen in remote age ago in dim land of dream in a looked at stream of babbling talk froze on lip heart beat quick be back again in darkness of motor be saying to yes siegfried without thought of anything present moment of love then with sense of coming from infinite distance be back in sitting room again conscious that edith have said something that have not remotest notion what be edward answered be capital said be glad be better of course elizabeth will drive down in motor to morrow morning so

true history of evening never never there be question of not for present about that mr hancock must not know mere fact that edward went to opera alone seemed ludicrous stratagem laughable what tangled web be going to weave about nothing said warn edith will be sure to forget let out oh mother must be horrified said edith must take care elizabeth sat down took one of edward cigarette somehow revulsion of feeling against have altogether vanished yearning for be stealing back again like pain have be temporarily numbed begin to reassert dream impossibility be that on october th be going to marry edith be quite incredible mere piece of nonsense that have heard down at dream place called heathmoor where everybody be fast asleep be just part of dream of one of of aunt julia perhaps who certainly have pain joy only comfort have to humour dream people saying thing to drowsy people of whom edith be one really have meaning not for have really done anything so awful asked be highly improper that edward must go to opera together there be about two thousand people there to chaperone lot of be so respectable bald men stringy woman laughed again did see one just behind edward said

must hold out hand to must sit on edge of sofa holding in must bend to kiss not once not once only must whisper together word be natural proper between pledged lover word hour ago be burning to say to now made doubt be glib with to edith yet hour ago have wrenched away from arm kiss with horror upheaval of nature of horror there be nothing left now in hour of first onslaught of jealousy now be inconceivable to that when have offered what longed for thought of given to made writhe with jealousy must have rejected have repulsed for wanting to give what whole heart cried out for what be hers though have already sworn away to have not met then did not know that be ordained for even a for now just because have promised like child not knowing what promised be giving that by right be hers to girl whom did not love for moment thought namely that edith be nothing to assuaged might a well be jealous of dog that caressed mumbled nonsense love to rage turned against for having be so insane a to give scruple instead of welcome what if went back now into room have so lately left said to edith let go will have to let go be not care for what if challenged to say of chose knew well what answer must be inconceivable a be folly in rejecting equally inconceivable be mood on morning be only morning of to day when walked about dewy garden in ecstasy of happiness at knowledge of love have thought be sufficient to love have made happy to do have understood nothing of nature then be only when saw brunnhilde awake to siegfried kiss that have begun to understand full understanding have come when edward clasped kissed for moment have clung to only to push away to thrust from just that wanted whole soul needed be foolish fairy tale have told among rose sweet pea tale of sexless bodiless love fit for sunday school bible reading tale of white blossom white robe thing for child old maid inquisition have pair of pincer heating for be ready now glowing what if moment heat flash of desire for be fruit of excitement froth music have stirred up in certainly have be easy to quell have to tell to let go of obeyed to get out of motor then stood on pavement despised weakness for surely man who be in earnest who be stirred even a be stirred not by mere breeze of attraction by excitement of stimulated scene felt heart need must not have relinquished a easily a yet looked to in unreasoning agony that be so for now be with edith indulging in more madrigal doubt yet when thought a collectedly a might be for second have cold water ready for pincer knew really that what now called weakness be in reality of same stuff a own strength that made strong that grotesque angular old image called honour be one with reason of yielding to be left alone with now next door precisely similar idol presided over two whom raged to think upon yet if have not so easily succumbed to strength if to put more truthfully if have not both be held in by force restrained hot impulse governed that laid cool hand on rein have flung away must so asked now have continued to persist have ranged will purpose against till there be more courage left in did not know swift decisive though struggle have be seemed to have taken force of be capable to make at for moment there be remission for at hand of jealousy walked across to window stood behind curtain looking out on to moon emblazoned river flood tide be at height reflection of light from farther bank lay on lake like surface in unwavering line star moon burning in blaze of everlasting day something in calm of night in eternal progress of shining world gave momentary tranquillity so that be able to ask question on answer to depended with mind aloof from how long will must have held out against love did not know knew must not have chosen to yield at moment have won have known first real battle of life for moment stood with banner waving round next be back in thick of melee again without tactic without sense of there being one in command of army fought with even of being unit in immense warfare felt utterly alone struggling yet hardly knowing why knowing only that odds against seemed desperate chapter ix edward absence injury to edith ankle according to authorized version have happened on return from opera to hotel gave more trouble than have expected ten day after infliction be still limping pedestrian morning be whiling away half hour must elapse before motor took out with mother in long chair in strip of shade just outside drawing room window with unread paper on knee hearing rather than listening to elizabeth stormy performance on piano agitation sounded there be not confined to musical excursion for ever since night at opera there have be something about elizabeth that cousin must have summed up in word queer have not other circumstance other people be queer too must probably have be content to define without analysis a be have spent good deal of time during last week in attempting to penetrate queerness of elizabeth seeing if fitted in with other oddity have come to uncomfortable conclusion that be not unconnected very small phenomenon more remembered now than noticed at time have announced like horn faintly blowing train of circumstance be growing peaked like volcano cone promised eruption such for instance have be sense that something have happened on afternoon when edward have interrupted elizabeth practising be barely noticeable at time tended to confirm view of subsequent happening began to take shape substance in mind on evening of opera night elizabeth have be rather oddly excited though excited elizabeth be daily if not hourly phenomenon excitement then have be of peculiar texture though not given to simile have represented quaintly enough to edith mind under image of elizabeth holding young living thing puppy kitten down in bucket of water to drown while to draw off attention from employment have be wildly incoherently talkative at time have struck edith that excitement be not merely reaction from climax of music drama be certainly attempting to drown something while tongue be voluble with vivid talk finger be holding something down shrinking resolute be not wholly affair of memory interpretation impression have be conveyed to edith at time now taken in conjunction with other event conclusion assumed importance of cipher when numeral be prefixed to numeral without doubt be edward for on night of opera after elizabeth have gone to bedroom edward have lingered for talk have be a inanimate a elizabeth have be vivid a grey a have be rainbowed be absent minded preoccupied inaccessible have nothing enthusiastic enraptured to tell about opera have so stirred companion yet when questioned said that so far from being disappointed with have be magnificent to comment that elizabeth have seemed to enjoy have for reply that believed did dozen time have tried to rouse for few minute have pulled up by muscular effort a be to normal level a often a thus exerted fell back again below surface below wave water once more own image of elizabeth trying to drown something occurred to then again edward must ask after injured ankle not listening to reply repeat inquiry suggested train for return next morning to heathmoor having arranged hour before be to drive down in car finally edith half amused half piqued with have told that whether knew not be tired have better follow elizabeth example go to bed for few minute after that have roused to performance of little loverlike speech touch hint of relationship have never be habit of to be demonstrative to night attention seemed to purely mechanical thing wooden creaking not result of fatigue with have saddled since night instead of seeing a be accustomed to do evening on return from town have not once set eye on have telephoned next day that stress of business kept night in thing occasionally happened same stress of business appeared have prevented coming down to house next door ever since sunday have intervened have merely told that be engaged to pay week end visit morning further note have come saying that similar engagement prevented coming down on saturday be at hand be true that have written to with frequent regularity for morning presented with note from communication be of most unsatisfactory description with perfunctory regret for continued absence perfunctory assurance of imperativeness of employment detained once have said that hot weather have pulled down from usual serenity of health visited with headache inquiry sympathy on point have brought forth further allusion to be still staying at savoy hotel for while work be so heavy be not worth while getting to heathmoor late in evening only to leave by early train in morning said must only add further fatigue to fatiguing day have clearly written in between line must not set eye on even how be ankle note a have be mentioned arrived with regularity be not only communication received at arundel from twice to edith knowledge elizabeth have heard from allowing now to suspect everything everybody edith imagined that cousin have heard oftener than for early post be delivered at house hour before breakfast time be sent up to room of various destination week ago now edith by chance have come down before arrival when came have sorted out seen neat unmistakable handwriting to day in obedience to definite jealousy suspicion have come down early again again found that edward have written to cousin time hating for yet unable to resist have fingered envelope come to conclusion that there be certainly two sheet in to of letter have elizabeth made slightest allusion there remained to colour a be various outlined feature with general wash aspect of elizabeth impression of of edward must only judge by tenor of note in revealed nothing except reticence elizabeth be here mood appearance voice gave information about if edward note suggested reticence elizabeth suggested repression required very little knowledge of human nature luckily for edith since acquirement in supreme branch of knowledge be of most elementary description to see that mind be beset by monstrous incubus often sat silent absorbed then with effort must break into torrent of broken winged high spirit gaiety presented appearance of fair forgery of normal appreciative pleasure in life then with equal suddenness must seem incapable of keeping up spurious pageant in middle of voluble extravagance must sink back again into nervous silence more than once change have come on ringing of front door bell sounding in kitchen passage be clearly audible from garden not once twice only in last week have seen drop suddenly into restless silence when innocent harbinger be heard while with eager shrinking anxiety watched beneath dropped eyelid for appearance of visitor sometimes such must appear elizabeth must soon make excuse for visit to house conjecture a to arrival of post now up till moment of falling in love with edward edith potentiality for jealousy have remained practically dormant sealed up in nature reason presumably being that have not cared enough about anybody to be able to wake green eyed monster three quarter fiend one quarter angel from hibernation for though jealousy be passion at first sight seems wholly ugly contemptible must not be forgotten that very existence postulate pre existence among ancestor of love love may say represents one of grandparent be always of noble descent if be argued that passion so utterly mean be wholly lacking in open hearted trust so emphatically be in essence of love must at least be conceded that love be in hand turn key break seal of cell where jealousy lie confined then fling open door to let wild secret prisoner escape roam love be lofty that seek not own will doubt wring hand in despair to see what sort of intruder have set loose will use best effort shocked at appearance of monster to confine again without love never have jealousy be allowed to get free to root about among springing crop of heart devouring trampling spoiling in edith case love have from first come mixed with sense pride of possession first act while yet new born be to set guard round treasure sentinel to watch to day be wide eyed alert from inside drawing room came sound of galloping squadron of chord scale harmony brahms be working up to one of great intellectual crisis with attack thought out brilliantly manoeuvred before delivering irresistible assault then quite suddenly music entirely ceased in middle of bar there be dead silence for second edith conjectured turning of page half second grew grew be clear that be such momentary halt a have be called simply elizabeth have finished have broken off in middle idea explanation leaped into edith mind suggested to by one of green eyed sentinel in present mental condition sapped a be by secret indulgence of week jealousy be unable to resist testing accuracy of conjecture a be to resist demand of lung for air in pursuance of object waited without moving until pulse in clenched hand have throbbed hundred beat then very quietly got out of chair went softly in through open garden door into drawing room elizabeth be sitting with back towards at writing table stood at far end of room a edith entered swift passage of pen ceased sat with head resting on one hand thinking intently then taking up again began writing once more edith have seen enough for present purpose took audible step forward instantly elizabeth turned round a turned shut blotting book on unfinished letter oh how startled said thought somehow have gone out driving with aunt julia edith sat down car have not come round yet said will be here in minute will pas post office will post letter for elizabeth turned farther round in chair hand still lay on closed blotting book oh be only just beginning scribble to father said will not be ready edith considered day of week felt that knew be not to father that elizabeth be writing will just catch mail if post for said otherwise will have to wait week then must wait week said elizabeth jealous people never feel wantonness cruelty of unconfirmed suspicion only know that be not suspicion at certainty noticed that have letter from edward again morning said elizabeth slightly shifted blotting book edith registered fact for so seemed to that letter be lying there again said elizabeth edith felt that be not being wise jealousy be of passion most pig headed only say must know must know yes heard from week ago elizabeth who have be startled by cousin entry be cool enough now perfectly understood what prompted catechism little did edith know how gallant battle be being fought on behalf by girl whom now so utterly distrusted suspected little also did know elizabeth be using whole strength to conceal elizabeth laughed meant to laugh anyhow effort might pas for laugh yes believe did said a for rather fancy have be hearing from day naturally did say in letter to when expected to come down here again have not told that did not mention a far a remember appears to be very busy appears to have time to write very long letter to said edith hatred resentment flashing out till moment have not known that hated cousin elizabeth opened blotting book took out of unfinished letter from under edward slipped into piece of music that lay there holding in hand stood up left table what do know about length of letter to asked edith saw mistake instinct said must know must know have be wonderfully ill inspired in notion of how to find out happened to take up be thick letter said hopelessly trying to efface step giving a reason irrational excuse know thickness of edward letter to said elizabeth be concern of mine how many sheet writes paused moment speak a if resent edward writing to at added edith saw that must get at nothing in way swiftly unexpectedly shifted attack answering elizabeth comment by question why doe keep away from heathmoor said elizabeth have not be expecting anything of kind winced a from blow have to wait moment before must trust voice to be steady have not told asked thought be work during week couple of visit for sunday that be away two instinct be dominant in edith love jealousy inextricably intertwined disputing for mastership love yearning anxiety cord so to speak of jealousy held other end pulled here be so strange of said letter be strange understand at ca help to understand elizabeth be so much cleverer than have anything to do with music there be mistaking sudden piteous sincerity of tone half minute ago have be all anger hate suspicion now appealed to whom have hated suspected elizabeth felt eye grow suddenly dim if be must worry edith said must be quiet not let thought run away with trust everything be all right then there be something wrong asked edith did say did mean to imply take that be busy that have visit feel must pay why must conceal thing from why must assume there be anything to conceal edith instinctively shrank from making direct accusation week jealousy have be dinning in ear so that head rang with elizabeth must simply deny must put on guard here jealousy be busy to prompt chance of finding out more must be lost emotion have narrowed enfeebled scope power of thought must make plan be very unhappy said simply elizabeth took step towards be sorry for dear said make unhappy contribute to expected summons came even a wheel of motor crunched gravel lind sounded gong mr hancock entered household book have proved at least sovereign le than have expected also coral necklace with pearl clasp have come back from jeweller in new case with edith initial on felt that two delightful phenomenon be somehow dependent on other money have spent on new case seemed to be returned to by modesty of household book dearest be ready asked edith let start at once can go round by old mill what delicious tune have be playing elizabeth dear edward will think have got on when hears again why hardly limp at morning edith knew that lotion gave last night must make better mr hancock settled among cushion have lately got new one rather stiff resisting admirably supported small of back footstool from store continued to give complete satisfaction lovely day said just not too hot oh what jolt yet hardly felt at with new cushion see there have be dreadful accident in welsh colliery so sad for poor widow family what lot of misery there be in world a mr martin say must not dwell on too much for fear of dimming sense of thankfulness for blessing edward have heard from edward when be that naughty boy coming back will have to scold dear for neglecting while absorbs in making money there did not hear cuckoo just say 'cuck there be rhyme about yes edward be really quite greedy stopping up in london like to make money yet after dear must consider that be working for making rich for edith turned round sharply so sharply in fact that mother be startled for sudden movement be not characteristic of do really think be mother said if so how about sunday be not here last sunday be not coming down for next sunday what do mean edith asked mr hancock have not have quarrel anything what edith must not say to cousin be possible now have not quarrelled said what if doe even care to quarrel what if have ceased to care at came out with difficulty if care for somebody else mr hancock be sufficiently disturbed not to call attention to cuckoo that in defiance of rhyme be still gifted with complete speech what wild dreadful idea said have reason for supposing so so far must edith go must not tell mother that have definite suspicion affinity attraction have begun to exert force between lover elizabeth chief feeling kept silent be pride confession must be humiliating must be acknowledging a having failed to feed affection have inspired love for genuine though be best of nature be capable be not large enough to make drown still kept own head above water not guessing that be through drowning asphyxiation of self that full life of love be born second cause of reticence dominant be belief in edward loyalty be overlaid with suspicion ivy like covered thrust pushing tendril between stone of solidity beneath rank growth be still there did not yet quite soberly believe that suspected sat silent moment to mother huge discomfort weighing pride in balance confusing with loyalty if be not for absence must not have reason said understand absence gospel according to mr martin be of greatest assistance on point then dear dismiss altogether said mr hancock with relief why be that very point that mr martin spoke of last sunday ah remember must not go to church because of ankle told that ourselves be responsible for most of own unhappiness that if only determined to feel cheerful thankful must find cause of thankfulness being multiplied round be not coincidence that preached on very subject one can hardly call coincidence indeed one feel sure there must have be purpose behind lovely sunshine be not there be old mill so picturesque tell denton to stop moment let look at pause be made for contemplation of particular cause for thankfulness mr hancock put up parasol to temper other well be nice said will drive on have never heard mr martin more convincing eloquent be sure practises what preaches for have always got smile pleasant word for everybody so dismiss from mind dear will be bound will find edward coming down here before many day be past just same a ever showing how right mr martin be for cheerfulness will be rewarded see nothing odd in having to stop up in town week a for going away for couple of sunday to see friend what must be more natural must not wish to be without friend be sure to shirk claim of friendship since said that absence be only ground for dreadfully foolish idea think may consider that have disposed of now let look about enjoy oh there be windmill how sail be going round mr hancock cast slightly questioning glance at daughter to see if mr martin wonderful prescription be acting at once like laughing gas finding that edith still sat serious silent proceeded to administer other fortifying medicine have often told to busy with plan thought for others said there again how practises what preaches have have dining room repapered since mr martin thought be little gloomy have given most beautiful new carpet for sitting room be sure have never be happier in life than summer with future dear to plan scheme for with elizabeth a well to think about must say have have moment to think about even if have wanted to kind face beamed with such smile a mr martin considered to be symptomatic of christian life have got plan about elizabeth said though be secret yet must like to tell about be thinking of making proposal to elizabeth suggesting that must not go back to india a early a october there be great affection between stepmother expect often feel very lonely unhappy there with music a far a can judge only soldier to talk to dear elizabeth think be enjoying quiet life at heathmoor dare say that after dreadful wilderness jungle in india seems to one round of excitement pleasure party opera given free indeed have further plan still will make quite wild with pleasure be sure be thinking of asking to come with to egypt have written to ask uncle bob about just to see if will allow before say anything to of course must pay for journey indeed be on way to india hotel expense must not dream of charging for share of sitting room if have one will go share with edward in dare say servant at hotel must not expect to tip mr hancock plan for other people always necessitated certain amount of interpretation be important to look at from point of view here interpretation be easy have occurred to that must be rather lonely when edith edward left after marriage that in egypt must be pleasant to have somebody in constant attendance on since other two presumably must want to make kind of expedition that might not care to join in liked vitality fervour finding stimulating point touched on next declare elizabeth be a good a tonic said with high spirit gaiety though for last ten day have not be quite so lively dare say be hot weather though to be sure ought to be used to here be on heath again will be at home in ten minute how quickly have come well darling do think have managed to disperse cloud for morning think edward absence will give more anxiety now that have talked so fully about there be nothing like talking thing thoroughly over will see that will not be long before stress of work be finished perhaps be making quantity quantity of money for hear sometimes on stock exchange people make fortune in quite short time must not that be exciting mr hancock a have be seen have great belief in imitative instinct interpreted by mean of own to meant that if felt thoroughly content happy be certain that round must feel happy too for diffused happiness in same way if felt very well knew that diffused spirit of health be comfortable belief like clause of creed must have be quite incredulous if have be told that have done be to accentuate edith suspicion by allusion to elizabeth diminished liveliness to depress thoroughly at thought of elizabeth joining on egyptian tour have edith known how elizabeth have be spending last hour while mother have be so rich in unconvincingness must have known how solid suspicion really be girl have gone up to bedroom after motor have started in order to be secure against further interruption have again read through letter have received from edward that morning a edith have ascertained contained two sheet heard voice in pleading sentence seemed to a read with eye ever again be too dim to decipher word that be actually talking to must not interrupt argue with a must have done if have be here have to fight cumulative effect of close written line besought to allow to come down for be at instance that stayed away tell edith scouted a childish idea absence must make difference that must forget what have called excited madness of evening above again yet again with lover clamorous iteration begged to see elizabeth sat with letter in front of for long time after have finished reading rereading letting tear have way with in strange guise have soft god come to girt about with bitterness impossibility raged at for loving reviled torturing demon that others found so sweet how longed for changed transfigured aspect that burned to show once for mere relief of heart filled page with scrawled word of love only to tear up again once filled page with useless denial with cold assertion that edward be nothing to that be perfectly indifferent to that too be fruitless knew loved even if must have convinced that be not so must not have brought so to convince to deny most sacred truth that have ever known must no more have done that than must accept love brought misery on rose from ash of broken promise if there be binding force in loyalty tie be dissolved after while sob grew quieter tore up letter have begun to when edith that morning have come in from garden till then elizabeth have not known that cousin suspected anything that have begun to put real construction on edward absence now be necessary to quiet suspicion to let edward know also in way must not convey by letter while edith claimed promise that promise must not be broken for reason nothing in world seemed so certain a edith must voluntarily give up before then carefully erased that sentence that contingency be not to be thought of yet elizabeth felt utterly weary confused heart sick obstacle menacing monstrous faced in whichever direction turned perhaps edward presence must only confirm strengthen edith suspicion lead to certainty suspected yet if edward continued to be absent must lead to break on side at initiative be that above must be avoided if threw over said must not marry host of hell heaven combined must not be able to bring elizabeth to must not take what by right be edith against edith will be possible more than possible that edith might see did not love not release only bid begone yet edward have never loved while loving in own manner have be content with liking friendly intimacy when knew that heart have be awakened not for must still desire that moonlight when sun have risen on land elizabeth a finished letter to edward felt that have not slightest idea letter got written word of tenderness love appeared in might have be penned by fossil of family friend written in prehistoric ink for if have not written like there be one other way in must write to must have said be coming to thinnest partition partition most impenetrable insulated from on point will stood utterly firm in short dry note did not attempt to argue question merely told that must come down at once put end to edith intolerable suspicion for to break engagement to will not bring one step nearer be concluding word whether be acting wisely not whether there be not step must take later must be cleverer more tactful must not consider situation be simple enough have to wait for edith to decide solution thing be done that cold hard little sentence that finished letter be written last week of absence have wondered whether will must stand firm enough to enable to tell to make other answer to pleading knew that when came down a assuredly must on next day must be obliged to see to let in justice state case for have now own word to bind must be able by memory to recapture spirit of moment when wrote be definite decision knowledge of must fortify must need felt when be face to face with overwhelming need of resolution taken embedded in mortar of fact always give relief even if death sentence be involved in acute edge of suspense be removed when elizabeth having posted letter strolled out again into garden be conscious of certain tranquillity to for last ten day have be utter stranger did not suppose that there be anything more than lull in tempest knew that must again howl buffet round even a on night after opera have felt momentary calm a looked at moonlit flood tide so now be given respite now felt securer have gained little ground must look out over contention estimate odds against a le desperate be just here have walked on dewy morning in ecstasy of unreflecting happiness when instinct to give thanks to one first came to to day saw triumphant riot of midsummer under noonday sun no le than garden be surrounded by burden heat dew freshness have faded from cool petal heavy head of rose drooped on stem with brimming eye bitten lip encouraged to exhibit sturdier pluck than must not yield must not hang head must whatever issue might be be grateful to power have come into soul power to love ignorantly ten day ago have thought that sufficient now with greater knowledge wondered whether ignorance have not told right after then seemed to matter nothing so long a loved now just for little while knew mattered nothing caught glimpse a of snow peak behind storm cloud of reality so lofty so serene that almost distrusted eye suddenly mind sped on magic flight to low white house at peshawar from so often have lifted eye up through heat haze to quivering line of eternal snow to steadfast peak rose above dust storm cloud smiled a recognized by what association of idea mind have winged way thither garden there must be withered in heat yearned for scene where life have be so unperplexed above yearned for father who even now retained simplicity of youth yearned for comradeship wisdom patience sympathy must have told trouble so easily confidently must hear say lizzie dear be so sorry of course have to do just what did must have argued with taking side of longing love telling that nothing must be counted reckoned with against fact that edward loved other again must hear say dear know think that really then must have said mean have sobbed heart out against rough homespun jacket wore in garden garden at end be low wall over one night have vaulted when just outside lay dying brahmin to whom beggar death by wayside needy indigent be triumph transcended telling be finding of life have sought eye already dim in death be open not upon death life have renounced fair thing that world offered to find something infinitely fairer round tired hungry dying banner of stupendous triumph waved how have reached that by seeking how have sought by renunciation what have found life moment have worn vividness splendour of dream elizabeth be again conscious of heavy headed flower noonday heat wheel of motor scraped on gravel sweep at other side of house in minute must be plunged back in deed need of day no longer felt so utterly alone desolate far behind storm have seen snow for moment moonlight have shone on face of dying brahmin there be tie between something expressed in peace of great silence in vision of dying eye be not right in hoping in choice have just made there be one thread running through there be factor common to here be mr hancock coming into garden dear be wise to be out in sun without hat asked have have nice quiet time for practising have be telling edith felt sure edward must think have got on when come down here again chapter x edward return elizabeth letter to edward have pressed upon immediate return to heathmoor at cost of week end engagement if such existed to desire of heart for other have be revealed on night of opera a chaos suddenly made manifest by flash of lightning on consideration have be more decent wise that must absent a elizabeth have foreseen absence must not indefinitely continue since implied absence from edith a well a herself be of nature of temporary measure to give breathing space time for reflection have told not with confidence that absence must restore legitimate allegiance poor girl have little trust in mildness of prescription be so to speak dose where knife be called for in case edith revealed suspicion have rendered return necessary solution of knot into heart string of three young folk be tangled must be dealt with by presence here for girl interval before must answer whether reply be argued negative to elizabeth affirmative announcement to edith passed in acute discomfort rose fell like ebb flow of physical pain of deep seated mischief into crisis of anguish numb reaction there be not employment there be scarcely topic of conversation did not conduct sooner later to impassable road where be red flag danger signal hour passed in broken conversation aching silence with edith sentinelled about by fear jealousy elizabeth torn with longing hearing amid troubled peace of renunciation voice accused of bitter cruelty to herself to poured scorn on tragic folly of refusal twenty time day felt must barely resist need of telegraphing to cancelling letter acceding to imperative desire of simply taking next train up to town going to saying have come will renounced still will still dominated deed time knew that edith watched with sidelong glance be quickly removed when own eye met sometimes seemed that edith must speak so intense be miserable strain always shied away at last moment over palpitating duellist who never quite came to blow presided mr hancock unconscious bland foolish voluble have experienced moment discomfort morning when edith spoke to of edward continued absence a mr martin must have do dismissed with complete success from mind telling that have quite cleared up made edith comfortable again obvious constraint hung over two girl merely refused to admit into mind might batter ring at door there be need for even to open door chink assert that be out sat knitted at crossover in evening played patience refusing to hear signal of distress trouble next day came telegram from edward to edith announcing arrival at half past seven that evening asking rather supposing that might dine with be delivered at lunch time edith a tore open glanced at elizabeth opposite saw sudden whiteness of face saw that sat with fork half raised to lip then put back on plate again that waited with hand pressed to table to control trembling message gave rise to debate for mr hancock edith be engaged to dine at vicarage night small solitary dinner have already three hour before be ordered for elizabeth there be to be slip lamb cutlet quite enough not too much of course must be natural said mr hancock to ask to come have little dinner with dear elizabeth then must amuse yourselves by playing to other afterwards till edith returned then edith must have made excuse to get away perhaps at ten even five minute before now dinner be ordered be very provoking mr williams edith interrupted watching elizabeth narrowly jealousy seemed to have divided into two camp part for moment be stronger allied with scheme if elizabeth edward have evening together thing if there be thing must declare there must be answer to eternal question want to know want to know be delightful plan mother said surely mr williams have got cold beef edward say nobody can need more than plenty of cold beef for dinner elizabeth will enjoy evening together will talk over opera play sha be obliged to hurry back from martin rather diabolical speech hit mark elizabeth blushed furiously a heard yapping bitterness in edith voice be not only with rush of conscious blood that face flared anger flamed at innuendo double meaning in fact need reply to edward telegram at said edith will naturally come here for dinner elizabeth looked up at cousin at moment completely fervently hated oh must do edith said edward must come over here anxiety to see find only must be horribly disappointed make very disagreeable must wonder if went straight back to london again be first pas of naked sword between yesterday have not come to touch of steel first bout be distinctly in elizabeth favour elizabeth have not parried only have attacked yet be only with foolish word must not wound that have thrust have edith only known cousin be fighting for with loyalty be a divine a be human calling on loyalty of lover to be up in arm assault with sharp double meaning only gratified moment laudable savagery instantly turned to aunt oh aunt julia said must so like evening alone do tell edward be out can be here sunday want to write to daddy want to practise not play practise well must put mr williams out said mr hancock to know that have to provide dinner for edward a well for a for letting eat nothing cold beef think must sooner leave service than do edward be great favourite with mr williams indeed where must get provision know for be early closing even such shop a have here be shut think plan be best dear father must like not to hear from then there be practice a well will write note to have everybody finished of must like to drive with afternoon elizabeth conscious of own loyalty did not in least

overpowering sensation in mind absorbed active power of thought spread like dense enveloping mist obscuring other perception namely knowledge that in house next door edward sat alone perhaps walked in garden longing to catch sight of over low brick wall too must have spent hour of darkening twilight outside for fear of seeing more exactly for longing to see must starve deny doubt must have to see have to listen to pleading be part of resolve that must use will to hold apart thought of possessed must not concentrate mind enough even to attempt to practise to write overdue letter have taken all

morning sunshine asleep over saw congested with winter green with young growth of spring triumphant in blaze of summer gorgeous with flare of dying year saw with rain cloud lowering on hill swelling stream with gathered water saw underneath lash of rain echoing to drum of thunder saw beneath moonlight white with starshine on snow suddenly elizabeth held hand suspended over key in throat breath suspended through maze of melody have heard sound faint tingling pierced through noise of vibrating string bell have rung hearing knew that unconsciously have be listening for with yearning with eye of shipwrecked watch for sail there be step in hall few word of indistinguishable talk turned round on music stool faced door opened whispering on thick carpet edward stood there in silence held out

once more have power to turn from went back to piano to close mechanically shut up music have be playing from then though have heard nothing felt that change have come into room from edge of field of vision saw that edward have turned towards door looked door be open edith stood there elizabeth let piano lid slip from hand fell with bang jar of wire be back early said at least be early be not have aunt julia come back telephoned for car left almost immediately after dinner ankle began to hurt again reaction after struggle have begun in though be for edith advantage have done battle be not for edith sake sight of cousin suddenly filled with bitter resentment felt perfectly sure also that reason for return be wholly fictitious have come back like for entirely different purpose elizabeth feigned exaggerated sympathy oh be so sorry said surely edith be madness to stand like be sure be in agony of course will go to bed at once will not ring for filson then will telephone ask dr frank to come round immediately be very bad poor dear anyhow have pleasure of seeing edward did not expect to find here did did goaded accused of foolish attempt at deceit edith turned to yes did said thought extremely probable ah can have be for sake of finding here a much a for sake of ankle see still continue to stand on came back edward do hear edith expected to find here so be not disappointed be sure ankle feel much better be scarcely possible to believe that jeering scoffing girl be same who five minute before pleaded with lover with such womanly strength such splendid self repression that must have thus battled for right of whom now so bitterly taunted indeed mere identity of edith be casual accident elizabeth have ranged on side of principle rather than instance of for rest after scene in have called upon ounce of moral force to aid have nervously entirely collapsed with jar like of fallen piano lid then collapse spread little farther angry fire burned in for pitiful subterfuge went out swaying a stood put hand before eye be giddy said be afraid be going to faint edward took quick step towards waved aside fell on to sofa edith looked at without moving will be all right if sit still moment said then think be who have better go to bed a edward be here want to talk to privately leave alone edward be better left alone paid attention to went to sofa can do anything for said ca get water brandy elizabeth sat up will be right said will just sit here minute two then will go edith want to talk to have not seen for so long slowly vitality returned with for second time day aching sense of uselessness of bitter ironical word to cousin of sheer stupidity of wrangle if edith chose to tell foolish tale about ankle concerned nobody did not matter for one thing only in world mattered with regard to for present felt total apathy have done part nobody not even must require anything more of felt hugely overwhelmingly tired nothing more at got up will take advice edith go to bed said if there be anything want to tell afterwards please come up to room good night edward not till step have passed away up stair did either of two others speak edith face firm pretty plump showed not slightest sign of emotion stood in front of empty fire place waving feather fan backwards forward opposite knee looking at think have better tell have happened said if find difficulty in doing will tell imagine that have fallen in love with answer seemed superfluous after little pause apparently thought so too went on still in same quiet passionless tone have often watched said have used music a instrument to encourage draw on be not so said edward of course be bound to defend be manly of what must expect from doe not matter yes doe matter said throughout fault have be entirely mine have got to believe that understand at if think otherwise want to understand elizabeth nature mine be so far apart that attempt to understand what be perfectly clear to be that knew that be engaged have tried to come between so far understand for be far enough edward looked at half hour ago have wondered whether elizabeth be flesh blood now wondered if edith be be absolutely mistaken about said be who have be unswervingly loyal to disloyalty have be entirely mine know ca make believe be so edith met eye looking at steadily without tremor yes can make believe if ask to release from

tell happened on night of opera will tell why have kept away day will even show letter from brought back will have to believe for moment nothing seemed to matter to except edith must believe in silence followed watched face marvelled at change came there be a if be possible to see belief penetrating into brain transforming feature even a thaw of spring penetrate into congealed ground softening outline bedewing spear head of frozen grass with moisture percolate liquefies ice bound tussock even so edith frozen with jealous hate for elizabeth melted at word truth of be impossible to doubt for nature of proof offered be guarantee for have to believe unfreezing melted crust of hardness be dissolved pitiful imperative yearning welled up from very spring of pierced flooded ground have be sealed to outflow a far a will went banished bitterness blame of elizabeth be alone with lover love be more adamantine than mere frozen surface of hatred jealousy have be till crust be dissolved inner spring must not flow now be melted flooded fan dropped unregarded at foot clasped hand together believe said be who who be responsible ask to release be well for for ca release can refuse to marry suppose man can always do if have made girl love have asked to marry did not answer went on winding unwinding finger see love said ca let go only few week ago liked enough anyhow to

have sought light heartedly with view to comfort quiet happiness domestic peace must abase to asking that must not withdraw so paltry gift have known liked admired for year have offered not knowing how cheap shabby be devotion what be wholly unworthy of acceptance in return now gave unreservedly have be capable of only asking that rubbish must not be taken from now a sat there full of cold pity for full of scorn for that must give pity be unable to give warmth knelt to clasping knee beseeching so grovelling so abandoned seemed only to degrade knowing now that knew what love be how royal be gift brought saw bankrupt abject receiving supplication of noble petitioner with streaming eye voice that choked besought just give what can darling said oh how content will be be so short time ago that thought must make happy can believe can be not worthy when asked first have learned so much since began to love be worthier now have always liked have always be good friend will get over sudden infatuation for elizabeth will be so good about wo be jealous of be fault that fell in love with will never reproach for will be so happy together very soon will go back to india will forget will do anything except give up once twice have tried to interrupt swept word away in torrent of entreaty here for moment voice utterly choked put arm round raising dragging from knee weeping hysterically clung to burying face on shoulder tenderness kindliness in nature came to dear talk like that said soothing cry like dry eye edith there be nothing to cry about tell then sobbed what be going to do with still with arm about led across room to sofa where hour ago elizabeth have fallen there be possibility of choice left saw that clearly enough must not break promise made to one who loved strength of whose love have not even conjectured before undemonstrative reticent by nature edith have never yet shown heart have known how completely be there be struggle more there be left to only self humiliating task of comforting god know will give can said will do best to make happy dear humiliate more know that be giving woman can give man be sweet of to forgive deserve to be forgiven there dry eye let dry for never never hope will cry again because of edith sobbing have ceased with woman instinct began to repair with deft finger little disorder of dress oh will love so darling whispered will be happy know will be happy when give best gift of when give child child yes yes know said how grannie will love shrank away from moment at have said anything might comfort quiet came to tongue how will love added quickly there look more yourself still leaning on a if to let go turned tear stained face round to mirror above sofa ah what fright said will just go wash face then come back to

said ca say be surprise for told edith be sure must look in where be edith where be elizabeth edward shook hand elizabeth went to bed hour ago said be not feeling very well edith have just gone upstairs be going to look in see how be mr hancock sat down to patience table always played patience when have be to party to calm after excitement be that like darling edith said forgetting about ankle will be bound even about though must scold for will have told that ankle began to pain fancy there be second king already ring bell dear edward must have little lemonade doubt must like whisky soda ace how provoking mr hancock have tremendous belief in own perspicacity looking at young man came to very distinct conclusion that something have happened voice sounded rather odd too simultaneously caught sight of wreck of edith fan on floor remarkable power of imagination instantly enabled to connect deplorable accident for edith be usually so careful with whatever be that have happened perhaps there have be little tiff over edward long continued absence summoned up tact optimism why if be edith fan said must have dropped stepped on must be more like elizabeth to step on what long time have be away edith be almost disposed to blame for until have good talk together told must never do for to neglect business friend once mr hancock be away from for month when there be slump boom in market dear how old word come back to one though be sure forget what mean have be slump boom dear edward last fortnight oh everything have be pretty quiet said absently must barely focus attention enough on what be saying to understand upstairs edith have gone in to see elizabeth to tell what have happened see said mr hancock with great cordiality so have have to watch thing very carefully such pleasant dinner at mr martin great deal of wise witty talk have lovely plan for elizabeth will tell about to morrow so there be reason why must not tell now mean to let stay with after have taken darling away october november come with to egypt so that will meet again happy little party have just heard from father who of course will pay for travelling expense be quite agreeable if elizabeth like quite look forward to telling will go mad with joy think for imagine girl seeing egypt at age be very fond of elizabeth be lively cheerful though think have felt heat last fortnight so affectionate be not be not sure doe like cousin edward best of of amazing display of tactful conversation designed to take edward mind off little tiff that might have have with edith demanded kind of appreciation from must be delighted to know elizabeth liked said may be sure doe common interest have too in music ah here be edith patience be coming out in spite of horrid ace blocked so long be talking about elizabeth dear be telling edward how fond be of poor lady have touched limit of endurance think must be getting to bed said not wait chat while have lemonade well dear be nice to see again have doubt that edith will see out lock door after so that need not ring for lind again edith darling fan who must have stepped on be elizabeth have ankle ceased to pain edward followed edith out into hall there be repressing anxiety to know did see asked yes oh edward have be wronging elizabeth so be sorry told did care for not one scrap have never entered head asked forgiveness for having have such dreadful thought about know how thought so have made quite happy see never thought of kissed forgave lifted face to told to tell said edward kissed quickly stepped out into black cloud shadowed night chapter xi telegram mr hancock be distinctly aware when three day afterwards started in motor for drive with elizabeth in order to live worthily up to mr martin pattern of thankful cheerful christian life have to keep very firm hand on herself nail smile to pleasant mouth indeed for last few day have to set before ideal not of cheerful of grinning christianity like prudent manager however have steadfastly saved up a conquering antidote to depression queerness be so marked in joyful plan must give girl month more of heathmoor own undivided society reunited tour in egypt afterwards at colonel fanshawe expense prospect of felt sure must not possibly fail to restore to elizabeth accustomed exhilaration liveliness meantime mr hancock have carefully forborne to ask of girl for edith also have exhibited symptom of queerness what be ailing with serenity of life fitted in with cheerful gospel to know a little a possible about worrying annoying topic lest infection must mar soothing uplifting influence over others of mind wholly untroubled two inquiry only have made be from edward elicited comfortable fact that event of th of october still remained firm that have not lost money in city after firmly shut eye to possible cause of trouble though one that correct one actually stood immediately in foreground of mental vision by long practice in obedience to mr martin gospel have reached pitch of absolute perfection in feat of mental eye closing even a child frightened by dark can by effort of will shut out terrifying possibility by corresponding physical feat firmly bury head under bed clothes victory over subtle influence of gloom general oddity have not be gained without effort have be distinctly hard to maintain equable cheerfulness with elizabeth sometimes for little girl be quite with short lived flood of high spirited talk sometimes from sitting room mr hancock must hear flight of brilliant song bird on piano then suddenly flood must cease from pouring flight fail in mid air once just after silence have fallen on ringing air have come into drawing room to find elizabeth sitting with hand still resting on key head bowed forward over assertion that be not ill carried conviction denial that anything be matter be le easy of belief said since successful inquiry might lead to disturbing information mr hancock fell back on unimpeachable general duty of trusting everybody completely in particular of believing what elizabeth said required effort to remain perfectly comfortable for be surrounded with people who did not appear to be so edward so seemed to though have lost money be going to marry edith on th of october seemed to have be drawn into what looked upon a vicious circle vicious since be wrong positively wrong not to be happy comfortable be not quick discerning in interpretation of symptom indeed when suspected that anything be amiss quick to see symptom at through closed eyelid so to speak there filtered fact that elizabeth altogether avoided looking at edward that observed with furtive eager glance somehow seemed disappointed in what sought also though elizabeth took spasmodic violent spell at piano never played in evening when edward be there have evinced sudden desire to learn new patience mr hancock have found in lady paper mr hancock did not so much wonder at for particular mode of killing time be undoubtedly of thrilling interest almost thought of buying elizabeth little patience table for birthday occurred in october intended in case to look out article in question in catalogue from store see how much cost there must be harm in if cost more than felt must manage why there must be necessity to say anything about then admirable notion struck own table be getting little rickety shook when put card down on to also be rather small for great four pack king of mexico have fully determined to learn autumn so elizabeth must have old table must get new one of size bevelled edge adjustable top that be even more expensive did not trouble impressively told that must not have dreamed of buying have not be that wanted to give dear elizabeth present in fact though bought apparently for be really elizabeth for whom great expense be incurred rich refreshing reward namely month at heathmoor instead of cobra desert of india tour in egypt most expensive patience table at store must announce to fortunate niece a went round by old mill how look of trouble depression must fade from dear elizabeth face a listened to announcement of delicious joy one after other mr hancock felt sudden gush of thankfulness to kind disposition of providence have endowed with ample income be so eager to spend in securing happiness of others even while without conscious commonplace felt blessed in such opportunity will to take advantage of must not help feeling how true be that kindness thought for others be so laden with gain for oneself for must have new patience table size with bevelled edge delightful companion throughout october after edith have left while elizabeth father must pay expense in egypt must not help feeling also how much more christian how much more martinesque be to stifle smother destroy might be cause of elizabeth trouble by perfect shower of cause for happiness rather than inquire into thus run risk of being unsettled made uneasy have certainly required effort have to put firmly out of mind not only elizabeth possible worry also remembrance of evening when have come back from dinner with martin thought edward voice have sounded odd seen edith fan lying broken on floor have never be explained edith have said subsequently that supposed must have stepped on be very odd must not have noticed for breaking of ivory stick must have made quite loud snap meantime gong heralded arrival of motor have sounded quite two minute elizabeth have not yet appeared mr hancock thought must just speak to on subject of punctuality then wipe impression of blame away by recital of prospective benefit elizabeth be not downstairs be just possible that have not heard gong lind be told to sound again elizabeth heard second time that boomed rose from where knelt by bed by side of five minute ago have flung following so seemed to blind instinctive impulse that morning there have broken over storm of rayless despair for couple of day after final rejection of edward when edith absolute determination not to give up voluntarily have be known to apathetic quiet of step taken of deliberate renunciation have be hers have not be poor girl guessed peace be always eventually not only reward consequence of self abnegation only exhaustion follows prolonged mental effort edith choice apart from tremendous significance have for herself be incredible monstrous to nature did not question fact that edith loved edward notion of love not seeking happiness of beloved be to inconceivable must not understand must not in consequence have smallest sympathy with have to take did take on trust let depend on own unalterable decision that decision that a far a must see took sun bodily out of own life from mere weariness have found in dull acquiescence in apathy have for couple of day anaesthetized against insensitiveness knowing that be valueless have made pitiful little struggle seeking now to establish kind of sympathy renewal of intimacy with cousin now to rouse to feel in music passion with have inspired instead for present found have shrinking abhorrence of beauty have become remote from withdrawn eminence unassailable snow peak mocked did more than mock reminded of have done for how through edward have be brought together to stand now close to other embracing overlapping yet with thin unmeltable ice between then in due course have come recuperation of vital force have awoke morning after long dreamless sleep to find that anaesthesia of mind have passed off for couple of minute perhaps have lain still in delicious consciousness of restored vigour of delight in new freshness of early day then a became fully conscious of herself again found that what have be recuperated in be capacity for suffering blackness of vivid despair bright black not dull black fell on more black because knew that be darkness of own making word from to edward must scatter let loose morning have doubt of doubt that at bidding must break fetter of promise bound a easily a if have be wisp of unwoven straw told be more persuasive must hear voice telling that be committing crime against love that be refusing bidding profane most sacred gift of told that be fool to listen to voice sounded so insistently there be yet voice still small be steadfast in message to be not that cared one jot for ordinary external consequence of disobedience to guessed that there must be consensus of opinion in favour if disobeyed doubt must say be deplorable accident that edward have fallen in love with other once accident have happened be best to make best of regrettable situation young man have never be in love with poor edith have fallen lukewarm victim to influence of propinquity mr hancock certainly be very sad for miss hancock be young must get over probably end by making quite good marriage elizabeth cared little for approval condemnation of world in general thought of be remote stifled insignificant be edward who called to called loud called closely low must be deaf not to listen to not hear even at cost have to approve of black empty aching intolerable loneliness have one desire apart from desire of heart be to escape from to go away a quickly a possible to be out of sight of what might not contemplate far away across league of hot ocean mile of plain baking from summer solstice be father one else in world did want to see to one else if even to must pour out woe must comprehend must approve knew of have done not blaming for letting love so completely envelop not praising rejection of simply seeing even a have seen in loneliness heart anguish that there be other course possible knew that a thoroughly a if have already opened whole heart to there be letter already written have not yet posted now opened added postscript father dear wrote be awfully awfully unhappy ca write to about when get please send telegram saying want home at once trust that be wiser delay dear daddy pen dropped from finger after have re directed letter sat quite still looking blankly at have told edith did not love edward that have never thought of like if there must be degree in abject wretchedness hers be depth unplumbable yet colossal lie seemed to necessary edith believing that cousin loved edward yet refused to release of own will so be to have must be given what be already hers handsomely largely must be wicked even at cost of denial to give with stab so to speak emptiness utter loneliness self ordained must tell somebody about misery must pour out unshared grief for burden of be intolerable with dry blind eye with groping instinct to seek just to seek threw on knee by bed knew not what whom sought there be just blind unerring instinct in soul instinct of homing pigeon mr hancock put up parasol when three cushion be perfectly adjusted car slid slowly forward think will have time to go round by old mill said though be little late in starting wonder elizabeth if must make effort to be more punctual dear think there be person in world who hate blaming people a much a do so want mean to blame only ask to make little effort be so easy to form habit while be about might just a well form habit of punctuality a of unpunctuality be so sorry aunt julia said be thinking about time dear be just want to think about time little more there be just little touch of selfishness inconsiderateness in keeping other people waiting selfishness be so horrible be not edith be never unpunctual though time ankle be bad got downstairs very slowly allowed for be engrossing employment to day kept be saying prayer aunt julia at least be trying to mr hancock laid hand on elizabeth dear be very good reason said though be afraid mean that forgot to say when got up be very good plan elizabeth to say moment get out of bed then be off mind oh what beautiful fresh air there be morning think might almost have window down yours quite down prayer yes to think that when came did want to go to church at felt sure that mr martin why there be do see in red coat playing golf fancy what coincidence be dining with to night must be sure to tell that saw just very moment be speaking of only way to get through day work be to do everything punctually prayer then when bedtime come be ready for with nothing left undone to keep awake now dear have great deal to tell be sure look forward to doing so be almost a great pleasure to a will be to to hear about plan have made for mr hancock have settled that climax be to be egypt patience table perhaps be least sensational of benefit be going to begin with have often noticed lately dear said what interest take in patience so much so indeed elizabeth that have have not note of music in evening for week past though have thought sometimes have seen edward looking at piano a if must like to hear how be getting on look there be old mill will tell denton to stop so that can enjoy looking at so thought to myself other night perhaps little bird whispered to that must like to play patience too in evening so will dear will have patience table for very own will get one for mind elizabeth be not lent to use only a use other thing in house be quite yours moment other table come from store may take back to india if wish when go when go oh be kind dear aunt julia said girl why must give go to expense of new one enjoy seeing play just a much a must enjoy playing mr hancock wondered if be really true generosity about taking table to india so neatly introduced next topic have be unpremeditated flash of course if elizabeth did not want to play patience there be kind of reason for getting new table luckily at moment remembered king of mexico employing four pack must not be properly laid out on table at present used dear be determined will have table of own said to take to india with if wish perhaps noticed that said 'when go ' repeated that brings on to second plan must enjoy dear must really enjoy stopping on here after edith edward be married

quite pair of blue stocking when meet edith edward again be able to tell sort of interesting thing about greek ancient egyptian will take patience table with for shuts up more conveniently than table have ever seen dare say will often ask for loan of if will be so kind a to lend then will come down nile together happy party know very well dear elizabeth that when come to part go on to india from wherever be that boat call for one will miss very much indeed mr hancock have warmed up into most pleasurable glow of generosity felt that wonderful plan a matter of fact have be made solely with view to own comfort be entirely due to altruistic desire for elizabeth delight self deception be complete triumphant have for time quite lost sight of undoubted fact that have thought of herself only in making of have secured excuse for new patience table companion during what must have otherwise be month of loneliness at expense to herself of somebody who must look after in egypt be devoted to comfort fully expected burst of gratitude rapturous scarcely credulous assent from girl elizabeth sat quite silent for moment oh aunt julia be sweet of said think be quite impossible must go back to india must get back to father aunt julia still glowed dear father have made up mind to do without let enjoy said wrote to about oh week ago telling not to allude to at to must tell will rejoice in happiness a much a elizabeth clasped hand together on knee oh ca ca said thank ever so much aunt julia indeed wrote to father only to day saying wanted to come back to quite soon sooner than have planned ca explain have be so kind to know must go back to india a soon a possible simply that mr hancock recognized earnestness of girl tone pleasure glow faded from face really think word do require explanation said to think of so busy planning contriving for pleasure saying that want of plan yes denton drive on have looked at old mill long enough think ought to tell what mean elizabeth ca tell said try to think mean nothing that mean only just what have said doe mean want to go back to india if be possible must go back to day want to see father have be long time away from though edith edward be so kind miss dreadfully be homesick want to get back mr hancock own beautiful architectural design for elizabeth happiness tumbled in ruin elizabeth notion of replacing did not seem in least satisfactory who avowedly have planned contrived for end found accusing girl of most barefaced selfishness when stated what really wanted apparently thought about nothing well can say at present said mr hancock be that be dreadfully disappointed grieved yes be sorry put in elizabeth be quite impossible must think be ungrateful aunt julia think can expect to praise for gratitude said mr hancock want praise deserve want to go back to father mr hancock sense of ill usage of having kindness met by black ingratitude rankled grew be worse much worse than painful case of housemaid who suited so well going away from service to be married indeed that misguided creature marriage did not turn out very happily mr hancock be sure did wonder cause of so many bitter memory appeared now a perfect angel in comparison must say that can not consider pretty return for indulgence have showered on said have treated like own daughter elizabeth with piano always ready dusted for most expensive motor always whirling about country wherever like to go new table for patience never thing asked of in return till suggest that must keep company during october flatly refuse what father will say know with kindness in paying for tour in egypt when settled between to let come with up nile at great deal of expense now can say be that want to go ca explain why here be thinking of ordering book on egypt from london library very afternoon even planning going up to london day week to make sure of getting place in sleeping car to marseille ca explain elizabeth felt suddenly goaded to exasperation at child babble of book from library ticket for sleeping car be round such thing a that aunt emotion clung like swarming bee around queen felt wild desire to supply aunt julia with something real to think about something must really pierce through coil of comfort padding that wrapped up a in eiderdown quilt at present ever reached be slight disarrangement minute tweaking of one of quilt if by year of habit be too firmly tucked round must be something to let see that others be not so grossly wadded against world against reality will explain if like said quickly almost smiled to see aunt julia huddling quilt round clutching with eager finger dreading lest must be taken from by cruel inconsiderate hand dear have given confidence voluntarily said in great hurry be last person in world to ask for confidence when be not freely given dear edith have always told everything be reason why must do mean that edith have told about asked girl about inexplicable rejection of plan for including patience table certainly not that imagine concern dear edith must be last to betray what seems to be secret elizabeth broke in again be offering not to make secret of from said mr hancock turned almost imploring face to elizabeth said have not come to with of own accord be quite wrong to hint that owed explanation if have hinted so withdraw look there be mr beaumont with butterfly net let be silent for little collect ourselves again talk be getting very wild uncomfortable must kindly put window shade more up mr hancock regarded view with severe compressed face into there stole by degree expression of relief felt that have dealt with threatening situation in extremely tactful manner elizabeth have not chosen to confide in have put so told natural curiosity aside refused to hear secret have not voluntarily be made known to that waiving of personal feeling in matter have a usual immediate reward for have averted risk of hearing something thoroughly uncomfortable dismissed that consideration in silence for have asked devoted to pained contemplation of elizabeth selfishness have so much surprised grieved hitherto have not thought elizabeth at selfish except in matter of unpunctuality discovery be great blow to have quite made up mind that girl must jump at delightful proposal have be fruit of so much thought about egypt did not care so particularly felt terribly blank at prospect of lonely october with elizabeth taking real solid interest in patience with interval between tea dinner filled in by reading about ancient egyptian with companion for two daily motor drive have felt really quite resigned to losing edith since on return from egypt must be living again next door of course must be only too delighted to enjoy mother companionship during edward daily absence in city now there have come earthquake upsetting everything there be proverb misfortune never come singly felt indefinable dread that filson must want to marry next mr williams threaten to leave of course must raise mr williams wage again to stem tide of disaster if filson wanted to marry doubt must try effect of raising filson wage must point to awful fate of housemaid even might not prove sufficient if filson loved hypothetical young man very much then tried to cling to gospel of mr martin determined not to dwell on unnerving possibility meantime elizabeth sat silent a requested by kindliness of mr hancock existed in large crude quantity affection for girl in own way be perfectly genuine came to aid however startling deplorable elizabeth selfishness be be sorry for might be trouble lay at root of provided only that trouble be not confided to be willing eager to do best to alleviate secretly guessed that edward be concerned in guessed also that girl affection be concerned in rejected without difficulty that elizabeth have conceived hopeless passion for mr beaumont illicit one for mr martin inferred that elizabeth affection edward be synonymous term be only guess hastened to assure herself of might really be a insubstantial a hoped be shattering notion that filson be engaged in love affair shut door on there be poor elizabeth trouble safely locked up wondered how must help turned to girl dear be sure have trouble said must be last to ask about be there not anybody must consult perhaps wanting to go back to father mean that think must help be there one here must not tell edith if doe not know about already there be mr martin must find kindness wisdom often think of a mind doctor to whom must certainly go if be worried oh thank aunt julia said think will worry mr martin must like to tell daddy about will must be worry for mr martin said mr hancock be so used to hearing about other people trouble be quite profession have often said to that wish be to bring joy to people take away wretchedness noble career ca think why make bishop elizabeth gave little squeal of laughter a unexpected to a be to aunt think will really aunt julia repeated appeared to mr hancock bit of selfishness seemed to quite likely that mr martin really magical touch might easily remove elizabeth trouble in case egypt patience table blossomed again instead of withering on stalk determined not to give up quite yet abandon elizabeth so represented to to moral pit of selfishness mr martin who dined with mr hancock that evening spoke of egypt a if be newly acquired possession of hers like motor gate have in spite of edward luke warmness on subject be put into wall separated two garden trumpeted praise in usual manner will miss terribly said heathmoor will not be without still how right be to go see for take car with then will be down on denton expect to stop for sermon sunday morning poor fellow instead of stealing out to bring car back for poor denton have have will be glad will warrant when come back again can shirk padre jaw a usual excellent fellow denton upon word be sorry for will skip page two now then if denton look too reproachfully at alfred alfred said wife will nobble be nobble edward will nobble denton to sing psalm in choir said mr martin while mr hancock be away will have car to take back after have gone to church yes yes give denton dose of david to begin with alfred to finish up with mr martin looked furtively round to see if lind be amused mr martin put hand to face alfred alfred said be not alfred naughty mr hancock beamed delightedly wild religious badinage always pleased seemed to make human thing of religion to bring into ordinary life will leave denton in hand said with utmost confidence so long a make clergyman of before come back suggested mr martin wo do that there be many mansion be sure that good fellow in garage occupies one of have got mansion have not miss elizabeth in music edward here in city though be lucky fellow to be sure for have musical mansion a well meet meet be shade more solemn than mr martin usual dinner table conversation mr hancock crumbling bread with dropped eye saw here very good gambit to open with again in little serious conversation meant if possible to have with afterwards then appearance of very particular salad roused immediate attention must eat mr martin said be new sort of lettuce elli insisted on getting be told that in egypt be quite unsafe to eat salad raw vegetable for ca tell who have be touching what sort of water have be washed in be same in india be not elizabeth mr martin turned briskly to girl why join aunt in tour to egypt said be on way back to india be not why not put afric sunny fountain in before india coral strand dear how wonderful bishop heber grasp be be indeed coincidence that mr martin must suggest quite without consultation very scheme that mr hancock have planned contrived that mr martin must think of quite independently seemed to mr hancock tremendous almost religious argument in favour well be odd now that must have mentioned that said for be proposing to elizabeth only morning that must do very thing that mr martin must agree with well edward looked up caught elizabeth eye ricocheted so to speak on to edith returned in time to catch drift of mr martin further comment on bishop heber mr hancock saw sudden colour flame in elizabeth face saw glance played between three young people shut more firmly than ever door into have thrust conjecture on subject entirely refused to recognize possible existence of anything so very uncomfortable mr martin observed that wife have got well under way again with bishop heber spoke confidently to hostess have got scheme in head too about egypt said though know that will come to anything want to send dear minnie to south for month two of winter remember perhaps how unwell be last winter what wonderful jelly mr williams sent indeed if think can manage believe will really have courage to suggest that go out about same time a so that wo be quite alone in land of bondage of course for moment hint at actually joining party hush mr hancock be observed have not said word about to yet be impossible that mr hancock must not feel that providence have kindly turned attention to disappointment about elizabeth egyptian tour be true that even more harrowing subject of lonely october in case elizabeth persisted in selfishness have not at present attracted notice suggestion of mr martin seemed to to be direct divine contrivance for comfort have wish to examine into logic of belief did not dream of inquiring if really thought that mr martin have suffered from bronchitis last winter in order that husband might think of sending south now so that mr hancock must have somebody to attend to in egypt felt that elizabeth perhaps be not intended to go to egypt being so providence having special regard for comfort have put forward utterly unexpected idea to see if liked did like also formed conclusion that on side be meant not to urge elizabeth more even to see if mr martin must not probe heal trouble be evident that entire arrangement be being seen after for have to meet half way to acquiesce thankfully help on turned beamingly to mr very thing said a for dear mr martin not being of party how must suggest such idea subject cognate to bishop heber be actively engaging mr martin mr hancock must speak without fear of being overheard will share sitting room a guest of course everything said after dinner must have couple of word together if be only question of expense that trouble if there be difficulty there must allow to help elizabeth say for matter of that second class cabin on liner to port said be bit a good a first offer to help be not so precipitate a sounded mr hancock have seriously considered during afternoon what expense of companion must be have come to conclusion that if elizabeth must not join must be able to afford providential idea must save greater part of expense for doubt if must persuade mr martin to let pay since must then be saved full expense of companion forty pound perhaps thirty towards mr martin travelling doubt on subject of whether must be afforded must be completely removed must tell that looked on a form of charity must not be too proud to accept be subscribing to mr martin efficiency in parochial work be clear duty mr martin must be induced to see in same light surely must when saw that husband mr hancock be so completely in accord on subject if if behind locked door in mind there be shut up true reason for elizabeth unwillingness to go to egypt how wonderfully have be conveyed to that must not urge more that of course be most important thing of must also cease from accusing elizabeth in mind of selfishness must dismiss now not even wonder whether be true not providence have locked door on indicated quite unmistakably that elizabeth be not to go to egypt providence too have caused pas book to be returned to disclosing very sound position even forty pound must not worry at be reason why must not see whether thirty must not put mr martin mind at ease on question of expense must certainly ask elizabeth to play to after dinner go out into garden with mr martin to enjoy music from there mr martin left alone with edward after dinner have glass of port before took cigarette on general principle of bonhomie partaking in pleasure of other people also on particular principle mr hancock port be very charming beverage continued also to trumpet praise in confidential manner most generous woman know said be indeed lucky to be allying with daughter instance occurred at dinner mentioned be thinking of sending wife south for winter not word of yet to anybody dear fellow guessed that expense might be serious consideration to have ever so faintly alluded to instantly offered to help suggesting that wife must be of party join think bride at cairo do not be idea very good one miss elizabeth be going too seemed to have occurred to aunt edward got up know thought of said suppose elizabeth will go will join others get scolded if stop in dining room too long certainly certainly if will allow one more whiff of excellent cigarette mr hancock always give guest of very best how much more dear fellow have given best of edward did not reply to waited in silence while mr martin took one whiff a crossed hall front door bell sounded lind took in telegram miss elizabeth sir said to edward edward just glanced at be foreign telegram will take in said mr hancock have stationed strategically near window so that must easily stroll out with mr martin there be said have be good not waited too long now let have music there be room for here mr martin who will begin edward elizabeth meant to have got duet for then must have played together what be edward telegram for elizabeth said open then dear said mr hancock to girl will excuse little hush so often attends opening of telegram fell on room a elizabeth tore open thin paper looked at message standing quite still handed to aunt be from stepmother told that father have died of cholera that morning book three chapter xii april evening elizabeth be sitting in drawing room window of little house that mother have taken in oakley street on warm uncertain afternoon of april in following year window be wide open breeze blew in from south west ruffled leaf of music stood open on piano seemed to girl indolent mood that there be quite good chance of not blowing on to floor since be so much preferred going to pick up if happened rather than disturb herself for fear of happening outside there be small brick walled enclosure with strip of flower bed bright nodding with daffodil fig tree rather sooty in foliage hopelessly incapable of bearing fruit at be thrusting out broad handlike leaf from angled bough enclosure mr fanshawe be accustomed to call dreadful little backyard when felt like in more cheerful mood alluded to a dear little garden for day past have be dreadful little backyard colonel fanshawe have left widow daughter in circumstance admitted of comfort demanded care mr fanshawe sometimes complained of sometimes rather enjoyed practice of economy elizabeth be rather afraid of bout of economical enjoyment for meant that mr fanshawe be apt to order more coal than cellar must possibly hold a got cheaper quotation for large quantity must take taxicab to far distant shop in oxford street keep waiting hour drive back in bursting with innumerable package must then gleefully reckon up saving have effected by not buying same good at shop just round corner sometimes amounted to a much a two shilling in case must give elizabeth quite little homily on virtue of thrift immense importance of looking after penny shilling apparently a represented by taxi be capable of looking after after thrifty afternoon must feel that little treat be owing to must take elizabeth to concert at other time still enjoying must help in housework putting on very pretty grey apron dust china on chimney piece in drawing room even clean handle of front door with sample have be sent be of unrivalled merit in polishing brasswork still required great deal of rest to recuperate from labour past fit for to come always have breakfast in bed apart from necessary repose fatigue engendered by practice of economy time for last two month have be largely taken up in collecting material for short memoir of late husband feel that who know best said to elizabeth owe to large circle of friend at home abroad who loved to tell can about be duty dear in addition to that public service a soldier be never properly appreciated by war office be right that must know what have lost now that be too late elizabeth felt a if file have be drawn across front teeth stepmother went on with certain degree of complacency with sense of importance yet not without sincerity be so beautiful that passage in 'in memoriam ' said wiping eye where tennyson say that to write about mr hallam be bead narcotic numbing pain ' know must have understood feeling about be just that will of course state in preface reason for writing memoir say that though be like tearing open wound will never heal owe to dear husband memory paused moment will be privately printed of course said will give to friend be thinking of having purple cloth binding with gilt lettering wo be very expensive mamma asked girl can not bring to think about expense will have to be very economical know when call of duty come like feel that other consideration can stand in way if think quietly over elizabeth said again cry little believe will agree with when recollect that dear father be will help hope will help to appreciate too a well a war office awful little conversation held for elizabeth certain miserable wounding humour have taken place soon after mr fanshawe have come back to england after husband death have returned a soon a have settled affair in india have sold not unsuccessfully bungalow contained retaining only few personal possession of what belonged to elizabeth private property included many packet of letter tied up in black ribbon bestowed in immense tin dispatch box with corrospondence orthography of be not worth correcting printed in white letter on indeed have suggested to idea of short memoir with by side of chair sofa made mass of extract with view to arranging afterwards in chapter on second marriage home life piece selected for publication almost entirely consisted of affectionate word to herself mostly omitted message sent to elizabeth indeed anything did not directly refer to affection for wife mr hancock have be put under contribution to supply detail about boyhood early manhood similarly consisted for most part in story to show how fond be of for month have poured in in immense quantity before came to end mr fanshawe have begun to find exceedingly tedious dry detail in same way about military service did not so much engage mr fanshawe attention be be duty to get fact about from army list while during long winter evening searched through letter for fresh instance of devotion to wrote have typewritten preface be on line already indicated chapter on social life in india be already arranged also in rambling sort of fashion showed without slightest doubt how popular mr fanshawe be at dinner party ball how husband with wonderful confidence trust have in be never slightest bit jealous first wife elizabeth mother be scarcely to be mentioned in short memoir might have be week end visitor who have not made much impression on wind have be threatening so long to spill music stood open on piano carried out intention at last still elizabeth did not stir something of languor of spring have invaded meaning moment to get up go on with practising have be excuse for not going out with mother on expedition of economy to army navy store still lounged in window seat thinking over have passed since evening when edward came into drawing room at arundel with foreign telegram in hand have be shock to violence of have not be conscious of at time showed afterwards in week of nerve fatigue followed there have be taken away something in very core kernel of life for time have known le of grief than of inexplicable lack a if on physical plane limb have be amputated that have just awoke from operation found with arm leg no longer there indeed feeling be not so much that be dead a piece of herself be gone sent out message from brain be not received anywhere nothing thrilled moved in correspondence with then slowly by degree there began to wake in that new sense that almost always wakens in who have suffered intimate bereavement mind must not take in must not conceive when once faced with notion of annihilation of ceasing to be revolted from though for time reason a accounted reason kept telling that be gone that day of love confidence be over found conclusion growing incredible began to dawn in like waking of new intelligence that there be nothing of gone except sight of possibility of presence being apprehended more by physical sens knew must not again

contradicted never in communings with quiet wisdom beneath fading crimson of indian sunset have felt more strongly than now immortal kinship between reality of spiritual alliance have told once in word at time seemed to to have be spoken in unknown tongue that be impossible to go beyond love that can only penetrate into finding without beginning without end be by death that have begun to understand that by knowledge of impotence of supreme divider supreme divider echoed meaningless word word from meaning have departed death did not divide be only meanness falseness impatience must do so tragic work remembered with growing clearness a lay in window seat with daffodil nodding outside music splayed on floor talk in garden that evening be a if have be written in mind with invisible ink required spiritual solution to be poured over to bring out word again remembered have be full of vague vision a to possibility wonder of world have be full of dream be coloured with vivid unsubstantial hue be painted by inexperience now behind not removing painting over there be stealing soaking into colour at time seemed to to be somehow dull dingy stereotyped what have said to about love have seemed somehow commonplace when hour two afterwards have sat by dying fakir at bottom of garden be more sensationalism picturesqueness of weary happy passing have affected now saw differently saw that precisely same spirit precisely same inborn knowledge have inspired same rich unclouded vision be daily outlook have staked on love then few day afterwards elizabeth have ridden out with father have spoken to in same quiet way about death have said enjoyed life tremendously a for death be to stage in growing up elizabeth turned face to garden bright daffodil daddy daddy said aloud raised on elbow with indolence languor of spring quite slipped off from overwhelmingly conscious of nearness to father not to memory to none knew none ever must know except guessed at huge significance of just what death have done for with regard to comprehension of life news have come to in day of despair when love seemed manifested to only in form of desperate renunciation when who loved be loved in return be severed just by untimely promise by bond signed blindly even then have known though only by groping of instinct that to disown to allow to be disowned be to poison very fountain well spring of love edward knew well with reason on side have longed to marry in despite of believing that eternal gushing of spring must wash away from mouth of taint have be laid there now have begun to see how be that instinct have directed for even then when need be sorest have comprehended though without conscious knowledge of comprehension that while loyalty be of very essence of love passion be symptom of while love died at breath of disloyalty existed still deep calm though symptom froth on surface be blown off by austere wind of mere straightforward commonplace duty be suffered to die down under frozen dawn of renunciation how have longed through thirsty day to be able to go to father be comforted by steadfast upholding of choice draught of cold sweet water in sultriness of barren land never so have be ordained must whisper to story of summer cry fill on shoulder upholding comforting have be not one whit vivid present to though far away parching wind swept over grave beneath tamarisk tree in remote cemetery be not often thought either of grave of death for thing seemed to even a have seemed to little incident of wayside not event of great moment in onward march of soul to be given place beside what have be what be to have died swiftly under stroke of sword of pestilence died in few hour from time that have be taken ill have buried that night a moon rose with wheeling planet for funeral lamp flitting owl cry requiem be little of that more than garment outworn have there be laid to rest essential self seemed to elizabeth never to have left through dark day of autumn winter through lengthening evening of long delayed spring have be hard struggle stern one work in spirit seemed so continually to have be at side there be so much appeared inextricably intertwined with love for edward must be cast out annihilated there be so much also be of even greater moment must be so loyally uncompromisingly kept not one of thread of pure gold ran through whole fabric must be drawn out of there must be loss of turning royal mantle into cloak for funeral must not part if shoulder on to have fallen be to be worthy of with one gleam of splendour with one atom of gold here be task to test utmost of patience wisdom in preserving yet unravelling disentangling certain other thread there be feeling there be attitude of mind there be desire connected with edward seemed at first to be integral part of fabric so strictly be woven into seemed that to draw out must make rent yet have to be done to be done radically completely though rent must be seen exist there be not that thing be in part of love be only that circumstance have made impossible that must be part of love for indeed be not hers belonged by right to edith must come out of fabric one of must come out have to divert from certain strain certain colour human longing desire yearning even be natural be proper for one other woman only not for how well remembered how father have told that knowledge must come to through love through love of common man a have added be even so have come to thus even more through right renunciation not mere rejection of whole rejection of certain part of gold be infinitely precious must remain rest be not dross merely be not hers not only at first through long month of patient effort task appeared impossible so intimately be passion of love woven in with love sensibly enough let subconscious mind work at while employed best effort in filling day with other interest occupation yet so many of of one hitherto have most enthralled engrossed namely study of music gave moment stab of recollection passion for have be so immensely kindled quickened by that when tried to kindle again be still thought of fed flame have to go must retrace step find for inspiration of alone have to shatter dream with filled have to shake awake from association roused in must be disconnected from have to be made to speak to with own voice often thought of giving up altogether of cutting off from stem of life flower of melody harmony so closely be set with thorn made heart bleed yet again must have be wanton mutilating renunciation instead with patience sometimes shrank fainted set to pick off thorn be essential part of growth yet thorn bled very stem seemed to ooze with life sap of spiritual task filled be day with striving drove sleep from during weary night most haunting most difficult of remains to be mentioned namely that of keeping heart sweet when thought of edith seemed at first that mere patience mere daily unremitting striving be of avail to quarry away adamantine block tool of armoury be blunted at contact tried not to judge to attempt to record verdict about action be morally unintelligible to if indeed must preserve from thinking vile when contemplated choice edith have made refusal to let edward go free from promise have made before knew what love be must scarcely abstain from revolted condemnation succeed in leaving case unjudged be not easy to dissociate from momentous personal consequence that refusal held for to look at impartially a if situation have be presented to a incident have happened among stranger even when most schooled to put own entanglement in out of question felt difficult not to seethe with scorn over must not understand how girl with respect for great emotion must refuse to set free man who no longer wished to be tied to who longed a edith knew very well to be acquitted of promise be inconceivable even have not given heart elsewhere to claim right in such matter to refuse to uncage bird of love be beating wing against wire just because cage be hers in hand be to close unclose door seemed to elizabeth that very fact that edith loved though made more difficult for to give up must make that giving of up more imperative love so appeared to must have relaxed finger detained have not cared for have not known what love be other desire liking have for desire in general way to be married feeling that must be happy with might have caused to keep at rate not voluntarily to release from promise that must love a elizabeth rightly felt did yet not find predominant over everything else longing for happiness be thing be utterly inconceivable whether edith have secured own happiness have idea whatever have seen half dozen time since edward edith have returned from egypt in early spring edith seemed to have developed sort of sheath over carapace be insensitive to touch be natural indeed anything else must have be impossible that mention of past history how bore on present must take place between seemed to elizabeth that cousin have shut up in hard integument gave indication of real self if spoke of home be to say that have put fresh carpet down in drawing room if of daily life to say that often lunched with mother if of mr hancock that have raised denton wage if of edward that seldom came back from city before later of two train once twice be true have seemed to elizabeth a if edith be wanting to say something more that a if shipwrecked on desert island be silently waving inconspicuous flag might indeed not be flag at nothing came of effort be impossible for elizabeth to urge to confidence when be so very doubtful whether wished to confide indeed have anything to say once elizabeth have made impulsive attempt have said suddenly not pausing to consider wisdom of such speech eager for own sincerity oh edith hope be happy be be edith if have be signalling furled flag at once a if afraid have be seen quite happy thank have said picked up from floor umbrella with false onyx top have fallen there proceeded to explain about top mr hancock have bought in cairo very cheap edith hoped must never know be not real onyx need not have be afraid for mr hancock have have doubt on subject have resolutely put from before made present have be said that elizabeth be eager for own sincerity in wishing to know that edith be happy that express with fair accuracy measure of success in trying not to judge edith may be taken also a epitaph on grave where jealousy of be buried cynic be at liberty to reflect since edward did not love wife have cause for jealousy of virtue lift eye of men to hill patience be least admired have least to attract attention thus earn encouragement of others yet none be more certain of result never doe fail in putting forth fruit in due season in accomplishing perfect work for most part growth be imperceptible doe not shoot up like aloe flower challenge attention from brilliance of blossoming like violet hide lovely fragrance who observe carelessly without love be usually quite unaware of blossoming trumpet forth deed of valour fill stage with heroic attitude splendid speech only who watch tenderly closely can see growth of sweet smelling purple be not matter for wonder then that mr fanshawe eagerly intent on interested in own grief bereavement marvellously anxious that others must be if possible equally interested in must have observed nothing of modest flowering not even now when on languid april day elizabeth plot be thick with flower of silent gardening indeed be disposed to blame stepdaughter for many omission in general conduct there be much to be desired in that did not get when played to so to speak elizabeth be not always ready to dance when mourned elizabeth did not always weep took tepid interest in mr fanshawe brilliant absorbing economy though be always ready to go on searching through army list did not bring to employment eager zeal might have be expected from one who have just lost so well beloved father worse still when mr fanshawe voice sometimes broke eye filled with self pitying tear a read aloud to elizabeth fresh pathetic page of memoir describing how father have sat up till half past three on two consecutive night so that wife must have fill of dancing elizabeth seemed a hard a adamant over poignant recollection indeed elizabeth have tried to persuade quite unsuccessfully to cut out from preface concluding paragraph began out of depth of broken heart wish to thank friend whose sympathy have supported in bereavement indeed mr fanshawe be afraid that have not be far astray when on first marrying have formed conclusion that elizabeth be selfish sort of girl have believed then that have great affection for father who really rather spoiled have tried dear fellow to spoil wife a well now so quietly did elizabeth take bereavement be afraid that after affection for father be not so very deep otherwise must have found writing of memoir work at be agonizing yet exquisite pleasure to assist otherwise again elizabeth must not have be so remarkably industrious in music must not within couple of month of father death begin course of instruction in piano at royal institute must have be unable to give mind a be undoubtedly doing to very nice accomplishment of playing piano have immured in privacy of oakley street refused to see anybody stepmother to whom must have be irresistibly drawn by bond of common sorrow incidentally too music lesson seemed to mr fanshawe very expensive for gratification of mere luxurious whim thought of often impelled to distant economical expedition implying huge expense in taxi cab be on one of that have gone out afternoon object being to purchase large quantity of violet soap so cheap if bought large box of other little thing must probably occur to from shop in high holborn though distance be considerable elizabeth be surprised be not back by time servant brought up tea since might return moment be querulous over fact that tea be not made prepared risking other possibility that might be cold when stepmother returned who must then drink with air of martyr be compelled though hated extravagance unnecessary trouble to servant to order fresh teapot one of two be likely since a have be mentioned open space at back of house have be for last fortnight horrid little backyard agreeable surprise be in store mr fanshawe came in before long in most excellent spirit full of affection tenderness dear little musical cinderella have made tea said ready for wicked stepmother darling must have come out with be loveliest day be too industrious perhaps evening will play to something have be so diligently practising elizabeth poured out tea be afraid have be so very industrious mamma said have be sitting in window nearly hour doing nothing ah be not doing nothing to enjoy sweet breeze look at daffodil in sweet little garden dear what good cup of tea nobody make tea like often say often did though with different nuance clearly day of horrid little backyard be over for present such afternoon a have have dear continued must never guess thing have happened to who must meet for instance in isaac redford aunt julia so pleasant full of welcome nothing must content must promise to bring down to stay with next friday over sunday dear little elizabeth called quite quarrelled over said be dear little elizabeth have be so busy said since return from egypt in february getting thing straight after long absence must have asked many time before never thought odd be glad to say that have not done so always refrained from wondering at though to be sure three month be long time to take putting thing straight after absence of two now quite insists on simply must not let go until have promised will send motor to station to meet train settle to travel by here be prospect have long daunted elizabeth to look forward to yet of necessity must sometime come close to have not so much a seen edward since handed telegram last august in mr hancock drawing room tacitly contriving together in sundered co operation have averted that heart leaped sank leaped again shrank from seeing have not known till now when in natural course of event must see how much longed to on side there be reasonable excuse to urge against plan have there be hardly knew whether must have urged on side might escape meeting say that have arranged to take edith away for sunday felt sure that if understood that have consented to go down to aunt must not absent waited so instinctively knew for sign that be willing to meet otherwise must long ago have be to see quite understood absence silence sign of emotion might have escaped be certainly not seen by stepmother who be full of wonder of afternoon elizabeth felt that something beyond invitation to heathmoor have occurred to send mr fanshawe mental barometer up to such exhilarated serenity of fair weather waited for to be told did not come at once mentioned first other object on ray have beamed gilded transfigured long dear talk have with went on begged if did not hurt too much to bring down memoir have written to read to quietly after have gone bought soap other little thing wanted be even cheaper than have anticipated never must guess dear how came back here perhaps will scarcely believe when tell for got on top of 'bus with great box of soap other parcel came way right to chelsea town hall for threepence not counting sixpence with tipped conductor who be most obliging helped with thing really very polite in spite of package of course saw be not just common woman like rest of passenger hesitated whether ought to have given shilling have never enjoyed making little economy denying comfort more than did when got up on 'bus be not 'bus ride so thought elizabeth have produced exhilaration pleasure waited before got up on to 'bus gave just little treat mr fanshawe proceeded went into one of electric palace a call where see cinematograph be not quite sure whether be sort of thing be thought respectable so looked pretty closely at programme before entered need not have be afraid never saw anything more refined will go together one of day dear so cheap too only shilling why must go day for week not spend more than in one evening in dress circle at theatre mr fanshawe looked up at elizabeth with glance of soft shy helplessness many men found so provocatively feminine pleading called forth instinct of protection in somewhat unobservant mind for on whole nobody be le in need of protection than be almost aggressively able to take care of herself did have to carry parcel after said from where 'bus stopped for whom must see just coming out of chemist there that dear sir henry meyrick who be commander in chief in india do remember came home only couple of day ago on leave will be here till january stayed with once at peshawar darling in happy happy day mr fanshawe took out handkerchief dabbed corner of eye be piece of ritual have lost practical significance for there be not semblance of moisture there be merely outward visible sign of inward grief stayed with afterwards at simla said got oh so fond of be while be staying there know that news came that caused poor heart to break dear be like woman for tenderness to yet have strength of man can never never forget what owe dear sir henry if have not be for be convinced must quite have broken down even made away with elizabeth felt sure that have here origin of wonderful rise in stepmother spirit idea horrible to contemplate came close to stared in face resolutely turned away from yes remember quite well said thought found rather foolish ridiculous foolish ridiculous said mr fanshawe with great energy can not imagine what mean elizabeth must be confusing with one else perhaps be said girl be stupid of how be looking mr fanshawe calmed down at once became softly pathetic again oh so different to what be when saw said when be so cheery jolly made woman in peshawar fall in love with at least be sure that did looked so anxious unhappy elizabeth that heart quite went out to longed to comfort brightened up so when saw looked quite radiant again will never guess what pretty welcome gave though of course be very foolish of said bey dear little girl dear little girl twice over just like held out hand to dropped umbrella in puddle never seemed to notice there be with arm full of great heavy parcel declare for moment be quite ashamed before so true gentleman a sir henry be took parcel from oh dear be so wonderful to in loneliness in crowded street to be taken care of again like carried right up to door gave to mary when opened must not let touch again again idea stood close to elizabeth holding so seemed not letting turn face away soft childlike voice went on asked after too said so nicely affectionately must not come in then for have other appointment though wanted to break did not let be coming to dine here to night will not think of making extra preparation for will like best just to see in quiet modest little house just naturally there be moment rather awkward pause for mr fanshawe have to consider how to reintroduce topic have be spoken of morning between elizabeth in hour of horrid little backyard elizabeth have wanted to go to queen hall to attend concert of most ravishing character be to be performed that night have given up idea owing to marked querulousness on stepmother part at prospect of passing deserted evening there have even be pained wonder at girl caring to go out to evening of pleasure so soon be not apt to be troubled at own inconsistency pause be not long will be sorry not to see be sure darling said think told be going to concert at queen hall very likely will not be in till nearly eleven may be sure will have nice cosy little supper ready for when come back to elizabeth seemed to confirm idea have forced on needed at rate little perspicacity to see that stepmother with prospect of dining alone with sir henry wanted to keep engagement in deference to desire have abandoned be surprised at tenderness followed mr fanshawe rose in willowy fashion from chair stood behind elizabeth gently stroking hair want to enjoy pleasure can contrive for dear said whom miss so dreadfully know must wish to enjoy 'richly to enjoy ' doe not bible say must have hated to think that be going to lose gaiety happiness elizabeth felt physically unable to bear touch of insincere caressing hand got up quickly yes mamma said be sure of have tried not to lose joy of life so right darling said mr fanshawe in dreadful little cooing voice have helped other hope in know have helped will not let life be spoiled broken must grieve so paused moment with handkerchief ritual with head little on one side spoke with childlike timidity be lovely being taken care of again said though only in little matter like having parcel carried be going now dear enjoy sweetest stop till very end of concert know what treat music be to must not have miss note elizabeth felt need of air after interview having hour yet to spare before need think of going to concert went down broad quiet street on to thames embankment at lower end felt stifled by atmosphere of insincerity from have come choked at pitiful nauseating deception that believed almost deceived stepmother caused to refer to duty of behaving a late husband must have have behave at little subterfuge for facilitating own arrangement falseness of be so blatant so palpable that must not have deceived baby yet be not wrong in thinking that largely deceived very author of acting might not appear at life like to audience seemed real to herself for year have while diligently pursuing path of complete selfishness be employed so to speak on modelling figure of herself be winning child like trustingly devoted to love of others now regarding that with conscious approval have come to believe that be very image of herself elizabeth felt sure again be not mistaken that mr fanshawe be even now getting into graceful pose for reception of sir henry to say that be deliberately laying out to attract must have be coarsely true way of putting thing be coarse thing be true be almost equally abhorrent to mr fanshawe mind told that owed great debt to sir henry for kindness sympathy at husband death debt that must never be able to repay be bound to treat a old friend to confide in plan for future to tell how be oh so content to live quietly here devoting life to elizabeth who be so sweet to must somehow make appear that be own sweetness not elizabeth that be really talking about must hint that be great deal alone that be by own wish that elizabeth spent so many evening enjoying with hearing music elizabeth be right oh so right to do elizabeth thinking over thing executed few wild dance step on lonely piece of embankment from sheer irritation at thought wondered also whether stepmother must show sir written chapter of memoir rather thought not little ebullition of temper passed let mind quiet down again a leaned elbow on stone balustrade looked out over beautiful river brimmed swirled just below for tide near to full flood be pouring up from sea still fresh strong unwearied by journey barge be drifting up with in comfortable haphazard sort of fashion great company of sea gull

glory of world from great sea of life came vivifying wave covering for moment brown seaweed tangle of trouble have lain dry sun baked so long flushing freshening uplifting relieved of irritation refreshed by good moment of spring evening mind went back to stepmother felt sure that be intention to marry jolly old warrior if must possibly be managed that be going to employ art in shape of artlessness simplicity to bring about be eight month since husband have died after what did matter actual lapse of time have very little to do with question must be sure to have touching convincing reason for step have seemed horrible at first to elizabeth where after be horror of course dead husband must have wished to be happy elizabeth knew father well enough to know be only horrible that must give a undoubtedly must a reason for marrying again what knew wish must be on subject whether sir henry must be brought up to point be matter on elizabeth have evidence except stepmother account of meeting clearly mr fanshawe thought that thing promised well elizabeth be eye suddenly filled with tear only once have grass sprung up on far distant grave not yet have memoir so quickly taken in hand be completed daddy daddy said aloud turned from rosy river set out to walk down embankment to next bridge from where proposed to take conveyance have thrilled stepmother that afternoon with sense of incredible adventure pavement stretched empty darkening in front of at far end lamplighter have started on luminous round two hundred yard off figure be walking quickly towards long before must distinguish face feature elizabeth with heart in sudden tumult saw who be almost at same moment saw pause suddenly in rapid progress halt a if undetermined whether to turn retrace step came on again

dear said how can ask that be sorry said simply edith know know anything about try to be kind nice to in fact be wretched quivering smile broke out on girl face conceit said be glad have met edward for have to get over know well be over stood in silence moment then suddenly broke out why must trust own heart elizabeth let trust mine what good have come of what have come of wretchedness ask if be happy know be no kept faith good have come of say thing be best of say what be doing here often walk way said then go up oakley street evening be getting light now do mind doing that then something swelled in throat forbidding speech must go on said at length may walk with little to corner will take 'bus there there be little way to go stood together waiting for 'bus looking at darkling river down poured wild west wind sea gull said to pointing sea gull spring edward mounted quickly up winding iron stair not looking back a 'bus swung round corner little distance up road must not resist turning round be still there at corner where have left minute speck on pavement glowed in rose coloured sunset so minute so significant seemed to that of essential self heart power of love be standing

expected to find that stepmother have gone to bed must be allowed that elizabeth must not have be very sorry if proved to be case for felt that must give vague attention to voluble triviality must otherwise await not till have softly closed street door behind did bring into focus fact that mr fanshawe have be dining alone with sir henry that voluble triviality might be supplanted by news not trivial at idea when first have occurred to have repelled with repulsion that deep love must naturally feel for self conscious willow affection there be sort of heart breaking jar in thought mr fanshawe with pen still dipping for ink to write memoir must be thinking about re marriage now repulsion have left found le jealous for father memory more ready to let immortality of love look after more capable of sinking personal feeling be not that idea have lost sharp edge from greater familiarity with saw a distinctly a ever only sharp edge now failed to fret besides how must willowness of stepmother affection insincerity that in be of so unreal nature affect anything be real mr fanshawe have not gone to bed be sitting in very pretty pensive attitude hastily assumed when heard be step on stair over brisk little fire in front of be standing in fender small covered dish have put on white bedroom wrapper with little black bow of ribbon long abundant hair streamed over shoulder there be never so bewitching little widow held out arm with welcoming gesture a elizabeth entered darling how late be said if have be enjoying be ask of must not bear to think that little elizabeth must come in find silent house with one to welcome home got up gave elizabeth little butterfly kiss see dear lit fire for with own hand so that supper might keep warm there be napkin spread for tablecloth little rack of toast lemonade with plenty of sugar in just wing of chicken saved for ate leg instead little bunch of grape to follow gingerbread cake while eat dear will tell about concert fancy if day played at concert at queen hall how proud must be must not burst glove in applauding to tell about concert be somewhat extensive suggestion there be need for elizabeth to reply a mr fanshawe went on without pause must not attend to anything dear said until have quite settled in mind what must be nicest little supper must think of for have quite little squabble with sir henry about eating leg though assured that epicure prefer leg helped to light fire assure be a zealous on behalf a be told to be sure give love if did not think must consider that liberty thank mamma said girl be good of to take so much thought for almost expected to find have gone to bed be so late suppose sir henry have be gone time quarter of hour ago perhaps have not more than time to take off dress brush hair must not go without peep at when returned promised little cosy talk over fire when have finished supper elizabeth left table sat down in big arm chair near mr fanshawe latter took elizabeth hand a lay on arm held in of hers have be thinking of so much dear said time dear sir henry be here have be in mind minute wise kind man be so full of sympathy tenderness for show with such wonderful tact not by dwelling on great loss by encouraging cheering up declare laughed outright a have not done for month at of delicious droll story be sort of man to whom one can open one heart completely kind of thing talked about about old dear happy day about india oh elizabeth how long to see dear india again quoted something thought so true about hearing east calling said ought to be 'when hear east bawling ' be not that quaint of east bawling yes be just what doe dear happy day in india with pleasant party society ball miss gaiety of in sad secluded life here in little tiny house why drawing room be not much bigger than bathroom be at peshawar think that be naturally of gay joyous nature dear be not made for sadness apparently mr fanshawe be taking rest from thinking about elizabeth evening seemed to realize hurried back to subject if be sad for how much more sad must be for darling for used to enjoy so in india with horse dog be sure used to laugh fifty time day out there for once hear laugh now be not only of loss of gaiety have be thinking so much there be thing more important than especially while be young loss of father care thought for make dreadful blank weighed down with petty care economy have to practise can not look after a constantly a used day be so full with care of house with writing dear father memoir week have be to nothing le than sacred duty even if be quite free must be impossible for little weak silly helpless woman to supervise growing up with wisdom large grasp of man have be doing best think can say that know how feeble wanting best have be there have be opportunity so continuous have be prattle of monologue for elizabeth to speak at for be grateful for must have found difficult enough to frame sincere reply to endless tissue of insincerity be only half conscious of mr fanshawe have be so long accustomed to look upon utterly inaccurate picture of herself of be artist so long unaccustomed to look on actual origin of that really have got to confuse two rather to obliterate one in favour of imaginary portrait to night elizabeth did not feel smallest resentment at imposture regarded mother a must have regarded charade acting child be willing to encourage belief in reality of acting for mr fanshawe a for child dressing up be real elizabeth must almost see father listening with smile for tenderness did not lack humour must have be amused surely at for own simplicity sincerity have never wanted to improve edify others at most only encouraged like beloved plant in garden to grow blossom besides have loved wife for life of elizabeth have never be able to guess why simple fact fact one must try to explain away took precedence of everything else there be pause for few gentle application of very small lace handkerchief became incumbent on elizabeth to say something knew of course perfectly well what stepmother be leading up to since appeared to find difficult to come to point elizabeth decided to help so sir henry began be quite enough mr fanshawe rose swiftly from chair bent over kissed darling yes said be so glad have guessed be so afraid must come a shock to that only promised henry must tell to night if must said must trust to instinct a to whether must not only begin to prepare for told that must not know a knew how deeply loved father must judge whether to tell at once not said must not wound dear little elizabeth heart for anything now have guessed how nice be oh what true wise friend second father will find in elizabeth do wonder now darling said how much have be thinking of evening suddenly be borne in upon girl that play acting be really going too far seemed impermissible to allow even child to take invention quite so seriously be a if child insisted on having real solid food real champagne provided for pasteboard banquet yet yet be there gain to one in saying remember be only acting knew well there be not detection exposure of even such abominable insincerity a never yet did good to criminal only made resent cruel perspicacity of exposer possibly exercise little more ingenuity in invention must be wiser to enter into spirit of imaginative flight be like seeing somebody waving arm saying see be bird how high fly pretending to look upwards be dazzled made giddy by reckless feat of aviation be sweet of to think of a well be a much a must humanly be expected of best intention did not nearly satisfy mr fanshawe dear central thought be of declared almost first thing said to henry when when must not let go for have affectionate nature oh darling how love almost first thing said be 'what about elizabeth must not think have said yes to until assure that will be father to elizabeth said be so like 'we will offer grandfather anyhow birdie ' be what said must call bright eyed little birdie so foolish of clock on chimney piece chimed twelve mr fanshawe rose to apex of surprising fatuity gracious what hour said believe have not sat up till twelve last two month must go to bed henry will find dull eyed little birdie when come back in morning will never love more will think have made great mistake want to marry elizabeth instead dear henry will tease about only just for minute must not vex big loving heart for anything looked at elizabeth with expression that be familiar with in imaginary portrait of expression called wistful of course will not dream of marrying until whole year have passed said be sure must henry wish to know what tender heart have for beloved memory think dear will put memoir on one side perhaps give to aunt julia to deal with a like dare say must be glad of something to do in poor empty life will take down with on friday perhaps have done work did not explain exactly what last sentence meant a there be explanation whatever of except that seemed to finish up with memoir in vague beautiful manner must have be idle to attempt so sleep well precious said kissing elizabeth think will do wo now that little anxiety be removed be really immensely well off what responsibility will be for hope will prove not quite unworthy of mr hancock have never seen much of sister in law perhaps must not have be so kindly disposed towards task of making better acquainted with have known that have be pitied for poor empty life for poor empty life be indeed not phrase fitly described passage of pilgrim of mr martin gospel through pleasant world mr hancock have idea so slanderous thing have be said of looked forward to sister in law visit with considerable pleasure be enhanced by prospect of having elizabeth in house again intended elizabeth to be in best of spirit to play piano to very loudly brightly mr hancock knew be just little deaf have seen four eminent specialist on subject who implored so said not to be in least disquieted to eat rather le meat a very slight dullness of hearing be certainly gouty in origin to drive with on saturday afternoon to sit constantly by admire masterly method with king of mexico have rendered thrilling so many after dinner hour in egypt then mr fanshawe must drive with on saturday morning must have great deal of beautiful talk about colonel in mind eye saw sister in law cry little with touch caress administering gospel of mr martin a through fine hose in most copious refreshing abundance when be quite refreshed have be made to see death be gate into life doubt must read part of memoir in mr hancock took great interest seeing that have supplied so much material for chapter chapter be to be hoped on early life expected to enjoy account of early life very much in sort of way that mellow sunset may be imagined to enjoy thinking over own beautiful sunrise if found mr fanshawe very sympathetic understanding thought almost thought that must confide in something that have never yet confided in anybody after making clear to what own intention in matter be ask advice if appeared probable that must turn out consonant with what have practically made up mind to do last six month have be crowded with incident mr hancock did not think year in tale of forty eight summer have held so much except perhaps one year when have married edith have be born for now edith have married mr williams have have operation for removal of small tumour brother have died have be to egypt have brought back score score of photograph pasted at interval into large half morocco scrap book procured at staggering expense from store have forgotten what precisely good many of represented edith with wonderful memory usually knew if did not mr hancock in exquisitely neat hand wrote under non committing title such a temple in upper egypt nile in january certainly be be sensational enough mr hancock have read about year so full of incident in novel must have probably felt that fiction be stranger than truth when be asked to believe that so many thing happened really together with thing have happened fraught with more potential significance than for death of brother of whom have seen so little for so many year have not really strongly moved mr williams have quite recovered cooked just a well a ever edith still constantly drove lunched with agitating though pasting in of photograph be have pasted one in upside down not noticed till next day when paste be quite dry stuck did not ever look at again one event seemed likely to make real difference to life for while be at luxor mr martin have be suddenly taken ill with pneumonia have died three day later have proved charming travelling companion mr hancock have be very much shocked grieved at so sad incident marring holiday did not break down under bereavement ordered beautiful tombstone though not expensive since knew that mr martin be not very well off left luxor a soon a possible bringing back with large photograph of grave widower being what be behaved with most characteristic fortitude faith felt that have be permitted to be wonderful help consolation to since return desolate though be have not let work suffer indeed added to ordinary duty supervision of choir practice wife have always managed after suitable interval played golf a regularly a ever only last sunday have preached most wonderful sermon mr hancock have ever heard on text of wilderness solitary place will be glad for thankfulness joy be keynote of everybody understood that wilderness be egypt showed how in midst of death be in life that joy cometh in morning have lunched with mr hancock afterwards have settled that must be printed with purple not black line round cover with in memoriam january printed on inner leaf did not go away till be time for to take child service at four before that have asked if when broken heart be healed appeared to be making excellent progress must become in name a well a in fact partner of joy sorrow rather thought must though there be great many thing to be considered first promised answer in week time mr hancock have practically settled what that answer be to be at present have told nobody asked anybody advice about have indeed thought of seeing how edith received idea on other hand felt that must not give encouragement wanted edith indeed have be altogether rather discouraging for month past ever since party met at cairo did not give lively interest in applause of mother plan must have liked be not that seemed unhappy if have mr hancock must have applied cheerful gospel to simply appeared to be like house shut up with blind down shutter closed face looked out from be also impossible to penetrate into perhaps like caretaker edward have key mr hancock a already noticed did not like to pry into affair might possibly prove depressing have not asked for besides be difficult to imagine cause of unhappiness must be hers edward always came home by train just before dinner expected baby in july after tremendous struggle with mr hancock have let have own peerless kitchenmaid a cook felt that must like to tell somebody who must probably agree with what contemplated have great hope that sister in law must prove sympathetic have be prepossessing trait to find buying soap in high holborn have received with touching gratitude story about mr hancock be to go into husband memoir there have be great deal to think about before made up mind have real liking real admiration for vicar about there be in spite of eight forty year something akin to romance be very wonderful encouraging person certainly have needed encouragement in lonely month after edith marriage again felt sure that must be devoted to comfort though ecstasy of youthful love might be denied did not know that be sorry for be perhaps five year older than a youthful ardour be not part of programme little discrepancy of year be of small consequence there be other consideration must not possibly go to live at vicarage where servant entrance be close under dining room window there be garage must not also be expected to help in parish work beyond knitting of thick muffler went to warm deep sea fisherman golf playing presented difficulty at must start rather earlier drive to club house pick up on way home to be sure must somewhat restrict drive if always have to start come back by same road perhaps must be better if denton took there first must call for then what be to happen to present furniture in vicarage for did not want more in own house did not intend that such difficulty must be obstacle of magnitude mind so long have be completely taken up in affair of detail whole general course of being already marked out must not resist contemplation of here again woman who went way to high holborn for soap might prove comprehending enlightening mr fanshawe who with elizabeth be met on platform by denton by car outside station be immediate success after crude sort of harbourage in oakley street with small room dreadful backyard with parlourmaid who have perennial cold notion of cleaning silver perfectly ordered house with smooth service atmosphere of complete comfort be a cream to cat have be living on thinnest skim milk admired appreciated with childlike sort of pleasure ate two bun with sugar on top at tea because be so delicious elizabeth darling must eat one of lovely bun made instantly popular time in depth of heart hugged knowledge that must so soon be in position of extreme affluence ladyship pitied mr hancock for poor empty life simultaneously mr hancock felt what treat must be for sister in law to have few day of comfort luxury instead of going way to high holborn to get soap little cheaper having seen brother will in paper knew exactly how much elizabeth have to live upon at five per cent of capital doubting whether got more than four be warmed with sense of own benevolence in saving three day of household book at cost of third class ticket felt sure have gone third class to heathmoor be dreadfully sad for poor thing to be left widow be not to be expected that must find second husband very easily cordial admiration of saw be certainly prepossessing mr hancock felt that must probably prove worthy recipient of secret give exactly advice wanted more metaphysically of felt drawn to other by striking similarity between in point of lack of sincerity success achieved in deceiving three dined alone that night soon after stepmother having discovered that sweetest elizabeth looked tired two elder lady be left alone now dear said mr hancock have got to dearing other before dinner be half over so want to have good talk to want to know plan about memoir be sure will be most interesting will lay out patience while talk can attend perfectly while be playing one of easier patience elizabeth too be such joy to see elizabeth again after sad sad parting in summer mr fanshawe put head little on one side wistfully elizabeth can hardly talk of happy week spent here said be sure wonder at enjoyment of dear how happy must make to make everybody around so happy believe ever think of mr hancock smiled long wanted red queen have appeared doe make one happy not to think of said how time go when be thinking of other people be often astounded when sunday come round again for week go by in flash take dear edith out for drive be so good to to have plenty of fresh air come to lunch with day almost so that will not be alone in house with husband away day be sunday again get what call weekly refresher from dear mr martin such beautiful sermon gave last sunday ah there be ten wanted on subject of sad bereavement wife know took out to egypt with be most important that must get out of winter fog damp of england died at luxor after three day illness how glad be have friend with dear forgive how thoughtless be not thoughtless dear said mr fanshawe not thoughtless mr martin tell about mr martin feel sure must like mr martin mr hancock bundled patience card together have not left patience unfinished except when patience have finished for year perfectly a must attend when be playing prepared now to be absolutely undistracted indeed one must help liking mr martin said have noblest of character with not touch of priggishness to see play golf to hear laugh talk must never think be clergyman to hear preach must think be bishop at least know of nobody whom admire more listen be not that front door bell how tiresome if be interrupted in talk yes hear lind going to open now have shut again ah be only note will excuse from edward just to say edith will come to lunch to morrow a be not going up to city answer lind now mr fanshawe have not failed to mark expression of sister in law face when spoke of mr martin if have worn must have called rapt expression be not so admirable on feature of woman who to adopt mr fanshawe point of view be already aground so to speak on willow of advanced middle age where there be not sufficient youth to carry over emotional bank still on younger perhaps more spiritual face must have be rapt occurred to that in mind perhaps sister in law be not a old a looked a be must be very ridiculous if at age woman be prey of sentimental notion then have very comfortable house delightful retreat from stuffy little kennel in oakley street mr hancock waited till lind have quite shut drawing room door then turned to sister in law again dear want advice said for be woman of world be sure be wise see spring after poor mr martin death saw great deal of vicar think be able to comfort uphold so that lean good deal on now though of course have be very great friend for year must give footstool just little kick way feel loneliness very much want one whom know trust will say admires yes said mr fanshawe admires be sure how kind of well admires to take place of whom have lost who be very good sweet sort of woman indeed mr hancock leaned forward have told to said putting hand on mr fanshawe arm now know what think of do advise what be to say to edith edward see be so young must be wonderful thing for to have father to go to in difficulty in man be so much more competent to advise than woman lind denton too there be great deal that master of house can do to influence men servant what will say to probably more wholly original reason for matrimony have ever be put forward than that must provide man to look after butler one of story about colonel early life have shown that have highest opinion of sister originality to day if never before opinion be justified mr fanshawe did not remember story did delirious originality strike now saw quite clearly what mr hancock owner of comfortable house wanted to say got up from chair knelt on footstool have kicked little dear envy beautiful unselfish nature said let be first to congratulate mr martin will be said mr hancock kissing chapter xiv heart desire mr hancock have made so touching tale of help have be to mr martin of mr martin devotion to how chief reason for contemplated marriage be that might exercise wise fatherly care over edward edith denton lind mr fanshawe lay awake for quite considerable time night in spite of extreme comfort of bed vividly exercising imagination to see how might paint with even nobler brush love of henry birdie flattered that have far more promising material to work with for what in point of romance be middle aged country vicar to compare with commander in chief in india be elderly mr hancock in comparison with young graceful sister in law be slightly chagrined that mr hancock have already bagged a motive for matrimony care of fatherless daughter have rendered ridiculous when be thought over by addition of butler chauffeur besides edith be already married longer in touching desolation of newly orphaned girl just growing up however found have many very beautiful thing to say only hoped that mr hancock must prove a zealous absorbed listener a have be have opportunity of testing when started on drive next morning mr fanshawe be not quite ready when motor came round after prolonged debate be decided to go round by old mill just same put off lunch for five minute unpunctuality however be quite forgiven when explained that elizabeth have be so wrapped up in tulip that have idea how late be mr fanshawe began preparing for exquisite revelation without loss of

house edward have be sitting in smoking room after breakfast with eye wandered over uncomprehended newspaper conscious of overmastering desire to slip across to house next door merely to see elizabeth to satisfy eye ached for a knew well to render more acute aching of heart wife a be often custom have come in after have attended to household duty sat in usual seat by window speaking occasionally to replying in perfectly commonplace fashion to dropped observation have spoken of plan for day of arrival of mr fanshawe elizabeth now then focusing eye not mind have mentioned newspaper topic such half hour have spent hundred time before to day be intensely conscious of something always lying behind intercourse never spoken of between have suddenly enveloped enshadowed like gathering of tropical storm foreground of life a well tried to imagine putting down newspaper in leisurely way forming voice to say lightly casually that must stroll across to mr hancock felt that a if intoxicated tongue must stammer stumble on word once laid paper down saw that on instant have started into attentive expectation have fixed eye on ready for what knew must come from lip for read so felt unspoken sentence knowing what filled mind still sat there unable to tell what ached to do while waited in month of marriage elizabeth name have be mentioned only a name of indifferent cousin might have be never a one who held edward heart in hollow of hand for even a bee build up in wall of impenetrable gluelike wax intruder enemy to hive edith have walled away from life thought of cousin have built up into separate chamber of brain so that worker bee conscious denizen of mind must have access to love for edward nipped unexpanded bud have never blown have claimed possession of instead of giving liberty seeking happiness at cost of last drop of heart blood have starved on comfortless food leanness of desire have entered into soul for seven month have be wife sharer in name in nominally be recipient of unwearied kindness affection never for single moment possessing essential self have word thought of complaint of in conduct in feeling towards gave be to give have demanded of fulfilment of bargain to full extent of solvency so to speak have paid now knew that be absolutely insolvent towards with regard to coinage of only true mint have thought that love with hopeless limitation must make reef of gold hers have thought that must settle down into sham must cheat that mask of face must either be withdrawn must deceive into belief of reality have happened must always wear mask for that mask must never grow so like human face below so little way below yet withdrawn into impenetrable depth that must deceive into believing in now before long must bear child to seemed to in enlightenment that prosperous month of misery have brought that baby must be no better than bastard must not be supposed that misery be acute degree of enlightenment brought clear cloudless perception be not of kind admit great poignancy of wretchedness of bliss once only perhaps in life have engine of being worked up to full power be when claimed fulfilment of edward promise have felt intensely acutely then impossibility of giving up since flash of deplorable intensity have fallen back on to normal level where ground so to speak be solid rather clayey where there be peak precipice declined slowly unintermittently into place of featureless gloom yet except to one who be gifted with divine intuition of love towards there be sign in normal behaviour of inward wretchedness for poor edith there be nobody thus inspired have always be rather reserved silent even mr martin that brilliant seeker after joy sorrow of others have missed in steady placidity that knew have detected other change a for mother edith invariable punctuality quiet recognition of object of interest like tower of windsor castle train on great western railway be sufficient evidence of contentment especially since edward always got home by dinner train be going to have baby here be adequate cause for thankfulness be sure that edith who have so strong sense of duty appreciated edith enlightenment be of same order noonday blaze only diffused luminance came veiled through cloud not dispersing no longer groped in darkness a have done when decided that must not voluntarily give edward liberty must see more now not only must see utter unreality at have grasped that there be in existence real light different altogether from phantasmal will o ' wisp have blindly followed into quagmire have sought own thinking that be love followed must have sought own no longer if have be possible for to make choice again vaguely a sat morning by window thing passed before mind a picture of well known familiar book pas before eye of one who listlessly turn leaf at end of book knew there be picture have not seen yet be a if edward finger a well a hers be on page doubting whether to turn on not nearly hour wore away thus outwardly like many other hour in reality hour of poise expectancy then on road outside gate saw pas a have so often seen mother motor mr fanshawe be with next door elizabeth be alone mother going out for drive said mechanically did not look round heard paper flutter in edward finger alone asked with whom with mr fanshawe said again silence fell suddenly desire doubt came to did not know how came for impulse prompted seemed to have taken part in thought apparently something behind wall of gluelike wax have stirred stirred imperatively giving quickness decision rose will go across see elizabeth said know have be wanting to do that morning edward must say understood got up also what do mean said what be saying something perfectly simple of course want to see elizabeth of course find difficulty in telling so do know that have mentioned elizabeth name except a stranger might mention ever since marriage ever since night in fact that settled to marry be natural be certainly something stirred behind sealed up partition bee thought worker in edith mind be tearing partition away suppose be said want to see elizabeth now be natural too because be always fond of elizabeth blame because loved see never loved told that came close to why do speak of elizabeth now said after month of silence shook head know why doe one do anything occurred to suppose to speak of elizabeth because be here because be going across to see never loved edward told that spoke quietly reassuringly occurred to that for reason edith be beginning to doubt that for looked at so seemed with certain question challenge in eye be a if weighed answer took like doubtful coin rang to test genuineness will go now said still lingering do not wish to go paused moment why do not wish to go edward said want to do just a wish dear said for moment certain cloud of trouble restlessness quite alien to normal reasoning have seemed to disturb cleared spoke naturally again lunch there do not said dare say will not come again before till lunch time then traversed hall hesitated a to whether must take hat decided against went out into cool spring sunshine gate of communication between two garden mr hancock have eventually decided that since edith edward used so much more than did be only reasonable that must pay for half of have be made went through leaving aswing with tinkling latch a have said to edward scarcely knew why idea of elizabeth desire to see have taken hold of mind month have deliberately of set purpose put idea of elizabeth from consciously segregating refusing admittance into current of thought have be natural enough for be on elimination of elizabeth from joint life that success of marriage have seen must depend to day have registered have contemplated admitted fact of failure elizabeth have not be eliminated from life when just now edith have alluded casually almost to fact of edward being in love with saying did not blame elizabeth for that have that pas without challenge have not occurred to however lamely to take exception to have shown with convincingness that have not known before how cousin be knitted into edward heart must have to be cut to bit before must be disentangled from quietly insensibly throughout month conviction have be growing on have be like bulb buried in earth have known in inner consciousness though there be outward evidence of fact that be growing to day green vigorous horn of sprouting showed above ground be not shock to more than be letter confirms bad news conveyed in telegram authenticity now be quite beyond dispute in seven month of marriage elizabeth spell have lost none of potency edith stood between just a have done on day when have decided must not give up holding apart to day too definite doubt have come into mind knew that desire to see elizabeth be connected with possible resolution month ago elizabeth have told that idea of love for edward have ever be hers that have never thought of in light to day for definite reason by process probably of general enlightenment that misery have brought wondered if be true at first when elizabeth have told that have implicitly believed now wondered whether elizabeth have not said that for sake whether seeing that be determined not to give edward up elizabeth have not splendidly lied certainly that statement true not have have effect of making edith quite comfortable a mother must say dozen hundred dozen time have told relying on that edward must have be nearer happiness if have given up edith did not so far deceive a to say that must have made difference to decision even if elizabeth have loved knew poorly knew sufficiently well to be aware that nothing in world just then must have induced voluntarily to give freedom have be open to to break word not marry have not seemed morally possible for to let go be just coming out of long window of drawing room when edith passed through gate two cousin met on croquet lawn warm day of may have made possible to play already edward at wife wish have have several game in preparation for heathmoor tournament elli morning have moved several seat out of summer house on to grass croquet set complete in tin lined box most expensive set of must be bought at store have be mr hancock wedding present to edward stood open in case anybody wished to play just year ago a now occurred to edith have sat here when elizabeth on morning after arrival from india have come out remembered how almost on first mention of edward name elizabeth have guessed engagement edith greeted with usual precise restrained manner heard mr fanshawe arrived yesterday said mother be looking forward to coming elizabeth kissed be glad to come said be beginning to be afraid must never see heathmoor again edith looked at moment in silence did want to asked yes wanted to see too edith hope be happy edith laughed wretched little jangle of laugh be very comfortable mother will tell said edward be always very kind to have made great deal of money year come back from town evening by dinner train be going to have baby semblance of ordinary conversation have to be kept up a long a edith chose if talk be going to get more intimate deepening of have to come from quite suddenly came be very unhappy elizabeth said have not have single happy moment since married have turned out different to what expected wanted edward so much that must not give up thought that by degree must turn to love never loved proposed to accepted because thought that must be very comfortable together so must have be if have not have not fallen in love with elizabeth laid hand on edith knee dear be there need to speak of said edith turned quickly on secret self suppressed through month by right must have be month of such wonderful magical expansion fell on struggling to be allowed utterance when came here with more than vague desire to see elizabeth have not guessed how like highwayman with cudgel bludgeon secret walled up life must attack fighting to express think there be need to speak of said have one whom can speak to if told mother must must recommend to see mr martin if told edward must only try to be kinder to elizabeth kindness choke ca breathe in have all be utter utter failure thought that must get to love so that must be enough for to be with always thought must be satisfied to be wife thought too that must be happy a well a for be not so thought then entirely selfish must not have refused to give up if have thought that must turn out so hopelessly then there be a well did not love so be not standing in way of happiness elizabeth felt face go suddenly white have too made awful lifelong mistake knew integrity of purpose when have told edith did not love how have said that simply solely for edith sake so that having definitely irrevocably chosen not to give edward up might not be prey of back thought gnawings what if misery hunger unslaked thirst must have be avoided what if have rejected great renunciation have avowed love for edward have given rein to steed of desire have renunciation be no more than savage heathen rite mutilation of herself for moment very foundation of world seemed to sway noble superstructure to totter edith did not notice blanching of face saw quivering eyelid be looking fixedly at spot in lawn in front of with intent absent air went on speaking in same unemotional voice may a well be honest said because there doe not seem to be much else left a matter of fact must not have done differently even if have loved did not care two straw for happiness for only for own yet did love be passionately fond of thought must make love at rate that must forget told anyhow that be sudden wild fancy have for that have fallen in love with music did not care what told so long a got now at present moment must give anything in world if must be made possible must still love love more be not even jealous that love may do a like if only must cease being kind to if only must go right out of life never see again be impossible soon will be mother of child besides mother must think so odd so must mr martin must call wicked think be really much wickeder to go on living with yes time be trying to get love be only poisoning own be poisoning that be dearer to than anything in world be sorry for now lie before quite dead killed by well can say truthfully be sorry when have committed crime like that only possible palliation be that be sorry did love even when gave love that first dose of poison in refusing to let go loved got up in agitation let one say did not love cried in voice suddenly strained shrill elizabeth got up also forcing down terror at tragic figure suddenly revealed to full of growing pity edith dear be talking wildly said know what be saying edith put up hand to head be not wild talk said be sober truth express badly get confused there be something wanted to ask be really true what told then face changed hardness restraint faded from became humanized again by suffering elizabeth feel so ill said be in pain in great pain elizabeth be sitting in window of edward smoking room where two morning ago edith have sat talking reading before came over to house next door late that night baby seven month child have be born flickering faintly into life out again now in room overhead edith lay dying hour ago have asked to see elizabeth have passed into state of unconsciousness before girl must come to so now elizabeth waited near at hand in case cousin rallied again again wished to see edward in room upstairs have promised to call at once mr hancock watched with house be very still with curious stillness come with such waiting outside warm may wind blew in at window laden with scent of wallflower grew just outside air be full of fragrance chirrupings of spring at gate stood mr hancock motor have just brought down doctor from london who at moment be holding consultation with edith doctor in dining room elizabeth have propped open door of room where sat so that might hear come out get word with have be told there be hope that cousin must live above head from room where edith lay came occasional footstep sounding dim muffled must hear slow tick of clock in hall outside guessed believed with certainty what be edith wanted to say to namely to repeat question have be cut short by coming of pain two day before elizabeth knew how must answer sat there long in silence alert for noise must come from house then dining room door where physician be consulting opened went out to meet in hall couple of sentence told london specialist walked out to motor waiting for while other went upstairs again to silent room from outside came whirr of engine a denton started again elizabeth sat down on bottom step of stair mind quite still inactive occasionally like cloud taking substance suddenly in serene sky remembered sentence trivial happening connected with edith appeared there forming vanishing again more than once edith voice sounded in ear a said let one say did not love for most part imminence of great silent event that be waiting for kept mind vacant in presence must not think of anything else little thing kept occurring to seemed to come from outside then heard stir above click of opened door looking round up saw edward beckoning to have asked for said a entered edith be lying on bed looking with wide open eye at ceiling did not seem to elizabeth entrance doctor beckoned to knelt down at right of bed then went back stood little distance off by window breeze streamed in through open sash making blind tassel rattle tap against wall otherwise there be dead silence then suddenly edith spoke want to see elizabeth said will not elizabeth come elizabeth got up be here edith said want to speak to alone said nobody else must hear have turned eye to girl a bent over waited looking at with fixed anxious expression till others have gone into dressing room adjoining be alone asked then tell did love elizabeth bent lower over kissed yes dear edith said always loved then then must get to forgive perhaps will forgive do think will elizabeth took hold of white wet hand lay outside coverlet oh dear said ask to come then said edith faintly quickly quickly next moment stood together by bed lip moved once sound came from only eye over lay deepening shadow looked from one to other back again
