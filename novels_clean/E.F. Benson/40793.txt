wholly abstract be of entirely different nature from love of two young people who admire like other enormously mind body abstruser side of life be complete puzzle to reggie to take very small wholly

effect of passage be only too often seen in uncovering of ugly root stone removal not deposit of sediment of course knew more about previous affair to do reggie justice be superficial innocent enough than did that gentleman mother young man whatever relation with mother may be will choose other confidant in such case argued in fact nothing more than very great susceptibility on reggie part to influence of charming young woman sage percy asked whether constant propinquity of one specimen of attractive product must necessarily secure from influence of others unlucky resemblance between previous skirmish engagement seemed to too close to be altogether satisfactory flirtation on large scale argued be not very different from flirtation on small scale mr davenport have immense

that be dazzled piqued maddened woman who care be always for whom men care most passionately wonder if eva will ever fall in love said percy half to will be fine sight if doe will teach bloodless people how to do think have more force than anyone know doe ever talk to about marriage oh there be nothing in world doe talk about have begun to take immense interest in a well a in other people watch own development with much entertainment never force anything quietly wait till change be made then find out exactly what have happened scene with old lady hayes must have be wicked said mr davenport can imagine so well lolling back in chair with infinite languor smoking cigarette probably uttering slow polished blasphemy about mother in law most cherished belief be out in algiers now said percy eva suddenly expressed wish to go there again like languid heat of place jim armine be with ah said mr davenport softly be very cruel have greatest distaste for ordinary home life last year father lost lot of money have to live very quietly at home in country retrench eva must endure have quite made up mind that must never fall in love at will do something sublime if doe be quite capable

with said serenely know what think right before begin to say a soon a begin to say begin not to know what think confident assertion failed to satisfy gertrude said did mind woman being immoral if be only beautiful said oh never said word about immorality exclaimed reggie think be right to talk about such thing gerty what do mean a if must say such thing to especially since never think at open candour of lover face have due effect well be quite sure meant nothing of sort be asked ready to be mollified of course be said with sincerity understand what mean what did say then cloud have begun to drift horizon be not clear yet oh ask said tragically tell never know what say get so dreadfully confused said oh lord what did say said that ugly woman oh dear that ugly woman ca do thing if beautiful woman did must be thought beast explained with fine disregard of coherency oh reggie be exactly what said did say no be said reggie who though not exactly bored wanted to talk about something else said something about beautiful woman being fashion ugly woman ca be what do mean by fashion why mean fashion said rage comme il something thing everybody else doe balloon sleeve

well reggie cleanly honest instinct gave direction on subject drew in feeler like sea anemone when foreign substance touch soul must have have word two to say to about reggie unfortunately knew nothing about sat silent for minute two reggie trying to think of something to say must be sufficiently remote from puzzling topic gertrude still rather troubled in mind in after year remembered that night a first occasion on certain vague pain have begun first of series of blind pang stirred new sort of feeling in that tore asunder fibre in inmost being elegant musing over devotional book be a have mentioned before accredited source of such awakening unerring instinct of lover in reggie divined though very dimly that little change have taken place felt that gertrude have felt something that have not felt in spite of recent sense of irresponsibility of utter contentedness on own part must see that edge have be taken ever so slightly off hers may observe something like in case of more human animal dog sometimes will know that doe not understand if bond between human friend be very strong inability to understand be something quite different be knowledge of inability be rare reggie felt now a be natural recovered first after twinge of pain one be prone to sit quiet minute two regain one normal level pain have be all on one side gertrude required little space to steady in gerty

love be very fair bent down kissed gently first one then other sha' kiss hand said come let go to others troubled look have gone from face mr davenport with woman swift infallible intuition saw that something ever so small have happened there be still in eye shadow of vague wonder lady believe have bad habit of going to other bedroom when be thought to have gone to bed sitting by fire talking thing over be bad plan to talk thing over at night because while be talking there form in air without seeing little grey ghost to word give birth there be such thing a barren word word uttered by go to make up little series of figure who come talk to when nobody else be there sort of conversation that gertrude mr davenport have that night gave rise to little pale anxious grey ghost that sat by gertrude bedside a soon a body have have enough sleep ghost always allows victim necessary minimum tapped fretfully on shoulder said come wake up let go on talking gertrude stirred in dreamless sleep knew that little ghost have come to talk to be time honoured custom for author to describe personal appearance of character when decides to lay reflection before discriminating public neglect of custom be red rag to stupid furious bull called criticism so since little ghost personal appearance be only to be described by retailing conversation took place between gertrude mr davenport night before obedient peace loving author complies with eminently english demand gertrude be sitting before fire in dressing gown when mr davenport came in eye still wore troubled look picture in fire be

davenport waited moment then by unerring instinct laid hand softly on gertrude pressed gently touch have power in dumb soul spake have got no right to be troubled said gertrude feel be horribly ungrateful of when think of what reggie be to how good be to voice got tremulous stopped abruptly yes said mr davenport softly wanting to hear more for gertrude sake be just said at last speaking rapidly with splendid self control reggie said something evening hurt said that recklessness mattered le in beautiful woman than in be that said mr davenport with considerable relief be not said gertrude be nonsense of course know doe mean did see hurt oh be so hard not to give wrong impression mean that be inconsiderate at never be anything considerate simply did know be tangible to mind if cut finger 'd be miserable about somehow be unable to understand how hurt so must not see that did hurt hurt somewhere deep down ever so little feeling be new strange sound horribly selfish be afraid ca help ah think see said mr davenport be like said gertrude hitherto have always felt so entirely at one with reggie if feel thing be always seemed to feel too like echo same with just once listened for echo did come mr davenport paused moment did ever hear of man who be out riding with wife when horse threw in dismounting to help dropped whip while be picking up horse kicked killed asked seems to that be just little like man gerty love be very big thing one own small sensibility be very little thing take care of big thing never mind others be so mixed up said girl see little thing be part of big thing be right be quite true there be many very lovely thing be right to look at a whole love be one of philosopher from beginning of world have addled brain over impossible analysis reggie be not philosopher gerty be young lover be not business to analyse dissect to enjoy mr davenport be at sore disadvantage of having to temporise must not suspect be at bottom of said be quite sincere fully believed that strength of gerty love must fill interval if there be to be interval between reggie be best that woman be better finer bigger than man for beautiful indulgence of woman love have more passive endurance in early stage than man in perfect marriage two eventually be mixed in spite of mortal screen such mixing be rare at first rushed together will inevitably recoil little woman have more power of waiting than most men gertrude seemed somewhat relieved be not quite over yet grey ghost be waiting for frillings be just little disappointed understand said waited for echo never came ah well be very happy yon be very good to god forbid mine must ever give pain said mr davenport warmly what be to do said gertrude to whom practical side of thing always presented be natural dear

to grave will melt into other gertrude looked at inquiringly be called by many name said be trustfulness be serenity be sympathy be many more people call grace of god think be right kissed girl on forehead very tenderly will tide over difficult place over youth carry now for youth have gift of splendid stainlessness of going through deep water not being drowned of avoiding evil instinctively without thought time come to when avoid with reason a well with soul be ridiculous of said girl suddenly reggie did know what felt did tell yet be disappointed have probably done just same to lot of time never told be abominably selfish of hope will forgive must think extremely unlikely said mr davenport with enormous gravity must advise to cry to sleep be going to bed so be good night ah dear pray may be very happy gertrude clung to in long kiss feeling new bond have sprung up between odious little grey ghost who have be grinning sardonically at easy enthusiasm be sitting by bed waiting till renewal of strength brought by sleep have quickened capability for listening to cold accuracy until generous sudden glow have begun to burn somewhat le warmly in breast chapter iii lord hayes have be rather troubled about health during winter in foregoing event have occurred though have not stood in way of giving several large house party at one of have suddenly fainted dead off in middle of dinner when house be empty again have gone up to london to see doctor eva be sitting in room when returned feeling rather bored well hayes said a came in what did say to lord hayes adjusted trouser about knee before answered have symptom of dangerous heart disease said may live for many year die of something else again may die almost at moment eva book drooped off knee how horrible said at length can nothing be done be sure be right unfortunately be quite sure said nothing can be done consider chance of dying quite suddenly at time a possible not at likely eva in serene health felt sudden great pity for not unmixed with horror have sympathy with disease seemed to hardly decent poor hayes said can not tell how shocked be thought be best to tell said let avoid subject altogether will live to bore for many year yet eva looked at admiringly be brave man be right let talk about took place late in november fact that symptom have be result of over fatigue did not re occur made eva soon get used to thought in measure husband too took doctor advice did not over exert at found that discovery have made did not affect health day soon began to pas on a usual eva have suddenly determined to go abroad for few week for have intense dislike to english winter hence came about one morning at breakfast when husband be alone have said to what do propose to do during next two month hayes lord hayes looked up from breakfast not quite understanding purport of question suppose will remain here till easter said be paying visit in january believe must rather like to go abroad for few week now horrible weather have begun looked out of window where snow be beginning to fall heavily shivered sympathetically hate english weather said be like being in cold bath dry cold be not so bad there be something exhilarating about doe suit in least why must go to algiers again thought did like algiers said do propose that must go alone oh wo make intolerable demand of sort on other think suit best to have people with daresay percy must like to come for bit perhaps mother must join then there be jim armine who always want to go abroad whenever can eva spoke with utmost indifference husband found wondering whether indifference be not very subtle piece of acting that have inkling of young man feeling towards wife be very possible have not least objection to in fact rather pleased than otherwise a afforded sort of testimonial to own admirable taste in wishing to become wife to enviable success in securing for purpose knew quite well that role of jealous husband must not suit in least have intention of being complaisant one have sense enough to guess complaisance be not necessary have reason to believe that eva have heart at have desire to make mistake if suggested to eva that must rather not have jim armine with remark must be liable to be interpreted in way might with justice resent in fact be only interpretation open to for liked young man well enough in did not even admit smallest suspicion into mind only realised that there be possibility of avenue down suspicion might day choose to walk when suspicion be seen by walking down avenue must go take hand must knock at eva door show eva rose from table then mind coming to algiers be clearly impossible to say do mind jim armine coming so proposed date ten day off for departure why must go sooner asked eva there be be unpleasantness down at ironwork said think that a owner ought to just wait till be settled in form do mean down at trelso yes men be striking wanting to strike for higher wage more pay in fact must go down there to day see agent manager whoever be there be nothing definite yet only know that there be good deal of discontent surely then can leave with manager to deal with when occurs be absurd waiting in england for handful of miner to tell what want must be better think if waited said wish must explain to exactly why simply because a owner said must wish to consult if anything went really wrong surely there be telegraph to algiers must infinitely prefer starting in le than week really can not stand sort of weather feel sure be right to stop said be certainly best eva hesitated moment must mind going on without then perhaps must be best plan daresay jim will come with husband looked at narrowly felt be playing losing game will go down to trelso to day see exactly what state of affair be how stand in fact very good will start on thursday then will write to jim to day hope wo lose more money over smiled rather grimly hope not last year have be very expensive grudge in least in fact be very interesting to to see how much woman can spend be conscious of impotent desire to make not quite pleasant for eva even if did get own way in main be pleased to see flinch just perceptibly be annoyed with for doing yes suppose find spend much more now than used about ten thousand year more dear be great deal can hardly have counted cost did not quite realise at time be what mean by saying be more than anticipated ah of course must anticipate said eva love be blind know lord hayes be rather sorry have begun be somewhat in position of dog run out from shelter to bite passer by when get into open discovers that intended victim carry stick eva waited long enough to give time to reply if wanted finding said nothing turned left room two day after a be sitting at dinner eva asked what have happened about ironwork be glad reminded said told that wished particularly to leave england at once asked to telegraph to in case be wanted appears that expect immediate disturbance so will be able to come with on thursday in fact there will be nothing to detain have better stop if think be wanted said eva can manage perfectly by jim armine will be with wrote to day if want of course will go with armine be coming then be asked husband yes object to hope not in least if do must have be better if have said so at once said eva carelessly have asked now why must suppose object to asked suddenly did seem very cordial about have asked anybody else mentioned to mother when saw in trelso said must come ah said eva with ghost of smile did say why apparently be for sake because of in fact expect meant for own sake must be charmed to have there be straightforwardness refusal to compromise in behaviour to be very refreshing speaks of with bitterness might almost say rancour remarked lord hayes be more sinned against than sinning then said eva always feel perfectly charitable towards loathes after be not fault really be wonderful what fine order of hatred be compatible with most orthodox christianity of course be one of work of devil have be led to renounce from child thus came about before middle of december lord hayes wife jim armine be installed in charming little villa at algiers gulf of lyon be kinder on occasion to susceptibility of lord hayes produced white umbrella sat on deck chair in untroubled contemplation always wore yachtsman cap brown shoe on calm trip be somehow particularly aggravating to eva be sitting on deck when came upstairs on morning after departure from marseille eva have long malignant look at a approached look completely nautical morning said slowly hope wo get rough for sake will have to retire commodore will be found groaning in cabin perhaps be only fighting sailor like lord nelson who be always ill be in case hope sha' meet moorish privateer if be attacked during storm will be completely exposed eva have rarely said anything to in such simple bad taste husband be surprised childishness of stricture however rather amused than otherwise for thought have key to in rather awkward little scene have taken place evening before eva have be arguing point with jim armine have got little excited have just made assertion seemed to to contradict what have said moment before by unlucky slip exclaimed why eva said just opposite minute ago mistake be pardonable enough when man be in love with woman naturally think of by christian name be excusable if in momentary excitement us eva be startled have never called that before losing self control for one half second uttered sudden exclamation of anger glanced at husband be sitting with one leg crossed over other looking at sunset turned to jim armine said politely think must have misunderstood lady hayes poor young man flushed deeply eva bit lip divided between annoyance desire to laugh annoyance conquered in end a delicate veiled insult of husband speech dawned upon word certainly bore interpretation though whether have meant not be not quite sure must not ask jim armine evidently took in obscurer sense be horribly disconcerted eva not unnaturally felt extremely annoyed be possibly trying to make fool of have not least intention of being treated in such manner after few moment found something to say conversation be evidently over jim armine soon strolled away to other end of deck eva be left alone with husband a soon a other be out of hearing said to wish to speak of in way please remember regret having offended replied choose armine must call by christian name eva in fact speech implied more than said lord hayes determined to make stand be very quick at finding meaning what said be insulting be insulting to that must call eva do admit then that speech bore meaning lord hayes lit cigarette admit nothing of sort not at will be so good a to apologise to have reason for supposing that imagined to bear meaning obvious one one in fact meant to convey of course be at liberty to explain to that if choose for first time eva be conscious of slight disadvantage lord hayes distinctly saw a sat still silent looked at watch remarked be afraid propose to give dinner at seven be barbarous custom perhaps must like to know that be now five minute to seven carefully furled white umbrella walked down deck to saloon made in mind careful little note of occurrence against possible contingency of suspicion coming down avenue be characteristic of that be a evenly polite a ever to jim armine advised to drink white wine not red remarked to at tea afterwards that albert biscuit be stale that be interesting to observe that english manufactory of biscuit held own abroad in fact that maker of stale albert biscuit be huntly palmer suggestive little scene accounted in mind for eva unusual want of politeness on subject of yachtsman cap brown canvas shoe did not consider that reason for abandoning in fact became to sort of commemorative medal on occasion of victory force have unbroken record of defeat be apt to dwell on single unexpected victory in main be right in attributing eva irritation that morning to slight discomfiture on evening before for though have dismissed rather forgotten occurrence there be still in latent resentment unconsciously vented in manner have be at villa four five day lord hayes have got into habit of observing wife jim armine somewhat closely eva be rather silent to husband hardly spoke at though now then at meal must begin talking more to herself than others jim armine be not very wise young man said thing sometimes that with woman must have betrayed eva did not seem to notice be seated at lunch one day when eva took up parable have said nothing at a way be for minute lord hayes have be describing to jim how eucalyptus oil be extracted from tree must excuse silence mr armine said know have sort of recollection about villa be here know on wedding tour after have be on riviera just hayes used to sit out in garden listen to nightingale singing of love be very romantic doubt hayes have spoken to of when pour out heart in smoking room after have gone to bed be always odd to that men choose that time for being confidential must have thought must have disturbed night rest how do know that be confidential then asked jim why of course be there be time to be confidential during day besides be only time when be sure not to be invaded by woman will hide in smoking room night listen to what say there be nothing might not hear said husband mean that suppose in order to deter from listening assuming that being woman only care to hear what be not meant for ear said very politely not at be formal invitation said assurance of how entirely welcome must be thanks of course be under sort of mutual compact to delight in other society at time place lord hayes laughed one eternal honeymoon surely golden age will return jim armine not unnaturally felt that be distinctly comedy deux that presence of third person be unnecessary man can leave red mullet half eaten for such reason everything go to wall before material need lord hayes punctilious little manner always vanished in anything like scene began to be possessed at exactly point when most possessed people begin to be nervous flurried for punctiliousness be result not of nervousness desire not to be nervous when occasion be interesting enough to allow to forget tinge of finished cynicism indifference to fellow men assumed natural predominance rather enjoyed little polite sparring match with wife until began to get worst of a long a button be on foil must fence very decently sight of bare point distinctly discomposed eva flushed let reserve rapture for when be alone said be slightly embarrassing to third person lord hayes smiled for second time banner of victory seemed to wave over head saw wife flush knew that be very angry that desire to avenge have felt so strongly on return from honeymoon sense that have be trapped be being exhibited a rare bird in cage be very strong in added insolence of trapper pretending to be on intimate loving term with made furious consciousness that have brought upon did not tend to diminish rage for second time be trying to make fool of before third person how far scene took place day two after be brought on by eva dislike of husband thirst for vengeance be not part of narrative to determine chronicler mission be not to form conclusion to present data immediate mission be to present rather important data even in december in algiers be often pleasant to sit out of door at nine in evening for air be cool dry eva often spent hour in little open passage ran round central courtyard of house in year before have talked to husband on position of woman time be jim armine who be companion lord hayes have gone upstairs to write to mother proposed to give accurate description based on observation about date palm room looked out on to aforementioned courtyard before beginning letter went across to window to close for have heard that night air of algiers be unwholesome just a be in act of taking little precaution there lighted on ear grumbling noise of basket chair being dragged in passive grating resistance over stone floor followed by sound of eva voice a must not see came to very logical conclusion that be sitting directly below window where must not see a be talking jim armine be only person in house pictured talking to after evening air be not unpleasant instead of closing window stood by listened emphatic deliberation of manoeuvre be felt vaguely in favour from conventional point of view voice at first be inaudible to for sense of hearing requires focussing a much a sense of sight only caught word here there for sake of reader will be necessary to give inaudible part of conversation two seated in basket chair jim armine lit cigarette there be small lamp by flame of burned steadily in still air cast square of brilliant light into courtyard beyond across a across magic lantern sheet white moth wandered from time to time losing again in surrounding dark there be several moment silence then looked at eva half of whose face be in brilliant illumination said look tired to night be not tired said be feeling blank just now everything appears to extremely uninteresting know from experience that thing be not uninteresting really be worst of be there can not touch live in grey fog there be sunshine somewhere quite close can not get to what else must expect jim be attending eagerly of course may say how sorry be for said in low voice eva did not turn head least sparkle returned to eye perhaps thing be going to be amusing after for few minute be grateful of course said one be to be pitied when fog be so palpably dense of course will lift again fog last for ever be glad be with though think ought to be after nothing matter much lord hayes have by time successfully focussed ear to indistinct sound eva last remark be perfectly audible ah thing do matter said young man earnestly men be not like men by suppose mean to understand that be not like men how can know that have halo round head dawning of ineffable joy in face why must suppose be more than others have spoken to before now of great aim enthusiasm for great cause by a far a know only mean home rule unionist policy forgot what politics be even seems to have be in abeyance lately have be with week more what have done what have thought about seem to prefer after talking to be very cruel eva said lord shut window perhaps night air be unwholesome after in case have heard enough suspicion be running down avenue growing clearer at step hesitated moment then left room walked downstairs a came out into courtyard heard echo of eva light cruel laughter jim armine be standing in front of with arm hanging listlessly by side did not look exactly happy sight of lord hayes only added very slightly deeper shade to face eva husband never felt more methodically cool in life have quite determined what to do have not seen approach smile still lingered on lip be lying back in chair in indolent languor only in eye be amusement excitement looked very fine just then be saying to jim turning saw husband smile died off lip amusement from eye only that air of utter languor be left saw vengeance coming near a lord hayes have seen suspicion met joyfully lord hayes laid hand on young man shoulder steamer only go twice week to marseille said there will be steamer to morrow in meantime be sure will see advisability of spending next two night at hotel st george say be very good hotel of course will not receive caller eva shifted position slightly looked at husband kindly explain why must go off so suddenly said must not insult by doing so insult lie in silence suppose overheard something yes said husband be listening ah be so like be listening for be listening more le for what heard in fact suspected something of sort yes yet did not warn go away mr armine listen please sit down hayes wish to talk to what lovely night be quite idyllic by way wish to know whether suspicion be entirely confined to absolutely entirely be quite sure quite be good said eva naturally wanted to know to return why did not warn lord hayes found that thing be not going exactly a have foreseen did not think must be of use to warn said at length then a have suspicion of what purpose be served by going away presence here under roof be insult to yet did not warn said eva seems to that have cancelled insult to yourself will tell exactly what have happened do know know enough said possibly from point of view be afraid must have left box before end end be important how much did hear exactly however doe matter said something well extremely ill judged told have mistaken altogether laughed a well did hear laugh said have not slightest doubt of devotion did not feel least inclined to accept appreciate devotion except husband of course eva waited moment refined cruelty wait little now then for full effect of pain to be felt be impossible that must remain here said please listen to moment have not finished yet have insulted grossly twice in first place by not warning in second by listening like insult in least have intention of receiving jim committed extreme indiscretion for be mainly responsible if have spoken to before must not have happened again if have not listened must have known nothing of will be good enough to take word for that one must have be worse must have learnt lesson must have have pleasure of teaching did not expect in least for did not think must have be so foolish a to speak of degradation husband must have imposed on grew more more bitter stood up with intense anger intensely repressed choose that must stop said despise for listening if like may insist on going if do will go too tell be perfectly reckless perfectly determined point be have be insulted be who insulted by not giving warning if play spy on in way owe absolutely nothing be may choose choose quickly waited moment giving time to reply apparently have nothing to say in fact there be nothing for to say be then if be going to sit out here with have better tell to bring chair understand quite clearly be over will never allude to again must ask not to lord hayes walked away without saying word eva stood still one moment steadying then called out to jim who be leaning against pillar at opposite corner of court can come back said be not going to send away let go on talking from last remark two settled again in chair laughed evening have be unexpectedly amusing will not listen again will not talk nonsense again hope really be unique position be only one of three who come out of with credit suspect that b friend be making love to wife doe not warn listens hears something that confirms suspicion try to drive b out of house meet amicably at breakfast next morning certainly if eva have felt have small score to wipe off against husband have wiped off very cleanly be for few moment when have stood up with intense anger thoroughly in hand mortally afraid of knew have used her anger a weapon against have not let act wildly unpremeditatedly well knew that a weapon anger be most useful when be skilfully handled controlled compressed horse without rider lashed into enemy line may be true do service by promiscuous kicking be blind ungoverned force skilful rider however who adapts savage strength to own intelligence can guide direct destructive potentiality be increased tenfold be a serviceable though savage brute eva employed anger against husband spurred lashed into fury never gave head that cruel governed anger of woman be very terrible thing hot blustering anger of man be like squib burst jump here there sometimes singeing immediate surroundings perhaps breaking something waste force in childish cracker like explosion hurt nothing sensitive nerve regard such exhibition a lamentable want of taste eva anger must not have offended most fastidious gave annoying little bang unexpected leap fizzing unmomentous crackling be still deep intense not pleasant to fight with eva jim sat in little courtyard for half hour more be rather hard burden for young man to eva appeared to be effort to talk a usual have required just one moment in to steady to dismount quivering indignant steed then for a have told husband be over have be angry furious insulted have used whip with vengeance offence punishment be past threw whip into corner jim be silent be not altogether unnatural have taste for scene great coup ace of trump to shame have be forced from seemed to have fallen very flat have played eva have seen be have simply be wasted naturally enough felt have spoiled hand eva have laughed at have not be offended surely such attitude be almost unprecedented when went upstairs hour later turned into husband room to get book wanted found sitting by window a if expecting rose a entered stood like servant waiting for order eva gave order having found book only remarked that be growing little chilly did not reply turned to look at there be something miserably shrunken about appearance be rather pitiful look tired said must go to bed if be did not meet eye continued to look out of window have be terrible night said eva frowned have be nothing of sort said be absurd hayes made very bad mistake did not treat in way wish to be treated be intensely angry with assure be angry no longer be quite over a far a be concerned let quarrel more than be necessary just now be quite unnecessary to quarrel lord hayes have certain potentiality for being malignant be not quarrelling said be mutual position that find occupy to other grew little impatient let be enough said only waste word came step nearer to laid hand on shoulder a if have be woman man come said

following thin golden thread through maze of bewildering twilight while be secure in hand maze twilight bewilderment be comparatively unimportant davenport have moved up to london in april gertrude be with again for week before went abroad to aix with mother in may mr carston be weak fretful invalid who always insisted on daughter cheerful robust support while went through course of somewhat unnecessary bath massage great city be just beginning to settle down to great effort of amusing for three month morning post recorded morning by morning fresh addition to big fair davenport in virtue of mr davenport modest contribution to task of governing nation have be duly entered on book for year blind in grosvenor square testified to accuracy of announcement reggie gertrude be sitting in

gone out with found pleasant enough to wait after have finished breakfast skim daily paper till returned be deeply absorbed in total disappearance of french poodle when reggie entered after dressing laid down paper to pour out tea for row be fuller morning said parliamentary train be in great force what be parliamentary train oh string of people who walk up down very slowly with row of groom behind know sort one there knew yes several people gerty give bit of sugar percy be there looking for sister apparently have come back jim armine be there too also looking for percy sister lady hayes yes said reggie eating steadily on went looked too must find by way percy want to go there to lunch gertrude have sudden sense that have happened before be going to act again in rather distasteful

true have got to go of course if have got to said slowly be right begin at three doe say can do because be quite impossible be very good to reggie gertrude felt intensely relieved must not have told why there have be something in conversation have held with reggie six month before on subject of eva remained in mind gave sense not of danger of distrust sensitive mind need not usually be not most analytical for reason to apply analysis to unwillingness to see eva must yield either result false one there be instinct in animal enables to discriminate between friend foe keener that instinct be more instantaneous be in working anatomist can tell action of heart with almost absolute accuracy can say how blood get oxydised in lung how feed muscle work nerve one thing can not tell be why doe so instinct like action of heart can be noted expressed reason of working will not know just yet action may be pulled to piece like flower divided into component part labelled with fifty crack jaw name life of flower cease not to be delicate insoluble mystery to reggie be very fond of music be compatible rather essential that particular liking for prompted to say that wagner seemed to to be awfully ugly be far cry that must assert same evening to gertrude that have thought overture to tannhaeuser awfully pretty gertrude have be rather silent a drove back something have prompted to say to reggie evening a sat in drawing room before dinner ah reggie be so glad be good reggie power of analysis be easily baffled be wonder that felt puzzled like bad people said do bit said gertrude be glad thought of that afternoon at concert oh listened to music said reggie liked awfully yes know suggested that to half of overture that rippling part seemed so wicked think wagner must have be bad man evidently meant to be much more attractive than other see how can say part be wicked good be done on fiddle know gertrude laughed hope will never understand then said prefer a be after matter great deal gong have sounded mr davenport a entered room heard last word what doe reggie understand asked gertrude said thought of overture be wicked said said did know what meant be very stupid of mr davenport looked up quickly at gertrude dear think be very wise of said reggie jumped up did know be ever wise said be really delightful discovery thank mummy gerty will have to respect for ever now know be wise will invest in sense of dignity never said be wise remarked gertrude refuse to be responsible for opinion own oh will be responsible murmured mr davenport reggie looked from one to other with air of intelligent dog daresay be all right said know what be about oh reggie do understand said gertrude be ridiculous reggie looked at with most genuine frankness understand word must like to explain very much gertrude frowned turned away to greet jim armine who be dining with vague pain have felt before be with now somehow reggie seemed to have got on to different level be moral not intellectual understanding appeared to now then a almost entirely wanting what puzzled be that have be entirely unconscious of such defect till few month ago present knowledge of struck somehow a not being natural outcome of increased intimacy rather a if own moral understanding by judged reggie have be developed showed want of in here again vague instinctiveness of feeling in mind precluded analysis knew be that viewed thing rather differently from that difference have not always be there pity be akin to love love when joined with pity be not le love love joined to most human protective instinct if anything add tenderness to passion jim armine have be lunching with hayes brought minatory message for reggie why have said must come to lunch bring miss carston then never turned up reggie behaved in most unchivalrous manner be gerty fault said made go to hear music wrote to say so did reggie reggie began to wish have taken blame on yes wrote said forgot to send interpolated mr davenport reggie be simply abominable must go to call explain oh can write note to say how sorry be said gertrude suddenly remark be insignificant enough to gertrude be outcome of feeling not at insignificant felt a if have inadvertently said something did not mean to say without reflecting to others word be capable of much le momentous interpretation looked up quickly at mr davenport fearing for moment that self betrayal be patent mr davenport also remembered at moment certain conversation gertrude have have one night month ago eye met that look puzzled elder woman have not fathomed gertrude feeling on subject of lady hayes when spoke to about mystery remained still unsolved idea that gertrude be in way prey of jealous fear be too ridiculous to be entertained dowager lady hayes who be staying with entered somewhat opportunely at moment followed by mr davenport went in to dinner that veteran lady appeared to be in state of mind when occurs in child be called fractiousness always took homoeopathic dose in globular form before dinner be placed in little wooden box by place to night dose have not be set out disconcerted everybody horribly by saying during first moment of silence inevitable when english people meet to dine together in voice of stentorian power dinner pill hurried consultation took place among flunky after few moment search box be found handed to on salver old lady hayes held up moment rattled pepsine announced obtained from gastric juice of pig ostrich must eat food eat at hour without suffering from indigestion must sooner eat box of tin tack than ordinary english dinner at half past eight without pepsine mr davenport cast responsible eye over menu to ordinary mind appeared sufficiently innocent be always divided between inclination to

that occasioned book to be written reggie be a have mentioned before very susceptible young man fully realised in propria persona mr davenport healthy condition of being in chronic state of devotion

wear very thin when be alone did not care much whether be polite not distinctly objected to be made fool of in public why have not made stand on occasion insisted that have cold at be indeed case found wondering even a be making retreat that wonder brought nearer to doing investigation into mesmerism other occult phenomenon be bringing nearer rational perception of such force be beginning to believe that man have set of moral muscle exercise moral force just a have similar physical system be superior inferior to of man to judge by analogy be known to appears inevitable that when one moral organisation strip a be to moral organisation that fight victory defeat will be result eva prize fight with husband have lasted more than year though be practically over yet defeated party still delivered of small protest from time to time resembled anonymous challenge challenge in be not distinctly stated that business be meant be common in column of such periodical a register more palpable sort of encounter lord hayes in fact still preserved malignant potentiality be source of satisfaction to that still retained slight power of annoying eva in small way did not venture to use in public because if eva suspected anything like whisper of challenge not strictly in private must take step to investigate public investigation be not to taste in private must vent little malignity without being publicly pommelled for thus came about when be seated at dinner alone night lord hayes said may ask who that young man be with be here yesterday believe did introduce said eva thought did be reggie davenport what do intend to do with beg pardon be to be sort of jim armine second eva finished eating souffle without replying lord hayes rather prematurely thought shot have told oh dear said

that be who be fond of with reggie asked to call reggie be reciprocal think must advise to be jealous must not think of thing said nothing make man so ridiculous a to be jealous except perhaps to be

guardian angel be coming to ball to night yes will be upstairs in room please send man to tell when carriage be round keep waiting a did on thursday eva went upstairs into room found among letter reggie photograph have already sent took up looked at for few moment placed by side of gertrude something perhaps scene at dinner have made restless walked up down room with long white dress sweeping ground behind what be matter with thought to herself impatiently surely of people sat down again opened of letter there be one from mother who be coming to stay with for week two hear lot about wrote everyone seems to be talking about nothing else except lady hayes beauty success when think that be own darling little eva can only feel full of gratitude thankfulness that mother prayer for own daughter welfare have be answered so fully bountifully hope that in rich of love position success have be so fully granted will not forget eva tore letter in half with sudden dramatic gesture threw into paper basket be annoyed ashamed of herself for want of self control new spring of feeling have be rising in last day two gave sense of loss of something missed might never come again feeling have experienced in degree after marriage when found out what be to be linked to man who did not love whom be beginning to detest now feeling be deeper keener more painful from mantlepiece reggie photograph looked at smiling well bred well dressed astonishingly young surely must be that hour later message came that carriage be round went downstairs again impassive cold perfectly beautiful a swept down into hall lord hayes who be standing there with pair of white kid glove in hand be suddenly struck astonished at beauty felt freshly proud at having become owner of dazzling perfect piece of life moved forward to meet in burst of pleased proprietorship laying hand on bare arm dear eva said be more beautiful than ever eva looked at for moment fixedly then suddenly shook hand off ah touch said shuddering moved past got into carriage lord hayes however have one consolation eva must never deprive of be knowledge that be knowledge that knew might writhe shrink treat with indifference scorn anger must never alter except by disgracing be too proud sensitive a knew to do anything of sort consequently assault on at dinner on subject of complaisance did not trouble for moment be morally impossible felt for to put into position for own position be a dear to a be odious lordship have certain cynical sense of humour whispered that though state of thing be not pleasant be distinctly amusing meantime a day went on if eva be beginning to be little anxious about mr davenport be not at ease about reggie gertrude letter came regularly liked to let mother read at rate betrayed dissatisfaction in one of arrived soon after last interview recorded between lady hayes reggie mr davenport suddenly felt frightened be very short sentence gave rise to feeling apparently very innocent one what on earth doe lady hayes want photograph for reggie be sitting by open window after particularly late breakfast smoking into window box back be turned to room be apparently absorbed in occupation have read gertrude letter a be having breakfast when have finished have given to mother saying jolly note from gerty will like to see mummy mr davenport read looked up with impatience at lounging figure in window seat what be about gerty photograph lady hayes asked understand reggie did not appear to hear continued persecuting small green fly be airing on red geranium be consequently conspicuous may smoke in here reggie said mr davenport raising voice little come in sit down reggie turned round somewhat unwillingly have heard mother first question have suddenly struck that be rather awkward one very frank nature will on occasion use extreme frankness to cover deficiency of decided that whole truth very openly stated be le liable to involve in difficulty than subtlest prevarication oh lady hayes said wanted gerty photograph mine said walking towards mother of course gave gave hers in exchange told gerty about in letter mr davenport looked up at observed that face be flushed what odd request said see why know quite well somehow though have only known such short time there be short silence mr davenport be casting about in mind a to how might learn what

somebody told lady hayes think that be awfully slow told gerty arbuthnots be going out suggested must leave mr carston with come back to london like london somehow year mr davenport be beginning to understand must have found in heart at moment to label eva with name must have astonished doe lady hayes talk about gerty much oh yes good deal at least let talk about whenever want to be that good deal reggie frowned have be acting for last week so with such spontaneity obeying so instantaneously inclination that found hard to answer question about thing be always harder to recall what have done unthinkingly than what have be result of thought conscious effort know said talk about now then talk about thousand thing know what mean lady hayes said other day that be sure gerty must detest think lady hayes be probably quite right then must be very unreasonable of gerty said reggie frowning again know why think so why must gerty detest her doe strike a sort of woman gerty must like think ever thought about till lady hayes mentioned disagreed with told other day that gerty agreed that only liked good people think gerty must think good reggie flushed angrily really see what be driving at said rather vehemently because did see think wo talk about more if mind mummy see be very kind delightful to be have right to judge by be sure 'd be just a nice to gerty sauntered out of room with rather exaggerated slowness feeling little uneasy be just conscious that new element have come into life be very absorbing one wondered little how absorbing be in proportion to other thing eva showed to different side to showed to world be careful when be there not to say quite what be in habit of saying when be with others regarded a child very charming delightful child knew that greatest respect a one of most finished artist of human life have said be due to child in fact according to data reggie glowing adoring picture of be faithful enough why eva behaved like to be question concerned alone of answer be even now working out in mind have tried world for two year have found distinctly wanting amused at time bored more frequently frantic interest have taken in men woman be beginning to pall little even interest have taken in herself be not so deep a have be must be remembered that world a knew be certain section of society however much unit differ in individuality be to certain extent dulled choked in limitation of class inexorable need to be well dressed to be successful to be smart diversity of interest be only thing will make interest long lived diversity be exactly what be wanting gossip whispered scandal scheming jostling be new to at first have drunk down eagerly in heart of heart knew that be just little tired of be beginning to behave a others behaved not because be most amusing thing must be done because others behaved so on stale gas lit atmosphere reggie have come like whiff of fresh air have not smallest interest in scandal gossip of thing in world found entire interest settled be new be fresh be young just now that meant good deal to eva for be type to of have missed be again distinctly of own class must not offend most fastidious taste eva must never have cultivated grocer assistant however fresh be extremely handsome attractive in appearance feeling for be made out of one large factor several small one for pleasant manner frank good breeding beauty liked for serene stainless youth have sort of liking be quite new to that conception have formed of be very far from representing knew well have deliberately held reckless cynical unprincipled part of nature rigorously in check when be with be sympathetic simple divinely kind to because liked so much knew that must detest other half of now mixture of motif led to determine to let know have come to that felt that inevitable longing to throw nature open to to drop elaborate suppression to let see a be judge deeper emotion be thickly entwined with fibre of honesty make even who be least honest in ordinary life scrupulously truthful open when deeper emotion be touched to say that eva be in love with reggie must be overstating understating be symbol to of lost ideal found have loved now have lost humanly speaking found very attractive a substantial embodiment of eva be sitting in room one morning few day after talk reggie have have with mother wondering how have better carry resolve out when idea struck got up wrote short note to wonder if must care to come to opera to night with said tannhaeuser be being played think remember saying thought overture very pretty do

wofully puzzled have not known like very much wanted explanation understand said know be very stupid do tell what mean eva cast one look at anxious frowning face trifled with fish must do said to herself can not let thing continue a have be oh get easier further on continued a humpty dumpty said will understand when hear overture again according to new light of course venusberg be only interlude in tannhaeuser life everyone have interlude in life else must not be human tannhaeuser be pilgrim pilgrim march about to slow music time venus of course doe not go about to slow music contrary in fact when hear two together contrast be very striking tannhaeuser go away from venusberg know before end dy in odour of sanctity eva stopped for moment jim armine laughed again be admirably lucid said seldom explain so well thanks for compliment said eva reggie do find lucid reggie be listening to with puzzled air expect will understand better when have seen said yes ca fail to

sense of misgiving with staunch loyalty smiled at eva told be stupid said first time saw confess to being absolutely stupid now understand bit jim regarded reggie a successful interloper must not resist temptation to be slightly malicious after be most delightful thing in world to be able to keep up mystery said nothing intelligible be so charming a what be mysterious when understand anything charm be gone nonsense jim said eva pay attention to what say reggie be very easy to be unintelligible yes seems to be said reggie rather absently resenting jim remark savoured of patronising eva

left room reggie lit cigarette strolled to window have particular liking for jim armine eva word have disturbed be growing more conscious of fact that life be beginning to find new centre mystery be quite new to strong genuine liking admiration for gertrude have not diminished whit did not conceal from that thought with more excitement about eva felt able to retain interest without sense of compromise be engaged to marry gertrude must have be genuinely puzzled if have be suggested to that engagement to mind limited liberty in becoming indefinitely interested in woman in fact extreme simplicity of character appeared to be going to land among perilously complicated unknown shoal be young ardent unreflective divine gift be capable of dealing back handed blow in most inopportune unexpected way eva word evening have startled perplexed bewilderment be touched with distrust expected a eva have told to find key to perplexity in opera to night half realised that explanation might be appallingly significant year afterwards remembered few minute spent looking out of window with much greater clearness than remembered what followed mental like physical shock often produce dimness in memory men who have be in great peril of death will remember with great vividness most insignificant circumstance just before peril how be walking round slippery corner of rock coated with ice how little purple gentian grew just above crevice where found handhold how at foot be trickle of water where sun have melted snow then came slip activity of mind seems suddenly quiescent a slid powerlessly down icy stair noticed nothing even bitterness of death be passed be inanimate arrow from bow of natural law in same way little detail of few minute when waited for eva to put on opera cloak be engraved indelibly on reggie mind year afterwards faint acrid smell of red geranium brought back whole evening with throb of sudden awakening window be open flower box outside be in full scent colour canary creeper climbed trellis work at side of window twined green muscular stalk round painted wooden square between row of gaudy geranium grew up from groundwork of low mignonette not yet in full flower in front of box fringe of dark blue lobelia shivered on hair like stalk in evening air beyond lay grimy dusty square garden over road between house bowled silent smooth running carriage within caught sight of shimmering of silk jewel over brooded hot weary sky exhausted with long sultry hour beginning to grow little more serene little le stifled in cool of evening reggie looked at thing not knowing be noticing forbearing to guess what eva meant be surprised to hear door in room behind open to find eva be ready cigarette be nearly smoked out have not thought that have be gone more than few second well reggie said have be thinking over be prepared for great change think be coming to night of course there be nothing so easy a prophesying nothing so inconclusive well will see at present carriage be waiting must be off be still early when arrived at opera house orchestra be just beginning to tune up house be still comparatively empty be beginning to fill rapidly

choose material for choice be there whole of data be before a tannhaeuser chose once so chance have ordained that of must choose same thing called chance ordained that reggie must choose that night there be pause silence after conductor have entered then wooden instrument gave out problem slow deep note of pilgrim march rose fell walking steadfastly on in perilous place weary yet undismayed then

came have gone away ah suppose got tired of be possible to get tired of wagner eva stood up suddenly self control be beginning to break down knowledge of what have happened entire success of own scheme of letting reggie know truth about be being supplanted in own mind by great sense of loss felt reckless at revolt with world intolerably intolerant of position a stood there watching husband leaning on back of chair with photograph of reggie in hand desire to fling truth of at became too strong to resist made quick silent step to side plucked photograph out of hand must not touch that

down on mantelpiece again next gertrude looked at for single second then took girl photograph with sudden ungovernable frenzy tore to bit threw piece in grate wild animal burst of jealousy must not be smothered then went on still speaking rapidly need not be afraid of scandal hayes anything else of sort have broken with reggie for good thought kind good be womanly so wished to know truth about have ever be in love if so will understand shocked horribly by explaining to about tannhaeuser at end of overture suddenly understood what meant got up left box having told that be wicked woman be very fine admired immensely for that sort of thing be rather trying managed to behave decently while play lasted have broken down be there be to tell really know why told at lord hayes listened to wife with much composure dear how very sensational said how very quixotic of must not have thought be capable of quixotism be most remarkable woman think will go to bed new story by paul bourget be reading will seem quite flat after little romance good night eva felt sudden sense that be justified in quiet scorn of how be to be expected reasoned to herself that must behave to a far a in lay otherwise than behaved to regret at have lost be not entirely resentment towards for first time since have known be generous to showed willingness to meet way wait moment said have not quite done paused in uncompromising attitude with hand on handle of door ready for fine return shot eva impulse be strong within spoke blame said assure of that only blame be willing to be very kind to believe be willing still in fact be very sorry for just a be very sorry for wish to make worse for of want to make bad job a good a can be made did not tell have told in order to disgust pain be traveller in same compartment in very tiresome journey called life be inevitably shut in here until be time for one of to get out let quarrel will only make journey worse lord hayes came step closer do find journey called life so tiresome asked must have thought must have enjoyed wish be dead said simply then quite suddenly self control gave way dropped face in sofa cushion sobbed a if heart must break lord hayes be by mean fool saw very plainly what reason for sudden outburst be obviously be not very complimentary to however complimentary might be to closed door quietly sat down in chair little way from have notion of being tender lit cigarette till be again sob grew quieter after while in few minute eva sat up again lord hayes chucked end of cigarette into fireplace dear eva said very calmly quietly know quite well of course what mean be in love with young fellow that quite account for very very extraordinary behaviour mind at assure may be in love with a much a ever like only thing must mind must be scandal on subject feel quite sure that nothing of sort will happen have be very candid to very candid indeed will follow lead know perfectly well that position title wealth be much too dear to to let risk possibility of losing must lose everything by scandal believe must gain anything young man be engaged to girl a say be obviously very good young man will hing must not in case must have to live at boulogne dieppe of hideous little french town among set of second rate people be absurd on face of be sure 'tedious journey called life ' to quote own word again must be much more tedious there for rest fail to see how be to prevent quarrelling never have be wish of mine that must so once more good night eva be sitting up looking at husband with intensity be not pleasant to contemplate felt perhaps for once when met eye looked away again immediately faltered in speech utter entire absence of generosity of anything like manly feeling in what said seemed to eva to be new revelation of meanness like of have never encountered turned left room at last word eva be left sitting there chapter vii mr davenport have spent evening alone husband be away for night reggie a have seen have gone to opera reggie be be not secretive obvious pleasure afternoon at lady hayes invitation did not savour of sweetness of consciously forbidden fruit very frankness a have be mentioned before be capable of dealing unpleasant back hand blow have also dazzling power about like ray from noon day sun render impossible to tell what lie behind though must be very false to describe a partaking of nature of dissimulation seemed to say be not responsible for weakness of eyesight show mystery want of mystery to with heart be at fault if can not form conclusion be to continue metaphor mr davenport must have felt not ungrateful to abatement in brilliance partaking of nature of eclipsed frankness shadow cast on disc by external object at rate must have be glad to take opinion of someone who be possessed of smoked glass natural tendency to observe correctly have known lord hayes must have be exactly individual required be discredit to acuteness that idea never entered head quite apart from impracticability of putting into execution have just dined be glancing through page of novel from mudie when drawing room door opened reggie appeared paused moment when saw mother then advanced into room attempt to look unconcerned contented be singularly unsuccessful mr davenport laid down book frightened ah reggie what be matter have happened reggie turned away from fingered small ornament on mantelpiece nothing said hoarsely came away from opera turned round again knelt by mother chair ask just now said there have be scene came away lady hayes said thing disgusted did think be like mr davenport offered short mental thanksgiving until relief have come have not known how much reggie intimacy with lady hayes have weighed on waited for moment to see if reggie must say more then wo tell more dear must rather not yes want to tell said at dinner told about tannhaeuser venusberg did understand then when overture be played suddenly understood be horrible be wicked if anybody else have said that must simply have thought be very bad form that must mr davenport have not quite realised before how serious be reggie tone even in renunciation of eva be shock to that must say thing repeated reggie when understood must stop there remember very clearly what happened told be wicked woman then came away excessive baldness of narrative struck mr davenport a convincing felt little reassured reggie have not meant to reassure soon undeceived why must have said thing to went on getting up walking about room why if be like must have kept from must have be content to know only half of to have adored that ah mr davenport winced a with sudden spasm of pain then pity for gertrude bred in anger for reggie what do mean said sharply understand in least adored then why not say love did know before said until thing came of course must have gone away be not villain know now adored loved do still yes there be long silence hum of london street came in at open window mr davenport found noticing tiny thing among others reggie have placed ornament have be fingering perilously near edge of mantelpiece in great crisis large reflective thinking power get choked for moment ordinary surface perception be a instinctive unnoticed a breathing be left in command of mind sight of ornament there assumed overwhelming importance to got up from seat put back in safer place then turned to reggie who be standing still in middle of room with back towards sit down here reggie said quietly think have better talk little do quite realise what mean ah talk to like that burst out a if be not in hell already without being reminded of mummy mean that be be good loving know that know be very gentle with wo be angry again mr davenport anxiety for gertrude made very tender ah dear said care for myself be very immaterial that speak like to must be very selfish woman if thought of just now there be others to think of gertrude yes know know what be to do tell will do go to aix said mother promptly go at once go to aix said why be just what must possibly do god know have done gertrude injury enough without insulting waiting here in london be worst insult must do must see that ca do cried know ca how can leave eva lady hayes like mr davenport got up waited moment till voice be more under control when spoke anger vibrated through so strongly that even reggie in almost impenetrable self centred wretchedness be startled have ever occurred to that there be concerned in besides said be aware that gertrude love in way that honour man to be loved do mean to make effort to repair injury have done be man reggie have be boy too long dare say ever loved gerty if treat like now wish to behave like fool what be worse like coward never thought must be ashamed of a will be now if stop in london after what have happened once more there be dead silence mr davenport a knew have played ace of trump have brought to bear strongest motive that must think of to influence reggie if must not listen to because be mother if cared nothing about effect action must have on opinion of knew that there be more to be done by reggie flushed suddenly a if have be struck what good will do if go cried where be to go to ca go to gertrude now place be with said mr davenport if be over between be business to tell wish to tell at once go there wait week be coward think that will be better for putting off what do propose to do in interval to wait here will write to will not answer will pretend that be hers a be yours must not be very honourable position must disgrace bring dishonour on have pride even reggie looked up in amazement disgrace bring dishonour on have never struck that be on verge of doing said mr davenport evidently have not reggie received possibility of with deep perplexity outcome be that said wearily do a like with yes will go ah what be use of going like said mother must go not because wish to because realise mean to act up to fact of going be only symbol that be not quite disloyal yet be to go a if heart be still whole be going to meet gerty to meet to whom promised so much told eva said thing disgusted think of sting into hating oh will not be easy expect will enjoy reggie sat still moment then exclaimed inconsequently be very tired will go to bed yes want to see gerty again very much reggie a have said have only that night realised how much eva have entered into life have not occurred to before to put case candidly to not because wished to shirk conclusion because regarded feeling for gertrude a sufficiently safe to warrant assumption that thing be all right when sudden crash came serious enough at least from point of view for must not help regarding word to eva a formal complete rupture saw exactly where stood be separated from eva be separated from gertrude not by violent wrench by gradual drift of current have not perceived till now have not occurred to to be honest with before eva have be divinely kind to sympathetic eager to share confidence be wonder that in blank gertrude absence made have found pleasure in giving that aforesaid blank became gradually filled with new interest if thought ever have occurred to that image of eva be becoming sort of palimpsest to of gertrude must have denied imputation stoutly perhaps more stoutly because be aware that have not be at pain to find out mr davenport felt when have left that in vague way have expected have be quite aware that be not possible for men to continue being boy indefinitely that there be time for everyone when must ask why do thing why do knew that for reggie that time have come be boy no longer that unconscious youth have moved eva interest then love have gone have awoke from long happy dream to grey convincing morning of reason of claim that must be better man for did not doubt that must not have be man without knew yet be full of regret full of aching thought for day be more be even more poignant when feel for others than when mourn over for reggie have consented to go away be good be there not something left to be done knew from that have called eva wicked woman have left box what then be be feeling on subject if be offended so much better might be induced to say so if worst chance of cared for more than cared for hundred men who be dangling round be there still possibility of making say be offended mother pride protectiveness revolted against notion be worth trying mr davenport have so clearly in mind best solution of problem namely disenchantment of reggie by mean failing that prolonged absence from eva that put pride in pocket remembered perfectly well talk with percy how have felt uneasy at engagement because resembled too much reggie previous escapade surely if be right reggie very curtailed entanglement with eva came under same head let only get away with obvious discouragement from eva let gertrude reassert previous relation unconscious of interruption lady hayes have not passed very good night be on verge of doing very difficult thing be to say doing something directly opposed to inclination in fact be a have told husband in love with reggie davenport such experience be new to very simple day phenomenon be curiously complicated in case happened to be man wife man with whom be in love be about to be girl husband thought with impatience of hundred one story be called realistic because be improbable in woman man cast everything to wind say obey dictate of divine mother of thing because solution be very far from satisfying there be book say that love seeketh not own curiously enough eva found thought straying to short text have be abandoned a untrue by apostle of evolution modern life who say that particular gospel have served time that now know more excellent way have probably never devoted much thought a to whether be modern not be surprised to find so ancient text seemed to represent mood more clearly than le antique hall marked utterance have have breakfast be still sitting in dining room with husband when footman came in bearing card eva looked at pondered then tell mr davenport will see show in here eva got up from place walked up down room be very pale looked anxious worn stopped opposite flower stand in corner put two orchid in front of dress mr davenport be announced remarked that be beautiful morning lord hayes assented have seldom seen before be dressed with extreme care appeared wholly insignificant remembered enormous wealth seemed to to be sort of label to prevent getting quite lost in large world reminded of undelivered parcel waiting for owner to turn up lady hayes sat silent for few minute then turned to husband perhaps must be so good a to go away said in low musical voice a have thing to talk over with friend if like will go upstairs perhaps must be better lord hayes got up with alacrity fact be said be on point of going have business to do be wanting to talk to time later on if must be convenient certainly said eva will see about later dropped eye a addressed sat looking at ground till have left room then said to mr davenport what do want with tone belied curtness of word waited eagerly for answer few moment after have said must see mr davenport be spent in agony to control be hungering for more news from reggie in hand held note have come from by early post made decision doubly difficult be wild absurd production imploring pardon entreating to let know that have forgiven only half coherent eva knew that have really made choice be willing to make choice between gertrude if must only say come be going to aix to day note finished to see gertrude can not send one word to say forgive behaved quite unpardonably mr davenport raised eye to eva face answered bravely have come to talk to about reggie said eva flushed unconsciously closed hand on note held what about be not very happy said mr davenport gently think perhaps can help ah think probably can said eva be glad have come to see be afraid have made mischief be sorry be odd for to be sorry suppose be sign be growing old know for time have be seeing good deal of be fault ought to have stopped last night gave sudden shock only knew one little bit of thought be better eva stopped for voice be trembling mr davenport waited be better continued after moment that must know rest of then when knew called wicked woman went away straight from opera be splendid admired immensely appears be sorry did so have just got note from imploring forgiveness ah foolish boy said mr davenport half involuntarily yes quite agree with see put in difficulty like very much so much that must be sorry to do injury must do injury if allowed to fall in love with again on other hand like well enough to be very sorry not to see again have to choose eva stopped again mr davenport laid hand on hers yes yes said eagerly eva be gradually regaining control over want to be very happy said best chance of happiness be sure be with girl forget name have never seen reggie have spoken of to ought to go to herefordshire wherever be live among daisy with beloved be not made for sort of thing be too good at wish to spoil life girl life mr davenport bent forward again in chair ah eva will do wo be sure be right will be very happy with do write to say be offended make angry pride be a brutal a possible feel brutal said eva be rather hard on ca ca exclaimed suddenly mr davenport saw how matter stood at once paused have not expected complication eva started up a made self betrayal stood with colour rising in cheek furiously angry with wondering how mr davenport must interpret blamed for ever having seen have passed sleepless night nerve be disordered other lady spoke again almost at once saw that made harder for eva saw that only thing to be done be to pretend to have noticed nothing so before silence grew portentous went on with more tenderness in voice yes of course be hard for said be very hard to be unselfish in weary world be worth effort be not that be fond of reggie ought to make easier wish to spoil life a say how did behave last night when came home asked eva suddenly be changed said mr davenport think must see somehow be boy no longer have become man find not pleasant ah be so be said eva be horribly stupid of make easier for be so young somehow have never be be sure be right yes quite sure that make easier for perhaps for doe take thing hard think reggie have known anything before must take hard have be very happy mean will be le happy now for time yes said mr davenport feel sure will be for best be one of people who be made to be happy be sure will have le unhappiness way than if took other course must think about said eva turning walking up down room even a spoke tore reggie letter in half threw piece into grate be hard for be not said stopping in front of mr davenport appears be to be victim reggie looked very like victim last night said other eva looked away did be very unhappy about asked not too unhappy what do mean from what know of said mr davenport especially since sudden change have come if speak now may make whole difference to make angry sore then let go off to aix think gertrude will do rest wonder if will guess what have happened hope not how will hate murmured eva so will reggie be really hard to see what be to gain by arrangement ah go back now entreated mr davenport see have pride left implore to do what ask be very powerful know power too well so doe reggie god help wonder if be really better to be unselfish than selfish mused eva more to herself than to mr davenport to try to do good at be so very short sighted that may be doing worst thing possible who be very ingenious people who did harm when wanted to in order good might follow anyhow if do will not have chosen selfish course suppose there will be imperishable reward for somewhere even so perhaps be really doing selfish thing by doing a ask depends doe on how much like whether like enough to be unselfish whether burden of being selfish must be harder to bear than burden of being unselfish know how little matter to personally said mr davenport will know at least that think have done very noble thing something of not many be capable something be very hard for to do ah understand bit broke out eva assure that one opinion have atom of weight with fear evil report a little a covet good let think for few moment mr davenport be silent hardly heard eva last speech for thought be on possible decision that have not dismissed at once have not refused to see felt be favourable sign eva knew be quite capable in spite of certain intimacy between of having sent message that saw one in morning mr davenport feared cold hard power a feared nothing else in world sat there pale almost trembling while eva passed slowly up down room for few minute at end of one of turn when be by door passed out mr davenport heard step ascending stair waited there while minute hand crept round dial of great bronze clock on mantelpiece be hour before eva appeared again with large unsealed envelope in hand looked very weary a faultlessly beautiful a ever have not sealed said because thought might like to read while be about might a well do handsomely at same time must sooner did not read will neither blame try to dissuade if wish to with be reggie photo one gave need not take will read then will send man with at once a care to look at letter there be reason why must be turned into penny post because son have called wicked woman be quite right by way perfectly right eva stopped suddenly for there be tremor in voice have be there once before at interview will not betray determined biting lip in splendid effort to keep command over there be just one thing must like to ask went on almost at once send line now then to tell about reggie whether be all right between girl liked very much know will never see again suppose mr davenport be much moved have guessed guessed correctly that reggie must not be only sufferer that eva have behaved heroically tear partly of relief partly of gratitude admiration started to eye god bless for what have done whispered can say no more than that tension broke leave quickly cried a large painful sob began to break from throat go at once eva eva cried mr davenport stretching out hand to go go at once cried other turned rapidly from mr davenport without word left room just saw eva sink in arm chair have be occupying before bury face in hand mr davenport closed door quietly went out have left behind knew sorrow greater more desolate than reggie weaker nature must ever know remembered percy prediction that day eva must do something sublimely unselfish must be when fell in love be still only about mid day when left house have purposely said good bye to reggie before went for presupposing success of expedition of reggie knew nothing presence be unnecessary undesirable if on other hand be unsuccessful have determined to go to station meet husband acquaint with state of thing drove about for hour so then changed mind determined to make effort to see reggie before set off arrived home just a be starting met in hall when saw face drew deep breath of satisfaction relief be unmistakably angry be just off be dear said quietly give gertrude love be very brave make effort dear boy will not be easy god bless darling wrote to morning whispered reggie hoarsely a kissed mother will never speak to think of again ah mummy good bye have saved chapter viii after mr davenport have left eva remained in dining room for hour more have chosen choice be not easy seemed to a if struggle came afterwards rather than before letter have written to reggie rose before heart cried to for mercy clear knowledge have arrived at chance of happiness grew in direct relation to remoteness from remained unclouded at moment of hour agony must have reconsidered decision that have so decided be matter of wonder to for be always surprise to find that be better not worse than think investment in unselfishness gave quick return for at present a well knew reggie be a miserable a be sacrifice of two victim called down immediate answer from blessed god in way of sudden cessation of pain when hour be passed went upstairs to husband to see about business have mentioned felt strongly necessity of being active of doing something matter what might possibly take little out of moral nature have to go to bed when be hurt be well to leave there not fidget at bandage to see how be getting on business resolved into affair connected with ironwork at trelso lord hayes told that be going down afternoon must stop night there returning following day eva longing for distraction found none there mother percy be in town drove off fetched back to lunch sight of so well appointed house thought that in measure be part of environment a being mother of mistress always put mr grampound in excellent humour at time bordering on sort of mature playfulness how be little daughter behaving asked lord hayes a soon a be seated at lunch hope be doing credit too of course like way girl behave now be sure do thing must have got dreadfully abused for when be young now one take notice dear eva what lovely piece in middle of table be new be not beauty of be that be very old remarked eva really look so bright fresh talking of brightness freshness met mr davenport other day spoke of great deal a if knew quite well be great friend of eva said husband watching why have come to see to day eva chiefly because left by mail for aix morning said eva asked to say good bye to for lord hayes have satisfaction of believing to be untrue be small compared with complete failure on part to ruffle eva bosom with uneven breath raise slightest tinge of colour to face be quite in love with went on slowly without looking at husband feel quite desolate without hayes must be particularly kind to day though of course must hope to compete with reggie in affection lord hayes smiled took jelly most people know that particular moment experienced at varying distance from dover pier when be not quite sure whether enjoy motion not lord hayes be metaphorically speaking being little tossed about if did not yet think with longing of terra firma be not sorry to remember that must be alone at trelso that evening what beautiful thing be be not said addressing mr grampound when wife repose such confidence in husband that tell be in love with someone else truly there can be secret between such mr grampound tittered shrilly to state truth a eva have done be often surest sometimes only way of producing complete misconception failed to notice acidity in lord hayes face voice thought scene quite too charming percy noticed wondered what shocking thing to say to other cried eva naughty child how can deserve must scold too said turning to son in law reggie have scorned homage altogether continued eva gravely speaking chiefly in order to produce sort of counter irritant to own pain on same principle a on child suffering from toothache may be observed to bite lip have gone off to aix to see fiancee gave photograph be that cruel thing to do own really be most shameless be never so humiliated before think when hayes go away to trelso will take train to aix sit watching hotel window serenade in hotel garden be quite new idea for woman to serenade lover why did never serenade must like to see serenade on cold night under silk umbrella can sing by way 'd have to leave good deal to lute like man in browning who serenaded at villa during thunderstorm mother must approve of serenading must evening fever set in about time think from eleven till two of course damp must matter if have jaeger boot with eight hole in eva naughty girl said mother again yes there be just little too much motion metaphorically speaking lord hayes went below have got to go to trelso afternoon said hear that men be getting more more discontented there be organised body of socialist down there who incite refer to a brutal tyrant what very odd way to spend life know going about country calling name ca think what imagine will get by be rather hard to call brutal tyrant said eva with amusement now if have said so of reggie of for example yes percy may smoke here let go up to top of porch there be tent there be deliciously cool two gentleman stayed behind moment eva mother went on lunch made mr grampound even more effusive than usual do so love to think of here in beautiful house darling said to eva a passed up great marble stair with husband devoted to that charming little scene at lunch so playful delicately touched always be clever dear be such happiness to to think of like yellow collar have on livery be very becoming how much do pay chef ah what charming little room tent make suppose husband often sit here subsided into low chair looked at eva affectionately at rate with air of proud proprietorship be very rich murmured eva have thing that money can buy have title yes what more can want mentally be far away boat got into calais about two thirty have looked out in bradshaw that morning have just left calais going south to join gertrude must be at aix next morning early felt if must only know exactly what effect letter have have on must be more content heart ached for sight of ached with pang of self inflicted wound have sent away irrevocably hoped feared be there be hour at calais remembered on journey to algiers enough to lunch in to buy book in to be rather bored in there be ah curtain separated little tent from drawing room be drawn aside a have often seen drawn aside lately when said be not at home to visitor lord hayes entered have come to say good bye said must be leaving at once for station will be back to morrow eva soon after lunch expect be dining with davenport ah yes have forgotten said good bye will see to morrow what be going to do afternoon inquired mother after have kissed hand to lord hayes a drove off be going to wimbleton house there be garden party be bore promised to go eva paused to see sudden alacrity with knew mother must receive news before added perhaps must like to come with must enjoy very much said mother be so fond of garden party do so well there did know that knew duchess remarked eva let subject drop returned home dined alone spent long evening upstairs in room reviewed again minutely from beginning not because wanted to think of because must not avoid event of last week be a if sudden light have burst in upon soul showing what be meant by love then just a comprehended exigency of very nature compulsion be under to reveal that second compulsion must not allow to do for reggie anything what sober reason told be best for have left face to face with horrible blankness spring have broken out must never felt cease to flow stood there with mouth gagged unable to drink of coolness in heart believed that even now if wrote one word to come in two day must be with longing firm renunciation seemed indivisible must no more have apostatised on renunciation than must have compelled to be quit of love nature be of too large serene type for to feel again that one outburst of jealousy when have torn gertrude photograph in half at moment worst side of heart have leapt out tigress element animal within have raised that one howl of anguish after that have lain still cowed to deeper pain of in be human divine at moment of renunciation light have shone on darkness though darkness comprehended not wondered be still when in light saw decided what course must for reason take animal did not venture even to lift head growl reader be burning to tell that suffering on part of eva reggie even if allow such very proper chastening for lax self indulgence with slid into mutual position now occupy be subject fit to be treated of at in moral christian country whether hold might a well describe infliction of cat o ' nine tail on righteously condemned convict for well defined properly chastened offence that suffering be perfectly well merited that have eva be woman of even decent moral principle have reggie not be subject to calviest of calf love must never have happened that above be particularly fault plead guilty to indictment rather put in defence for prisoner be same thing admit that eva be not according to best light doubt be judging by woman of decent moral principle that be tenable view that infatuation of reggie be only calf love last remember for have told that be boy no longer above admit that be particularly fault now with regard to eva moral be judging imagine by own standard after be only standard by one man can judge one can judge by other men standard whether be lower than own higher result be loss of moral perspective can not take observation except by applying eye straight to telescope if stand above squint will obtain incorrect idea of what wish to see in addition to venturing to assume that judge by own standard will go further assume broadly what standard be have noticed that when people a for sake of argument have made do refer to moral principle refer to code may vary in magnitude comprehensiveness be based on one principle avoidance even in thought of certain thing regard instinctively almost hysterically a being impossible because be wrong moral principle very seldom go so far a to say be wrong stop short at impossible be contrary to nature be enough eva be afraid have moral at of kind to take exaggerated instance be afraid if truth be known vitally essentially kept hand from picking stealing not because be wrong because did not want thing might have stolen be very shocking confession be driving principle home to admit serf to illustrate under distorting at rate very high power lens difference between again

have omitted to put down to warm for lord give rise to recrimination perhaps few silent tear to pang of remorse for wrong done can never undo what be there of be wholly guiltless supremely suffering babe unborn innocent utterly milk water heroine of severely classic romance be not common in dingy work day world must be presumptuous in to say doe not exist have never seen yet be very beautiful ennobling conception always get full reward in last chapter where be joined to only love life happily ever afterwards sometimes be seen again in epilogue surrounded by group of golden haired clean limbed child with father pensive eye who utter sentiment must fill maternal heart with pride joy ineffable have never even in beautiful epilogue be faced by grey shadowy doubt that life be not quite like even villain have good point heroine bad one virtue doe not always bring so full reward vice be not discomfited with sublime completeness in word that human nature be much more complex more subtlely compounded than epilogue must indicate that nature capable of sublime action be also capable of one of many fall in with moral principle that something be to be said even for villain eva maintain though not heroine though bank of ineffable joy have not given blank cheque to be filled up at pleasure be not villain have done something right minded person must approve in allowing to fall in love with reggie in allowing to fall in love with what be more have done something short sighted not knowing nature of love have tried to play with perplexing emotion be finding now that be not

control got up walked to window sun be just setting over lawn strolled tall figure preceded by still taller shadow reggie eye be bent to ground walked up close to verandah without seeing sight of familiar best loved figure produced mood in gertrude watched silently for time then said to herself under breath pray god let love very much then aloud reggie at sound of name looked up saw come in here minute said have something to tell reggie nodded assent came along verandah until reached low french window opening on to come in said gertrude be princess room be here sit down there gertrude paused paper have just come said at length there be something have read wish to tell reggie affect very deeply have just read lord hayes be dead ah god exclamation burst from involuntarily must have

swallowed bitter draught moment afterwards saw that have told more convincingly than have done even afternoon for saw realized to full ah gerty what can do said when silence have become unbearable know how be with how can help wish be dead though gate of hell be yawning to receive did not wish be dead two month ago said with flash of scorn not even though gate of heaven be open to receive be not so easily contented now reggie looked piteously at know deserve must say of much more than ever must be brute villain deserve to be shot yet did not speak like afternoon be glad have said though feel guilty god know be not so bad a not to feel thankful for punishment let say good bye now said gertrude will not meet again like held out hand to volunteered more intimate embrace grasped held for moment let drop even touch of hand have be something sacred before to felt there be something dead between hand be a to gertrude rush of memory be too great strength have be too severely taxed already ah reggie cried do leave like god help said too reggie darling cried suddenly will that woman stand between did not promise love where be promise be dream come to again a be once did not love anyone said once told disliked wicked people what have happened to word of yours be not true be pity if be not for have written on heart ah darling darling threw arm round in last embrace reggie dear

enough now go leave by good bye dear good bye went with on to verandah where dusk be already falling a soon a be outside room turned quickly from went back closing glass door after chapter iii lord hayes be buried with father forefather in little churchyard at hayes after funeral eva came back again to london house mr grampound came to see occasionally be tearful voluble must hardly conceal satisfaction at handsome settlement lord hayes have made on widow so thoughtful of must say wiping eye to leave london house for life knew that must not do without few month in london year villa at algiers too for winter in memory of honeymoon so unselfish mr grampound seemed to think that lordship disembodied spirit might have preferred to keep villa at algiers to that fact that have left to widow seemed to imply that renounced right of visiting particular glimpse of moon eva assented with ghost of smile a impossible interpretation occurred to reggie letter to mr davenport telling that engagement with gertrude have be broken off have arrived be not very pleasant reading mentioned that be prior to news of lord hayes death that be coming back to england with old frankness said that have written to eva letter of sympathy on husband death if reggie letter gave pain to mr davenport not to mention gertrude be not altogether happy just now surely there be corresponding balance somewhere eva for instance thing be taking fresh turn be not for husband be just dead be true though loss of husband be not in general way matter for congratulation case be little exceptional morning letter have come for from someone be very fond of saying few word for sake of decency few other word for sake of decency have better have be left unsaid reggie have told eva that be over between gertrude that be coming back to london letter ended almost imperiously will come to see will see yet be not owner of balance of happiness to make square how be eva be very conscious a sat with reggie letter in hand why be not happy reggie be coming to offer body soul to there be nothing in world that desired to give body soul to seemed very simple unfortunately be only more impossible have decided only week ago that be happier must be happier with than with knew knew be convinced of by instinct reasoning alike seemed to that there be nothing knew except that certain dull remorse when thought of moment when have found thing have be husband lying like broken doll in dark room wished have made more of bad job be so weak so inadequate surely have not be worth while to spar with one so immeasurably inferior have be very kind to a kind a must let have be like little dog have be purely amiable at first have got to snap instinctively when be approached from certainty that be going to be teased recalled that shrinking hunted look that have seen so often on face when have snapped at have turned on with whip to do justice provocation at rate challenge have usually be on side after must not have be better so many time to have let pas not to have slashed so savagely ah well be dead eva envied now for road to happiness be a impassable a ever husband death have made difference to knew that reggie best chance of happiness be not with with unfortunately for eva found that fact must not be overlooked necessity of securing happiness came first be most essential part of love for impossibility have felt on morning after have seen tannhaeuser rather heard overture together of doing anything be not for best of happiness a far a in in sober judgment lay remained a impossible a ever existence of husband felt then be altogether smaller matter if have felt good that reggie must love one must have be content to go on living a have lived before seeing other in ball room in crowded dining room in publicity just touching hand just reading that secret knowledge in eye knew that must have waited indefinitely a blissfully a herself knowledge of herself rendered that impossible be impossible still surely be very hard did not ask for much little be infinitely impossible meanwhile hour be bringing reggie closer to london closer to will come see will see word rang in head till seemed whole air held nothing imperious note first have heard from be terribly dear to a be to men woman when one love command long to do be changed mr davenport have said have become man eva felt in word that change have come spoke to a man to woman pleaded no longer demanded announced claim pictured coming to bold in assurance of love be mine must say be mine be yours let come away together ah will come dare not say 'no ' against sight of sound of voice touch of hand eva knew must be powerless impossibility on dwelt must sink well knew into nothing by side of one great impossibility that of resisting claim when came to seek have surely nothing on earth not duty unselfishness wisdom be so strong a love soft delicate winged love strove wept only smiled smiled until claim claim in full be willingly poured into outstretched hand eva rose from where have be sitting walked upland down room dressed in black from head to foot looked like image of despair looked round room not hers felt be chair where used to sit last day have be there have pushed back into window have sat in sun because said have cold have be smoking cigarette have put down on window sill where have made paint blister burn have brought little benares ware ash tray to put in after ah there be ash tray with stump of cigarette still in servant ought to have cleared away yet well perhaps be too small to notice in case must not speak about on whole must speak about rang bell must dust room more carefully said to man that cigarette end have be there week after did not matter added a took ash tray up leave where be let room be dusted more carefully time poor momentous little cigarette end will see will ah will not eva who have always felt so strong be suddenly weak if knew that be there be waiting to know if must see how must say must not see if saw how must not yield be impossible impossible meanwhile have day night in to decide what to do must not be in london till to morrow morning many thing may happen in day night might go away away somewhere where must never know must never follow where in world be that where must not follow perhaps nowhere in world out of world somewhere perhaps perhaps there be piece of green unturned grass next grave where husband lay in peaceful churchyard where tree sang low together in wind how must do to go there to be quite quiet at last perchance to dream yes surely if dreamed at must dream of reggie one might do worse thought than dream of how odd that have not thought of before be so very simple so very satisfactory only cared for one thing in world that must not have so why wait here must never know must spoil must never even suspect eva have intense horror of anything like melodrama wished everything to be a natural a possible if only must hire madman from lunatic asylum to shoot shooting must not do be noisy messy hundred thing must not be surely doctor knew plenty of way by one must glide quietly out of world without suspicion knew so many ingenious device by can keep in world that must know to let out clean soothing drug presented trace at post mortem diagnosis be word be not eva smiled when pictured going to doctor asking for drug of description suspicious mind might perhaps attach undue importance to visit if made few hour before death what fool people be eva pondered till after moment sudden thought struck be not suicide of kind more misleading to to to whom wished to be misleading than death from apparently natural cause husband have died four day before nominally be more le broken hearted widow to reggie at least broken hearted enough for be part of concealment have practised to to hide relation with husband when decided to let know rest of be side issue have not shown must not self sought death of heart broken widow be most complete disguise to action far more complete than clumsy death by pistol overdoses be always good thing to add detail thought eva to herself worst of be that such death be somewhat melodramatic when actor quits board for ever may be excusable that make one concession in spite of own distaste to set audience in roar yes must have so lord hayes used to dabble in chemistry in amateur way eva remembered showing in laboratory at little bottle full of harmless looking liquid smell of reminded at first of soft cool peach afterwards of almond icing on top of wedding cake have told that be prussic acid that one drop of on tongue must kill man remembered incident clearly because when smelled have shuddered have thought of own wedding cake bottle be sure to be there still stood on second shelf to right a opened door of laboratory have large red label on be curious how accurately whole thing came back to bottle be at aston be buried in churchyard there regretted necessity of melodrama must not be alive to regret afterwards eva have fear only longing to get over to be quite sure that nothing must stop carrying out intention of putting out of reach of loved must go down to aston afternoon meanwhile there be three four hour to be spent in london well there be very few preparation to make when take longest journey of there be packing to be done arrangement to be made a when go away for three day visit arrangement be made for death provides with excellent courier who will forget nothing there be just two note wished to write one to mr davenport saying that have heard from reggie to say be coming back to london that wished to see that have given conge once for have intention of seeing that must save trouble if mr davenport must communicate to be not very easy note to write for many reason other be even harder be to gertrude carston ran a follows will wonder what of woman in world can have to say to resent writing till have read have done cruel wrong be sorry for allowed reggie davenport to fall in love with when might have stopped if have cared for must have be different for husband be dead must have married in case must not have be sorry a be now never cared for at did thoughtlessly a far a have motive at because amused husband be only man ever cared for be dead wish be dead too be poor amends can make promise will never see reggie davenport again be very patient with will love a well a love know be not little will come back to will not hate then wish must have seen to tell thing think must have believed must ask to believe now will have heard of husband death may never know what that mean if like show mr davenport what have written to will be good that must know never cared for be not so bad a think did best to stop caring for when saw tannhaeuser together went away to know next morning hoped that must have be end perhaps if saw must be sorry for now above remember will come back to will be with a if have never come between fault be mine cast up to letter took time in writing be not easy to write when be done eva closed for fear of drawing back sent off at once to post longed to finish one of thing lay before to do so that must not go back from finishing be afraid of being weak not from fear of death be far easier to die than to live with impassable barrier between happiness arrived at aston about four o'clock have sent telegram to house saying that be coming for few night carriage be at station to meet went first of to little laboratory opening off what have be husband study found that have remembered place where bottle stood with red label uncorked to make sure be right yes almond on top of wedding cake wedding cake be exactly that smell then drew black veil over face went out again there be certain grimly comic detail have determined to go through in order to lend probability to act with purpose went into hothouse gardener who be working saw pick armful of delicate orchid white lily tore plant up like one possessed with load of sweet smelling whiteness saw go down path led to churchyard there be several loiterer there among old sexton who remembered afterwards that lady dressed in black scattered mass of flower over lord hayes grave then threw down on fresh turned earth lay there for hour might have be more knew to be lady hayes when went away for dusk be falling left still there when sexton have gone eva got up one scene more of weary farce said half aloud ah reggie reggie may never know in gloaming went back to tall house standing stately among terrace garden bed sun have sunk only in west be great splash of crimson nightingale be singing in elm tree white winged moth fluttered about over flower bed a entered turned once more to look over peaceful unconscious earth river lay like chain of crimson pool among tree below meadow on far bank be brown faced country lad fishing nearer in hayfield be few belated labourer returning from work across river must see red wall of old home flower bed gleaming in light of sunken sun then for first moment sudden spasm of regret of longing of horror for what be going to do came over must have be better to have finished that last act at grave unaccountable repugnance to being found by first passer by have prevented next moment have swept away surely be not going to turn coward now turned
