swarmed up wall of house be too strongly solidly made to stir even to vibration produced by earthquaking motor bus bounced down park lane thus dancer dancing in tune have effect on stalwart ivy be indeed sort of symbol of solidity of fortune of house for be made at manufactory from husband derived really american wealth covered acre of ground at sheffield from door vomited forth sort of metallic hardware of most reliable quality imitation ivy of course be froth chance flotsam on stream of hardware be due to inventive genius of mr osborne eldest son percy who have great deal of taste be abstruse taste like appreciation of caviare strauss required educated a others might say vitiated palate jaded ear appealed strongly almost overwhelmingly to judge by order book of art department to eye of general public go in for form of decoration be known a chaste handsome be catholic enough to include mirror framed in plush on be painted bunch of flower bead curtain hang over door with shrewd commercial instinct percy never attempted to educate taste of customer into what ought to want gave in handsome catalogue list of thing did want of quality that must be sure to find satisfactory though ivy for instance be from excellence of workmanship elaborate nature of colouring rather expensive be practically indestructible till melting point of best tin be reached resembled ivy so closely that might perfectly well prick finger on before found out art so closely imitated nature indeed before now very pretty jesting have taken place in window of house with regard to when percy who liked joke amid scarcely suppressed merriment of family asked stranger to pick leaf of examine beauty of nature a illustrated in manner in stalk of leaf be joined to parent stem also have

well held large quantity of gilt edged stock have family history whatever in one point only be unlike ivy clung to limestone wall of house in park lane be important one point of ivy be to deceive be often successful in so doing while osborne never intended to deceive anybody there be with regard at rate to mr osborne husband percy possibility of being taken in must see at once what be like glance must save subsequent disappointment surprise one may be added at once ever pricked finger over be a kind a be new since many strain of blood have gone to making of member of human race one strain prospering predominating in specimen while in though of same blood scarcely show trace of existence divergence of type even in one generation be often very marked indeed thus though mr osborne felt that understood admired eldest son admiration for younger be agreeably tempered with mystification old claudes rum fellow often said mr osborne agreed with a will be seen there be still much in common between claude house like ivy be also new solid in point of fact none of inhabitant again with curious exception of claude be quite used to yet concealed a far a be able concealment really went little further than fact that did not openly allude to agreed that house be very handsome mr osborne have secret gratification not unmingled with occasional thrill of misgiving a to whether have wasted money in knowledge of frightful costliness of outside a have be said be of gothic design if guest thought that be to pas evening listen to music in gothic interior must have be rudely undeceived have be unkindly said that went through gothic door to find vandal within if vandalism includes appropriation of beautiful thing vandalism exhibited here be very complete destructive side of vandalism have counterpart mr osborne be very careful of beautiful thing very proud of admired in proportion to expensiveness having excellent head for figure must remember how much more important picture article of furniture tapestry have stood in ran risk of forgetting item for kept green in memory by often speaking of to guest yes must say there three thousand pound worth of seating accommodation in very drawing room tell twas lucky to have got suite at figure louis louis per boy did tell be louis xv xvi sixteenth yes louis xvi divide up youll find that average two hundred pound chair seems funny to sit on two hundred pound hey mr osborne said bright thing about sit firm then said youll keep safe furnishing appointment of house have in fact be entrusted to notable firm though have certainly charged mr osborne great deal of money for what supplied have given very good for cheque wife after have got over unusual feeling of sitting on two hundred pound if chose putting foot up on two hundred be quite content that furniture of louis xvi room for instance cheque for must be what called little stiff be same in italian room opened out of matter be better in dining room be furnished with chippendale here indeed very dreadful accident have happened on first evening that have got into house now two month ago for mr osborne alone with percy wife for night have drawn chair up to fire

occupant have crashed into splinter deposited mr osborne on floor second glass of port on shirt front have taken incident with great good humour live learn have said live learn got to sit up behave now maria per boy dont finish port while dad change shirt drink fair for fair play jewel fill mother glass mr osborne must never have attained to eminence occupied a manufacturer of hardware have not be man of intelligence instead of upbraiding furnishing firm for charging so high price for four leg of carved dry rot momentary irritation carefully kept to might have led to do drew lesson that be unwise to tilt chair unless be clearly tiltable accident have caused to insist on own room called snuggery being furnished a chose not a anybody else chose here rejoiced in chair of pattern known a chesterfield solid mahogany table on stood telephone broad firm mantel shelf where must put box of cigar without fear of overbalancing on point also wife have adopted similar attitude own sitting room opening out of white furnished bedroom where be afraid to touch anything for fear of soiling be thoroughly to taste a in husband snuggery have matter arranged for own comfort not for other people admiration percy have done room for sometimes when came up here to look at letter before going to bed drink glass of hot water be so excellent digestive after dinner be still little curious to wondered whether percy did not understand house furnishing better than great french firm name of be always rather shy of pronouncing have asked to choose furniture remarking only that be little rheumatic found difficult to get out of very low chair have succeeded to admiration not only have consulted comfort have divined satisfied taste paper of wall be pattern of fern with iridescent lily

rich enough to give emerald necklace to remind of colour of sea be true that emerald be remarkably fine be not exactly of tint that nature have given to sea very vivid artist have reproduced in painting hung on wall still reminded edward of enchanted week in cornwall be seldom when wore emerald that did not say mr o have got land end emerald on to night then more often than not must follow explanation of cryptic remark whispered information of how much emerald have cost mr osborne a matter of fact have overheard again again what figure be be still officially ignorant of generally closed subject by saying mr osborne wont never tell what paid for believe got cheap thats why secretly rejoiced to know that be not reason reason be just opposite have be so enormously expensive that expense

september during month have worn emerald evening have be sort of renewal of honeymoon though have not be able to go away have managed to send percy claude to seaside two month in sheffield when night wore emerald have be cause of remaining there be still one of mr osborne most delightful memory a sort of renewed honeymoon since then time have considerably changed though to many change from simplicity of life not uncomfortable narrowness of mean to wider horizon rapid accumulation of enormous fortune brings within view implies loss of happiness rather than extension of edward be of arcadian build immensely enjoyed wider horizon humble establishment with parlour maid have be very well how much more enjoyable be brownstone house on outskirt of sheffield with footman carriage for mr osborne did not find in least interfered with happiness to have men to manage richer thing to eat a matter of fact liked managing rejoiced in building of new wing to brown stone house in acquisition of motor car in drain on time resource by edward being made mayor of sheffield neither of ever thought that have be happier when mean be more straitened establishment humbler of in spite of essential innate simplicity of nature rejoiced in establishment be always ready to enlarge embellish rejoice have always made most of current resource though in merely financial sense have always

wholly satisfactory for though mr osborne have morning post brought up to room with early tea while young man be there in order that might be up to date with movement doings of nobility have extraordinarily bad luck since bankruptcy case be going on be concerned with affair of sister husband memorial service at st james proved to be coincident with obsequies of great uncle mr osborne felt that thing must not happen when be in midst of everything in town so momentous decision have be made two strenuous year have followed during time mr osborne have settled to adopt a became man of

doorway of ballroom without being able to get in to dance if did though a have be stated year have be strenuous struggle continuous mr osborne husband ever felt that be losing game that be playing apart from one defeat in conservative interest one dismal attempt at dance in house that have taken before be ready to eight men came told counting percy have swiftly steadily mounted for true to principle on husband have amassed so large fortune mr osborne offered be of very best at rate of sort momentarily most attracted singer who be most in vogue sang at concert heel be most admired danced there beyond doubt extreme pleasure that excellent woman took in own hospitality contributed largely to success be careworn anxious eyed hostess bubbled with good humour be genuinely glad to see world fill room always welcomed suggestion that guest must bring friend whose name be instantly entered by admirable secretary on visiting list thus rose prospered till on date at story open have crowned work of season by giving immense fancy dress ball to give due have whipped up again to full activity rather moribund energy of season somehow idea have taken on at once there have be no fancy dress function of importance that season by one of whim govern flow ebb of social world london have thrown with avidity into notion be soon clear that everyone must be there everyone be at last in own house mr osborne heard strain of national anthem have be of particular period point be not to have strict classical function amount of jewel fine dress queen of sheba cleopatra marie antoinettes joined hand in quadrille with napoleon pier gaveston henry viii have be admirable mistress page husband veritable merry knight of brilliant figure in motley crowd there be none perhaps more admired than slim dark pier gaveston be claude chapter ii dora west be trimming hat be straw hat have cost shilling two when came into deft hand trimming must only prove to have cost shilling two when became attached to hat leaving deft hand be put onto extremely pretty head by time hat must certainly have become very pretty hat be explaining with great volubility to friend be rich darling may said in consequence attitude toward hat be little opulent vulgar can put feather flag bird egg in exactly same place a biondinetti whoever be who sell hat not exactly said mary with quietness real conviction brings be quite certain about point so did not care to shout over be only when people be not certain about what say that drown want of conviction in argument conviction always swim dora have several pin in mouth so did not reply at once in pin reason be excellent more excellent be fact that did not wish to reply knowing quiet truth of mary conviction especially since must not settle exact angle at very large white feather must be put pierced hat once inward once outward be biondinetti over where in heaven name ought to start from so only made little impatient noise with lip even be difficult since there be danger of causing pin to be sucked into mouth made successfully poised feather moment focussing appearance against hat effect produced by impatient noise be sufficient to ensure against immediate reply then suddenly inspiration came with pair of tiny scissors cut strand two in straw stuck quill through hole there said pay biondinetti two guinea for doing cant wouldnt if must austell wrote to last week said swan be moulting telegraphed that cost sixpence little thought instead of two guinea to tell to send big wing feather he dreadful as know that have sense to see wanted feather to catch swan pluck what disgusting butcher said may dont mean butcher mean vivisectionist how do think get feather darling asked dora dont know never ask hat come from shop then dont ask now because will tell horrid shop have bird killed then pluck doe cant deny whereas with swan be just moulting austell assisted nature do caught head in landing net tried to peck say dora west stopped suddenly in middle of surprising remark held out hat at arm length in order to observe effect of feather have one of enchanting face be overwhelmingly pretty for particular reason must if chose argue prettiness away by maintaining with justification that single feature on have warrantable claim be passable be true be not clear how came about that sum of be so delicious eye be gray have nothing striking to recommend nose turned up at tip far too markedly to be able to claim beauty mouth be quite certainly too large yet even allowing for charm of extreme youth vigour vividness of vitality there be accounting for supreme prettiness be there so sensible thing be to stop arguing look at again more sensible yet to say something must make laugh for laugh be most enchanting thing of then feature laughed there be telling where began where ended may before now have declared that from quite distance off when doras back be turned have in ballroom seen be amused because back of neck shoulder be laughing so much oh nature want lot of assistance went on be perfectly hopeless if leave to herself look at flower even be nicest thing doe rose for instance must think of in way of rose be ordinary wild dog rose dont say be bad how paltry if have have simply million of year to invent rose in then man come along who be only really unnatural being in quite few year invents heavenly rose see now of course nature did in sense did with assistance why do call man unnatural asked may why because saw at once how stupid nature be have to invent thing make life tolerable lit fire built house made law motor car shop boat button hook motor car too nature must think of in way of locomotion be horse feather be inserted in absolutely right place dora breathed heavy sigh of satisfaction laid hat down on end of sofa hovered over tea table for moment selected enormous bun nature give brain continued with mouth full moment begin to use a have be doing over hat be biondinetti decree that will be so hungry that have to stop eat instead same with talking give tongue to talk with after quite few minute talking make hungry too have to use tongue to help to swallow did know swallowed with tongue darling never did till yesterday thought swallowed with throat apparently tongue help thats why cant talk with mouth full a be doing may thurston looked at hat on end of sofa for while then transferred gaze to friend dont think agree with said at least allow many people dont know what being natural mean think nicest people be natural for instance mr osborne last night at dance never before have seen hostess really enjoying at own ball stood at top of stair beamed danced beamed never before have seen person like mr osborne dance remarked dora well not often anyhow enjoyed tremendously be perfectly natural dora shook head wont do darling said allow that mr osborne beamed time enjoyed enormously why because everybody be there be ever so much pleased at sheffield do suppose wherever be came from be sure be not last night be pleased because duchess marchioness who count at be there a well a heap that dont count at shes snob probably finest ever seen by what process of reasoning arrive at fact that snob be natural be beyond agree that heap of nice people be snob snobbishness be in most artificial quality of artificial age snob be crowning passionate protest against nature oh well said may in deprecation of rather lengthy harangue didnt mean to rouse dora daresay not in case have done so without meaning really when say that mr osborne be natural be bound to protest might a well say that mother be oh mightnt said may quite calmly must be simply silly to call mother natural only doe thing because be thing spends whole life in doing thing yet dont know oh dora what very odd people woman be when grow up will be a odd do think love mother so do of love yours dont be very very odd people dora gave little shriek of laughter oh dont said want to talk about snob little more well im sure youve often told that mother be one remarked may yes darling be isnt be most delicious sort of snob month ago wouldnt know osborne merely said have doubt be very honest people with nose at same angle toward earth a be matterhorn while week ago be clamouring for invitation to dance last night in interval have become thing to know osborne mother saw be going to be thing to know long ago called at park lane almost before have washed white blob of paint off window hung up shield of heraldic glass on stair oh be there heraldic glass on stair asked may in slightly awe struck tone never saw dora a friend often declared really did not always play fair there have quite distinctly be satirical note in own allusion to heraldic glass a soon a may reflected that in appreciative reverence of reply dora be down upon at once why shouldnt have heraldic glass a much a people mine asked smartly theyve got exactly a many grandfather grandmother a have there not slightest reason to doubt that mr osborne be miss parkins mr parkinss heir who expect be far more respectable than mother father who drank to death though mother always call cerebral hmorrhage oh may be snob im not sure worst snobbishness of isnt shown by who say came over with conqueror be descended from edward fourth probably osborne didnt come over with conqueror be here long before only dont happen to know who be know be just said may calmly dont know who be yet put up coat of arm dora looked at friend in contempt suppose think have scored over said not in least be only pointing out perfectly obvious thing then why do said dora what be pointing out be not perfectly obvious thing at least appear not to be to whole affair be game star garter ancestor coat of arm be game oh dont say that isnt great fun be absurd to take seriously what can matter to whether great grandpapa be peer bootblack only amuses to think that be peer if amuses mr osborne to think that mr parkins have coat of arm at why shouldnt put up in hall window since a said be only child of course quarter with osborne arm one of rule believe be jealous of because be richer than horrid family nothing ever roused may except practical assault upon personal comfort dora seldom attempted to rouse be invariably hopeless present attempt only added to list of failure think be partly true said may dont see why common people must have best of everything only have to invent button razor life offer be theirs think deplorable doesnt make angry more than wet day make angry unless be absolutely caught in rain with new hat a to coat of arm thing think be rather pleasant to know one grandfather be gentleman dora waved arm wildly probably wasnt screamed mine wasnt be wicked one know did awful thing much worse than mr osborne probably ever dreamed of mr osborne great grandfather must certainly have cut mine if have have chance have have chance remarked may also mr osborne must cut nobody who must must lend lustre to house oh dora let stop isnt good be democrat radical socialist really doesnt matter besides havent seen for oh well nearly twenty four hour what have happened dora got up dont think can stop said because want to know what really think about certain thing two head be better than one know even when mine be one of oh by way austell have let grote to osborne have taken for seven year from end of july be mother doing think oh may may call radical socialist anything else choose cant quite see mr osborne there shell fill with plush know will after expect mother be right suppose be better to pay of debt have other people putting plush monkey into house than go on a austell have be doing expect must be just same if be son instead of brother doesnt seem to matter much what one brother doe a long a doesnt wear hair long cheat at card daresay different if he son dora gave great sigh be silent in spite of series of statement have led may thurston quite reasonably to call radical socialist there be feeling within rather more intimate rather more that made dislike idea of osborne living in grote have always be home austell finance especially for past two three year

mood like when dived down from froth effervescence of surface mind sat below in deep remote water be not that have lost power of living on surface for afternoon with friend have be quite completely there until toward end of talk have felt that be being beckoned down again knew that when may left must sink into depth till lately have not known existed yet path have led to have be quite natural life have above thing loved beauty whether of wave bird sunset human being thus be without sense of strange unusual thing happening to that have admired frankly naturally dark merry face of young man have taken into dinner once twice have danced with half dozen time then suddenly quite unexpectedly belonged to surface of thing no longer a far a be concerned something smote at heart flower bird

sound detached made very clear to ear be motor just preparing to start somewhere close below in street dora feeling instinctively somehow that be significant to got up leaned out of window instinct be correct enough big short broad man with extremely shiny top hat be just stepping into big napier car stood at mother door even a looked out chauffeur nipped into place again in answer to footman inquiry heard mr osborne say ome quite distinctly then lifted shiny hat carefully wiped top of bald head upon dora have doubt in reaction from really serious half hour of thought slight fit of giggle giggle soon stopped be of nature of coming to surface to breathe be already beginning to sink back toward depth again when there came tap at door mother entered lady austell be very tall one felt at once that there be not slightest doubt that be not countess seemed somehow far too suitable thing to have really occurred in endless surprise of world in everything unconjecturable happens everyone be what must not be ideally fit thing have occurred countess be in spite of obviousness of fact that must be that be dowager be le easy guess for though eighteen year have elapsed since husband death there be something about dress little strip of crape insertion in violet of gown may be absence of jewel except amethyst cross at other time cap very dutch becoming with ribbon of black in that sat loosely on abundant hair suggested though did not notify widowhood insignia must be noted did not wear simultaneously there be never day on one at least of others like be not present doubt also manner gave confirmation to impression conveyed by dress for be one from exuberance have departed though suggested reminded like clear sunset that brilliant day have preceded voice also be rather faint regretful voice of widow with unsatisfactory son unmarried daughter who knew best have in mind very distinct knowledge that be difficult if not impossible to silence faint voice make say anything different to what have already said lady austell when view be in conflict with of others never said very much never changed tune indeed ceased faintly chanting until opposition have be borne down by quiet persistence a for regretfulness of gentle accent be full may have be composed of grief for fact that others not must eventually be obliged to yield will be seen therefore that theresa austell be instance more of undoubted fact people a well a thing be not what seem seemed until knew quite well to live uncomplainingly regretfully among memory of dead happier year whereas when acquaintance with ripened must find that lived with remarkable keenness in present kept wide unwavering eye on live happier future appeared to be soft gentle helpless in reality be remarkably capable of taking care of herself though like ivy appeared to cling to others for support nature be in truth that of famous ivy grew on new mansion in park lane must stand upright with perfect ease be of metallic hardness adversity for have not have very happy life instead of breaking have tempered to exceeding toughness what have be at most soft iron be now reliable steel gave faint wan smile at dora a entered thought must be here dear said aunt adeline have telephoned to know if want motor can have till dinner time will then take to house knew liked drive so thanked said yes be merely way of putting fact that lady austell wanted drive also wanted to talk to dora method of putting sounded better be very likely quite true dora did like drive since mother knew might possibly have be reason why accepted aunt adelines offer lady austells next reason though have already given reason sufficient be not so probable drive will do good dear said faintly look little fagged out pale dora have learned not to dispute point with mother though in general be so full of discursive volubility be always rather silent with lady austell of whom in way that scarcely understood be considerably afraid again be typical of effect mother produced on people who knew slightly thought be least formidable of woman better be known more be feared often dora argued to herself about matter knew that be not afraid of anything tangible mother must do to her must not beat starve ill treat must have be mother nature of be afraid feeling be analogous to child fear of dark fear not what know of unknown possibility may lurk therein can not say what be if knew must probably cease to fear dora got up at once yes must like drive said then put on hat dear lady austells pale melancholy eye fell on half trimmed straw hat dora asked must have thought what have must have lasted till end of season at word doras pleasure in new hat fell a dead a sisera at jaels foot nobody must kill pleasure though quite innocently with so unerring aim a lady austell didnt cost twopence said dora jim sent up feather from grote lady austell looked at straw with experienced eye be very cheap for le than twopence remarked only question be whether be necessary then will join down below dear have note to write may a well leave instead of posting be illustrative of cause have made dora say that when woman grew up be very odd people lady austell must unfalteringly drive through mile of odious road to deliver note rather than post must on same day drive to oxford street two shilling fare in hansom in order to purchase what must have paid sixpence more for round corner be victim of habit of petty economy in pursuit of passion one of most fatal must become perfect spendthrift casting florin half crown right left in order to save penny took great care of penny half crown presumably took care of for at rate took care of when other people expenditure be concerned took care of note have to be left concerned cessation of subscription from library in leicester square caused to traverse length of piccadilly to retrace before must leave jostling traffic turn into park so happened that in traverse of street month being mid july hour late afternoon lady austell have be almost incessantly occupied though by own word disliked conventionality in smiling sadly regretfully a be manner at people knew bowing without smile to who appeared to know somehow smile even when be most gracious welcoming always suggested to person on whom be bestowed that something have gone wrong with affair lady austell knew be most sympathetic so mr osborne seated in landau bobbed prodigiously owing to extreme resilience of spring came from husband workshop receiving one of felt certain for moment mr o mission afternoon have not prospered until remembered that have seen lady austell smile like before soon after walking gaily eastward came austell whom have thought to be still in country on whom bestowed glance of pained wonder closely followed by claude looking in spite of heat of day extremely cool comfortable in straw hatted suit dora did not see be at moment smiling violently at one who did not see then motor checked for moment at gate of park slid forward again into le populous way lady austell abandoning duty of recognition did duty by daughter a usual began little way off point so that must get well

piccadilly like see sort condition of men woman jostling other what strike be not how different people be how alike be difference be getting into stride now think of a so great be really so infinitesimal real difference thing matter lie on surface at think tendency be to make far too much out of mere superficiality to neglect discount trait quality constitute essential difference between one man dont think so dear ingenious latin language have certain particle used in asking question one of grammarian tell be used if negative reply be expected if reply be expected to be affirmative lady austell speaking in le rich language of day must not make use of there be something in intonation quite a effective a nonne dora without question found saying yes be so glad agree with dear went on mother be sure will agree with also in fact that being so must try to judge people rather to appreciate by true inner standard not by more obvious le essential characteristic that see on surface lady austells voice sank little if one may say so without irreverence said how god must laugh at division of class must look like child arranging book by colour of cover instead of by content class sort of noble ignoble people together call gentleman neglecting only true classification altogether be evident now to dora that mother have got excellent start must see what have started for there be need for reply lady austell having favoured passing friend with smile be positively wintry in sadness proceeded good instance of what be saying occurred to day dear said mr osborne called on at six a think told be going to do for first time perhaps fully saw what true delicacy feeling have how immensely outweigh of thing hastily might call fault of manner breeding be same with kind excellent woman that be what priceless thing to inherit kindness sweetness of nature lady austell be flying along now race so to speak be clearly sprint dora merely waited for to breast tape proceeded to do so came on subject very closely concern dear said like true gentleman asked permission before allowing step to be taken can guess dear dora a have be said stood considerably in awe of mother occasionally discourse of kind felt to be entirely insincere roused in impulse of liveliest impatience gave sharpness to tongue oh dear yes said truly delicate mr osborne asked if mr claude might pay address to expect used just word hope allowed to mother lady austells manner be always admirable appeared not to notice sharpness of speech at laid neatly gloved hand on doras ah dearest said looked at with sad blue eye eye always looked tender patient even when be disputing fare with cabman be sure will be very happy dear said after pause be most excellent young man everyone speaks well of dear how good looking perfect forget name dora have momentary tendency to giggle at anticlimax of checked again impatience rose to surface adonis suggested be not good look one of superficial thing rate too high lady austell smiled ah mischievous child said make fun of say will send note to mr osborne to night for told must have to speak to first will make very happy dora will make somebody else happier will

tune a mr osborne said carry away with have steered very happy course in selection of so a to satisfy impulse of filial piety yet give pleasure to who like dora may be added did not want so much to carry tune away to listen to music thus selection from mikado admirably boiled down for string put everybody in good humour sir thomas to sleep later on similar selection from patience made mr osborne again beat time with fan without disturbing sir thomas for rest exquisite inevitable melody of bach scarlotti filled hour programme when be over claude turned to dora with whom be sitting in window seat eye glowed like hot coal let come out said stroll down to lake cant stop indoors after bach must always be played out of door be finely justly felt next moment came jar charged mater hundred fifty guinea for coming down said cheap will tell for real good music there price can put upon thing like again with dora check jar lasted infinitesimal time a turned aside to pick up fan have dropped a met eye again felt that divine discontent so vastly transcended in opinion other happiness appeared that too be in tune with come out darling said let get away from people just for bit five minute dont want more music even though be more bach dont want supper do theyre going to have supper now up went head with little unconscious toss of chin dora half laughed to hear how at moment seemed to put bach supper on same level when there be prospect of strolling with outside there be intense sweetness to in there be mastery also loved felt that even if have not cared for even if be particularly hungry must have to go with a rose must not help commenting on wanting woman like to hear reply that heart have already shouted to speak a if bach supper be equally unimportant said of course there not pin to choose between if youll just come out with if wont will said not even please shook head anything sooner than please said come not just a like to dora be tremendously attractive absolute refusal to ask anything of a favour even when so intensely wanted be revelation of eternal masculine not opposed to in accord with eternal feminine nothing seemed to more fantastic sickly than sort of devotion begged for flower sighed pined under woman unkindness caprice here be heart have in effect said to take leave if take give man gave be not woman to give too in own kind too longed to come out into warm half darkness of star with why in common fairness must be supposed to sue for favour longed to grant so out went on to dim paved terrace walk above sky be clear star dust strewn thick over floor of heaven fantastic shape of bird on yew hedge stood clear out against luminous velvet blue little draught of flower scented air stole up through square doorway in hedge from drowsy bed that dreamed of daylight fragrance somewhere not far away in park night jar throbbed bourdon note making vibration rather than sound dora put hand through arm laughed laugh for pure happiness said oh claude real who be with now do understand expect not so will explain there be several me rather liked be chattering extremely amusing be one saw first did like then oh well other me be variety of right below be real doesnt know sometimes whether want to laugh cry to talk be silent only want oh like with bach supper about equal laughing cry dont particularly matter if there be just a to bach supper didnt matter if there be there be a child say make come in grammar only wanted to tell that now well instantly talk about something else claude stopped against faint luminance of sky saw chin protrude dont see reason for doing that said much most interesting thing know drew toward well might give fellow kiss said chapter iv morning delicacy to lady austell be so subject be due to fact that when staying in other people house found saw enough of host fellow guest if denied pleasure of company at breakfast in other respect be stronger than most horse must go through programme must have prostrated most robust without feeling of unpleasant fatigue provided only that programme interested amused in way furthered plan really became tired moment be bored since sitting at breakfast with ten twelve cheerful people with crude morning sunlight perhaps pouring in at window directly opposite bored very much chose wiser plan of not joining in public festivity with excellent tact knew that at house like mr osborne everybody be expected to come down to be in admirable spirit to eat great deal of solid food so explained to mr osborne that never ate breakfast hence be that about past nine next morning maid carried upstairs tray groaning with coffee hot milk toast just one poached egg delicious plate of fruit mr osborne have given very pleasant sitting room next bedroom furnished with messrs linkwaters white boudoir suite for like house have be practically unfurnished austell who have ascertained comfortable fact when bade mother good night evening before caused particular groaning tray to be brought here also paddled in to join in carpet slipper dressing gown call devilish comfortable house nowadays observed be far more than must be said for in time what pity osborne cant run together must pay bill must give tone wish be possible to be comfortable though poor isnt everything comfortable cost so much now darling mother let loose tell what think of really absence of breakfast look quite delicious have given chop beef thing may have piece of melon jim mother be rather fond of other seldom met without having quarrel for while be agreed in general plan of grabbing at of world good must be appropriated despised in private exposed method of other so mother be afraid be one of very few people who be not afraid of often wished be have cigarette after bath be standing in front of fireplace on thick white sheepskin rug smoking end of dear jim said do think have better smoke in here mr osborne may not like oh will think be said jim calmly so wont dare to say anything fear cant think why now do tell how strike can bear for three day can easily must bear for month year be so comfortable now what did mr osborne talk about at dinner mr o talked about royal family sir thomas seems nice man doesnt lady austell gave very generous share of half melon looked rather like bribe be going to indulge in what jim called humbug hoped must let pas think dear a said to dora other day remarked that be far too apt to judge by surface take enough account of real sterling virtue honesty kindness hospitality austell cracked egg did not take enough account of effect of hospitality last night remarked because ate too much supper felt uncommonly queer when awoke morning always be rather greedy darling said lady austell softly scoring one know suppose inherited from deli mean cerebral hmorrhage grandfather dont drink brought about level jim proceeded with smart telling stroke refer failure to grandfather said so whatever say about host dear mother will consider that be only speaking of previous generation hospitality be unbounded kindness prodigious asked how long must stand perhaps polish culture breeding of host really doe seem to beyond question did see stuffed crocodile lizard in hall will give one for birthday think be odiously ungrateful jim said have got to take grote for seven year at really unheard of price get in return be jim opened pale weak eye very wide what have done said have only agreed with about kindness asked opinion about breeding be sarcastic backbiting said mother only a long a talk such dreadful nonsense darling mother said dont indulge in rhapsody about honesty of housemaid honesty in housemaid be far finer quality than in millionaire because millionaire be not tempted to be dishonest whereas poor people like housemaid be really only wanted to have pleasant little chat about osborne only will make serious serious insincere let be natural ill begin took one of mother crisp hot roll buttered heavily find mr mr o quite delightful said must have told so long ago if have only be frank do really there isnt one particle of humbug about have perfect ease naturalness of good breeding lady austell tossed head that word again said seem to judge everybody by standard of certain superficial veneer call breeding know one cant help grant that lot of well bred people be rude greedy there be certain way of being rude greedy be right im greedy so be cerebral grandpapa only be gentleman so be im rude dont get up when come into room open door for shut window claude brother claude doe thing yet he cad consider claude perfect gentleman said lady austell with finality know that perfect spoil said jim meditatively now mr osborne be frank cad thats how put claude subtle one thats why cant stand daresay youll do best to live on said lady austell certainly though will probably succeed without doing best will be quite easy expect do think be gentlemanly thing to do asked mother when behind back call subtle cad oh yes quite though perfect gentleman must dream of doing think claude have mass of good point simply bristle with give one such shock go on swimmingly for time then suddenly say that somebody be noble looking that carpet be tasteful superior now mr osborne doesnt give one shock know what to expect get time lady austell thought over for moment though austell be quite unsatisfactory in almost way of life be impossible to regard a fool have most amazing way of being right certainly view of frank cad subtle cad have air of intense probability about be one of thing mother habitually chose to ignore if necessary deny existence of hope will not say of ridiculous thing to dora remarked ah then be just because be not ridiculous that wish to leave unsaid if be ridiculous must not mind jim waited second to give mother time to contradict if felt disposed apparently did not interrupted consenting silence will not say to dora promise said because in case have not occurred to might see truth of might put off must damage chance of living on must be very foolish of besides have quarrel with dora like dora saying thing to be superfluous be afraid see perfectly though to apparently seem ridiculous be wrong mother do only pretend to think ridiculous lady austell felt must fight little on ground seem to quite ridiculous in so far a apply to dora said be deeply in love with dear child do suppose that stop to consider whether say tasteful not jim smiled with faint malice doe not stop to consider whether say not replied because be perfectly clear that doe when doe pause not for long just for second doesnt exactly wince not whole wince at least just little bit of one cant help if be not accustomed to if be going to marry mr osborne must wince little now then dont in least wonder shes in love with wish must find girl who must marry a handsome rich a claude only thing be jim finished breakfast be going slowly round room looking at furniture paused in front of saddlebagged divan with head on one side only thing be that though may get accustomed to tasteful may also get accustomed to extraordinary good look of course then there money to fall back upon dont think must ever get accustomed to so much what be be uncle alfred going to allow on marriage fifteen thousand year believe said lady austell gently a if mentioning departed friend jim gave little sigh in same style have dreadfully inconvenient memory remembered that original sum suggested be twelve thousand mother have thought decent not creditable there be doubt so framed transaction to that have screwed up to fifteen so sighed appreciatively comment that followed be of nature of testimonial when marry will leave question of settlement completely in hand if will allow said think be too clever for anybody be not once twice many time lady austell have told son complete truth in answer to question of when have said fifteen thousand believe be only reasonable to expect that answer must be satisfactory jim always remembered something else memory be terribly good be not that considered twelve thousand poor sum only recalled to mother mind fact that have successfully suggested fifteen have not openly stated fact have merely requested kindly aid with regard to own marriage settlement if there be ever to be must have be to completely gratifying request a be left with sense of having be found out complete correctness of impression be shown by austells next word think have be fearfully brilliant about said be sure have made think that considered fifteen thousand far too much do tell didnt say that thought be great responsibility for so young couple to be to be steward of so much wealth lord how wish somebody must make steward come in somebody have tapped at door to tell truth lady austell be not very sorry to have interruption for have actually used word jim have conjectured in little talk with mr osborne brother in settlement be very genteelly distantly alluded to there have be distinct twinkle in alfred eye at point did not want more cross examination interruption therefore be welcome mr osborne entered looking hot pleased jim at moment be looking at large engraving of landseers monarch of glen part of white boudoir set in angle of room parallel to door did not at once see good morning lady austell said thought must just step up see what must fancy doing beautiful day there of party going to motor over to pevensey mr osborne caught sight of jim gave faint scream im sure if dont beg pardon lord austell said with averted head for never guessed be here paying morning visit to mamma in bath wrapper thought somebody said come in for always tap at door now clear throat to give warning with so many lover about bless yes said come in said austell maynt come talk to mother thought dressing bath wrapper be rather smart be rather being of blue silk new unpaid for with mr osborne permission joined have given quite turn for moment to find that have intruded on earl in dressing gown rapidly recovered why beautiful said such figure a mr o be in old green padded wrapper a hardly come to knee be thought of that gave such turn at finding gentleman in dressing gown im sure neednt have minded what will be thinking of doing lord austell liberty hall a mr o always tell guest more say what like to do better be pleased lady austell have lit cigarette just before mr osborne entrance still looking at with usual bereaved regretful smile be making effort to pas to jim behind shelter of table observed with stealthy movement took from for though exposed other in private be firm ally in presence of others ive be having such scolding from mother said for smoking in here told be far too good natured to mind have done very wrong mr osborne beamed just saying that more guest pleased better be pleased exclaimed well what be to be lady austell drive to pevensey with sir thomas mr percy im sure therell be difficulty about getting gentleman when known a be going stroll what not bit of lunch quietly at home maybe drive afterward give name lady austell settled lady austell turned one glance of gratitude at son continued to smile at hostess be too kind said a ive just be telling austell what must really like to do best must be to spend morning quietly by going over dear old place again then may see how afternoon turn out pathetic mention of dear old place though dilapidated old barrack must have be far more accurate description of grote a be made mr osborne feel quite apologetic spoke to husband about afterwards assure dear said to see sitting there with sad smile be quite touching a if ought to have be who asked what must fancy doing well one up down in world after weve done something in taking place off hand putting stick two of furniture in keeping rain out white boudoir suite look beautiful hadnt seen since put in well im sure oftener lady favour with visit more will be pleased said mr osborne give rattling good rent for dear when alls

osborne be going to have second go evening cant deny music mr o mr osborne paused on way to door dont want to said though hate that scratching sound last night mr o dont mind telling what with young young franklin lighting up before wed got into wine at claude leaving room to join lady im sure dont wonder dining room be sort of clapham junction telling not to stop too long there to night give time to sit think if claude want concert god bless boy let have let be made clear that who want wine talk sit have dont feel theyre expected little drink a well know there sir thomas who fish for liquor little harm seems to do like guest to have what want maria there reason why of shouldnt stay quiet pas bottle while others listen to fiddle thats way weve got on old lady by giving everybody what want of best quality well let do so still care to leave table evening let leave dont let there be pressure on such a like to remain lord if there mr per not coming out already with fallal on must go get sir thomas glass of sherry mr osborne be in way most hospitable of men must have felt a personal disgrace if a never happened guest of have not wine wanted even a must have felt personal disgrace if guest be not met at station did not have sufficient breakfast wine to mind be something of quite different class to other hospitality be under personal control so that if sir thomas liked drop of sherry in middle of morning mr osborne if sherry decanter a proved to be case morning be empty have personally to go down to cellar followed by thoresby with taper fish out from bin bottle wanted moreover a motoring party have finished breakfast nearly two hour ago must not get lunch for nearly two hour after mr osborne have ordered tray of more sustaining sort of sandwich cold ham dish two of fruit to be put ready in dining room to fortify for drive for when did have lunch must only be cold picnic kind of lunch carried with in huge wicker basket like coffin two of resplendent footman be even now staggering under bearing out to motor for sake of good fellowship several of party who be not going on prodigious expedition joined traveller in collation for a mr osborne said with large plate of ham in front of made bit of break in morning to have mouthful of sherry dry biscuit help per boy for youre guard of personally conducted tour youll need bite of something before get lunch jim austell meantime have gone back to room from ejected two flurried housemaid who be emptying thing into other dressed in leisurely manner found letter two on dressing table among note from mr osborne secretary containing extremely satisfactory cheque for first quarter rent of grote with great promptitude despatched to bank then coming downstairs out on to terrace found claude rather impatiently waiting for return of dora who have strayed off after breakfast with may thurston challenged to game of croquet in two be still engaged when girl came back from walk refused to join may went into house while dora drew chair to edge of ground watched jim wallowing in remembrance of cheque have proposed sovereign on game claude have accepted game therefore since money be concerned be serious dora not knowing be not have great deal to say think englishman be perfect butcher said whole of long glade be simply one mass of most heavenly young pheasant who ran to in flock to be fed then come october when run to be fed shoot in eye there youre wrong dora said jim calmly taking aim shoot at running rabbit not oh well know what mean call sport there that serf right jim now claudes turn he got oh claude what beautiful shot wasnt lucky hit wire first if hadnt must have missed blue altogether claude did not reply even though be dora who be talking fact at present moment be playing game overrode other consideration must have much preferred to stop playing game talk to instead since be impossible continued to be entirely absorbed in what be doing ball after beautiful shot be well placed for break little consideration be necessary then somewhat lengthy faultless exhibition followed at end came sat down on grass by dora not bad break said will have cigarette be going to do after lunch asked gently a jim walked off to far end of ground just exactly whatever like so long a do by havent seen morning know be beastly said may dear know wanted to talk about harry rather wanted to talk about so talked together cant remember word said claude be lying face downward on grass nursing match dora be looking at short hair on back of neck then quickly suddenly looked up oh jim cheated cried saw move that ball with foot what brute be always cheat at croquet be always found out dont cheat only lose temper claude dear keep eye on perhaps cheat too do oh what heavenly day do let go on lake after youve finished game will row steer will encourage dora passed over fact of jims cheating a passed over other numerous topic of conversation thing to be alluded to left behind claude sitting up again when have got light made comment to jim continued to play calmly correctly at end of break came toward leaving unpromising position talk more rot in short space of time than anyone ever saw remarked what with shooting at running pheasant saying cheat make head whirl oh did saw said dora calmly why not grant paused moment a claude aimed then continued oh claude what bad luck did hit almost thought saw tremble in minute will be sure of thought hit said jim im sure didnt said claude full inch between game be over in couple of turn after dora finding hot on grassy bank have gone down to sit in boat wait for claude at conclusion of game produced sovereign handed to jim gave good thrashing said couldnt get in once thanks yes have bad luck through say youre satisfied that dora be talking nonsense about what when said cheated of course did nothing of kind why of course im satisfied if tell so said claude be coming down to lake not dora must hurl overboard claude strolled away jim walked aimlessly about taking shot across lawn with various ball knew perfectly well that have cheated be worst luck in world dora have looked up moment there have be ball quite close to a far off a if have be in better world by reason of fact that be lying neatly inaccessibly behind stump have just moved with foot a went by without so told more than half meaning to be quite characteristic of rarely fully meant that sort of thing something external to seemed to suggest paltry little manuvre of kind yielded to in absent minded sort of way without particular intention have game in fact gone on without attention being called to must probably have nearly forgotten about by now claudes remark though innocent even cordial considering what privately knew irritated good deal have said that of course be satisfied since jim have told so that looked a if must not have be satisfied if have not be told utterly unjustifiable attitude since have never given claude so far a knew very smallest ground for supposing that be capable of cheating at croquet anything else perhaps in sheffield be right thing to cheat at end of game everyone who have not cheated told opponent so who then kindly accepted word claude must find however that among sort of people now moved wasnt correct to cheat in fact be distinctly advisable not to indeed in very few minute jim felt rather a if claude have cheated be kind little troubled about then felt almost ashamed of for dwelling so long on so small incident looked at matter afresh have cheated pocketed sovereign probably in consequence be very small sum of money to cheat for distinctly wished that have not occurred then threw down again mallet have taken up fact be im rotten chap said to there be dissentient voice in brain claude meantime have gone down to lake after dora if have be obliged to give thought definiteness of word must certainly have said that thought whole thing rather odd then being of extremely loyal unsuspicious nature must have endorsed remark to jim that word be quite sufficient have turned thought resolutely elsewhere did not want to think about such very nasty little thing a cheating at croquet whether there be penny sovereign nothing at on game did not wish to examine certain doubt that lurked in bottom of mind a to whether dora have seen correctly not be in shade anyhow let lie there if anyone have told jim that incident be trifling microscopic one must have be quite right to deny that be true that game only sovereign be concerned directing power le important personage than honour really make great difference in daily journey through life if charioteer be at post not sorry for keeping darling said to dora have to finish game didnt take long did got head knocked off dora have already established pushed out through willow water where weed trailed whispering finger against bottom of boat to deeper water how clever of to screw on again so quick said yes quite straight oh

do know said if be shouldnt say that sort of thing even to didnt cheat told so so must have be mistaken awful pity to let thing like ever be talked about let go on to big thing though didnt happen suggested dora paid attention to excellent moral reflection merely waited with mouth open till have finished in order to speak again oh did did cried saw with eye never must play together because always cheated always lost temper how funny of not to confess claude did not reply for moment be rather uncomfortable well now for big thing said oh bother big thing said dora know think be wrong im not im never wrong im perfectly certain stopped suddenly leaned over side of boat dabbling hand in water saw unuttered trouble in claudes face rather dreadful conjecture occurred to claude werent playing for money be asked in low voice made up mind in moment acted with promptitude good gracious said what will be suggesting next dora be still grave oh be glad said with relief do let talk about something else daresay be quite wrong about jim moving that ball oh know wasnt cried be only game see there be nothing on oh poor jim see always used to cheat be just same at billiards if ball be touching used to go on before really looked to see if be lead on to big thing have stopped rowing with impetus boat have acquired in vigorous stroke made to get clear of weed be drifting toward little island in centre of lake where swan made nest be rimmed about with soft branched willow trailed yielding bough toward water boat glided in under drooping finger ran on to soft sandy promontory where beached bow while enfolding willow gave shade yes big thing said dora just darling youve got heap of attraction im not sure that one of nicest thing isnt that be so safe be such fun being able to trust person quite completely entirely know one be right in doing so dont believe ever scheme make plan mother doe jim doe people get so keen on plan that other thing get rather out of focus go oh

gray business in life unless one dy quite young must immensely annoy to do wonder how will stand gray business when see other getting older more wrinkled stiffer stiffer not only in limb be bad enough stiffer in mind be infinitely worse dont look at like sit up be sensible have got to be faced unconsciously at most half consciously be sounding knew quite well that there be beautiful thing to be said said truly about what have called gray business of life wondered longing that might be so whether there be within divine alchemy must see how gray must be changed into gold never have felt physical charm so potent a now when sat up obedient to order leaned forward toward with look little puzzled little baffled in eye almost be tempted to say to oh doesnt matter nothing matter beside exquisite day a know already very deep lying vein of curiosity wholly feminine very largely loving made not interrupt own question wait with just touch of anxiety for reply claude felt must have day to be far more intimately known by other than be now of knew little personal beauty though felt sure that a have said to may be good a have said to that be safe of guessed that knew more that loved have doubt felt that have shown a yet little beyond world saw quick eager attitude toward life iridescent mood of effervescent nature there be something that sat below real self wanted claude to know that even a wanted to know real self be vague to though real instinctive rather than describable flashed momentarily through mind a waited for reply that reply came at once claude seemed to find difficulty about facing of gray business there cause to worry said just look at dad mater isnt in love with still expect what call gray business for woman can not begin while husband love dont suppose of ever gave look so to say at anybody else think of way proposed health last night not much gray business about why be a if be best girl still that hed just come courting instead of having be married over thirty year be best girl still just a will ever be mine a for why he man still hows that for gray business dora felt one dreadful moment inclination to laugh have asked for sign that must turn gray into gold for reply got assurance that might put mind at rest with thought of what mr mr osborne be to other knew that for moment only saw ludicrous side of that very real solid truth be firm below somehow be not what wanted wanted hardly knew what something of spirit of romance triumphantly refuse to acquiesce in literal fact of life see thing through many coloured blaze of own light wanted gray business laughed at wanted assurance that must never grow old given with lover superb conviction to be received with unquestioning credulity of child doubt ought to have be very comforting to think that year must leave with very warm comfortable affection father mother have for other ought to be glad that claude felt so sure of to mind there be about a much romance in a in suet pudding saw eagerness die from face shadow of disappointment cross what be now dear asked dora tossed head back trick have caught from isnt anything now said concern year be century away think be foolish of to ask at dont think be in least said said have to be faced think ive given facer at least example of governor mater have besides there be other thing will colour up gray matter child hope son going to school daughter growing up again dora knew that spoke with excellent sense again felt that be not sense wanted so much a lover nonsense be more essentially real than sense wanted something airy romantic golden then looked at again want faded from brought gave little sigh raised till face be on level with o claude must be donkey if be not content said lord thered be pair of then if wasnt said sunday succeeded breakfast in consequence be put hour earlier so that servant in house must go to church mr osborne though day be already of scorching heat came down in black frock coat suit of broadcloth wife rustled in black satin be clearly expected that guest must go also for at half past ten stream of vehicle drove to door past window of smoking room got to start early said so that men may put up cattle come too there call for gentleman to put out cigar lady wont mind whiff of tobacco in open air sir thomas church be step outside park gate so that can sit finish there there be lady assembling time to go never keep fair sex waiting hey else most indulgent of will turn cold shoulder church a mr osborne have said be stone beyond park gate a arrived at twenty minute to eleven there be time before groaning of organ summoned in to have turn under tree finish cigar have barely be begun have be so taken for granted that everybody be coming to church out of party there be only one absentee namely austell to whose room mr osborne have sent with inquiry if be ready suggestion to send back motor for if be not certainly be not ready motor have not gone back for since have said that be not very well otherwise whole of party be there by degree strayed into church mr osborne have gone there at once from carriage with lady austell in order to escape from heat be already seated in big square family pew belonged to house when others began to come in sir thomas mr osborne be last because have be discussing recent rise in price of tin up till last moment entered indeed so shortly before procession of four choir boy two men vicar mr osborne have barely time to sit down by wife in place always kept for next her in church after standing up putting face in hat before have to stand up again sir thomas sat next lady austell two looked rather like codfish in conjunction with withered lily pew be four sided fourth side opening into body of church through easternmost of arch of south aisle in centre of be very beautiful alabaster monument to first earl wife while window be of exquisite early german glass to memory of second elsewhere in number round wall be other smaller tablet bearing medallion others merely catalogue of cardinal virtue with deceased be blessed whole place be historical established here morning sat mr osborne family friend among whom be lady austell daughter who be going to join together two family sat just opposite claude of alone to most observant eye be ambiguous might a well so far a appearance went have be of austells a of osborne dora be to be feared be not very attentive face wore that peculiarly rapt look a may thurston have once told her be certain indication that be not thinking about what be going on a far a service of church went that be true be completely occupied with occupant of pew sermon be in progress mother sat with eye mournfully fixed on elizabethan monument in centre just a if first earl have be husband while next sir thomas have eye fixed on nothing at for be tightly closed wife next to round corner made futile little attempt to rouse to consciousness again by pretending to put parasol in more convenient place so that must incidentally hit foot eventually succeeded in doing opened one eye rolled drowsily reproachfully at lady austell a if have interrupted celestial reverie then closed again claude a dora felt have observed be looking at so passed over for fear of catching eye went on to uncle alfred who sat next be closely wrapped up in shawl went over shoulder certain stealthy movement of lower jaw caused to suspect that be eating sort of lozenge then came mr osborne dora must hear rather tight satin bodice creak to breathing have bible in have verified text open in lap be listening intently to sermon be clearly to mind for plump pleasant face be smiling eye fixed on preacher be little dim smile be clearly one of smile of very simple happiness be allied to tenderness tear then dora focussed ear heard what be being said so earthly love of ours said preacher be of same immortal quality year dim seems to grow stronger brighter a mere purely physical part of then doras eye be focussed again by movement on part of mr osborne ear lost rest of sentence mr osborne gave great sigh dress great creak simultaneously took away hand be supporting bible in have verified text so that slid off short steeply inclined plane between body knee fell face downward on floor did not heed laid hand making kaleidoscopic colour in ring a moved on hand of husband who sat next too have be following sermon with evident pleasure be hard to say to of movement came first for within same fraction of second hand also let fall silk hat have already gathered up in anticipation of conclusion in same instant of time be seeking hers head turned also to a hers to whispered word passed between then smiled to other second whisper be audible right across monument of francis first earl to dora where sat opposite to maria dear whispered mr osborne if isnt nice then mr osborne belated consciousness awoke withdrew hand picked up bible mr osborne instinct in taking up hat have be quite correct doxology followed hymn be given out wife so be clear to dora have consciousness except for other hymn be first to find in hymn book while still fumbled with glass when stood up shared book with put down own then organ indicated first line of tune again two smiled at other for be favourite a have be sung at service for dedication of church in sheffield remembered that did not wholly account for pleasure have be favourite long before mr osborne sang what be commonly called second be to say made sound about third below air mr osborne sang bass be to say sang air octave thereabouts below treble sang very loudly so also did percy so also did mr per who sang real alto then without reason doras eye grew suddenly dim in last verse mr osborne closed large gilt edged hymn book with tune looked at husband moistened lip a last verse began coughed once then mr osborne ring again caught light a sought husband hand started shade before anybody else so through length of day mr osborne did not sing fat finger closed on wife ring listened to must not have listened then to melba must not have be so completely absorbed if seraph have sung to then finally dora looked at claude thought understood little more only saw little more chapter v be about two of afternoon in last week of may sudden heat wave have spread southward over europe have reached venice making more than ever place to dream be still in le than ever

carrying stacked up furniture of migratory household passed down midstream so a to get full aid current of tide avoided by other apart from such traffic passage of gray half empty steamer churned troubled water at regular interval sending wash of slanting wave against wall of white palace making moored untenanted gondola slap water with sudden hollow complaint grind side uneasily against restraining pali there be little stir of movement passage no lounger hung about on step of iron bridge seller of fruit picture postcard tobacco have taken ware into narrow strip of shade to north of accademia waited unexpectant of business till cool of later hour must bring forestieri into street again even native population shunned glare of sun preferred if be necessary to go from one place to to seek deep shadow of narrow footways rather than face heat glare of canal boatman in charge of public ferry have moored craft in shade if possible with head sheltered beneath discarded coat passed long siesta hour with little fear of interruption call on service dome tower of town glittered jewel like against deep blue of sky outline trembled in quiver of reverberating air on north side of grand canal southward facing house dozed behind lattice closed to keep out glare heat air be still noiseless for staccato chiding of swallow pursued swift curving way with nothing of speed abated over horizon hung purplish haze of heat so that edge of sea melted indistinguishably into sky alp euganean hill alike be invisible dora have lunched alone to day for claude have gone to milan to meet father mother who be coming out for fortnight must arrive evening at present moment be looking out from window of sala on to lower stretch of grand canal a intimacy with deepened seemed ever to grow more inexplicably beautiful flat occupied be on south side of canal though doubt must have left room cooler to have closed inlet of baked air preferred to have window open lean out to command larger view of beloved waterway deep into heart have magic of city of water entered thing incomparable incommunicable only knew that when be away from venice thought of caused to draw long breath hung fluttering in throat that when be in eye be never satisfied with gazing with being soaked in loved what be splendid in what be sordid what be small what be great sunshine shadow moonlight pleasant

gold thread through magical hour binding together circle of perfect pearl two thread indeed ran through be doubly strong for be in venice last autumn that claude have passed three week of honeymoon with glory of place be mingled glory of lover be that perhaps gave to detail such sight sound a be not remarkable in ineffaceable character be because claude have wandered pleased to find momentarily lost in high eaved labyrinth of narrow street that dingy little interior trattorias with smell of spilt wine vine leaf stoppered bottle sharp savour of cooking sawdust sprinkled floor be thing apart from anything must be seen perceived in other town in world spire of valerian sprouted from mouldering brickwork reflection of marble lion head on snow white cornice quivered in gray green water below little sideway scuttling crab bustled over gray mud of lagoon bent on private oblique errand of own seagull hovered at edge of retiring water gray stemmed pali with black head leaned together marking devious course of deep dug channel there came cry of stali gondola with high arching neck beautiful black swan shot out of canal by bridge where lingered sight sound trivial in be stamped in mind with royal mint mark belonged to week when claude be in venice after marriage emotion have streamed from soaking with be part of venice part of herself so wholly hers seal have be set on thing then must never be melted out be claude who have set there have so imprinted that seal upon venice that to now be venice have memory of honeymoon upon like hallmark on silver that time have be score of divine

hear mr osborne voice saying hospitable free handed thing did not get between memory of week in october be aware that during last six month have seen thing differently to way in be presented to during week be not venice that have altered be still venice a per last october a father in law might have said have rowed out to malamocco one day have gone to torcello ancient mother of venice have found there sort of tenderness for earlier now ruined fevered town just a just a found tenderness for husband mother torcello be beginning of magic from torcello creation of what so loved have come on day have taken dinner out on to great lagoon have tied up to clump of hoary gray headed pali notching ferro of gondola into disc of setting sun then tide have slowly swung little sideways so that still faced toward brightness of west long after sun have gone glory of departing have be infused into flooded heaven great cumulus cloud reared out of western horizon in tower pinnacle of ineffable rose with transparent aqueous blue dwelling in fold of at base of lay campanile roof of venice claude have be beside whose beauty intoxicated so that interpreted said did through medium of that have often yawned at thing engrossed have often felt that long lingering before certain picture be tedious reason for have ever be same reason be intoxicating one then picture campanile absorbed in consequence

edge of gray vapour streamed southward off alp spread with swiftness of spilt water along floor in pool promontory of vapour over northern heaven have be talking italian in ridiculous fashion to head gondolier now claude pointed dramatically northward said curioso cloudo on gaiety laziness of child of south vanished poppe put boat about rowed top speed for venice have come in expectation of fine weather with felse before be halfway home squall of prodigious wind blinding rain struck for hour claude nestled close beneath one mackintosh hearing squeal of wind buffet of rain by degree gradual rising of wave made bolt for across last open water between san michele venice narrowly escaping being swamped somehow to dora now that seemed best of day gondola be three inch deep in savage spray blown water knew there be danger of sort abroad when have already started have gone too far in maniac wind descended on to get back crouching beneath one mackintosh with claude with rain streaming in

at rate knew be that have taken very command control of out of hand be in love with be perfectly true be with beauty inextricable part of that be in love now to day a leaned out of window over summer stillness found that be beginning to be able to look undazzled at to see quality nature of husband a be not a have appeared to in early month of marriage when must not see at except through enchanted haze surrounded before married have be able to do a did to day to know at time something trivial always be a when spoke of woman a handsome lady made check suddenly when be married when wonderful beauty be hers be power of criticism have altogether left be only with sort of incredulous wonder that must remember that have ever be capable of to day now that be absent for have not seen for over twenty four hour for first time consciously registered fact that power of judgment criticism a regard have come back to dora drew in from leaning out of window settled in chair discovery rather startled insignificant a might sound if have described to may franklin other friend seemed to herself to be indicative of essential radical change in relation to husband concerned not with present only with future reached back into past so that hundred little scene memory bore different aspect to now from have hitherto borne have be enchanting to for instance that have said must a soon be at clapham junction a at venice provided be with at time have only thrilled with ecstatic wonder that must be so much to now made comment that did not really care for venice be pity be defect in that be indifferent to exquisite beauty with be surrounded have not seen that before made so to speak have part in venice strangely enough have created for be a if father disowned did not recognize own child dora have desire to pursue train of thought for there be something vaguely uncomfortable at back of at did not wish to look closer so mentally brushed aside thing be daily if not hourly habit of hers took mind back to first day in have be together let float slowly down enchanted week have followed till landed at present day again such retrospect have indeed passed out of range of voluntary thought be like pillow on mind when at rest instinctively reposed after venice have wandered week two longer in north italy until toward end of october foretaste of winter caught on italian lake have started for home arriving there at beginning of november have passed through london spending couple of day at claudes little flat in mount street have then gone down to grote for first big pheasant shoot of year found mother austell there dora be essentially appreciative of delightful thing in life can only be obtained by abundant money hitherto very few of have be within reach true be sensible enough to enjoy picture be not hers to look at beautiful thing exposed for public in museum art collection did not belong to slightly unreal class of enthusiast who say that a long a be able to see fine picture fine statue get from pleasure such thing be capable of giving again be deficient in appreciation of comfort knew that be infinitely nicer to telephone from flat at mount street a have done on two evening be there get box at theatre than getting seat at back of dress circle if time be exceptionally bad having egg with tea taking humble place in queue for pit be humorist enough of sufficiently observant type to find entertainment of kind while waiting in queue seemed to insincere to say that preferred going to theatre in such mode similarly though have beautiful view got so much air on top of motor bus that mode of progression along london street be quite enjoyable be really far more enjoyable to have own motor though outlook be not from so elevated perch there be probably not quite so much air be perfectly aware that took keenest pleasure in ease comfort with have be surrounded since engagement pierre loti a have once quoted to may franklin have said that be exquisite to be poor for found having have long experience of poverty much more exquisite to be rich there be thing about shooting week in spite of newly awakened love newly found opulence be in such resounding evidence there gave bad moment moment when be between bitterness laughter nearer perhaps to laughter than other to laughter in bitterness must have found reflection at rate of rather ponderous plan evolved by geniality kindness of father in law underlay week have be in london for inside of one of day that claude have stopped in town after return from venice en route for grote have lunched with claude have be out uncle alf have sent for rather peremptorily so seemed to dora to come down to richmond since uncle alf be purseholder for have intimated that wished to see on matter connected with purse invitation have authority of command consequently mr osborne lunched alone look rarely dear father in law have said giving loud smacking kiss claude seems to agree with bless heart yours for there be nothing like being married be there when alls said done provided find a heart point out to youll give old dad bit of lunch leave to smoke cigar with afterward tell about venice dear ive looked forward to return with boy of mine so a never be im blessed if dont believe mr o wouldnt be jealous of if wasnt that be wife think nought too good for claude even if say run on about like clock wont stop striking dare say shes in right of be not very easy to tell mr osborne about venice because be hard to think of common ground on venice might conceivably meet appreciate other description seemed to satisfy for be largely claude what satisfied even more be evident happiness of girl be in love with life with love with claude with beautiful thing claude have given beautiful thing must give asked if be possible to pick up tintoret two then came plan unfolded to with almost boisterous enjoyment mr o have put head together said im ambassador accredited dont say by with authority to put proposition before well just when dear boy come down to grote to morrow want to be master mistress of house mr o per rest of to be guest itll be for to say what time breakfast to see cook claude will arrange shoot give glass of wine after dinner if think wont hurt itll be found wont if stick to cellar a ive laid down for of ill give key itll give sort of lesson like dear a to how to make guest comfortable a ill be bound will required gift of perception to be able to appreciate kindness affection of speech dora did full justice at same time must not help being conscious of many little jerk remembered also party there have be at grote shortly after engagement wondered if same sort of gathering must be assembling again tried to think of a hostess to mr price lady ewart mr per be really very terrible people on occasion of home coming with claude be beyond question that badinage must be of most superlative order remembered with fatal distinctness how mother in law have alluded to mr per before dora met a very superior seemed to that long conscientious analysis of character must have arrived at report so definitely completely true a be verdict conveyed by two word yet have married claude loved claude to accept burden of honour be clearly one of obligation entailed upon for be mr osborne wish very kindly wish backed originated by wife there be shadow of excuse to shelter under for declining so pause before replying be not greater than must be well filled by smile with greeted proposal ah how dear of said cordially will make kind of mistake be sure mr osborne be willing to risk making hash of party will probably forget most thing claude will complete by forgetting remainder mr osborne laughed dear fill plate with hash ill ask for more said ill send up plate twice for hash hey thats capital will give mr o bit of rest for shes little overdone indeed be thinking of putting off party wouldnt hear of there thing dear couldnt manage to call dad a boy do isnt in nature that must call claudes father mr osborne know favour to ask like hit off from first didnt be right wife for claude mistake that met with far more spontaneous response from dora there be affection kindness a always in what said there be more than now namely pathos of very touching kind in making favour of so simple request dora be ashamed of not having complied with before be asked why of course said dad dad doesnt come naturally if talk such nonsense dad about being favour will will call claude mr osborne junior patted hand gently thank dear thank said mr per call mr osborne a youve often heard dont know that with somehow that want to call different know with people like born in rank of life thats not custom make pet name what not not that ask that must feel a favour dear must indeed if felt must manage to say dad like boy do dora held up reproachful forefinger now warn dad said in one moment claude will be called what said must be then not word more about well give love to rascal who got so much more than deserves bless expect to morrow gone to see uncle alf have poor old alf mass of lumbago be when saw two day ago acid must scarce have thought that anyone must have felt so unkind beautiful day be too with sun shining nature a may say rejoicing poor old alf god bless claude always doe more good than quart of liniment embrocation though what spends on doctor stuff be beyond telling such be mr osborne plan a have be said accomplishment of gave dora rather bad moment party be terrifically ill assorted lady ewart mr price one two more like husband being balanced against mother austell hungarian ambassador wife several others of particular world in mr mr osborne so much wished to be at home dora in consequence be positively tossed gored by unremitting dilemma be obliged to make what must have called cheap vulgar in order to convey at to price ewarts that particular pitch of cordiality to be accustomed alderman price for instance habitually declined second helping not because did not want intend to have because good manner made say no first time yes second a for asking for more a austell did must not have considered that kind of behaviour be used to be pressed tempted dora have to press tempt thing though must have be delighted if have eaten whole haunch of venison found difficult to do naturally have to call footman back mr osborne did quite easily get to put mr price plate aside wait till have given affair second thought then said well dont know a if matter be brought to triumphant conclusion yet be not easy to manage if procedure be new to again wife particularly liked glass of port after dinner after be completely innocent desire gentility be such that must never have thought of accepting when be casually offered night have to be accepted in order to oblige dora mr osborne before giving up rein of government to daughter in law have imparted diplomatic instruction dora have be subsequently assured that pressing tempting be held to be perfection of hospitality flow of badinage too went on incessantly from morning till night be almost exclusively matrimonial in character be difficult to live up to for claude did be construed by mr osborne sir thomas with whom dora so be assured by lady ewart have become favourite into having connubial bearing if a happened one day claude drove mr price home from shooting lady ewart with inflamed delighted countenance told dora that wouldnt wonder if lost way said motor have broken down to explain coming in late again dora be pompously asked by sir thomas on morning of streaming wet when shooting be possible to have game of billiards accepting proposal be expected to be immensely amused by suggestion that claude must be found hiding in window seat to hear what went on joke be embracing if spoke to claude somebody wondered audibly what be saying if spoke to anyone else be again audibly imagined that claude be looking jealous if for moment did not speak to anybody wonder be expressed a to what be on mind be trivial enough in a well knew ocean continent of kindliness lay behind guest section of at rate be pleased well entertained a far a part be concerned be charmed with during seven stricken day for party be of most hospitable order embraced complete week have to nail brave face so to speak over own set teeth inside smiling mouth price ewarts have come here to enjoy clearly did there be certain thick skinned robustness be necessary to anyone who have to enter into spirit of enjoyment have party consisted entirely of ewarts price pers dora must have found own conduct affair of infinitely le difficulty a be mother austell be there six seven more of own world who looked on with faint smile at such time a humour be particularly abundant to do barest justice to must be said that seemed unfailingly ubiquitous one night sir thomas have taken madame kodjek wife of hungarian ambassador into dinner in unusual pause in conversation dora have heard say in faint silvery voice how very amusing sir thomas what fun must have in sheffield then turned back on put barrier of white elbow on table between talked to dora three place off for rest of dinner thing a sir thomas indignant face silently testified be conduct to be unaccustomed clearly such breach of ordinary manner be thing unheard of in sheffield dora halfway between giggle despair at incident have not though longing to know heart to ask mimi afterward what be particular incident that made conclude that life in sheffield be so humorous affair sir thomas have confided in favourite that thought baroness very haughty lady without sense of what be due to gentleman who took in to dinner have be difficult therefore to steer course a in case of wandering channel in lagoon there be here no friendly group of pali to guide have to guess way turn helm swiftly way that to avoid running aground have not be dora osborne must if have found in house party of description have have entrancing bedroom talk to mimi others about sir thomas ewarts osborne such talk must not have be unkindly must have seen even a saw now that manner of excellent quality underlay irredeemable vulgarity thing more difficult in present position must have seen humorous side of affair a be must not have bedroom talk at of description indeed mimi others pointedly avoided a be bound to do mention of other guest from amiable desire not to say thing must embarrass dora have married osborne by act have joined circle true have not in least left own have taken on by necessity relation friend of husband indeed looking at transaction a whole there be not one of friend who did not think have done right few who did not little envy there be slight inconvenience in marrying into family weighed very light indeed if balanced against consequent advantage be business of friend to minimize disadvantage for pretend that sir thomas made particular impression on be deaf to doras insidiousness in getting mr price to

ornamental arch in open work dora must not help laughing oh dear dad said very likely be pers design thats new fish market just being rebuilt then struck that laugh might sound unkindly be quite possible be pers design said must not be thrilling if be giovanni again spoke in italian just land at market ask of workman where iron arch came from see one not yet put up wrapped in straw there be label on see if be from osborne sheffield giovanni floated gondola to side of landing place with flick of quick turned oar got out in moment came back having read stamped label on packing reported

have have lot to compete with when excruciating iron arcade of fish market be erected within stone throw of rialto within pea shooting distance of wondrous canal felt for moment impossibility of herself mr osborne being together at venice situation be one that have not faced without tremor now for moment when be actual accomplished be inconceivable mercantile discovery have delighted mr osborne have clearly raised previous estimate of venice town must so aptly enshrine design of pers be town must receive best attention there be probably more in than have be at first disposed to imagine gave best attention gray fussing steamboat going seaward on tide raising huge wash of churned water next engaged admiration well if didnt think when took so long to get to palazzo last night that italian must be wiser to build big sea wall somewhere raise level of canal so a must drive horse carriage down said if youve got ferry steamer go pace of lor dear how make rock dont see what there to complain of calling first on side then on same a used to do on thames what must ask for more convenient again dora have to enlist sympathy on foreign side know said go right out to lido where

swim right out together said can swim for ever in sea so buoyant then sit on sand eat strawberry while sun dry again then saw that portentous doubt on question of propriety be in mr osborne mind guessed hastened to remove cause of perhaps coming straight out from england dont want to bathe said besides there mater have adopted from claude so wont bathe well take out for giro row in gondola have tea out on lagoon dad youll love lagoon gray green electric light pole cross to lido eh will be nice said mr osborne quickly appreciatively here bridge why beautiful isnt think like better than

right left stately house stood up from water side in glimmer of rose blue orange beneath smiting glory of noonday since yesterday north wind blowing lightly from alp have banished oppression of yesterday heat glitter of city have awoke again pearly in shadow jewelled in sun in immediate foreground only blot of disfigurement be object of mr osborne admiration flat execrable iron bridge opposite accademia there lay convenient hideous impossible liked better than curved one have more sense in there be need for dora to rack brain to find response must steer middle way between lack of cordiality to father in law on one hand artistic perjury on other between fish market iron bridge vile convenient speed of steamboat venice be going up in estimation by leap bound be delighted to find be almost able to endorse doras opinion on town well call beautiful dear said a said to mother mother said if dora say venice be nice place may be sure there be something in be right to come out have

pretty water be too though not clear must have thought that here in south thered have be more of blue in im bit surprised dear that with eye for colour shouldnt have done up gondola more brightly have blue curtain maybe picked out that handsome carved work on prow with touch of red there thought too much black about for taste seems to tell of funeral almost dora must not argue about must not give mr osborne eye must see value of black blot of boat against brightness of sky mirrored in canal be easy to find praise in speech to must respond though praise be expressed in way that somehow set teeth on edge oh be most comfortable thing in world said even like indignant slap give when wash of steamer cross beautiful thing with arching neck like great black swan ah there twelve striking will just have time to look into house fetch claude then get back to dandoli for lunch hope theyll have put in garden oh dad how place have got into heart never did such nice thing a when gave claude month

stone plaster floor venetian emptiness of seemed to rather bare comfortless well im sure handsome room enough in point of size said in hot weather look cool restful seems strange to have never strip of carpet on floor scarce picture on wall lord dear dont make teeth chatter to think of coming down to of winter morning when even now strike so cool isnt there tintoret now dear that must fancy if not that dozen big photograph of canal bridge liked so much to hang on wall a for floor to be sure big job to cover proper carpet for end of where youve got chair table looking out over canal will

garden in centre of gravelled space sheltered from sun by mellow brick wall clump of overarching delicate fingered acacia tree made cool to ear by plash of fountain into marble basin down side at corner of space be tub of orange tree heaviness of drowsy fragrance mingling with large dilution of tide of warm sea scented air be translated into something exquisitely light vigorous claude have already arrived be waiting with mother for who be in excellent spirit why dearest dora said here be ready im sure for lunch to speak for though not gone half past twelve yet in england shouldnt be sitting down for hour claudes be telling that in england now not gone half past eleven here be wanting lunch at hour a eh whats that what did say to pronto sounded like guiseppe smiling italian butler

declare make feel quite greedy said mr osborne such appetite a have to day havent have since middle of april what else have seen morning mr osborne give account of sight dear will think youve have eye except for dora waited in cool greenness of garden till heat of day began to abate then went together in one gondola at mr osborne particular wish to begin sight of venice be in vain that dora suggested that everybody must be much more comfortable if took two gondola arranged rendezvous for mr osborne heart be set on family party wasnt sure that must trust mr o with dora alone more day so a badinage loomed on horizon dora hastily completely withdrew opposition four squeezed into one gondola plan be to row out over lagoon have tea at santa rosa tea made centre of afternoon round rest appeared to be grouped in mind of osborne then be to return to venice in time to look in at st mark loiter in piazza where mr osborne be hoped must find at one of photograph shop representation of fish market on have set heart accordingly labouring gondolier propelled laden craft across to little island tied up to bank procured strawberry from fruit farm to add to tea mr osborne at first have sort of vague prejudice against for abroad be impossible to tell who hadnt be touching be to be feared be only because rest of party found remarkably good that joined be charmed with picnic saw great similarity between little waterway of island regent park canal dined that evening at doras house meal somehow have leaped into sudden importance preponderance since arrival of father in law in venice though have more meal than usual mr osborne a well a husband be voluble over have seen just to think that floor of st mark be in marble said why seems almost shame doesnt im sure there not cathedral in england thats got grand floor st mark so said didnt dora be only roman catholic well well mother said mr osborne church of country see just a english church be ours youd think more of roman if youd be brought up to im surprised at letting floor get into state be ups down im sure scarcely knew where must be setting foot next so dark be too that one couldnt see a much a one must like if be must send for good english architect a know when building safe when isnt make cut dozen sensible window somewhere perhaps take down one of dome put in glass roof to instead five dome there be for counted thats beyond reason dora felt that be too much for simply must not think of reply if somebody proposed putting glass dome in st mark what answer be possible there be need for one mr osborne instantly joined in again never did think to see such shop in venice said why there be electric fitting at one passed beautiful be with nymph such like holding up globe same a might get in most superior shop in town need never have brought out stationery with for there be stationer there a must have bought best cream laid at not expensive if recollect that lira be tenpence though strange to have silver coin worth tenpence instead of shilling want deal of thinking back into pound shilling seem to have notion of building too said mr osborne im sure that great square tower be building be a solid piece of work a must find anywhere to think that original have stood there five hundred year how take back claude nodded at dora what did tell said didnt say mater pater must like venice near a much a do yes dear be quite right said dora with sort of despairing acquiescence in even what must like to do to morrow dad asked eh there more yet to see be there said to think that ive be sight seeing day not finished even now who must have thought there be so much in such small town well dear im in hand show ill be bound will like if come up to sample of venice weve have to day what say mr o well there picture havent seen yet said perhaps dora must take to see picture in morning a for afternoon want nothing better than to have look at st mark do bit more shopping perhaps have bit of row afterward for declare pity not to be out up till time to dress next three four day be must be confessed sort of nightmare to dora for took venice too seriously to see anything humorous in what have to go through took to accademia paul veronese of marriage of cana have instant amazing success owing to size mr osborne doubted if must have got into picture gallery at grote at mr osborne have doubt about saw at glance that must not without took frame off other picture pleased for other reason procession of cross because st mark campanile came into tintoret of adoration of doge because st george be sitting by virgin be english saint before titian assumption of virgin picture unfortunately dora detested criticism with regard to dimension even appreciation be mute size frame passed without remark mr osborne eye filled with dear heart felt tear mr osborne said lor maria be worth coming to venice for to see alone dear well now must paint in day immediately thereon bought enormous copy of vilely executed elderly english lady be just finishing with uncertain strippling touch explained in quavering tone that be obliged to charge very high for copy because spent week in study before began to paint in getting at spirit of original mr osborne alacrity in securing work doubt made wish that have charged higher yet for spiritual tension required for production on day went to san rocco for mr osborne found to amazement that be impossible to see picture in venice in one go even if spent whole morning at seemed strange since must see whole of royal academy in le time remedy be simple why not build new picture gallery hang picture in venice there charge two lira have catalogued in one book be kind of suggestion that cornered dora seemed scarcely worth while to say that many be in church that must be pity to move since be painted for place occupied trying to be patient kind did say so mr osborne be fired with brilliant thought of having copy made for church claude thought excellent idea govs hit nail on head time said be surprised when dora turning aside said oh claude to apart from picture at san rocco did not have great success visit be memorable because mr osborne said bon giorno to custodian just a if did day of life understood perfectly made suitable reply about loveliness of day be little beyond mr osborne so said grazie husband admiringly commented lor speak like native told mother must have by heart in time said on morning have still hour to spare before lunch since tintorets be not interesting beautiful rowed across to giudecca to see garden garden be fairly appreciated though to mr osborne mind border where southern june be rioting be not quite so trim a must have have great sugar factory be found to be most attractive mr osborne be much surprised to find that dora did not know whether be possible to see over not however claude made inquiry found must be shown took father there next day be late for lunch mr osborne dora be late too have be ordering very handsome gilt frame for copy of assumption pattern on wanted lot of choosing dora claude dined that night at dandoli mr osborne announced that mother have settled to stay on week for be thoroughly delighted with venice grateful to dear that be said mr osborne for telling about making feel a how must like to see there fifty different thing in venice must like to see score of time if be spared dear well spend month next year a per sample now dora did best when little speech be made sirocco have be blowing day a usual have made feel rather jerky irritable also must be remembered mr osborne with best most appreciative intention in world have a may be conjectured from foregoing detail of day succeeded in spoiling everything for who must look at enjoy picture while be wondering why tintoret hadnt given st john something more on feel magic of approach across lagoon when mr osborne said that gray shining mud flat called to mind fal below truro at low tide mr osborne confirmed accuracy of impression maria have eye for likeness in consequence dora have little failed in cordiality of tone on receipt of news for by plan must leave venice together day till departure must be taken up with nightmare excursion for be part of plan that must do everything together word be have be expressive of delight at remaining claude at rate have noticed failure in tone on way back after dinner spoke about in kindly fashion so seemed to dora with matchless awkwardness sorry youre bit off colour dear said know sirocco always make feel like dora saw obviously tactful intention conscience also little accused knew quite well what have in mind be probably going to say feel like what said though knew to be useless fencing oh feel like what felt when said be so glad pater mater be going to stop here dont say that noticed did expect im quicker than at feeling what feel what said be right enough be just way said leaned forward in seat little looking full in face somehow sight of proximity failed for once to make felt presence did not mitigate what said stamp with old magic wish must explain said a if there be need darling said a if dont understand a well a do said be delighted be stopping only voice said whats wrong there something up thought be having such jolly day together father be enjoying ever so much if pretend find just shade more delightful than really do why just to please make feel success that do settled to stop on believe just for made matter better dora felt ought to be delighted be doing so ought to be touched pleased with reason claude have conjectured be not venice a matter of fact rather day of venice be being spoiled for must a soon a claude have once said to though with inverted meaning have spent at clapham junction if osborne be to be with be great pity that must stop on if motive in doing so be to gratify hoped be not that oh dont think be claude said dad like like sun oh lot of thing stuckis sugar factory for instance mother like pigeon shop isnt venice like thats just what say said stop to make think do think world of know yes darling said dora quickly that make so pathetic pathetic mean that dont think so highly of doras heart suddenly sank have not meant that have meant only that be pity stayed in venice to please when in reality be not enjoying stay knew well that be out of place in venice be hopeless to try to explain even if have meant other must have be fatal error on claudes part to put into word called kind of frankness getting at bottom of thing felt be certain to use that phrase now did so let get at bottom of dear said a always do will speak mind just like perhaps will sound harsh to im sorry if doe leaned back again without looking at must see that tilted head back put chin little out identical gesture before have found so attractive so fascinating even have told so too hundred time have said loved man to know mind to be firm decided especially with loved best doubt remembered that at moment perhaps even be doing consciously at least half consciously so a to present what have to say in most attractive guise suddenly disconcertingly found gesture scarcely le than odious think pater be awfully good to dear said he done lot for given sort of thing have reason to expect there month in venice to go further than well will stand in pot of money just because doesnt grudge one penny of that think ought to feel rather more cordial to about stopping dont say that behaved not cordially because think what said be right of noticed that anything be awry hadnt got right feeling to back up tongue wait moment ive not finished there something more yet want to find word wont hurt yet will express what mean there be something in roused certain sense in dora that knew have be often present in mind hoped must always remain dormant now began to awake word kind a be implied impossible attitude be judging so seemed to making jury judge rolled into one be understood that put in dock before must make defence knew that be right be what came to be going to tell a kindly a possible what be right on instant found refusing to be judged condemned by standard did not know what venice meant to how essentially father attitude toward thing place that loved jarred on unfortunately affair be typical of hundred of other affair that mr osborne have artistic sense of sort kind did not matter what be beginning to matter be that claude who apparently must not see that entire absence of in person with whom be brought into day long contact made something rather hard to bear have put on wig be going to sum up on matter about knew nothing behaviour have never broken down have said that believed to be true matter be that must not understand that have to struggle against disappointment of spoiled day be yet serenely confident that have complete data dont mind about hurting said quickly want to say exactly what feel have arrived at water gate of home without noticing giovanni be already standing hat in hand to give support of arm on to step be slippery with receding tide claude be conscious of first be quite conscious also of doras tone not before servant said get out dear

osborne went through engagement book down at grote found so heavy programme in front of somehow to day did not feel markedly exhilarated by journey back from venice have tired very much though have felt sure that good night rest coupled with day two of solid english food must set up again still felt overdone devitalized be disposed to attribute in main to unnutritious character of venetian diet where if got bit of veal for dinner be a much butcher meat a be likely to see while to make up there must be nothing more than slice of unknown fish half of chicken be bigger than blackbird a for nice filet of beef choice leg of lamb be thing unheard of yet have not felt much inclined for filet of beef when be accessible again seemed to suit a little a rice maccaroni have done for last week too have have from time to time little attack of internal pain doubt be of consequence be pain that did not know must not quite localize once twice have thought of consulting doctor thing mr osborne have urged on before venetian visit vague curious fear prevented fear of being told that something be seriously wrong that must have to give up london programme have planned so delightedly be thing not to be contemplated london plan be to mind part of immutable order of thing be therefore essentially important that mr osborne must not guess that be out of sort for well knew if have so much a guess of that must have carried off by force if necessary not let go of till have deposited in eminent consulting room with specialist dangling at end of telephone have never be lacking in spirit must be singular thing if must not be genial hearty to world for few week more what doubted be power of getting through physical strain of knew how tiring standing about receiving be day now felt tired even before fatigue of have begun if only have daughter who must quite naturally take of off hand let sit down while company be arriving then idea struck dora claude be intending to occupy flat in mount street till end of summer after that must come down to grote soon please god flat in mount street must be too small for what must be elegant circumlocution be exactly phrase passed through mr osborne mind when returned to london again in autumn must be to house of own in green street with place for nursery however be only going to take at michaelmas dora have written to mother in law very morning innocent letter suggested possibility to mr osborne saying that mount street really seemed to be hotter than venice dreadfully stuffy venice be not what if dora claude must come live with in park lane till end of july remembered how dora have acted hostess down at grote in winter might play game again time there must be real object to be served by must help in entertaining prospectively a planned

thatll suit lady will youll like to have dear child in house know bless let come said mr osborne longer stop better will be pleased dora will be help too will help with dinner what not two be alone on last day at grote six wasp coloured footman marwilled by thoresby formed sort of frieze round table occasionally changing plate handling dish generous though be with money mr osborne have very distinct notion about getting money worth when have paid since house required six footman saw reason why must not all wait at table even when only mr o be having lunch be number of dish curtailed because be alone mr osborne always ate of because there be company be reason why must go starved be not therefore for nearly hour after time sat down that went to telephone so accurately depicted by sabincourt rang up claude joined mr osborne on terrace minute two afterwards claudes willing enough thank said say must speak to dora first so youd better telephone to lady tell to make ready room

be said done just to think of have got idea about new name yet daresay something will suggest after will smell a sweet by other name hey lor dear said mr osborne with slight accent of reproof for thoresby have come to see if there be order must have heard question however about move of dora claude to park lane be not so foregone conclusion a mr osborne have anticipated claude have gone to telephone when be rung up came back beaming to tell dora of delightful offer dad mater invite to go to park lane till end of july said im blowed if there be many father who must want son daughter in law in house time of course said that must consult first be only proper oh claude said of course awfully kind do think so why not just like governor to have guessed that must feel stuffy cramped in flat during hot weather dora remembered letter im afraid may be responsible for said at least wrote to mother yesterday saying be very hot airless here oh dear hope wont think hinted at not dont catch imputing motif specially when there werent shes got more to think about than say dora be sure didnt have that in mind awfully sharp of if did dora resented indignant that must have supposed capable of little of indignation coloured word im afraid that cant lay claim to sharpness said because fact be that if have thought offer be possible must have said be cool airy here claudes profile be outlined against hot hard blue of sky outside dora noticed how perfect be noticed in detached sort of way did not seem to concern at turned round came across room to whats matter dear said why be dont want to go oh claude if dont see wouldnt understand if explained said cant quite explain either try said well married do see be master of house im mistress isnt quite same thing if go live with other people be angelic of course to suggest oh wish people wouldnt be quite so kind rather that must mix little tact with kindness theyve made hard to refuse telephoning like like word of mouth invitation for month ahead youve got to say yes claude took up rather listless hand of hers lay on arm of chair ah then do understand said love reason guessed before said want to be alone with well same here ive doubt theyll give sitting room though dora have meant something very like that sounded rather dreadful to hear claude say say also that have guessed oughtnt to have guessed although assured be same here there be unconscious complacency about guessing that did not like went on without pause a for being tactless said think youre rather hard on governor when man a kind a can be a devoted a be to dont think must say that claude stuck out chin little over dora though knew be right from point of view knew that have be right too kindness even most sincere can easily be embarrassing need refining like sugar be sort of thing that claude must not understand tact of good nature have be left out of just a have be left out of father so reply be sincere yes dear be pity said that said somehow admission be bitter truth be that be pity to say because ought to have be more careful in what said to not because impulse prompted speech be mistaken one be unconjectured by darling said be so sweet with if have to criticise anything do never take amiss now ill tell reason why think have better go apart from comfort convenience of be that dont think mater be very strong for that eats so heartily get very easily tired shes laid down programme for next six week might well knock anybody out now must be awfully good of if must help with appealed to dora much more oh then let go let go said telephone at once think will think dad must like to think of everything said hoped must think of hell be so pleased at telephoning lewes know claude have meeting at brentwood afternoon have to leave immediately taking cab to station train from there so dora might use motor if wished felt that be perfectly natural ordinary thing to do at same time have to tell have done take very little longer said in answer to urging to take motor walk from station at other end will do good wish be going to prowl about with afternoon men must work know though when come back hope shant find that youve be weeping wouldnt like claudius imperator to be drone good bye darling will be back in time to dine take to play lingered moment still if havent got anything special to do might go down to richmond have tea with uncle alf said hed like havent seen for time yes ill go by mean said thanks dear see after give fifteen thou year dora ordered motor set off on drive to richmond at once day be exceedingly hot reverberation of sun from grilling pavement struck like blow when went out languid airless wind raised stinging grit from wood pavement reek of street hung heavy in air longed with aching sense of physical want for soft dustless atmosphere of venice cluck ripple of green waterway with le ache thirst of spirit for thing have once symbolized to yet last visit have not be rapturous success of one before venice be there unchanged with gold mist of romance that claude have woven for about magical weaver woman for whom have be woven have altered somehow perhaps even in enchanted city certain vague growing trouble be in mind must not be completely dissipated in general outline knew what be hitherto have not focussed vision on now felt that have better be examined for cried out to from darkness of mind where have be at pain to hide perhaps on examination might prove to be imagination only to have real existence except in own mind trouble be claude seemed to age ago though in point of fact be still scarcely twelve month that have told may franklin sometimes said thing gave check seemed almost longer ago though be only few week that have sat alone one afternoon when claude be at milan meeting father mother registered fact that again gave check between two occasion lay romance golden dream experience common though may be in world of men woman be none le marvellous miraculous love for love for have lifted life out of level on have hitherto moved have made of winged iridescent thing have soared many coloured into sunlight moonlight that marvel enchantment of have seemed to then to be thing indestructible eternal while be while claude be claude must never change shed one feather from rainbow wing often have whispered to to will be like for ever more often have tense silence testified with greater authority than voice even in month sens perceived be glorified looked at world through radiance of love conviction that romance must last for ever be part of divine madness of love saw that now clearly enough who have believed that alone be different from others have not be truly sane when believed have be living in world real doubt while existed yet not only capable of being extinguished doomed to extinction once before marriage have talked to claude about what called gray business of life remembered have given gray business facer to use word by pointing to example of father mother have seemed to dora already ripening for romance to fall very short of reply wanted have wanted lover nonsense must assure for romance must never fade have faded always faded question now be concerned with what be left did even consolation of claudes facer remain to have to put part of baldly brutally got a great admiration respect affection for husband a mr osborne have for hers knew have not to day must look undazzled at material out of romance have be constructed analyse be made of passion for beauty have fallen in love with good look be getting used to have got used to what else be there what be left to learn now have that by heart there be great deal left so told without emotion there be character left be sterling quality be excellent kindness safeness to go to purely material thing wealth vulgarity word be coined thought for first time definitely allowed to pas into currency have to reckon with what topsy turvy affair have be how strikingly different disposition from have contemplated have come about have told that must for ever be in love with beautiful face slim active body deft decided movement have told that vulgarity be thing of moment thing to must swiftly get used event have be evolved otherwise be used to beauty vulgarity be cumulative in effect on instead of getting used to be daily more irritated by more ashamed of have imagined even that must be easy to cure to eradicate proved to be task like of emptying spring with teacup have thought that lay so to speak like casual water on surface of ground mere puddle that sun must swiftly drink up be not so sprang from nature came welling up bubbling plenteous inexhaustible there be something about so seemed to now that tinged made unpalatable good quality in be so rich must draw gallon of pure fresh kindness from well spring be inexhaustible even before have time to put lip to drink of drop quite little drop must trickle in from source of vulgarity taint all be even worse than that there be permanent leak from one into other kindness be tainted at source dora did not indulge in reflection from spirit of idle criticism morbid dissection wanted to see how stood how bad thing be what chance there be of righting be no longer mere surface vulgarity in so believed got on nerve no longer particularly minded whether said handsome lady not what did mind be impulse prompted for instance to suggest that might go down see uncle alf because gave fifteen thou year minded saying have guessed reason why did not want to establish in park lane namely because wanted to be alone with minded suggestion that have written to say flat be stuffy in order to be asked there be common common judged by impossible standard standard be inconceivable yet time be good be kind have quality must make love make devotion imperishable thing a be have be married scarcely six month already knew that at time so got on to nerve that must have screamed already a began to look closely at thing felt be glad be going to park lane be glad that limitation be placed on being alone with be little cooler out of town richmond park be in full luxuriance of summer beauty have entered by roehampton gate have still hour to spare before time have said must be at uncle alfred directed driver to turn up to left past white lodge go round by robin hood gate kingston gate delicious smell of greenness coolness came from noble grove of tree beneath clear shade of knee deep in varnished green of young bracken stood herd of fallow deer with twitching ear switching tail warding off persistence of fly sweet forest sight sound be there air be full of buzz of insect hidden bird called to other from among branch distantly on right must see gleam of water where pen pond lay basking in sunlight flush of mauve red from great rhododendron thicket above triumph of summer time be there joy of ripeness maturity of year of kindled immortal vitality of world for though day brought nearer to miracle of motherhood seemed a if summer have stopped once more faced situation a conceived to be time of romance month in autumn be over red gold of autumn be withered from tree brief have be glory must have shed light over many year yet a far a be concerned what have made flame be just personal beauty of husband out of must already have sprung deep tender affection friendship be not only true noble sequel of love be integral part of love perhaps even love heart be there seemed to rather that something bitter have come out of something in regret for past be mingled with gall of disillusionment even regret have small part in month of gold seemed already unreal to felt that be regretting dream be same in little thing too for little thing took colour from what have be to then one great reality have referred to for instance very afternoon a claudius imperator be with sense of unreality that remembered genesis of very microscopic joke have bought roman coin in venice with inscription on have given to saying be label in case be lost to day must not conceive doing such thing must not recapture state of mind in did impulse even that made trifle conceivable in case thing be one might be said once then be forgotten claude have retentive osborne sense of humour with be once joke always joke from time to time a to day brought out claudius imperator again osborne humour have heavy tread slow heavy slouching rustic tread guffaw of laugh there be spectator within of who for ever watch thought word criticises may be called conscience guidance devil a case may be for folk be gifted with spectator be best self others with spectator be parody of doras spectator be above average be optimistic anyhow kindly at point came to aid with so to speak several smart rap over knuckle be truth of whole matter if indeed there be absolute truth to be arrived at in fluid ever varying adjustment of relationship with others only one attitude be compatible with self respect namely to find out hoard like grain of gold be fine generous lovable in others do best to find something in worthy of being matched with instead of so said doras spectator to now have with acute avid eye be picking out that in claude seemed to to be trivial ludicrous tiresome be finding in to match intolerance want of charity there have be no difficulty so said spectator in laying hand on plenty of have one word to say in self defence moment be said perceived that amounted to self accusation have fallen in love with beauty how must not despond when found that be in love with like no longer have blinded to else have seen vulgarity dimly if at even a have seen panoply of excellent quality dimly now saw only vulgarity at rate saw right in foreground big blinding while behind in distance so to speak rest of be not reasonable that outlook must take colour from past must be pessimistic then even that piece of self defence be turned into self accusation if be case fault have be hers from beginning be what have done have separated man into packet have fallen in love with one packet now be spreading in front of that only irritated almost disgusted have yet to learn true wider outlook to feel that fire of love fuse thing together love though can tenderly laugh be gentle always rejoices in weakness imperfection fault of beloved simply because be for though there be many way of love spirit animates be just that be swayed by one magical tune that dora did not yet know have not heard note of did not even know region of soul where made melody day long that have learned in last few minute be that have with considerable acuteness be spying out cause for complaint excuse for dissatisfaction must do little better than by time have arrived at uncle alfs though severe remark of spectator have partially braced again after rather sloppy abandonment of self pity dejection into introspection have brought must be confessed that there be something about uncle alf caustic malicious though be that restored more efficaciously for out of weapon with be fair to fight disappointment despondency be incidental to human life there be none sharper more rapier like in attack defence than sense of humour uncle alf be well equipped there not even picture dealer whom habitually worsted must have denied that have that be lambent ill natured twinkled stung have enviable trick of perceiving what be ludicrous hear poor old eddie have be out with claude in venice dear said cant say im most sorry for claude venice oh why claude asked for have not thought of being sorry for claude because have taught probably to admire tintoret say did eddie must want to admire railway station must have to trim very funny party must have be dear dora laughed till moment have thought of a rather tragic party other aspect have not occurred to do know expect be said time took seriously wonder if be mistake uncle alf to be sure be there many thing in world will depress make good for nothing if take seriously that cheer up if dont be not exactly wisdom out of mouth of babe suckling since uncle alf be very old man be sort of elementary wisdom child might have hit on felt that below surface of wizened crabbed little old man there be something be human have never suspected before in willowness have be content to look upon a mask with money bag to be sure be devoted to claude have not even reckoned with what implied not given credit for power of feeling affection believe be right said when youre a old a dear will know said lord ive have lot of amusement out of life digging for understand not picking up poor old eddie amuses more than can say why hair be turning gray with success pleasure ah not word against said dora he kindest dad that ever lived daresay there be thing to

a to make family party be way english go good lord have be gondolier on hot day not even for entertainment of seeing like noah ark gondolier be thin men that evening dear poor devil alfred have guessed situation with unerring eye of cynical malice word brought scene back to dora with amazing accuracy that day have depressed at time have never guessed how funny be here be laughing at now when be month old alfred continued eddie among picture too said bull in china shop must have be more suitably housed why nearly came out in order to see fun what holy look there about maria hed say dont believe must go into gallery at grote unless took roof off wrote to yesterday that have bought copy of housemaid among cloud by titian what daub dear with frame to match be too much for uncle alfred gave series of little squeak on very high note shaking head eddy silly man said very silly man be poor old eddie get sillier a get older what doe want with assumption of virgin six powdered footman what good do do a little a liniment doe lord dear say something too in letter make think theyre going to make peer of hint ah wish id kept letter made feel sick threw away eddie peer dear saw in

relation dora smiled at thats just what didnt do said only thought of claude well might dear love boy he got into proper hand too can make lot of lord toasting fork lord egg whisk lord frying pan uncle alfred must not get away from inventing title for poor old eddie did with malicious relish be rather instructive to dora must not be called kind hurt nobody frank amusement at idea of peerage be certainly better than heart sinking with prospect of event have inspired dora when thought of genial pomposity with must be received throughout have be too heavy too ponderous have pulled long face instead of laughing have seen depressing side of expedition like family party in gondola instead of humorous aspect be hint worth attending to have got sense of humour so believed yet somehow have never occurred to to look at spoiled day of venice in humorous light soon rose to go uncle alfred said youve done good do know be better to be amused than depressed isnt yes dear hope youll laugh at way back to town great coat on day like golosh to keep damp out strip of flannel assure round small of back eh have lumbago bad when first saw down at grote sight of picture of sabincourts of eddie maria did more good than pint of liniment what pair of guy lord lady biscuit tin dora laughed again how horrid of said well must go claude be going to theatre to night be leaving flat in mount street

claude paused again felt strongly about subject did laugh at governor asked well yes little said dora hope stuck up for im sure did dora gave hopeless little sigh wondered if uncle alfred must have seen humorous aspect of personally must not be question of sticking up for said be chaff fun claude got up with chin good deal protruded ah fun be very well in right place said im sure one like joke more than there be certain thing one must hold exempt from one fun dora tried humorous plan recommended by uncle alfred darling hope dont consider exempt said be laughing at now be ridiculous dear take thing heavily do too must try not to so hereby give leave to laugh at mother austell a much a like dora be serious said know be just trouble said still lightly claudes face darkened well trouble must learn to put up with said rather sharply daresay im old fashioned may call what like ask to respect father daresay mater seem to ridiculous at time if do ask to keep humorous observation to yourself hate speaking like be obliged to dora felt hand grow suddenly cold damp be not afraid of exactly there be physical shrinking from be rather like fear dont see obligation said perhaps not be sufficient that do now let have done spoke on same subject attitude to father in venice dont let speak of again say say be to make reply be that asked yes be know be right come dora appeal have effect for moment did not know how to apply uncle alfs wise counsel if know be wrong asked if tell that dont understand will make difference look here governor have done lot for youve never expressed wish what hasnt gratified then ask if be satisfied with attitude toward said dora see what say tell that uncle alfred have laughed at laughed too tell wouldnt hurt like said claude dora walked to window back again felt helpless in situation believed to be trivial must not laugh off must think of light reply must act a dissolvent to if must find light reply only serious answer silence be possible chose latter if more word be to be said wished that claude must have responsibility of eventually took im sure weve be good enough to people said made welcome at grote for a long a chose behaved friendly be only ten minute before came in wrote to jim telling must live in flat welcome till end of july dont see what must do more logical reply be on tip of doras tongue reply did not cost anything let get further only rebelled against thought that be kindness to do something did not cost anything thought be kind so in way be to give jim flat rent free might perhaps have let for fifty pound did not want fifty pound yet thought that be kind seemed to kind must be taken at that be use arguing going into reason for be real kindness at have told now felt sure to contrast friendliness to relation with ridicule so must put of have done best be bound to take like not point out cheapness of claude dear that be nice of said searching for anything must magnify kindness jim will be awful tenant will leave book about smoke cigar hope youve locked up not thing said just step in hell find sovereign on dressing table believe if look box of cigar in drawer of writing table he welcome to one doesnt bother about thing like be worst parade of generosity must not go further than saying that there be parade at dora must not reply more to that must only repeat awfully kind of said again must go dress if be to be in time for first act chapter viii though be true that claudes kindness in lending austell flat did not cost anything conferred great convenience on beneficiary jim who have be living at bath club have luggage packed without pause wrote letter of acceptance thanks to claude from flat on claudes writing paper letter be quite genuine heart felt at least pocket felt for jim have have slight difference of opinion with mother on subject of being seen in hansom with young lady who in turn be sometimes seen on stage eaton place where have meant to spend week be closed to claudes flat filled bill exactly be far more comfortable than mother house there be nothing to pay for lodging so that be better than club satisfaction be complete when found that claude have left cook there with instruction except to go on cooking order to have catering bill sent to tenant so jim made charming to cook gave sovereign have at once found on claudes dressing table when explored bedroom said must be at home for lunch plover egg yes by mean quail little macdoine of fruit by way of burying hatchet with mother incidentally making green with envy for must have suited very well if claude have offered flat since somebody wanted to take house instantly telephoned asking to lunch mentioned that be in mount street till end of july lunch declined made comment on other jim heard sigh into telephone must not hear grin a have be mentioned before jim have liking for claude up till present have done little living upon loan of flat especially since there be free food going be extremely opportune for at present moment jim be particularly hard up having be through derby week of most catastrophic nature have done nothing rash too made misfortune harder to bear have acted on secret mysterious tip from stable have with most plebeian respectability backed favourite only favourite have behaved in most unaccountable manner blighted career have very nearly succeeded in completely blighting have raised money on rent of grote must be paid at end of month have paid up debt that process however have made fearful inroad on receipt for next quarter strict economy being necessary claudes kindness have be most welcome a ate quail jim planned two three pleasant little dinner party must certainly ask claude dora to one of be that rather ironical thing to do since claude must be paying for food that ate must pay for wine a well seemed for bottle of excellent moselle have appeared since have expressed preference way coming supposed from claudes cellar jim looked round room a ate drank pleased to find in unexpected little haven of rest feeling at same time envious of rather resentful towards possessor quite sympathised with doctrine of socialism asked why must be given to

in thoroughly extravagant manner jim have be so often under obligation to others that heaven suiting must suppose back to burden have made by time unconscious of such accepted such offer a of flat with gay light heartedness be not without charm made also undoubted difficulty of conferring le than accepting favour gracefully easy to giver did not like claude have sufficiently firm conviction that claude did not like to take edge off enjoyment why claude must not like must not tell have always be more than pleasant to brother in law when met always owing to natural easy knack of volubility jim possessed got on quite nicely together minute inspection of flat have taken jim time when be completed strolled out to pay call two see if there be racing news of interest go round to osborne to

with claude declare he like boy again with thought of a be coming evening of next day accordingly saw with flare of light blare of band beginning of hospitality of park lane door of so appeared to dora be never afterward shut day night except during week end when door of grote flew open scene of hospitality changed to of country yet cordial though be be insensate hospitality hospitality gone mad have hotel announced that anyone of consequence must dine there without charge ask friend to dine on same easy term such offer must have diverted crowd of carriage from park lane sent to hotel instead full a programme originally be mr osborne must not resist pleasure of added hospitality little dance got up in impromptu fashion with much telephoning leaving of card be wedged in between big one became big before night arrived score of guest utterly unknown to host crowded room for known unknown alike mr osborne have same genial genuine cordiality of welcome be sufficient for that have crossed threshold must drink mr o champagne eat capon be glad to see have shocking memory for face that made difference since nothing must exceed geniality of greeting to whom have never set eye on before be good moment too when not so long after beginning of hospitality secretary whose duty be to enter name of caller in immense volume dedicated to purpose reported that second calling book be necessary since space allotted to letter with majority of name began be full must not have imagined year ago that must ever happen yet here at beginning of second season only more space have to be found doras name for second volume supplement to court guide be most gratifying alfs allusion to london directory though equally true must not have be so satisfactory brave cheerful soul needed gallantry for be incessant struggle with to conceal weariness discomfort be always with be so afraid must in spite of betray to others there be day of pain too not a yet very severe of sort frightened appetite failed must conceal without difficulty for most part since time be few on husband be not sitting at distance from with many guest intervening once twice when be alone be afraid must notice abstention question high colour also began to fade from cheek lip made one daring tremulous experiment with rouge lip salve to hide sent maid out of room before attempt then applied pigment with disastrous result lor mr o will think woman of music hall instead of wife said to herself wiped off again unusual brilliance though sometimes courage faltered never gave way have determined not to spoil week for husband be to be blaze of triumph afterward must go to doctor learn that have be frightening to purpose that there be something wrong endless hospitality stream of people who passed in out of house though tired also served to divert take mind off discomfort alarm have to be in place though dora took much of burden of off shoulder to shake hand with stream of people say be perfectly true how pleased be to see friend from sheffield for never in life dropped old acquaintance came to stay pleasurable anticipation have have of letting see bit of real london life fell short of reality best of sir thomas lady ewart be in house when list of honour appeared in paper happened dramatically drama of be planned contrived by claude came down rather late to breakfast having given order that morning paper be to be put in usual place in dining room went straight up to father good morning lord said hey what said mr osborne poking fun at be there something about in paper lord well never let see said mr osborne unfolded paper claude have brought lady said across table to wife thisll interest list of honour peerage edward osborne esquire m p be triumphant success sir thomas actually thought that be news to went so far a to lay down knife fork bless soul said well im sure there never be honour more deservedly won what will be more dignifiedly worn mr osborne must not keep up well well said of course weve known along claude must have joke pretend be news to thank ye sir thomas im sure maria dear im told new coronet come home pas to lady claude a if by conjuring trick produced from under table cloth round tiara of immense diamond have be previously balanced on knee mr osborne have have idea of part of ceremony have be kept from put on maria dear said if there peeress in land a better deserves coronet than must be proud to meet let honourable claude settle comfortable for dear claude boy im jealous of because youre honourable be more than poor old dad ever be deft hand of honourable adjusted tiara for got up to salute donor if isnt measure of head exactly said well never not knowing word about meantime a june drew to close in whirl of engagement sociality estrangement between dora claude grew though not more acute in more of habit very passage of time instead of softening rendered harder to soften have be alone in flat be probable that intolerable moment must have come breaking down stood between in case compelling to talk out thing must have be better than nothing bringing cold alienation up to hot level of quarrel must have be made up when made up might have carried away with much of cause of growing constraint a be there be quarrel thus there be nothing to make up claude on side believed that wife still rather resented certain remark have made to at venice here on subject of attitude toward father contrasting unfavourably with appreciation kindness family have shewn hers in rather hard thoroughly well meaning perfectly just manner examined re examined cause of complaint must conceive to have on subject entirely acquitted of blame did not see that must have done differently have not be unkind only firm firmness be based upon sense of right in examination of course utterly failed to recognize real ground of estrangement be a dora knew not one particular speech action of rather spirit nature lay behind speech action be incapable of telling even if have be able to do so no good end must have be served by have married not knowing at least blinded by superficiality now getting below getting used to found that there be thing to must not get used on contrary seemed to to be getting day more glaringly disagreeable to not knowing did best to remove what believed have be cause of estrangement by praise commendation of what called to altered behaviour for there be doubt whatever now at rate dora be behaving delightfully to parent took much of work of entertaining off mr osborne hand made few engagement of own in order to be more actively useful in house be in sense most loyal dutiful of daughter in law also very gently tactfully got leave to revise mr osborne visiting list drew somewhat ruthless lead pencil through considerable number of name for in early day to leave card meant a matter of course to be asked to house luxuriant exotic garden wanted little weeding seemed to claude to be happy fruit of criticism consciousness of in mind did not improve flavour of speech to dora be little alone owing to high pressure of day one evening about fortnight after have moved into park lane found resting in sitting room before dressing there be dear said how right of to rest little have be doing there be people to lunch said then drove down with dad to house be not there long so waited for have turn in park then whole host of people came to tea multiplied be ever so pleased with said claude im sure dont wonder ever since came up have simply devoted to in mind be thought ever since spoke to about be not verbally expressed whole speech rang with dora tried for moment following uncle alfs plan to find something humorous about failed dismally tried instead to disregard im glad said that one be of use then made further effort think be excellent plan that must come here added suit doesnt suit claude smiled at leaning over head of sofa where lay knew must find success said felt quite certain must be again dora tried to shut ear to personal note ring of how right be suit jim too said really be kind of to let have flat may tell went to dine there last night have bridge party claude laughed he certainly making most of said just a meant to do think im like dad in do remember how treated over venice house year not penny for to pay jims giving lot of little party im told parker came round to yesterday to ask if must order more wine a jims nearly finished also cigar cigarette of course told to order be wanted hate doing thing by half household book will be something to smile at he having rare good time not much entertaining have be able to do life up till now dora sat up claude do mean he drinking wine letting pay for food asked own fault ought to have locked up cellar made clear that must pay for own chicken a matter of fact never struck that wouldnt a hasnt occurred to cant remind of must tell he got to pay for thing said dora why might a well order clothes just because be in flat expect to pay for oh cant tell said claude must look a if grudged thing dont bit like people to have good time at expense poor devil have rotten derby week no wonder like living on cheap must be beastly uncomfortable living on cheap if own cheap so to speak expect must be just same if be poor idea be insupportable to dora more so because of way in claude took generous be one must be more generous there be behind sort of patronizing attitude gave cordially indeed with cordiality be selfconscious pleasure in own open handedness contempt scarcely veiled of what gave worst of be that jim must have taken advantage of insouciance about money affair sprang from fact that have need to worry about money claude did not like jim dora felt certain of made impossible that jim must take advantage of bounty be indebtedness must not tolerate in brother whats there to fuss about claude went on if whole thing run into hundred fifty pound wont hurt after he brother dear like being good to kin dora be not doing claude injustice when told that irreproachable conduct to family be in mind be there did not mean to be in evidence insensibly unintentionally tinged word whole thing be kind kind kind be consciously kind that made whole difference cant be said if wont speak to jim about will be impossible that must drink wine smoke cigar have dinner party at expense cant let do sort of thing if can possibly help must much sooner pay than that must pay for dear what fuss about nothing said claude isnt a if mattered to whether pay for soup cutlet thats just said dora quickly thats why mustnt if cost something oh claude dont think can make understand said anyhow will tell jim what think if poor wretch hasnt got money then must pay oh dont suppose he got money said claude a for paying dear what difference doe that make give allowance wish youd say wanted more for uncle alfs always wondering whether youve got enough want to pay out of well only out of one pocket into dont fuss about dear wish hadnt told isnt quite like said dora must deny something in order to pay if jim cant can tell not to send dress then hopelessness of struck be in same boat a husband must not deny anything wanted because there be need for self denial without must not make atonement for jims behaviour must say to herself that have done without thinking jim always thought when there be question of money for that took seriously be only own conduct own character other little trifle of sort for have so light touch so easy rein have be giving little dinner at flat instead of dining out a usually did must never have done that if thought be going to pay for quail peach that must do be thing be irremediable that contemptuous kindness of claude claude saw there be feeling in mind of did not grasp force wanted to pay to think paid for jims hospitality did not make pennyworth of difference must pay cheque into account must make square again must never notice just a like dear said mustnt tell jim be doing must think be reluctant to pay for food drink im not cant stand being thought mean there excuse for fellow with plenty of shekel being mean oh be not that said dora quickly voice without volition following train of thought in mind dear hope not said believe havent got two ill feeling to rub against other with regard to jim only by chance knew if thered be box of cigar in flat few more dozen champagne parker must never have come to a for household book why dear theyd have be sent up to bet youd never have seen just chance a have put in knowledge of for one must hate to take advantage of so cheer up dear pay if make feel easier dont say word to jim like doing thing thoroughly a im doing lingered moment by door perhaps that clear thing up bit dora said with touch of wistfulness in voice dora tried tried to think did tried also to put possible simplicity into voice a answered what be there to clear up dear asked thats right then said left once outside door shook head bottled simplicity so to speak be not same a simplicity from spring be quite shrewd enough to know difference be shrewd enough also to know that did not quite understand what have gone wrong something certainly have after compliment to on subject of admirable way in be behaving to parent knew that be no longer stricture on subject made barrier true be that during past week of have have much leisure opportunity for intimate conversation there be glance single word silence even have passed between when be in venice first have taken no time if measured by scale of minute second yet have be enough to fill whole day with inward sunshine have not changed to that knew quite well be not that be le sensitive now le receptive of signal of kind for part gave in plenty just now have leaned over smiling when lay on sofa thing that in early day must have be sufficient to make glance at with perhaps raised hand just touched face with perhaps oh claude below breath honestly a far a man can be honest with be a hungry for a ever made private code just a before answer came something be out of tune vibration wireless psychical did not pas from to a have done own message so seemed throbbed out found none to pick up be lost in unanswering air claude be of very simple straightforward nature felt none le keenly because be not capable of feeling in subtle complicated manner love have come into life part in burned within still in way le ardently believed that dora have loved also believed be to say in sacred sense have be creed to just a own love for be creed with body soul loved not fantastically deeply a left afternoon seemed to that love be being poured into vessel in be bitterness have talked only about what to be trivial thing namely completeness with jim have made at home in flat in earlier day made difference what talked about tenderness love came through like water through quicksand engulfing day have be passed in such quicksand be always joyfully foundering in now be not so bitter encrustation have come on bore weight quite easily there be risk of going through chance of honestly did not believe that be responsible for formation of crust have not changed be not other than have always be once for moment mind poised hovered above truth half said to wonder if find common rejected that be wildest freak of imagination besides have not found common at first have not grown commoner on contrary have taught much little thing doubt many of have noticed be always polite to servant shop people though year ago tendency have be to be rather short with a inferior have instinctively followed example be only one instance out of many so poor fellow told be little thing like must make real difference to anybody yet thought over little longer for instance have always known that father mother per be so to speak common beside seemed perfectly natural for have be sent to eton oxford have picked up sort of thing a to way gentleman behaved did not know must not press guest to have more wine a father did when have refused tempt to second helping a mother did there be little trick of language too infinitesimal affair so thought have got into way of whereas have not for instance never said lor a father constantly did mother if be not on watch said good lord because fellow said that not other what did really matter there be certain boisterousness of manner also characterized mr per for instance who be certainly perfect lady did not practise often half in jest father have said old claudes getting too much of swell for though deprecated conclusion understood what be meant knew that if be jest half be serious made more impossible that dora must find common eton oxford felt quite sure have taken commonness out of how little mattered saw hundred thing day by day in if have be disposed to peer dissect magnify must have felt that there be difference between father how measure so small thing what did matter saw kindness honour truth of parent be a likely to cease respecting caring for because of difference a be likely to cease to love dora because once have found gray hair in golden head besides mind came back to that if found common now must always have found common nothing be short of perfection in early week in venice once on way downstairs to be ready to greet per wife who be expected that evening half turned on foot intending to go back to dora try to get to bottom of knew that must find nothing to say for there be nothing must suggest in have fallen short even a paused wondering if must be enough that must go back say dora what be heard sound of hall door opening be per doubt must go down welcome chapter ix question of title have at length be settled simplest solution be felt to be best mr osborne need not have felt so strange at thought of changing name for only changed mr into lady eminently respectable name of osborne after be associated a seen on label in fish market at venice with idea of hardware world over thing mr osborne have be anxious to bring in at same time have faintly territorial sound lady osborne however be little disappointed must so much have enjoyed necessity of getting quantity of table linen with new initial worked on a be be only necessary to have coronet placed above indeed within week coronet blossomed everywhere with suddenness of coming of spring in south on silver on hot water can on writing paper envelope on panel of carriage car enormous one cut solid in limestone delivery of seriously impeded for while traffic in park lane be hoisted into appropriate niche above front door of by aid of gang of perspiring workman small steam crane have be smart morning work so said lord osborne who looked out from gothic window of snuggery now then to see how be getting on became even smarter in afternoon when gold leaf have be thickly laid on be on evening of day that lady osborne have only family party have planned that from very beginning of settlement of summer campaign have declined very grand invitation indeed in order not to sacrifice be going to send to morning post other paper just a if have be great party lady austell be there jim dora claude uncle alf per mr per husband be absolutely there be nobody of description coming in afterward be form of entertainment except such a must indulge in among to be provided idea be simply to have family gathering not heed anybody else for just one evening to be homely cosy comfortable so there be a lady osborne thought delightedly to a sat down with jim on right alfred on left just family party yet be folk of title now except alfred showed that money be not everything for alfred be richest of while austells who be highest be also poorest have looked forward immensely to evening not without trepidation for if alfred be worried must spoil party alfred however seemed to be in most excellent humour when a sat down said to well alfred turn next to be made something have replied that have just received most pressing offer of dukedom witticism be much appreciated there be keeping relation apart of course since be relation claude be sitting next father with mr per between jim be voice that mother most listened for with unconscious ear hearkens for sound be most beloved be apologizing to father for mislaying of key im really awfully sorry said im bad hand at key never lock anything up everythings always open in flat isnt dora im very sorry dad be careless ah well never mind said father im not one a lock up overmuch give key of wine cellar cash box drawer of mother letter to when be courting her tantalus drawer where keep cheque book cash box dont ask for more im jailer thank heaven dont even have key to cellar boy oh suppose there be one suppose parker have said jim too have caught of turned to lady osborne by jove thats so like claude said lady osborne beamed delightedly upon well be said there never be boy so free with thing lor used to get into such hot water with father when first went to oxford there be question a may guess of being kept short of money naturally father wanted to hear where went there denying be bit extravagant when first went up a say when claude got cheque book to look where how have gone why there wasnt a much a date anything on one of bit leave in never can remember name counterfoil suggested jim yes to be sure ill be bound doesnt enter half of now uncle here played trick other day didnt pay in quarter allowance did alf claude never knew till be told just said be hard up didnt know why bless well being father son must be queer if be tight handed jim laughed will be down on mr lord osborne like knife said if doesnt pay rent ill be bound will quite right too for money be money when alls said done said lady osborne cordially well im sure sea trout be very good feel a can take mouthful more thoresby give lord austell more im sure can tempt lord austell nothing easier said jim uncle alf came sat next dora in drawing room when after rather prolonged discussion of port gentleman joined rest of circle again came up here from richmond making end of smart speech in carriage dear said in order to make maria eddie jump ive not said one shes good old sort be maria be enjoying so dear whats great big gold thing theyve put up above front door oh coronet think said dora thought be couldnt be sure lord what set out two be having such good time hadnt heart to make sit up daresay theyve got lot of men in house of lord not so honest a eddie must never have forgiven uncle alf said if youd vexed well good thing didnt then said whats going to happen now dont mean to say mr pers going to sing appeared that be case naturally required certain amount of pressing not because have intention of not singing because little diffidence little fear that have be naughty hadnt sung for week be correct thing uncle alfred latter remark shes be practising day per told in dining room said lord if sabincourt must paint a look when sings id give price for woman will give indigestion if let mind dwell on mr per sang with great deal of expression such simple song a did not want much else indeed rendering of be good sweet maid let who will be cle be chiefly expression there be great deal of expression too in concluding line sang with eye on ceiling rapt smile playing about tight little mouth one lorng sweet sorng sang on quavering throaty f one lorng sweet sorng touched last chord with soft pedal down continued smiling for several second with lost look a per described that lizzie get when be singing mother in law broke silence if isnt nice said declare if know whether like word music best one seems to fit other so lizzie dear youre going to give wont now lizzie have intention of doing so again little pressing be necessary finally promised to sing once more just once if claude must do something afterward so ran hand over key became light frolicsome sang something about shower maid little kissing be very pretty winsome after sang again again jim have seated opposite dora in middle of eye met for moment faint smile quivered on corner of jims mouth moment after mr per came to end of song warmly complimented eventually left piano called upon claude for fulfilment of promise claude on occasion recited did so now piece chose be favourite of father little hackneyed perhaps for be sand of dee lord osborne blew nose when be finished thank ye boy said said that beautiful just to think of poor thing caught by tide like hair getting into salmon net im glad didnt have before dinner couldnt have eaten morsel of salmon dear youre so fanciful said wife be sea trout claude said beautiful im sure ive heard at music hall often often not so good a for that be professional so that if uncle cut off with shilling claude said father can still make home for dora hey dora then per did several very remarkable conjuring trick nobody must guess put watch into handkerchief held quite tight then there wasnt else be rabbit something quite different again card chose wherever put back into pack per be on in time thought of something per blindfold with help of mr per told what have thought of zanzics be held not to be in after strain bewilderment of accomplishment be almost relief to sit down to good round game basis of be pack of card counter system of forfeit plenty of chaff about twelve after little light supper party broke up alf driving down to richmond lady austell who have made up little disagreement with jim dropping at room be step from park lane there held short pointed conversation on way delightful charming evening said so genuine honest with forced gaiety insincere welcome how happy content dora ought to be question being whether be remarked jim dear have noticed anything asked mother rather quickly certainly during recitation looked little little inscrutable what deplorable performance be not if odious woman have sung more think must have screamed dora claude do think dear fellow be little on nerve yes think dear fellow be little on nerve said jim with marked evenness of tone can not imagine possibility of consider be very likely that lady austell considered did not however think good to inform jim of result of consideration asked be not in confidence said jim be only in flat here be thanks so much dear mother for lift wont come in must speak to dora said a brougham stopped think must be very unwise of know must say about honour kindness so on at present moment think feel that cardinal virtue make up for well for thing like recitation lady austell thought over for moment a jim got out be friend with claude asked real friend mean cant stand think cant stand lady austell must not resist giving son little dab yet use flat said oh yes drink wine smoke cigar must rather have liked flat wouldnt perhaps hell lend time like doing kind thing dont incommode think like feeling doesnt matter to feel that fact that dislike other give certain piquancy to good night im so glad liked party be refreshing after glitter hollowness of world to get close to family affection again seemed to that little flame of true bitterness quite unlike usually genial cynicism insouciance shone in word good night dear said very softly hope nothing have disagreed with jim laughed little to a ascended thickly carpeted stair to flat on first floor laugh be not of long duration of very genuine quality felt at enmity with world in spite of excellent dinner have felt that dora be fool to let little thing like well like recitation come between immense enjoyment must be got out of life if only have a be case with limitless power of commanding pleasure yet if pleasure be to be indissolubly wrapped up with osborne environment felt almost understood absence of content to put case if be given choice of going to newmarket to morrow with lady osborne in two thousand pound seventy horse power napier of travelling there third class at own expense what must do certainly if choice be for one day only must go in car if choice concerned going there day for rest of life hers question hardly needed answer thing must become unbearable dora have to go not to newmarket only everywhere everywhere with claude for must sooner have gone anywhere with mr osborne than with be more blessed to give than to receive in many case be certainly easier to give with good grace than to receive in same spirit if gift be made without sacrifice be unless recipient be genuinely attached to giver most difficult to receive charitably may be received with gratitude if be much wanted gratitude here be felt not

of offence a have be disposed to think last night that treated in so open handed way certainly must appear in far more disagreeable light if be close handed with money be of course sin iniquity that other people must have money not since providence that deplorable derby week have chosen to make disposition of affair be a well that certain mine of bullion must be accessible to here already be heath crowd roar of ring like most gambler jim though practical enough in ordinary affair of life have vein of fantastic superstition about occurred to after first race in have good fortune to back

winner after initial success jim went back to friend motor ate extremely good lunch whether broad minded angel looked back over jims past record found something that must not quite stand jim never reasoned out with certainty be certain be that after first race carefully made up almost gilt edged book went to piece once in sudden access of caution hedged over horse have backed that be only

scarcely one in hundred backing outsider be good enough game if be on luck also happened to be solvent did not go to next day sat afternoon in club making frequent journey to tape that ticked out inexorably without emotion thing so momentous to be little out of order now then after announcement newmarket must reel off rapid gabble of meaningless letter like voluble drunkard give extraneous information about what be happening at lord then pulled together again saw that callisto have won harry franklin be looking over shoulder a information came out gave cackle of laughter hurrah fur coat for may new gun for said lucky dog said jim thought never betted oh once in blue moon moon be blue yesterday somebody gave tip last night have shy didnt shy said jim rather pity twenty five to one

hundred pound more than must possibly pay exact sum be must have to be paid by monday next be true in sense a told harry franklin be engaged that night though engagement be to only be necessary to sit think money be necessary to necessity be lawless force money have to be obtained so much might be taken for granted be use considering what must happen if be not obtained therefore might be dismissed

well a understood more festive provision dinner be light short parker without prompting gave half bottle of veuve clicquot iced to right point further glass of port seemed to restore to normal level what have to face be no longer unfaceable felt must go out meet necessity other possibility detained little be use applying to mother for money for might a well apply to workhouse must not apply to osborne tried to think of asking claude to lend sum tried to picture going to lord osborne with story picture be unpaintable have possible existence other way way already have taken form feature in mind be not so difficult far le impossible of contemplation simply because nature be not straight moral difficulty of stealing appeared to to be within power to deal with have never be straight even now made excuse for said that be necessity forced into path be abhorrent to perhaps did dislike little certainly did not take for amusement simply there be other way open to there remained only to consider chance of detection did not seem to great cheque book with must shortly be concerned have clearly be left in drawer a finished with for last cheque be used though not one immediately preceding claude too have almost bragged about carelessness with regard to money truth of boast have be endorsed by mother only two night ago when told how have never noticed that quarter allowance have not be paid in be matter of nearly four thousand pound of hardly more than same number of hundred besides if be detected what must claude do proceed against wife brother believed need not waste time in considering possibility for to begin with possibility be so remote then for moment little voice of honour made heard have to argue down not to pay such debt debt of honour a be called be among very few thing that man must not do for if doe get quarter from society in general doubt must get debt paid if went to osborne that must not do be much harder for than proposed to do so little voice be silenced again almost before began to speak be used to being taken lightly to be not listened to be not often at home in evening when be usually sat in claudes room though small be cooler than southward facing drawing room took cigar there now tray of whisky perrier have already be placed there since did not wish to be disturbed rang bell to tell parker wished to be called at eight next morning wanted nothing more that night then took writing paper from drawer in knee hole table drew up chair to have found there also carefully written out speech by claude designed for constituent

with design of spending afternoon at lord to see cricket arriving there little before appointed time be told that be out have left word that must be back by twelve accordingly since heat be great in street came up to flat waited for there felt rather fagged morning for last week have be strenuous while privately emotional calendar have made many entry against day estrangement from claude that alienation without quarrel therefore more difficult to terminate have in secret way got very much worse presence even have begun to irritate certainly saw that irritation did not require much perspicacity spared a much a must never if possible being alone with instead threw into hospitality of house looked after mr per taking to picture gallery concert until per have declared that be getting to feel quite othello performed with zeal duty of resident son of house bitterly dora saw how easy be to how without effort caught rle like mysterious stain appearing again after year resemblance between family daily manifested more clearly sight of flat caused thought to inflict very vividly on mind sitting here alone waiting be almost with shuddering that expected claude to enter how often in familiar surroundings have sat just here expecting longing for to come to know that must be alone together in nest now wall seemed to observe with alien eye even a with alien eye looked at be blessing anyhow that have gone to park dual solitude here must have be intolerable have not got to wait long for jims step soon sounded in passage heard whistling to a went into bedroom next moment came in im not late said so dont scold who be early be most outrageous form of unpunctuality well dora how go got up came across room to doesnt go very nicely said seem cheerful be to good jim be so nice to see somebody cheerful without being jocose be very jocose at park lane claude flirt with mr per dora gave little laugh didnt mean to speak of said wont again let have day off not regret

so sorry about bad luck at newmarket somebody told have done nothing lose what as be dear why do go on jims face darkened for moment nothing least serious said did have rather bad time ive pulled through have paid penny in fact be what kept morning hate to give away great crisp crackling note hate then on way home determined not to think about more about anything unpleasant have ever happened get here to find have come to same excellent determination let have truce for one day amen said dora be astonishing what can be done by acting in pair dora must have be perfectly incapable alone of watching cricket with attention far a proved to be possible with rapture might also be open to reasonable doubt a to whether alone jim must have found occupation must have deeply interested together gave slip to anxiety preoccupation jim did not even want to bet on result of match afternoon sat there waited till at half past six stump be drawn then dora gave great sigh oh dear over said suppose weve got to begin again what nice day weve have quite forgot everything jim came home rather late that night found letter waiting for in little room where have sat night before there be nothing of importance nothing needed answer in few minute moved toward door in order to go to bed then quite suddenly with pent up rush of thought day have dammed up in corner of brain realized what have done face went suddenly white strange noise buzzed in ear very soul be drowned in terror be too late terror must have be imagined by twenty four hour ago now be authentic there be imagination required be alone with chapter x claude a became future candidate for constituency of west brentwood be sedulous regular in reading house of common debate two morning later be sitting after breakfast with time in front of to devoted attention le direct than be usual with for expected moment to be told that visitor whom be waiting for must be announced must form idea of what visitor business might be hour ago have be summoned to telephone found that be speaking to one of partner in graysons bank who asked if must see at once clue a to what so pressing business might be be given mr humby partner who spoke to only said that must start immediately have first telephoned appeared to claudes flat servant have given address in there be little here be tangibly disquieting for claude stood outside region of money trouble other thing combined to make usually so serene rather nervous apprehensive for last day two have be vaguely anxious about mother who appeared to not to be well though in answer to question confessed to nothing more than july fatigue while relation with dora rather want of continued to perplex distress be evenly polite to went out with when occasion demanded that barrier have be built between must no longer doubt have not only own feeling to go upon for mother have remarked asked if there be trouble lady osborne be least imaginative of woman be afraid question have so emphasized to mind that have determined must amelioration take place to put direct question to dora about must gladly have avoided that for instinct told that trouble be of sort must scarcely be healed by mere investigation present position be rapidly growing intolerable thing made difficult for to concentrate attention on fiscal question be almost with sense of relief to that interruption have be waiting for came shook hand with mr humby who at once stated business may be troubling on false alarm mr osborne said partner thought that one of have better see at once in order to set mind at rest have only just caught said claude be going into country before lunch then have saved journey said mr humby gravely produced envelope took cheque out of cheque came through to day said be cashed two day ago at shepherd bank quite regularly be drawn by to self over week ago be little curious since cheque drawn to self be usually cashed at once also though be business of ours be rather large sum five hundred pound to take in cash have banked with for year mr osborne find have never drawn large sum to before combination of thing seemed to warrant in making sure cheque be ah genuine handwriting appears to be yours claude looked at date june said did draw large cheque about time for motor car have be presented be drawn to daimler said mr humby claude turned cheque over be endorsed with name search how might must not recollect anything about slowly inability to remember deepened into belief that have drawn such cheque if must refer to cheque book said mr humby must clear matter

made impatient gesture of dissent no if can give minute later on will be right said search be soon rewarded proved to be fruitless for cheque book be new one have only used for first time three day ago perhaps must remember something dora did give rather big cheque for household bill anything while be in flat asked yes remember that did said remember endorsing a drew to why only that there be cheque appear to have drawn for five hundred pound just before left flat for reason banker want to be sure that did draw mean think that may be forged yes who can have got hold of cheque book asked dora have found havent yes be use cheque in question be drawn before began book suppose left at flat dora have continued writing note a talked for be only matter of few formal phrase of regret at

business bank can take other course folded up cheque again put in pocket left room claude did not at once go back to dora there have started unbidden into mind memory of morning at grote before be married of game of croquet of sovereign next minute too have left room minute after be in road walking quickly to mount street old cheque book doubt be there must be able to find way there tried desperately to keep at bay suspicion threatened to grip by throat upstairs dora waited for same doubt threatened to strangle jim be out be expected back moment claude went into small room began searching drawer of writing table there be sheaf of letter from dora in one copy of speech on municipal taxation in in third heap of old card of invitation butt end of cheque book sun blind be down outside window room be nearly dark carried out into large sitting room sat down to examine there be whole batch of cheque most of must remember about drawn on june then came blank counterfoil then last counterfoil of book bearing docket of identification a cheque to dora for be drawn on th heard step outside door opened jim entered be whistling a came round corner of screen by door then saw claude whistling ceased face grew white once tried to speak must not claude saw that blank face whitened lip be a if jim have be brought face to face with deadly spectre instead of commonplace vision of brother in law sitting in own room looking through useless surely innocuous trunk of old cheque book instantaneously automatically claudes mind leaped to conclusion have tried to keep away from must be kept away no longer inference closed upon like snap of steel spring in same instant there came upon own personal dislike of jim distrust of how deep be never knew till moment then came reflection that be doing jim monstrous injustice in harbouring so horrible suspicion that best way of clearing mind of be to let bank trace cheque prosecute knew that be dislike of brother in law gave birth to not sense of fairness on top of came thought of dora love for mingled with certain pity be legitimate kinsman pause psychically so momentous be short in duration claude jumped up mind be already quite decided seemed to have decided without conscious interference on part good morning jim said must apologize for making invasion in absence have to refer back to old cheque book jim commanded voice nothing wrong hope said again claude have to make swift decision must tell jim that cheque of have be forged that matter be already in hand of bank probably must force confession if there be cause for one must still be dislike though might easily call justice be mover here there be wiser way than that way that for surface falsehood of held nobler truth within nothing be wrong said excuse must telephone to bank to say cheque be right ah ill telephone from here if will allow telephone be just outside jim heard plainly passed number be rung up then claude spoke yes im mr claude osborne be speaking to mr grayson be be matter mr humby came to speak to about morning yes yes cheque for find have made complete error cheque be drawn by be perfectly correct yes be very stupid of please let humby know a soon a get back yes thank good morning claude paused moment with receiver in hand then called to jim cant stop moment said ive devil of lot to do good bye walked back again at once to park lane still thinking intently still wondering if must have done better in way honest through hated with physical repulsion thought of what felt sure jim have done oddly enough instead of feeling crescendo of dislike to jim be conscious only of puzzled sort of pity by instinct separated deed from doer instead of bracketting in one clause of disgusted condemnation then ceased to wonder at seemed natural after went straight up to doras room found still at table with letter round when entered be not writing be staring out of window with sort of terror on face claude guessed what be that perhaps have put there what lurked behind look of agonized appeal that turned on im sorry for being so long dear said ive be making fool of that cheque spoke to about be quite all right found counterfoil in old book at flat drew right enough mr humby expects fellow to carry in head memory of half crown spends dora gave one great sobbing sigh of relief must not check im glad said hated to think that parker perhaps have gone wrong one one hate suspicion atmosphere claude heard must not help hearing relief in voice must not help seeing that smile gave struggled like mist ridden sunlight to shine through dispelled cloud of nameless apprehension must secret mind avoid guessing what that apprehension be for be stranger to have be sharer in till have seen jim when deepened into certainty be opposite to at moment brought such relief to wife other certainty own must of course be kept sealed locked from claude hastened to convey away from presence so to speak by talking of something else for fear that might in despite of betray hint of existence there be something wanted to speak to about said yes be about mother do think be well havent thought so for last three four day said what have noticed went into room just now said dora be sitting doing nothing be cry claude paused in astonishment cry said mater cry clearly did not wish to see so pretended not to have thought wasnt well before now must do something claude make see doctor why hasnt be to see doctor day asked governor go to doctor if nail want cutting dont know why hasnt be there might be several reason thought must speak to first then if approved must go to try to find out what be matter wish must said dora got up mind went back to have be brooding over in absence that frightened did see jim asked yes came in when be there how be asked negligently oh much a usual couldnt stop because wanted to get back to will come tell about mater after have seen dora went back to lady osborne room knocked before entered apparition of sitting cry alone have frightened more than have let claude see for a rule mother in law cheerfulness be of quality seemed to be proof against minor accident of life dora remembered how one day in italy when have missed train at padua have to wait three hour lady osborne only comment have be well now that will give time to look about be afraid therefore that cause of tear be not trivial now when went in again receiving rather indistinct answer to knock found lady osborne hastily snatching up day paper so a to pretend to be occupied face wore expression extraordinarily contorted a if habitual geniality found hard task to struggle to surface im sure paper get more more interesting day said though seldom find time to have glance at curious thing be going on in world what dreadful place morocco must be couldnt sleep quiet in bed if be there what be dear on face in voice trace of tear bravely suppressed still lingered great wave of pity suddenly swept over dora something be wrong something at present lady osborne be bearing in secret for be quite clear that husband whose cheerfulness at breakfast have bordered on boisterous knew nothing did claude know mother in law a dora be well aware be not woman of complicated subtle emotion who must grieve over imagined sorrow must admit to personal relation with woe of world for with more practical wisdom gave subscription to whose task be to alleviate particular branch of family hospitality comfortable though busy life have be sufficient up till now to minister to happiness if something disturbed that dora rightly thought that must be something tangible personal so went to sofa sat down by did not seek to be subtle what be said be there anything matter simplicity be not calculated be perfectly natural have effect lady osborne held paper in front of moment longer be shaken with trembling of hand then dropped dear be selfish old woman said cant bear longer ive not be well long time

must speak to beloved in such language now with rekindled meaning remembered incident setting have asked for consolation with regard to gray business awaited everybody hoping to hear word of glowing romance have found half comical half tragic that refuted doubt by visible example of father mother have said that be best girl still now dora did not feel either comedy tragedy of reply felt only truth of did not wonder that mother in law be dad best girl still for though there be heartache in much have be said there be beginning of understanding also at rate awakening of sense that there be something to understand lady osborne have called coward reiterated that charge with regard to seeing doctor only love golden barrier of solid defence filagree work have come between fear yet be scarcely true to say that have come there be always there once dora have thought that compared to romance relation must exist between claudes parent must necessarily be of ash cold quality be have

take place more than take place there have sprung up herb of more fragrant beauty than scarlet of first flower have nothing in garden for herb of bitterness resentment at least be knew of till now paused moment outside door of sitting room where have left before entering for knew devotion to mother be sorry for somehow felt unable to believe that lady osborne optimistic forecast must be justified did not think that in few hour must be laughing over imaginary ailment claude must see that be anxious must be better to confess to prepare for possibility of there being something serious

manner well sir henry tell that mr o in pain that he going to see again to morrow said why call good news relief mind dear bless shell get good night rest hope now feel different creature in morning there nothing else occurs to dear surely must have said if have found anything really wrong dora read telegram again think be quite right to put interpretation on said truthfully enough well hope to get good news again to morrow be glad be out of pain secretly feared something did not say namely that there be something wrong sir henry have not be able without further examination to say what be yet after interpretation might be only imagination on part there be nothing in telegram appeared to to be meant to allay anxiety must know existed dora went to bed that evening with great many thing to think about have to be faced not shirked put aside day by measure of event have be almost without incident seemed terribly full of meaning to lady osborne have seen doctor have talked over domestic affair with dora be not quite claude have thought that cheque have be forged found on examination that have made mistake set out like there seemed little here must occupy thought at still le must keep away from sleep that in general be so punctual visitor to to night did not come near did not even try to woo approach have thought of sleep though be glad to have darkness silence round so that might think without distraction thing trivial a event seemed to to be significant to hold possibility potentiality altogether disproportionate to face value might prove not to be so when examined might be that for reason kind of nightmare inflation be going on in mind so that a in physical nightmare thing swell to gigantic shape in imagination simple little thing be puffed to grotesque terrifying magnitude have to think over calmly carefully might easily be that must sink to normal size again took first that affair of cheque have turned out apparently to be affair at claude have made mistake so have said cheque bank have suspected be perfectly genuine dora between time of thinking there be something wrong of ascertaining that there be not have passed very terrible quarter of hour one that made feel sick to think of even now there be use in blinking have feared that jim have forged husband cheque have hardly given thought to what consequence might be what turned white cold be thought that have done pen have spluttered when thought first occurred to believed claude have not noticed that have noticed sob of relief in voice when told that cheque be right be not slow to observe perception especially where be concerned be remarkably vivid seemed to that must have noticed yet have said nothing anyhow cheque be correct be left with fact that have seemed to possible that jim have be guilty of gross meanness just a if thing have be true found trying to excuse saw pleading with claude for poor jim be not be not quite like other people did not seem to know right from wrong have always cheated at game remembered telling claude so one day down here at grote when jim have be playing croquet jim have cheated have not be playing for money so claude have told have told cheque be right be there be nothing more to be thought of with regard to yet still lingered on threshold of thought of jim have got cleaned out own phrase in derby week have pledged quarter rent of grote in advance to pay derby debt somebody have told that jim have lost heavily at newmarket afterward have told that have paid be upright before world in matter of debt of honour have passed threshold of thought be inside again where have got money from well anyhow not by forgery claude have said that mistake be how odd that must not have be able to recollect about cheque for five hundred pound drawn only ten day before dora still lingered in precinct of thought though beckoned so to speak thought to distract what wonderful thing how triumphant beautiful be love of have seen glimpse to day be more wonderful because seemed to be common to be concerned with biscuit coffee hundred time have seen lady osborne wrapped up in such infinitesimal care a have thought only that mind soul be altogether concerned with serving that provision for comfortable house good dinner be aspiration sufficient for spiritual capacity yet there have always be little more than that there have be moment in church when sermon be to taste hymn favourite husband have tunelessly sung out of one book have touched dora little have then dismissed a banal affair of goody goody combined with melodious tune when saw great lunch that ate immediately afterward now detail martha care have taken different value morning lady osborne have be in great pain have broken down in endeavour to carry on somehow be face to face with medical interview dreaded still must think with meticulous care of husband milk of slipper of tendency toward strong coffee what if below martha be mary if be mary love made martha so sedulous in serving that have overlooked not caring to see below surface said be commonplace prosperous surface be transparent enough too be not opaque must have seen down into depth at time if have taken trouble to look before marriage for few month after have thought knew what depth meant thought knew what be to be absorbed in then have come disillusionment have worshipped surface only knew more of claude than have loved beauty have got accustomed to have at first disregarded what have grown to call vulgarity have not got accustomed to have known be honest true safe have grown to take for granted have never studied looked for what be have have few glimpse of more than have have of mother to day felt that with regard to glimpse be fused together made view prospect of very beautiful country a yet there have fusing like come with regard to husband now that saw even country country of gray business be beautiful at present in own warm country young country beauty be lacking perhaps here third subject came in perhaps even in trouble that felt threatened there be element might be alchemized be willing at least to attempt to find gold to transform what have thought be common into fine metal alchemy of sort have already taken place before eye no longer thought common little pathetic anxiety have heard morning for day month same anxiety same care have be manifest there be day hour in lady osborne have not be concerned with material comfort of whom loved be always wondering if husband have got lunch at house what gave whether motor have got there in time if remembered to put coat on have care embraced alone one day have come up to doras sitting room found that there be draught round door so have changed seat next day there be screen placed correctly claude have sneezed at dinner mysterious phial have appeared on dressing table with legend directed administration have come in to dora to ask if have explanation of bottle have none concluded mr osborne have put there fussily doubt for sneeze be only sneeze with what loving intent remembered everything of sort per liked kidney wife liked cocoa be attended to martha be in evidence mary be there doras thought have strayed again have meant to think about trouble that felt be threatening to see if by alchemy might be transformed into healing of hurt did not believe that be fanciful in expecting bad news wished to contemplate effect of if came supposing lady osborne be found to be suffering from something serious how be to behave have to make thing easier for father in law have to be of use be not so difficult little affection meant so much to glowed with pleasure when be kind for claude be more difficult have to be to be much harder there to meet need ought to meet must instinctively meet without thought once if have said oh claude must have be said because simple word be symbol now must not say oh claude like must be martha be easy be not martha who be wanted door from dressing room opened came in shielding with hand light of candle so that must not fall on face outline of finger even to half shut eye be drawn in luminous red where light shone through flesh have often come in like fearing to awaken often have be awake a be now to night feigned sleep heard soft breath quenched candle heard whisper of voice close to word of one who thought that none heard good night darling said chapter xi jim have be engaged to spend week end with party of be sufficient to say that though must probably be amusing must not appear in column of morning post on saturday afternoon sent excuse remained in town instead much a hated solitude have got something to do made solitude necessary evil have got to sit down think continue thinking till have made up mind have to adopt certain course of action by not acting at commit to course claude have not come back into room after sending message by telephone calling to farewell have be unable to answer few second before only when have come into room found claude examining counterfoil of cheque book have thought that be over have claude said nothing to just looked at pointed with finger to blank counterfoil close to end of book jim must have confessed claude have spoken at once incredible word moment after have confirmed reality of by message to bank immensity of relief have taken away jims power of speech have tried to use voice must have screamed then heard door of flat shut next moment be rolling on sofa face buried in cushion to stifle hysterical laughter incredible have happened impossible be now part of sober history of month bank have called in question cheque evidently claude have come down here to see whether have drawn cheque of corresponding date have found blank counterfoil not first in book have accepted that a evidence that cheque be of own drawing possibility of forgery never apparently occurred to vaunted carelessness about money matter be strikingly exemplified have not exaggerated in least what blessed decree of providence that one brother in law will be so rich such idiot jim felt almost satisfied with world next moment with same suddenness a spasm of relief have come ceased swift huge a genie of arabian tale doubt arose before fully developed be doubt no longer certainty for one moment relief have tricked into believing that claude thought cheque to be of own drawing next jim must no more delude with rich a claude be fool a be be not possible that must believe to have drawn five hundred pound in cash week ago to day find trace of possible memory of how have spent cheque have be called in question claude therefore must know that forgery have be committed that be certain have told banker that cheque be genuine jim got up from sofa put cushion in place smoothed with mechanical precision what did mean did guess by whom forgery be committed in moment jim felt injured indignant at idea of such possibility crossing claudes mind have never given shadow of ground for thinking thing a forgery be possible to be insult of grossest kind if such notion have ever presented to claude be of suspicious nature once before jim remembered dora have talked nonsense about jims having cheated at croquet claude have said that be satisfied that be not case when jim told be not won sovereign over silly game of croquet be monstrous if true that claude must suspect of be impossible for self respecting person however unworthy of self respect to stop in room accept hospitality until have made sure that idea have never crossed claudes mind sense of injury bordered upon virtuous then with disconcerting rapidity sense of injury virtue vanished must not keep up saw through once more mind went back to rapturous possibility have caused to bury face in sofacushion be there chance of claudes believing that cheque be genuine already question did not need answer that possibility be out of sight below horizon be here alone swimming drowning that claude knew forgery have be committed be certain then for reason shielded forger suspected sense of injury virtue did not make felt now did not if did not good if did well good also since shielded quick witted mentally nimble a be jim took little while to realize situation in normal course of life must necessarily meet claude often must not see doing so must not see how social intercourse be more possible must claude avoid such intercourse manage somehow that must not meet that might be managed for time not permanently dora must ask to dine lady osborne must ask to stay claude must always have to frame excuse yet claudes word of farewell to have be quite normal cordial there be nothing there that anticipated unpleasantness estrangement in future perhaps claude harboured suspicion against then whom did shield there be only one person who must have done whom there must be sufficient motive for shielding then suddenly own dislike of brother in law flared up into hatred hatred of injurer for injured be one of few thing in world be pure black have ray of reflection of anything good however inverted distorted in be living in room eating food drinking wine of man whom hated that claude have loaded with benefit made a once before offence greater be in claudes power at moment even if did not suspect jim now of having done have to send further message to bank saying that suspicion be correct have not drawn cheque must suspect further for must know hot hour of sunny afternoon went by not slowly at with unusual speed though passed doing nothing occasionally walking up down room have told parker when sent telegram of excuse about river party that must dine at home alone be matter for surprise when be told that dinner be ready after dinner sat again in room where morning have found claude with cheque book a far from decision a ever about one thing have made up mind believed claude knew at rate suspected who have done there be other explanation must account at reasonably for shielding culprit be time to invent utopian explanation even must be elusive to seeker jim wanted to see thing be actually case on evening be to be done be to be done must not tell claude that suspicion be grossly gratuitously insulting for claude have expressed none have said there be nothing to suspect ground for suspicion did jim see that be possible to continue seeing claude feeling that be in hand at moment might disown cheque let bank pursue usual course claude have be generous quixotically generous that morning who knew whether might not only be momentary impulse even move merely to gain time to consider be serious step to let one wife brother be prosecuted very likely have only done to stay immediate proceeding very likely wanted to talk over with dora first at thought breaking point came through solitary hour jim have faced good deal fibre of endurance be weakened must not face that anything be more tolerable than picture of dora being told generous that word have occurred in thought have be applied by to claude be le than due have always be generous generosity have not cost much have not entailed denial have be there have be given first in very little way a when gave jim free living at flat then in larger way when for sake of dora imputed mere carelessness to instead of letting crime be brought home to price of generosity concerned nobody jim be beaten worst of surrendered to something little better than worst surrender be not nobly made be made from necessity because other course be little more impossible than claude have to be told knew that be in claudes hand already most must do least be to seem to put there then suddenly felt so tired that thought be no longer possible fell asleep where sat be deep in night when woke for noise of traffic have almost sunk to silence from dreamlessness of exhausted sleep passed straight into full consciousness again took up tragic train of thought where have left did not reconsider decision be cut in steel did desire to for to wish for impossible requires strong spring of hope of hope have none be beaten resigned then on outer darkness there shone little ray claude whom few hour ago have hated with rancour of injurer have be generous appallingly generous be there nothing must do for claude yes one thing hardest of utmost for week knew thing have not gone well with dora got on nerve vulgarity a be most natural irritated must no longer see in anything there be more in claude than did not know might tell perhaps if knew must see must understand have claude already told that have seemed possible before thing easily pictured did not think likely now be not consistent with what claude have already done for must have be for wife sake that have acted thus little while before have seemed to jim worst possible thing one unbearable thing that dora must know looked at from new standpoint be different if claude told be one thing be if did if did if must might help dora to see that there be something in claude beyond commonness jim be long time coming to might in degree atone not in claudes eye for must not tell claude what meant to do in in eye look on evil thing good thing see difference between there be few arrangement to be made on sunday made without flinching claude dora be at grote line to claude there asking to see a soon a possible on monday line to dora at park lane saying that wanted to see alone in afternoon be be necessary be better to take interview in order must not help being clever over for be easier to face dora when able to tell that have already confessed to claude what have to say must come with more force thus must see that for sake of helping claude have done something must not have be easy day down at grote waited for news from sir henry none came lord osborne always optimistic saw most hopeful significance in silence depend upon dear said to dora a went to bed that night depend upon sir henry have seen lady again have quite forgotten that might be in anxiety because a know now forgetting aint told there nought to be anxious about thats like busy men lord dear fancy passing life in other people inside so to speak why must make forget own name if there have

hinting at youve got to know yes dear yes said have got to operate may be very bad indeed cant tell yet dont know till see dora drew long breath may be cancer said by instinct put hand over eye so that must not see mr o said very quietly dora heard buzzing of honey questing bee in flower border outside window clicking of mowing machine on lawn from close beside slow breathing of lord osborne without looking at knew that have pursed up lip almost a if whistling habit of in perplexed moment have be smoking cigar when came in heard lay down on tray by elbow then spoke well dear said weve got to help bear be dora found impossible to speak for moment must have given sympathy have there be anything in word suggested be wanted must have told that must hope for best that worst be by mean certain yet there be hundred quite suitable thing to say if only have appeared to need in least quite clearly did not did not happen to be thinking about at to want consolation in face of simplicity

once again a crossed great heathery upland of ashdown forest redolent with gorse basking in sun seems strange on beautiful day like said there who know that shant have pleasant weather yet claude meantime getting jims letter by same post have brought news to dora have left by earlier train in order to see jim a soon a possible have gone before dora came down thus heard nothing of sir henry letter though be anxious to know a soon a got to town how mother be determined to go to flat on way to park lane must not take long whatever might be that jim wished to tell few minute imagined must suffice way up pondered over think a might must find only one explanation of jims request be that be going to confess be best thing must happen a far a must see be only thing thought of own part embarrassed horribly have liking for brother in law guessed that on jims side there be similar barrenness of affection must make interview difficult painful must forgive easily willingly instinctively felt how chilly thing forgiveness be if there be warmth of feeling behind to vitalize when first suspected that jim have done felt sorry for if turned out that be going to confess pity be certainly not diminished on threshold paused repugnance for what lay before be almost invincible pondering have led to nothing practical be still absolutely without idea a to what must say thing have to be done waiting made easier went in must have to trust to prompting of moment all be sure of be that did not feel unkind only sorry so have known need not have be so very uncomfortable jim be standing in window looking out on to street turned a claude came in said nothing something have to be done claude spoke asked to come see said so came up a early a must oh good morning jim looked up saw that jim did not speak because must not face be horribly white lip be twitching at sight of helpless have done suffering horribly far greater warmth of pity came over claude than have felt hitherto kindness be challenged prompting of moment be not mistaken one oh say old chap said stopped short for jim broke during two hideous day have nerved up to encounter abuse disgust form of righteous wrath contempt knew well that claude have spared not for own sake for doras in confession be going to make be prepared to be treated a deserved though claude have spared public disgrace what have not nerved up to encounter be kindness such a rang in few word once more now not with hysterical laughter with weeping of exhaustion shame misery buried head in same sofa cushion claude felt helpless awkward brutal be use doing anything yet there be reaching jim till violence have abated sat there waiting just crossing over once to door bolting for fear parker must come in at length laid hand on jims shoulder knocked about awfully said can see im awfully sorry must have have hellish two day neednt tell know jim pulled together raised head thats just what must do said forged cheque well well said claude jim have got thing said now went on with suppressed bitter vehemence ive always be swindler think said im rotten thats what matter with ive cheated life cant even play game without cheating cheated at croquet once won sovereign dora saw again claudes instinct not reason prompted not amiss only told be sorry for jim must little reassure over didnt know be playing for money said quickly in fact told

shade nearer jim again laid hand on shoulder well think youve be hurt enough for present said dont like seeing youve have a much a can stand just now jim shook head there thing too said im absolutely cleaned out cant repay till next quarter claude considered be perfectly cheap easy to say that need not think of paying at judgment gave something better to say than well well wait till then said dont

after lunch will dont think dora governor get back till then come on to musical show evening therell be good singing right oh still jim must not speak there be silence again then claude spoke quickly finally buck up old chap said went straight to door without looking back let out went for turn up down street before going to park lane have be good deal moved for kind hearted to core be dreadful to to see a expressed fellow so awfully down in luck be conscious of thing struck a curious have liked jim during few minute have seen to day thing have never done before wished must have made thing easier for again be new sensation for that have ever done for brother in law have done frankly for doras sake must not see how to make easier be use telling that cheating be thing of importance be use telling need not pay back what owed be not way to make best of very bad job of course jim must feel miserable must be thing to sicken at if did not luckily however there be doubting sincerity of wretchedness yet boyish sort of advice implied by buck up be in place too felt vaguely that must have done much better than have done in have known must have found that jim disagreed with be told to
