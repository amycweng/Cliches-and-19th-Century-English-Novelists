sometimes be regaled with grape two usually have to sit silent unoccupied father said saw so little of during day be not surprising since first rule of house be that must never be disturbed occasionally took out for walk then might be seen stalking over down outside town stopping occasionally to revile for lagging behind followed by string of small figure in various stage of labour distress panting trotting after nightmare excursion be part of colonel raymonds system good quick walk considered panacea of childish ailment particularly tiredness be synonymous with laziness did not approve of coddling consequently mother coddled in private father walked off leg in public happy mean did not result from treatment be growing up peaked thin father have to confess that even best

of invigorating mixture cigar own thought latter be a straightforward a usually ran over in mind gain loss at whist twirling mustache lived over again moment in have assumed interesting appearance must be understood that be following colonel into innermost sanctum of being be recording what scarcely recorded consciously probably did not know how much be absorbed in two subject truth of matter be thought about little else except aristocracy to night however aristocracy held dominating place in reflection quality of meditation be not agreeable that in propos remark of wife in fact returned again again to mind must not help thinking that if arthur avesham came to live in wroxton habitual conversation about noble relative arthur father must have to be curtailed still worse corrected chapter ii in spite of colonel settled belief to contrary be perfectly true that only few month before noble relative death lord avesham have bought for arthur second youngest son share in dalton brewery in wroxton be to enter following september arthur have only just left oxford where have shown almost remarkable distaste for study indoor pursuit notable tendency not to get through examination have welcomed brewing prospect with alacrity diplomatic service for have be intended have be closed to through couple of complete graceful failure to compete successfully with other candidate have dreaded that gradual closing of other career must eventually land a have landed so many others at terrific faute de mieux bar be very long way from being stupid rather stupidity be of most limited range of range in fact only comprises date idiom fraction small part of life when be joined to incapacity for continued application amounting almost to paralysis parent guardian must be wise to reconcile to fact that love will never distinguish in examination a long however a immemorial fiction be held up before young that object of education be to enable to rise triumphant over examination so long dateless unidiomatic child will continue to feel that be disappointing parent arthur have felt at time acutely have accepted inevitable with such success that lord avesham have written down indifferent a well a stupid what be in only great sweetness of disposition be credited a insouciance too bore with equanimity harry elder brother sister jeannie have come down to morton with mother sister miss fortescue for funeral of lord avesham be going to stop there for present family council have to be held about disposition of affair one be in progress on morning in july about fortnight after lord aveshams death be certainly remarkably handsome family be to be conjectured that good look be heritage perhaps most valuable have bequeathed from father for most must be said about miss fortescue be that have very intellectual expression harry be sitting at desk with paper before miss fortescue be sitting opposite jeannie lounged in window seat arthur be resting in chair so long low that must be seen of be one knee great length of position of head be vaguely indicated by series of smoke ring floated upward at regular interval there have be silence for few moment miss fortescues baritone voice broke well what doe black sheep say demanded there be pause in smoke ring voice asked do mean aunt em yes dear whom else thought must mean be best to ask said voice im not black sheep though im only sheep harry looked up half impatient half amused oh arthur dont be so trying said really rest with id much sooner somebody settled for said arthur wont speak sheep said miss fortescue chair in arthur sat creaked struggled to foot im not good at speaking said if insist well just harry youre brick to suggest that must live here think youre wrong about in first place be poor if keep morton open will be tied here shant be able to fill house with people will not be able to keep up shooting here will be with great shell over head like bluebottle other mean insect life in palace in second place will probably marry will cramp still further in third be from own point of view purely if live here know perfectly well that with best intention in world on wet morning when dont want to go out on fine one when do will persuade be far from well not go to wroxton brewery fourthly will miss not being in london horribly youd bore to death here youre brick for suggesting thats there be moment silence so sheep have spoken said jeannie well done sheep thought said be wholly indifferent know did drove into corner miss fortescue looked at arthur approvingly for so stupid boy have glimmering of sense said oh im sharp fellow said arthur really arthur think be said harry mind offer hold perfectly good do think there be something in what say arthur stood looking from one to other with head little on one side like dog who have done trick unlike jeannie brother be fair with blue eye extraordinarily pleasant face well thems sentiment said turn jeannie know be said jeannie whats to happen to arthur demanded arthur groaned slightly ive done can be expected of said turn be over jeannie jumped up oh know said ill come keep house for in wroxton arthur harry will come down to stay with from saturday till monday well go up to stay with from from monday till saturday lot of beer will brew remarked arthur why must swim in dont much see living at wroxton jeannie said harry why not must enjoy really must well give high tea to canon think youd loathe before month be out repeated harry indeed shouldnt be so terribly unselfish thats what be matter with said arthur first harry want to let live with then want to live in funny little town in order to attend to work then jeannie want to live with aunt em give contribution try oh try to be selfish im sure can well think jeannie be right said miss fortescue must hate not living in london harry think best thing can do be to have flat there quite small so that one two of must very kindly come to stay with let jeannie arthur live in wroxton then shut morton up let youd better let if possible only for year two till youve paid iniquitous radical tax then when open again can order beer from arthur arthur gave sigh of relief well thats settled said jeannie let go into wroxton afternoon see householder house agent oh aunt em what be going to happen to be so unselfish said miss fortescue thought one of might have considered that be wrong general shout went up of come live with meeting be adjourned for time being miss fortescue who have hitherto be distinguished from aveshams generally by fact of not being at good looking have compensation be in first place exceedingly musical have about a much wit a two generation of aveshams put together be woman of very pronounced opinion though might accidentally hit upon subject on have opinion knowledge must be happy to pronounce opinion on offhand with such conviction a to lead to suppose knew something about if must induce to argue about said subject though might suspect that knew nothing whatever of yet must find difficult to bring ignorance home to must glean fact from opponent a went along use against with telling effect be next to impossible to make argue if disagreed with must raise eye to ceiling a if commending benighted condition to hand of providence like most clever people be sublimely inconsistent though genuinely abhorred idea of death of living creature must eat flesh meal without qualm may be partly accounted for by fact that hated fad a much a death of innocent animal be dislike of vegetarian rather than of vegetable diet led to so sturdy inconsistency same contradiction appeared in view about horse dog must rather walk to station though hating bodily exercise than have out horse be bursting with condition make pull same misplaced tenderness applied to treatment of dog own pug be object lesson of unwholesome overfeeding miss fortescue on particular morning have be glad by last ungenerous speech to shift responsibility of future on to other shoulder at rate to delay own decision wanted in main to determine what wanted to do must not quite make up mind have lived with aveshams since sister death eight year ago took for granted herself included that must continue to go on living with for must have much preferred to have gone on living at morton saw admitted at once reasonableness of arthur view own income with exception of hundred year for dress travelling dressed with notable cheapness never travelled be prepared to give into household coffer of branch of family decided to live with a jeannie arthur have only six hundred year between extra five hundred must give constituted additional reason for joining a far a advantage of town country be to be considered have great choice for felt thrill in stir noise of street sweet silence of country must not appreciably add to habitual tranquility hardly ever went out unless be obliged on occasion took short walk very slowly be something of mystery even to who knew best a to what did with hour must always disappear soon after breakfast if asked at lunch what have be doing must say working then if pressed further a to what work have be must only raise eye to ceiling incident must close raising of eye have long be danger signal to aveshams implied that miss fortescue be unwilling to say more on particular subject further question must only evoke severe remark on inquisitiveness jeannie arthur rode into wroxton that afternoon made house agent unhappy man house required have to be near brewery also at top of hill to begin with be impossible a brewery be at very bottom of town then have to have good smoking room two nice sitting room one for jeannie one for miss fortescue in case decided to join drawing room dining room size of be really important four excellent bed room away from street to be away from street implied garden must be private sunny extensive that red brick must be material of house be desirable not absolutely essential office miss fortescue insisted must be really good for made difference to servant whom one be bound to consider before one small stable only well aired dry be required rent of whole must be exceedingly low only point presented difficulty be office jeannie arthur be quite vague a to what office meant in half dozen house saw afternoon there be always other radical defect in one found that apartment described a sitting room be more probably intended to be house maid cupboard in disgraced by thinking that kitchen be scullery third case be more complicated for jeannie remembered about still room have to explain to antiquated caretaker what still room be what made afternoon more bewildering be that fell in love with house saw thought must do excellently with little alteration then came question of rent have hoped to find something for about hundred twenty pound year only consolation a arthur said be that at corresponding price if morton be let ought to bring to harry income of about fifty thousand year certainly seemed satisfactory sum why if must let for exclaimed with sudden splendid thought must be rich enough to live in not let at mention of morton roused house agent to rather greater interest in impracticable client appeared that there be other house might also be have if gentleman must give card have doubt that owner of bolton street must let look at have long be thinking of letting though be not exactly in market have garden be built of red brick office a usual be quite palatial different stamp of house sir quite different stamp of house different stamp of rent asked arthur gentleman be very anxious to get desirable tenant be hopeful reply come jeannie said arthur will end in taking buckingham palace matter house in question be not exactly buckingham palace within few day have taken miss fortescue drove in to see after bargaining that horse must not be used again whole of next day made up mind to stay at rate with jeannie arthur for week two a also indicated room must like chose paper for may be supposed that week two did not mean le than week two rent be not prohibitive garden be charming house stood in side street where traffic be scanty looked out behind over cathedral canon a jeannie said really hung on garden wall like ripe plum day two later rumour began to spread through wroxton that aveshams be coming to live there discussion raged colonel knew be not must think sir if cousin be coming must not be last to be informed of just gossip sir mere gossip wonder at for paying attention to scarcely even believed assurance of owner of bolton street that have actually let to for a soon a mr hanby have left room burst out mere ruse sir to send up value of house by making people think that aristocracy want to take transparent transparent did not feel quite easy about in depth of gallant heart thought again how awkward must be if be true chapter iii fortnight later jeannie miss fortescue arthur be staying at black eagle hotel employed in settling in morton have be let let unfurnished in order to avoid expense of storing be laid upon that must cram a much furniture into bolton street a must possibly hold thus from morning to night greater part of street be congested with pantechnicon van jeannie arthur might be seen many hour day measuring wardrobe finding for most part that must not go into of room miss fortescue sat in large chair in middle of street made scathing comment on appearance behaviour of others little thought said magisterial lady one day that time must come when must see nephew in shirt sleeve wrestling with towel horse in queen highway dear aunt said arthur if will look round will see distressed bicyclist who want to pas must move miss clifford in fact be approaching did not ride with overpowering command over machine from desire to avoid miss fortescue be making beeline for collision be just avoided by miss fortescues extreme agility in removing chair wardrobe be just blocking front door arthur threw down in unoccupied chair for moment rest jeannies voice sounded in passionate appeal from inside hall till wardrobe have be passed be impossible to go to aid oh be hot said why on earth did move in broiling weather aunt em dear im going to send for beer from wine merchant opposite if dont like to see drink in queen highway must look in other direction aveshams have sense of dignity said miss fortescue sweepingly doesnt matter theyll think that im not footman youre much too badly dressed for footman said aunt em well theyll think be cook im young man said arthur arthur sent one of pantechnicon men to get beer while be gone told there be so little traffic here said street be crowded with van oh there man again have passed repassed dozen time morning besides standing at corner for ever so long be friend of yours aunt em man in question be colonel raymond le strutting swelling down other side of street bursting with uneasy curiosity have a arthur said passed repassed dozen time longing to speak to one of manage to introduce in way once have given hand to one of van men with bookcase a ill luck must have three of house party a called be inside at moment when danger of bookcase falling on washing stand be over there be excuse for lingering on occasion have waited full two minute while foot path be congested on being made possible for to pas have raised hat with gallant flourish to jeannie who stood at door have appeared quite unconscious of salute colonel be working into fever of impatience be one thing to be able to say at club that have spent morning in bolton street where cousin have taken number be to have definitely established in wroxton not knowing from adam trying climate of india be nothing compared to sultriness loomed over prospect amiable kindly interest in minutest dealing of others be known a curiosity be not wanting in town of wroxton miss clifford have hardly passed on bicycle when realized that be idle to struggle with so overmastering emotion dismounted at end of street for be adept at turning round rode straight back again must have done so if only to get look at furniture be being unloaded though a have got on to bed room layer of might not have seemed engrossing to ordinary mind be not must get look at lady who sat in middle of road at young man in shirt sleeve might even if lucky catch glimpse of miss avesham whom have not yet seen so rode slowly back when about thirty yard distant saw arthur drinking out of pewter mug disappointment be intense for might even have be lord avesham come to help brother sister in settling in beer drinking in public made impossible must only be foreman of pantechnicon perhaps must be better than nothing footman valet of peer a passed distinctly heard say do have beer aunt em miss clifford rode on towards high street away from direction of home lost stupefied in whirl of conjecture perplexity if be footman what be aunt em doing there unless be just possible aunt em be cook if on other hand be foreman presence of aunt be still more difficult for foreman of furniture company must bring aunt with to superintend seemed proposition might almost be negatived offhand must be be not possible miss clifford by time having reached high street dismounted again determined to go home without more delay shortest way home lay down bolton street at least to go down bolton street be so little longer that excellence of road quite made up for minute afterward be again opposite house very great change have taken place since saw last possible footman be still standing in doorway with pewter pot in hand aunt em be sitting on low black oak chest suggested to miss cliffords romantic mind sort of secret drawer unsuspected will confession of crime proof of innocence a matter of fact contained jeannies boot tree knife board miss clifford did not know perseverance have reward even a passed voice of lamentation sounded from inside of house oh arthur wailed said be only four foot six four foot nine wont go in do come here possible footman put pewter pot on black oak chest went inside chain of evidence be growing massive supposing a before aunt em be cook arthur aunt whose be wailing voice inside must be lady maid house maid miss cliffords masculine intellect decided that scarcely must again have not sister spent hour last night in following history of avesham family in debretts peerage into ramification collateral branch son living hon arthur john talbot b ed at eton magdalen college oxford how be possible for person of intelligence not to connect subject of entry with person called arthur who lounged with pewter pot coincidence be too glaring to be overlooked one thing must settle miss clifford cursed defective memory if lord avesham wife have sister living called emma emmaline must be aunt em who have sat so truculently in highway be offered beer miss clifford turned quite cold at thought that have perhaps be within ace of running into sister sister in law of peer must mother have said if have be alive to see such day miss clifford wasted more time went home like positive race horse arriving in breathing heat went straight to room called by sister libry took peerage from shelf no late lord avesham have only one sister living who be called lucy must not possibly be abbreviated into em married france mary

father must march up steep side of down a if be storming breach long before most active of be half way up must be there must revile with marrowy freezing expression then a soon a aching leg have scaled summit must be off again ten minute later same scene must be re enacted with same trembling breathless mute occasionally on worst day must take one by hand called helping drag along in grasp of iron poor mr raymond always looked more than usually insignificant when husband be looking worried when thing be very bad indeed sometimes strange sort of recklessness came over if can imagine mouse soft feathered bird in reckless humour will have picture of mr raymond when colonel be looking worried have asked question about where have be morning have be treated to reply of kind where have be did ask where have be constance be devoured by curiosity devoured must be better if tried to check sometimes ill tell oh ill tell ive be hanging about bolton street morning not one of infernal

least shant go to day tea isnt tea ready let be brought even friend of colonel might have felt inclined to accuse of slight duplicity for action on occasion have returned by way of bolton street like burned moth to candle sending child on with instruction to go home after waiting for five minute at end of street have rung bell be opened by surprised maid hall be full of miscellaneous furniture maid have to go warily among picture stool to drawing room bearing card jeannies voice be what be known a carrying did not reflect how near front door be to drawing room where agonizing measurement of carpet be going on word be distinctly audible colonel who colonel raymond never heard of fancy calling when be in state tell be out did say fifteen foot six fifteen foot eight arthur make just whole

be made in favour of bishop who be under doctor order to drink abominable thing on occasion half bottle of burgundy blushed before mr collingwoods eye how exactly be possible to conceive of natural lifeless product a being in wicked be problem at ordinary mind stumble mr collingwood have solved must show more becoming modesty if lamented mediocrity of grasp silently envied mr collingwoods

like medicine with view to after effect in order to enable to return with renewed vigour to battle with immoral book people who be not helpful did not live in close in order to attain end a fully a possible have spent all time out of door taking long stroll from breakfast till lunch walk with husband from lunch till tea on recognised plan that best rest for tired mind be to strenuously overtire

work have produced three g f s leaflet one of embodied lecture on downward tendency of modern fiction be called parleyings with enemy in fact when husband returned might be said to be match for anything jack arrived on brilliant september afternoon sending luggage on walked old quaint town seemed to brisker london eye to be dozing on a peacefully a ever in sort of tranquil medival drowsiness from station be on hill must see across cup shaped hollow in lay red tiled town there be new house on way down name above old one be same man who have cut hair when be child stood a have always stood at door looking on to street with pair of scissors stuck into pocket of white apron balder stouter than used to be have always be matter of wonder to jack how man with so bald head dare have window filled full of infallible hair preserver perhaps be cynic traded with amusement on fathomless credulity of man very slope of high street seemed designed for leisurely folk be too steep for horse to trot up down foot passenger ascended softly like bubble arising through water descended with same equable motion like pebble sinking in sea half way down branched off through covered passage leading under house into close there too time seemed to have stood still few nursery maid wheeled contented baby up down path child be playing among grave stone gray pinnacled west front seemed incarnation of

on seeing sitter before promised anything then declining task be not beauty looked for in face be exactly intelligence quality whatever be might be altogether absent in most admired feature present in line of face when there be so to speak feature at be eternal search for refusal to paint where did not find magical brush when did that have already given somewhat unusual standing among younger painter of day picture be few a natural consequence of integrity honesty of art refusal to paint without conviction that subject be for there be nothing in of to show want of grasp that everything be proper material for art did not deny emphatically affirmed that everything be not proper material for artist compared to portrait painter who thus limited how fortunate thought be landscape painter

of stream where water be running in steadfast haste toward mill stood hundred yard below looked long into translucent coolness subaqueous plantation of green weed undulated backward forward in thrust of water like tail of poised fish alternating with bare space pebble sown pebble be glorified to topaz amber here there tall tuft of pithy rush stood breast high in water making strange movement of twitching a current struck causing smooth crystal to be broken with sudden dimple over surface from time to time there must run like wreath of mist darker line a if finger have traced on stream letter water be trying to efface then mark must change from circle to half circle straighten out for moment then be broken from below came gush of mill mixed with bourdon note of machinery jack must see rush of water coming out of dark passage in torrent of white foam soda water of bubble there knew weed must be altogether different must be close a velvet moss on tree offering little surface to flood not like thick branching forest must be torn away in mill race have waited so long looking into water that saw be nearly time to go back attraction of stream held by cord must not go on just to look at jubilant water escaping from prison of mill perhaps extend wandering to pool knew of hundred yard below where water deepened suddenly resumed again sedater going plank bridge crossed at head of just below red brick wall bounded garden belonging to mill must go a far a corner cross stream return to wroxton by path on other side of meadow so on went channel below mill be must be sun for delight caught white spray of plunging river hung broken rainbow on jack felt be gift thrown in have not anticipated gave thrill of pleasure yet even a looked shook head need of artist for expression be on must only tell that be beautiful wished be landscape painter thinking thus turned corner of red wall stopped in centre of plank bridge by intended to cross be standing girl opposite with face full of laughter anxiety with parasol kept at bay small retriever puppy who have just left water still dripping be evidently coming to mistress in order to shake receive congratulation on having have swim even a jack turned corner puppy began shake to trained quick eye whole scene be a complete a faithful a instantaneous photograph puppy head be already shaken down to shoulder be black curly set in halo of spray shake have not yet touched back tail hair of be still shining close girl be also dressed in black with one hand drew skirt away from dog with other held out open parasol so that puppy must be compelled to keep distance for bridge be narrow must hardly pas face with wide laughing eye set in expression of agonized dismay smiling mouth contradicted be moment miracle obviously nerve of body cell however secret in brain be taken up lost in amused fear that puppy must wet have hat on perfect oval of face be crowned with most glorious black hair jack gave quick drawn breath moment before have lamented that be not landscape painter now for cared world might be made of portland cement if only that girl must laugh that puppy must shake infinite moment be soon over even while stared oblivious of else puppy have grown curly from nose to tail anxiety have faded like breath from girl face looked up saw turned retraced step over plank stepped into meadow where only few yard off be sitting oldish lady reading book girl be lying by there be tea basket out silver of twinkled pleasantly in sun jack walked straight past did not look again have recorded in brain wanted to stop stare must be not only rude what in present frame of mind be more important unnecessary did not even look round when heard short scuffling step behind impatient barkings voice said toby come here at once knew instinctively that be girl who have spoken not elder lady for voice have timbre belonged to face who be did not know really did not care have given vision might disappear again must have liked longed in fact to paint more except a sitter be nothing to must even on reflection have thought twice about for one moment have be so complete be so indelible perhaps be poseuse startled for once into genuine emotion though on so small matter a wetting of gown be more than possible that must never serve again though sat to for score of year a have served at moment did not concern a long a puppy be not shaking close to in regard be already a walked back along water meadow thought no more about amber pavement of stream envied not mood of landscape painter for whom water meadow held such exquisite surprise girl be to no more than subject though puppy be essential factor in scene valued not on principle of love love dog way home vision remained vivid in mind settled composition of girl must stand facing full with dog almost straight in front of cutting canvas in two by long black line behind must be green meadow with narrow strip of broken ground just indicating stream bank moment must be when dog have shaken head curly again while rest of be still drowned sleek in joy of creation laughed aloud let pipe go out found father mother have come in be told be having tea in garden canon collingwood welcomed warmly mother evidently remembered be mother first moment be always little awkward for jack be apt to forget how few subject have in common must pour out in matter be near life before perceiving that what said be if not distasteful to mother at rate alien to did so on occasion walked down by river a saw be not in said be in luck just a turned corner by mill came upon finished picture girl standing on bridge keeping off wet puppy with parasol must have seen face beautiful to begin with laughing in line never saw anything so complete wonder who be young woman from town probably said mother in tone must have frozen mercury in thermometer wish have spoken to now continued unfortunate jack though didnt want to at moment anyhow remember face pretty well besides looked lady might have be awkward very awkward said mother time heard vivacity be struck from face went on without pause did enjoy time at lake father said never answered letter know really be tremendously busy though be excuse be painting mr napier do know mother have sort of lady hamilton face now lady hamilton be not person whom mr collingwood desired to have mentioned felt duty to change subject there will be beautiful sunset said now be kind though torture chain must not make allude to one who even resembled that notorious woman yet be willing to talk about subject in domain of art provided only that be innocent might without profanation be mentioned under shadow of cathedral a christian woman drew line at lady hamilton canon collingwood plunged to rescue exquisite quite exquisite said that rose colour be so so beautiful contrast of with blue above be quite quite beautiful exhausted by effort of making discerning criticism took cup of tea whether conversation must have languished further be unknown for at moment butler came out of house followed by miss clara clifford mr collingwood welcomed with worker smile so pleasant to see said know son think be enjoying lovely sunset beautiful be not said miss clara staring at east be always little nervous about coming to call without sister phbe have tooth ache villa montrose smelt a if be built of creosote took sip of tea laid hand upon courage talking of sunset said reminds of what wanted to say to mr collingwood may add name to list of patroness year for annual art exhibition have be so kind a to permit before will be delighted said mr collingwood for have always found that wroxton exhibition be so delightful must exercise strict censorship over what exhibit be sure do remember very clearly seven eight picture of switzerland several of lake surely remember picture of grasmere william be shown last year pointed out original to when be there be one of mr collingwoods chiefest pleasure in artistic line to be able to see original of picture have noticed to recognise in picture original knew cared in fact more for fact that picture represented place knew than did for merit always bought catalogue when went to picture exhibition always marked with cross picture have pleased most must be found to be representation of place knew occasionally when knew place very well must have given picture two cross two cross in mr collingwoods catalogue be a rare a double star in baedeker part of wroxton cathedral must receive one grasmere have chance favourable reception of first request made miss clara even bolder be afraid that phbe might consider conduct unladylike phbe be not there turned to jack must be so much honoured said if must lend sketch mere sketch must be greatest pleasure must be responsible for being well hung have nothing with here said jack thought struck when must picture be sent in by exhibition open in ten day said miss clifford certainly then will be charmed said will only be sketch know will have week will send to house miss clifford be overwhelmed with gratitude looked round indeed apprehensively at mr collingwood canon appeared to have thought request unmaidenly triumph of having secured sketch by jack be so great that even phbe must probably be lenient jack have come to wroxton nominally for holiday a soon a miss clifford have left began working at sketch found a have hoped that scene of afternoon be very clearly visualized by dinner time have sketched out a meant to be felt extraordinary delight in work a progressed with became more more capable of becoming picture in fact before dinner promised sketch have intended to be eighteen inch water colour have so changed in scheme that determined to make oil picture of three foot by two whether not must be finished in three day in have promised that miss clifford must have be more than doubtful have forgotten miss clifford knew be that picture be in head face have drawn with great minuteness a found reproducing with faithfulness for have scarcely dared to hope laughing anguish of girl crossed mind for one moment only that be doing rather questionable thing have idea who subject be might might not be resident in wroxton might might not come to picture exhibition then find portrait of herself how must take if did be equally problematical jack confessed to that knew nothing whatever of all have seen be laugh might be able to frown did not know scruple lasted so short time be in of so slight nature that never reoccurred artist be said do work in sort of somnambulism seemed to jack that worked in state of intoxication lived riotously when brush be in hand mind sang shouted a worked certainly a progressed with day by day continued to prosper live on canvas be frankly surprised at vividness with moment have be impressed upon girl have moonstone brooch on dog silver collar sunlight caught outlying hair on head though be black turned into gold thing hundred like have hardly be conscious of seeing until began to record on fourth day be finished a soon a be dry sent to miss clifford day after be leaving going back to work seemed to to have have holiday at yet did not regret somehow occupation have taken hold of mind when looked at finished thing knew that conscious humble pride alone be sufficient reward to artist for what have done be good said to wish have seen that girl again added chapter vii phbe have not be very kind when heard that sister have be so bold faced a called to ask jack collingwood for sketch dont know what interpretation might be put on thing said indeed be difficult to conjecture clara attributed severity a much to tooth ache a anything else in point of fact when picture arrived phbe who must usually spend quarter of hour over untying knot rather than cut fetched scissors in le than time behaved a if string be not precious metal be kind of said clara see what size phbe though perhaps may be mostly frame know artist be very fond of putting large frame on small picture oh dear there be wrapper picture be undone at last two peered closely into in approved fashion suddenly clara started corner down by mill said where foot bridge cross river dog like phbe miss avesham dog on bridge by mill phbe looked in silence moment what be to be done said at length dear yes wonderful likeness too be just like when laugh what be picture called said clara opening note have accompanied in danger oh see dog be shaking dress be in danger of getting wet how very clever phbe have ceased looking at picture affair far more momentous interesting occupied wonder what mean began see dog be shaking repeated clara danger be know that said phbe be there if can say so without being indelicate do think there be understanding between miss avesham mr collingwood do suppose stood to how interesting must have be if have happened to stroll down there one of last day seen working doubt be right phbe said sister be not proved said phbe modestly seems likely cant ask miss avesham about really dare not ask mr collingwood ask about what dont see clara must be so awkward if picture have be done without miss aveshams knowledge dear how well have caught likeness there be ring at bell go to window clara keeping out of sight see who be clara ambushed behind curtain peeped out colonel raymond whispered mr raymond dear how fortunate dare say will know tell to bring tea at once clara be sure to have heard of if cousin be engaged well show picture see if say anything colonel raymond be in best spirit afternoon have at last be to call on aveshams considered that reception have be most gratifying have also explained at length relationship to jeannie be satisfactory mr raymond also be in cheerful mood since colonel have decided to pay

colonel raymond said must so much like to hear opinion on colonel adjusted eye glass why god bless soul exclaimed jeannie avesham constance do come here look at mr collingwoods picture of cousin

cliffords wanted a colonel raymond raised head from examination of picture clara looked slyly at now when miss clara looked sly there be possibility of missing looked sly so to speak with hand colonel a often said be prodigious observer observed eh what began then suddenly possible explanation of miss cliffords slyness came into mind be that nature of man who can not endure that one must know piece of gossip news before determined to appear at least a well informed a miss clifford ah have heard something too miss clifford said how thing get about understand be to be kept quite secret at present except from few friend of course a long a be in mourning understand great thing for collingwoods put among county family colonel raised eye to ceiling a have observed miss fortescue do when wished to say no more on subject congratulated on having come with credit out of miss cliffords be bursting with curiosity to hear more colonel tactfully led subject round to other topic jack collingwood be at oxford with cousin arthur said wonderful place oxford spent night there once must suit literary taste miss clara plenty of opportunity for study what treat by way gave in last observer brought tear

with lady arthur be going to deal with colonel there only remained mr collingwood jeannie devoutly hoped must have glimmering of tact about if looked awkward uncomfortable must feel so too really there be nothing to be awkward about if have done picture must have snapped finger at possible consequence for have greatest respect for achievement of kind certainly picture be achievement in secret heart have pang of exultation at thought that be like jeannie be singularly free from self consciousness in nature there be hardly touch of egotism wondered whether sight of picture have not given in way have be piece of self revelation to have idea that people saw like very possibly did not here be man who did how must see wondered have only given one glance at one meeting remembered nothing more than straight rather tall figure kindled eye very likely must not have known again if have met casually looked clean alert be must have sworn to looked forward with good deal of interest to coming next day thus far have run meditation when be interrupted by butler miss clifford be waiting outside to know if must see jeannie for moment only if be disengaged jeannie sat up yes ask to come out here said must be hardly possible to conceive more agonized embarrassed face than miss clifford turned to jeannie latter must not conceive what be matter be quite free said delighted to see did come down on bicycle said miss clara did not feel up to bicycle jeannie noticed that hand be trembling do sit down said gently there be hurry have coffee tell what be then just when feel inclined there be bitter tension about corner of poor miss claras mouth twice tried to speak be unable phbe began at length phbe have be very unkind to miss avesham felt felt must not rest without telling about be fault said that oh dear dear miss clifford gasped once twice like person coming up after long dive burst into tear in moment jeannie be by oh poor dear thing said please dont cry be upset about something speaking make worse let get up walk quietly to fro little then if feel better still want to tell will if not why just dont tell be sure be nothing bad whatever be remember forgive if in way concern miss clifford tied face into series of hard knot put on series of expression so widely different from other that must have made fortune a impersonator at music hall if of have resembled one else be of unique in few minute however recovered want to tell dear miss avesham said if will excuse liberty of calling that phbe be so unkind that felt must never be happy again if be right never told said drew colonel raymond on to say what did jeannies companion struggled moment with wild spasm of internal laughter at thought of miss clara drawing colonel raymond on conquered dont quite understand said tell about from beginning well be way said miss clara that picture came to house of course phbe recognised phbe said must be very awkward if exhibited if so happened that have be done without knowledge suggested be who suggested that there might be understanding between mr collingwood see said jeannie well at moment there came ring at door be colonel mr raymond phbe said how lucky because colonel raymond being cousin must be sure to know if there be anything so in came showed picture to colonel then there came in what phbe blame for be so unkind hardly ate bit of lunch can hardly tell about there be hurry said jeannie again seeing that miss cliffords face be growing contorted after moment went on colonel raymond recognised at once said looked up at phbe say looked slyly at prompted to say what did know miss avesham colonel raymond be rather odd man in way cant bear that one must hear anything before know naturally must feel more if knew something about particularly before did did catch eye be true oh yes must tell phbe be right meant that must then broke out with how news travel of course must say nothing about oh dear miss avesham if have all be fault will never never forgive jeannie got up from chair took miss claras hand in hers kissed be dear good woman said love for telling now wont say single word more about unless sister be unkind again in case will come flying to rescue there be harm done at a mr collingwood be coming to stay here to morrow one will think perfectly natural that must have done picture of give kiss miss claras face have be perfect study during last speech of jeannies at close heaved out of chair raised face to hers like child joy honour of kissing being kissed by honourable be entirely submerged in natural human

entered house in close be not in anticipation of cool reception due to picture made distrustful of what next hour must bring hardly gave that thought for have seen jeannie mattered little what rest of world thought a long a have uninjured mind on subject frank welcome of utter insouciance on subject above though scarcely knew yet fact that have met again that vision by river combined to make almost exultantly happy on score errand to mother however be far different full of difficulty met with kind christian expression have received so supposed note desire to see after be filial laudable for note

be good son to father hand lay unresistingly in tightened grasp looked up mother only shook head go jack said kiss then go kissed left room without word mr collingwood sat quite still for moment then wide mouth widened burst into tear jack have be more moved by interview with mother than be convenient for social purpose did not go straight back to aveshams took stroll through town first have not expected that mother must suggest arrangement other than orphanage for child have thought possible what have moved be sudden deepening of talk in moment have gone from instance to great eternal principle of thing to sin love death from that talk have veered a suddenly to personal relation relation between mother deep down in knew what empty place there be in heart place empty garnished ready

little distrustful of self importance be due to fact that considered daily walk by river to be taken entirely on account have something in fact of air of colonel raymond about jeannie wondered what must make of sight of herself jack together lounging on bridge chapter xi that prodigious observer have not failed to notice though arthur interview with have be quite remarkably frank outspoken colonel be not to be taken in way indeed fact that arthur have denied with such directness truth of brilliant conjecture colonel have made when saw picture of jeannie rather tended to confirm belief in own acuteness meant to put off scent sir meant to put off scent said angrily a waited to let three daughter catch up at guildhall added savagely looking at maria who be near collapse doesnt take in way strategist be not quite certain how to act secret joy of knowing be right have seen through flimsy attempt to baffle be gratifying be like money locked up must not use on other hand have not enjoyed that moment when in presence of wife arthur have spoken of absurd foolish report busybody have invented so have heard have reached colonel raymond people so thought colonel bitterly talked so let thing get about if again alluded to what knew so well about arthur jack collingwood interview might occur between arthur be bad enough when only mr raymond be present colonel turned quite cold at thought that next rendezvous might be at club in presence of old crony be only timely unhesitating retreat have perhaps saved other day on question of cousinship even then be far from certain that others have not suspected awkwardness colonel raymond began to feel ill used why must aveshams particularly that insolent arthur come settle in wroxton render precarious colonel immemorial position a cousin friend of noble family why if must come must not have treated more like cousin have told truth about affair rather than try to hoodwink with denial why thing be a plain a nose on face stormed colonel a ascended club step indeed nose be not beautiful to go tell that jeannie have never seen young collingwood when very next day see with own eye lounging in public street together be insult to disgrace to party at bolton street be happily ignorant of thunderings tranquility be undisturbed jeannie have indeed told arthur that colonel have seen jack together afternoon wondered with amusement what must make of made pretty clear to yesterday said arthur thoughtfully be poisonous sort of animal be given notice to repeating hope wont do so jeannie on occasion otherwise will have to repeat to yet say cut make question simpler why gossip be gossip be more than can understand said jeannie where pleasure of repeating a true what made up come in be altogether beyond be one of pleasure of imagination said arthur taking off coat go away dress jeannie leave to do same will be late always be said jeannie still lingering isnt odd paused arthur began unlacing boot well isnt odd that mr collingwood must be mr collingwoods mother must be odder if wasnt remarked arthur miss fortescue have taken rather fancy to jack showed by treating a treated nephew niece be to say be rude to be bad sign for miss fortescue to be polite to one implied did not like one must have called polite to jack have asked several question on very different subject during dinner to have returned answer showing knew something of various question be miss fortescues test yes seem to know said in fact think know too much mr collingwood mind of well informed man be horrible thing be like curiosity shop full of odds end be of use to anybody jeannie arthur burst out laughing answer back said arthur wont mind jack be sensible enough to know miss fortescue must not be so rude if object be to be rude if have not be able to tell about pearl oyster cayenne pepper said must only have said mind of ignorant man be horrible thing be like new jerry built villa unfurnished just so said miss fortescue owner call desirable mansion what be one to do said jack one know about thing one doe not be choice between being jerry built villa curiosity shop people said miss fortescue fill villa with curiosity be possible to be well informed completely uneducated go jack said arthur shes beginning to hit wildly be to apply to myself asked jack turning to miss fortescue oh be so like englishman said whenever suggest idea to englishman can not consider in abstract have to think whether applies to aunt em never doe that observed jeannie go on opposite tack if tell be being offensive quite personally considers offensiveness in abstract make remark about true courtesy have hare aunt em said arthur shot two day ago did kill at once asked miss fortescue wounded said arthur quite regardless of truth screamed butcher said aunt em will give repeated arthur miss fortescue glanced at menu card only very little said where be proper mean miss fortescue resumed jack how can one avoid being well informed being

suggest orphanage said jack have be suggested before think be quite out of question case be not orphanage case there be plenty of money hoped hardly hoped that mother must suggest that baby must be brought up in house for owe great deal to frank a be dead without being able to pay owe to memory did not suggest so think will take child bring up paused yes know there be objection said to begin with people will talk luckily however there be nothing in world matter so little a what such people say other objection be more important must be better for child not to be in london dare say thing will work out somehow for present at rate will certainly do that be bad enough for child to be fatherless nameless what as poor frank be what good one be girl like asked arthur did know yes very slightly oh cant talk about be nice frank meant to marry know one mean so much said arthur dear fellow dont attempt to be cynical make poor hand of really know that did mean to a mother pointed out that be excuse arthur be silent moment apologize said be sure be right have idea never mind have whisky sat smoking for spell without speech ought to be awfully happy here said jack at length have charming house nothing particular to do how wish have be born loafer have great inclination way gift at real loafer be born not made be always wanting to settle down finish up get to work want none of thing said arthur with conviction settling down suppose mean marrying be going to marry by way be going to do everything that there be to be done said jack after will find more thing to do all in near future asked ask a many question a miss fortescue said jack be in dread of appearing well informed so will not answer dont a soon a know answer to question lose interest in lucky then that have still so many question observed jack by way sister did not mind about picture did set so thoroughly at ease about that until evening really never occurred to that easily might im sure didnt said arthur good will go to bed when be breakfast arthur got up lit couple of candle breakfast be when come down said bind to nothing chapter xii avesham family manner of attending cathedral be characteristic miss fortescue be always first to start reached seat in choir five minute before service began took with bible prayer book large tune hymn book frowned abstractedly at jeannie started about seven minute after be almost invariably just late so that have to sit in nave close to choir arthur considered sufficient to arrive during first lesson sat at far end of nave where must hear nothing singing followed therefore a corollary that left before sermon jack on particular morning proposed to stay at home go to afternoon service thus when arthur came through garden on way to first lesson found in large chair underneath mulberry tree paused moment must seem more hospitable if didnt go to cathedral asked remember rank hospitality very high among cardinal virtue be honest said jack then perhaps have better go to cathedral said might have made easier for to stop well good bye will come out before sermon will devote time to silent meditation said jack where will find cigarette ive run out in smoking room distinctly bad manner to talk about cigarette to fellow on way to church have novel iced drink too wont dont mind arthur made reluctant way across lawn disappeared if jack have be obliged to be perfectly honest too must have have to confess that bore prospect of solitary hour with perfect equanimity have several thing to think about must do best alone in first place have received that morning note from mother asking to tear up letter have written when received unread also must like to see again before left wroxton note occupied jack thought not little when jeannie have broken in upon meditation on bridge evening before be doing best not to draw conclusion not to formulate in own mind what relation with mother be have not known how talk have moved be only natural that must not for mr collingwoods deepest emotion be founded on cardinal virtue more be moved more passionately felt expressed horror of what be wrong to jack with antipodal nature have appeared like hardness have wronged mistake be excusable for with more emotion be touched more human indulgent became dangerous development doubt luckily for kindliness of world common one certainly one be lovable if be not too censoriously moral that frank must so have failed to act up to proper reasonable code made feel more tenderly toward though regretted be otherwise with mother lapse of kind blotted tenderness from mind have happened to one loved more complete must have be horror attitude of son be ideal resultant leaf nothing wanting request then to tear up letter unread seemed to of good omen mother knew have felt strongly about picture of jeannie letter must not have be pleasant reading did justice not even to question whether have not be written with most utter obedience to notion of duty be never unkind from carelessness anger rather if be unkind from anger anger be never of brutish selfish sort thus hoped that interview must develop idea that letter must be unread be not sum of task of meditation more intricate even more absorbing be remainder assured believed own assurance that be not falling in love when man have to tell that be doubtful whether be longer fit person to decide radiant presence have first met on plank bridge be no longer subject for sketch have stepped down up from platform of subject have taken by hand have become in fact that ever agitating thing woman jack have be often agitated before took a doubtful boon have never indulged in maudlin sentiment place human emotion on pedestal a be in otherwise empty room to be married ideally did not according to mean ideal life if else be to be sacrificed for man who gave up whole world for woman loved be a incomplete a man who gave up woman loved for whole world still le be love plaything to if be not absorbing be not therefore nothing more than pleasant amusement more hopeless still be common case of men who seem to regard a mere amusement yet devote whole life to never did extreme meet more deplorably truth lay beyond between thing man have work to do in world jack at rate made question about to certain men woman came great gift gift no le than completion of nature by fusion with did not come to whether came not there remained stubborn fact that one have still one work to do be use saying that love be greatest thing in world that be stronger than death for so if look at aright be steam engine must not be supposed that chill reflection be rehearsed in jack mind a sat under mulberry tree that morning be given here merely to show outcome of previous thought on subject that reader may be enabled to realize starting point from meditation began racing ground colour of piece on perhaps gold thread must be traced nature of soil from mysterious seed must draw nourishment in intellectual artistic matter be vivid quick fastidious sympathetic above almost incapable of accepting thing a proved unless have practical experience of just a must have denied with utmost cheerfulness claim of raphael to be great painter unless so considered after looking at picture so must take ideal of love a own because have be ideal of great good men got up from chair looked out over shining garden quiet peacefulness of sunday morning be in air hardly breath of wind swayed tall single dahlia heavy head of sunflower drooped great quiet tree of close old unaged seemed guarantee for safety of world gray cathedral numbered century to decade yet in spite of suggestion of secure tranquility whole view offered jack felt excited almost frightened who know who know said half aloud paused moment then walked forward half laughing at falling in love be common enough experience thought be not to be treated a tragedy can not think of a comedy miss fortescue appeared at lunch have thought deeply on question of ritual if have not previously thought deeply apparently did not stand in way of speaking strongly reredos seemed be synonym for idolatry absence of extra candle on altar be only plank so to speak saved english church from being immerged in bottomless sea of romanism proposed a experiment to make offer to chapter that must present to cathedral small chapel in honour of st joseph to be erected at expense if must build corresponding one to virgin felt doubt that thanks acquiescence of cathedral body must be accorded to proposal ingenuity with twisted argument of other side to tell in favour be truly remarkable when at end of hot half hour raised eye to ceiling be not only person present who be grateful for respite have already reduced jack to such confusion of mind that have founded theory on seven veil of jewish sanctuary though have not slightest idea what be talking about miss fortescue have convinced out of own mouth of being friend to detestable enormity of pope of rome say be going to see mother at tea time said very well tell have said jack be discreet not provident be sure will agree with admitted eagerly in case said miss fortescue be duty to use influence with father to get thing remedied jeannie laughed give up mr collingwood advised use always give up when aunt em feel strongly at church on sunday will too when know better there be several people at tea when jack came into mother drawing room when entered saw that have be talking on point concerned for there be lull in conversation yet one looked interested rather eager showed that conversation have be suddenly broken off mr vernon gushing wife of canon more distinguished for vague sthetic loquacity than for tact appealed to at once be talking about picture of miss avesham said maintain do agree with mr collingwood that be not function of art to be photographic have seized be true moment oh dear delicious moment have given have not what called story of moment jack looked little puzzled dont quite understand said oh mr collingwood be laughing at cried be very unjust not appreciative of jack gravity be creditable to be laughing at want to involve mean that must never have given wonderful moment if have not known ancestry if may say so of must have studied miss aveshams face till be own to know to show exactly how looked when dear little puppy be shaking in danger too what delightful title must have made thousand sketch of for surely be impossible to paint portrait real portrait mean without knowing face character jack stirred tea theory be admirable mr vernon said agree with entirely must confess that portrait in instance be rank contradiction of until moment saw miss avesham standing a represented never saw before finished sketch before ever saw again can only say that be luckier than deserve in having done something be kind enough to consider a being like something of interest died out of mr vernons face occurred to jack for moment that have theory at stake more interesting to than theory about true method of painting portrait flushed little be annoyed at for doing so be afraid may seem to that did very rude thing said fact be be walking down by river about three week ago suddenly saw what tried to paint have idea that be miss avesham for a have told have never seen before without sufficiently considering confess whether girl whoever be must see picture whether if did must object to painted saw miss avesham again yesterday for second time be staying with brother for sunday be sure must be charmed flattered at picture said mr vernon dont know about being charmed flattered said jack certainly be very kind about considering what liberty have taken rather what compliment have paid exclaimed mr vernon effusively what sweet girl be so simple kindly be staying there be not yes for sunday said jack with teeth on edge knew arthur well at oxford did miss avesham talk to about portrait continued mr vernon be told be so artistic oh yes spoke about said jack indeed be curious coincidence for just a arrived be out in garden again puppy be shaking having fallen into fountain mr vernon gave titter of laughter like chromatic scale there seems to be fate in such thing exclaimed how exciting how romantic thank one more cup of delicious tea before long others left shortly after canon collingwood retired to garden jack mother spoke of indifferent thing till tea table be cleared after servant have gone wanted to talk to jack before went received letter yes morning tore up a asked to without reading mr collingwood be silent moment thank said at length simply reason be wrote hastily must not think that miss avesham must consider painting of portrait a great liberty appears did not that be excellent friend so be wrong about attitude mr collingwood took chair closer to jack jack be right in what said yesterday went on be made very differently must accept have be too much given to judging to disapproving disapproval doe good must not judge either have own life to live can not grasp point of view if be tempted to disapprove of will be careful in future not to do to simply say that understand jack looked up mother voice be trembling ah dear went on in father house be many mansion be likely there be many mansion of on earth if window of look out on to beautiful thing others on to austere surroundings suffering perhaps sin in different chamber must not judge other be what wanted to say to have to go on in own way can only do what think right there be tell what do intend to do about baby will have to live with think said jack be unless something else turn up mother dont know how have touched how glad have made that have spoken how ashamed jack not ashamed said have to talk to about have thought of nothing else since saw yesterday go back to morrow do not yes then say good bye to father before go must leave have evening class good bye dear kissed with tenderness be new to left be not in nature of who have lived in groove lightly to get out of habit becomes nature to look permanently at one view must no doubt if continued for forty year tend to make observer believe that world contained other be case with mr collingwood humanized interview with jack have jolted a stone on line may jolt train for moment without causing to leave metal direction in have be running speed weight have to be overcome with long continued conviction have given great momentum address delivered three day afterward at mother union showed speck of apostasy chapter xiii jeannie threw into life of place with amazing energy have hand very full in first place house in bolton street have new inhabitant none other than baby of frank bennett have occurred to arthur when jack be telling about that here be possible situation at rate for present before week have elapsed have written to jack to say that if wished must give child home a long a present rgime of bolton street continued jack have accepted offer with most thankful alacrity to live there be much better for child also hardly admitted to must run down with reasonable frequency to see how throve jeannie have wanted no persuading miss fortescue hardly more have opposed scheme at first on same ground a opposed everything in order to see how thing looked from other side that plan be somewhat out of way that must give wroxton good deal to talk about did not consider at disadvantage to distinct benefit to wroxton will hear le of s p c k remarked baby be to jeannie of absorbing interest same instinct have led when child to make

gentle society mr collingwood have left room in marked manner in middle be true that came back again spoke venomously about be after thought for by going away expressed silent disapproval repeated not at silently in discussion followed indeed might well be horror struck for jeannie taking a text that notorious scandalous novel sheltered life have made remark about realism artistic treatment made mr collingwood not exactly blush bristle in first place hero of work be professed unbeliever though if be to believe author sought for light lived sober innocent life there be doubt about religious opinion be unnecessary to go into detail of rest of story that one fact be enough for mr collingwood jeannie seemed hardly to have noticed instead spoke of admirable development of character of sobriety reticence of narrative of skilled surgical dissection of man action exhibition of real force swayed partly result of heredity partly of early training circumstance one thing according to mr collingwood condemned book even have be written by shakespeare corrected by milton passed over with remark that description of struggle of reason against faith reason must not accept be wonderfully rendered dead silence followed reading literary lady who for most part have followed with great interest saw mr collingwood enter again came in so punctually a jeannie sat down that seemed almost a if have be listening at door cowered most of looked guilty be noticed that miss clara in place a president sat bolt upright looked a brave a lion indeed several time during lecture have applauded with

originally once week at bolton street to sing glee for hour under severe guidance of miss fortescue who taught by degree not so much what good part singing be a what be not then won way to passable

jeannie often thought that must sooner have fretful irritable if only must be le despondent one woman who be having attack very slightly getting through with very well must spend day in sulky tear pitying moaning over cruelty of jeannie who in obedience to order did not of course let have crumb of solid food sometimes when be giving wash in morning must be called away by trying to raise in bed wanting to be attended to in way when came back there must be nothing querulous complaint of time have be left felt sure must catch cold jeannie have not dried properly before went at time must beg

till then nothing nothing hour more sufficed to finish round went into next ward to watch man who be so restless for nearly hour have to sit close by bedside with hand continually pressing on shoulder to prevent getting up be more than half unconscious wandering in talk saying thing now then ten day ago must have made jeannie turn from in horror disgust now have nothing of left only pure pity one great end in view to let none of poor people die then when nurse james have finished round came back to by then be time to get patient food of more advanced progressing case be already allowed mellins food for most be still only milk beef tea at mid day have couple of hour interval usually returned home to lunch went afterward for walk to day felt too fagged too sick at heart to do more than sit in garden beneath pitiless leaden cowl of sky effort of appearing cheerful remaining cheering be too great when alone abandoned to sort of resigned hopelessness just before leaving ward have seen terrible screen put up round bed of girl who be dying be privacy must be given almost hoped that when got back end must have come only two day before have sat in still awe struck ward while woman passed through last hour have heard wandering inarticulate cry have counted breath through long pitiless silence have shut teeth hard to bear without screaming audibly that one last exclamation in spirit clutch with unavailing hand not to be torn away from inert body one last convulsive breath in body try to retain thought must hardly bear again then cudgelled contemned for paltry selfish cowardice be there ever thought girl so puny spirited during ten day in have be nursing epidemic have showed sign of abatement sometimes for couple of day return of fresh case be suddenly diminished once when jeannie went to hospital at eight in morning to take up duty told that there have be no fresh case reported since night before on occasion lull be only temporary in next twelve hour there must perhaps be seventy more reported pictured disease to herself like hideous monster must lie down to sleep for few hour after one of gigantic meal then when victim be digested must rise up again clutch at with hot hand once a be leaving hospital dr maitland have called into consulting room to ask question about one of patient a rose to go have said must like to see what be matter with people pointed to microscope stood on table jeannie looked through at drop of water be beneath lens there be quantity of typhoid bacillus in said be long black with one pointed end rather like pencil adjusted light for among infinitesimal denizen of water saw five six little dark line seemingly a lifeless a rest drew back with shudder thought of a terrible beast with claw teeth said be more terrible never before have realized on what hair breadth path precarious life of ours pursues way strength wit beauty of man be slave puppet in hand of minute organism king on throne mix one day little water with wine in golden cup with one of black pencil invisible to high power of lens thereafter ascends throne more sits in place before whom sing god save king father be one among uncounted dead afternoon a sat under tree in garden after lunch thought like flitted bat like through gloomy chamber of brain how insignificant insecure be life be like ill constructed clock might stop moment how mean trivial be best aim here be with fair average of birth brain heart life held for more heroic task than to wage war oh how hopelessly with infinitesimal atom peace sheltered security of wroxton busy tranquility have fashioned for here be knocked in dust everything be at mercy of bacillus luckily for peace of mind unfruitful imaginings be interrupted by pool did not hear step on soft grass voice spoke before knew be there mr collingwood be here miss said want to know if can see jeannie did not move voice trembled little yes ask to come out here said bring chair rose to meet ah how do do said tell baby be quite well quite well said then there be silence pool brought out chair still in silence sat down jeannies heart have suddenly begun to beat furiously heard from arthur morning said be why be here knew of course from paper that there be epidemic of typhoid here be frightened letter told more told that spent day in nursing at hospital must not bear jeannie said nothing great pervading peace took possession of troubled soul be a if have suddenly passed from stormy mountainous sea round into harbour bacillus resumed real dimension must not bear said again looking at word of explanation passed between right to question what did jeannie did not dispute did not miss significance of must not help said be impossible for not to do what must oh have be terrible time be not at end of yet oh poor people leave place come away began suddenly passionately then stopped for saw in jeannies face light of pity divine human womanly be selfish in love for said can not live without died leave place resumed do that heart prompt to do promise promise that will leave precaution untaken to minimize risk to know there be need to ask that because be duty a much a other will comfort to hear say promise said jeannie simply divine deed be done word yet unspoken have changed three minute before there have be only leaden sky withered drought yellowed grass round grass be become paved sapphire of court of heaven sky be sky of be so utterly in tune with other jack felt desire to speak directly did jeannie wish pause out of music must issue be what be to be done with asked in lighter tone may stop here jack said utter unconsciousness with spoke name smote with sweetness be to go back to work too have got work nothing can refute tell about baby cry for said jack kiss for then pray

stupid ungrateful little fool be not enough to find little silver line on thermometer little lower than be at same time yesterday perhaps degree lower than be day before one feel so helpless be on account of little invisible demon carelessness of dirty people allowed to get into water supply people talk of horror of war horror of water company seems to more frightful jeannie paused moment must not have gone through must not be now going through for kingdom of world said mischief have be done be inestimable privilege to be allowed to help in minimizing result be giving new view of life jack here in sheltered peaceful town be in danger think of becoming sort of ruminating animal sleek living in meadow like sort of cow didnt gather be in danger of remarked jack did happen to hold class in meadow did not yes class of other cow be cow together at least be out of suffering there come know not what certainly despondency believe that be permanent net result one learns what little thing be

change heart be lighter for two hour have be like caress to troubled spirit have be worn with fruitless effort collar of suffering world chafed one hand brought healing to heart be holpen reported case of probable typhoid to doctor went back to ward nurse james met with smiling face when nurse james smiled be not without reason that girl left so ill morning be worse said if anything be little stronger dr maitland think that sudden drop in temperature may be after sudden turn for better say occasionally happens certainly if there have be perforation must have known by now watch very carefully afternoon remote lightning winked distantly in sky answering thunder got ever gradually louder more continuous wind have veered into north west be coming in sudden clap buffet of hot air storm distant rack of coppery hard edged cloud distinct different from heavy soft vapour overhead be approaching slowly from opposite quarter oppression of air be a intolerable a ever strangely more acute remote heaven seemed to be pressing down on earth like hot lid over stewing pot in ward there be general feeling of cheerfulness easy to perceive hard to define survival doubtless in man of curious instinct in animal make smell approaching storm warns domestic sort that earthquake be coming earth fever stricken town be waiting for change must not be for worse of only girl who have be almost despaired of morning lay quite still apathetic again again jeannie went to bedside betwixt hope fear about five storm burst in riotous element for hour before that strain have be almost unbearable forked flash of lightning dry growl of thunder have approached nearer nearer earth seemed to pause finger on lip for catastrophe now then few rain drop a big a penny fell down upon pavement vanished again like breath on frosty morning on hot thirsty stone then suddenly heaven burst ribbon of blue fire leaped downward from zenith noise of thunder be a if sky have cracked one woman half raised in bed cried lord have mercy at end of word came sound a if thousand snake have hissed in street outside blessed whisper of rain be changed girl who be so ill moved slightly laid one hand outside bed clothes woman who have cried aloud lay back in bed smiling jeannie felt pulse rise in throat subside again outside hiss of snake changed to drumming on roof got gradually louder more insistent perpendicularly fell like rod of steel a second added into minute roof drain gutter pipe began to gurgle chuckle to never be there song so sweet guttural sound grew ever fuller in few minute with great splash choked overflowed in bubbling laughter again yet again lightning tore path through cloud at reverberation in baptism of fire earth grew regenerate young hot stifling smell of last six week turned to something infinitely fresh vigorous down pavement over road began to flow flushing stream five be hour of afternoon milk beef tea carmel hour a seemed to jeannie of evening sacrifice food healing rain be poured out sign of hand abundant health giving exultantly went round found smiling face one only did not smile for girl lay in deep natural sleep a if racket tumult outside be lullaby to outside have grown very dark wind have ceased a if to compensate for darkness from moment to moment intolerable brilliance of lightning made tenfold brightness be a if town be beleaguered by artillery of sky from right left fired unceasingly gun of heaven in interval between flash colour be blotted out from world dark roof black tree huddled together to meet sky scarcely more luminous then in moment colour must be restored geranium in box outside window black before leaped into scarlet livery black elm top dark blob became outlined company of green leaf tiled roof of house be red once more noise a of hundred sack of marble poured out on to wooden floor endorsed truth once again world became shadow click of gutter by six first violence of storm be momentarily abated sullen blessed rain cloud hung ready to burst when jeannie miss fortescue came to leave hospital passed unwetted down to bolton street in jeannies head easy melody of love joy bubbled repeated listening to be silent aunt em spoke wish have brought golosh said be glad rain have come will flush drain be miss fortescues habit though who knew best least suspected to commend loved to special care of god night though never talked about religion there be nothing in world more real to than communion with thing unseen never lost sight of undoubted connection also with thing seen to night devotion be tepid for at dinner jeannie have be altogether unaccountable obsession of gravity responsibility have beleaguered during past week be altogether absent miss fortescue wondered what have driven away have laughed spilled thing with mastery of custom after dinner have stopped in dining room with arthur smoking cigarette now jeannies cigarette be properly speaking not cigarette at barometer argued very rare content almost passionate acceptance of present circumstance of life for week past more especially since epidemic have come to town jeannie must no more have smoked than must have flown something so argued miss fortescue must have occurred to send needle up sky high weather thunder storm clearing of air doubt be predisposing cause so also might be reckoned wonderful turn for better of case of girl whose life have be despaired of morning miss fortescue be not content to accept alone a sufficient reason must have occasioned relief more sudden rise in barometer be due to removal of more marked depression so instead of going to bed put on dressing gown knocked softly at jeannies door receiving answer went in room be brilliantly lighted jeannie seemed to have lit candle must find be standing far from door by wide flung window looking out into night too have taken off dress put on short sleeved dressing gown left arm bare to nearly shoulder hair be hanging down back in great black river a far a waist face nearly in profile be cut like cameo against dark square of night rain have begun to fall heavily again room be filled with sh sh sh of drinking grass just a miss fortescue stood at door blackness outside turned to sheet of blue flame thousand rod of rain became for moment prism of colour jeannie started turning half round saw aunt smile of great happiness played round mouth held up head listening in half second came great gong of thunder in answer to lightning laughed with pleasure hear hear cried oh aunt em isnt splendid rain oh rain have come for talk be good also for can not go to bed yet let pull out chair to window now miss fortescue hated thunder storm snake german band hated thunder storm most jeannies happiness be too infectious to be denied sat down in chair by oh be so happy cried jeannie listen at river down gravel walk there wont be flower in garden to morrow dont know that be altogether advantage said aunt em havent got better reason than hundred said jeannie be sane again be looking at thing awry have be put right who put right asked aunt em why mr collingwood said jeannie be here afternoon didnt know said miss fortescue jeannie looked at with frank surprise never occurred to said now come to think of couldnt have known came just after lunch talked together for about hour again ribbon of instantaneous flame be dangled from sky thunder replied with short unechoed clap miss fortescues chair be little behind jeannies a girl leaned eagerly forward at lightning saw bright wholesome colour flood face arm when turned to transcendent brilliance in face be thing to wonder at yes even said jeannie employing figure of speech known a hiatus oh aunt em to think that never knew have known so well afternoon there be something infinitely simple noble in girl gesture of happiness miss fortescues eye be suddenly dim jeannie mean cried mean did not mean to tell yet yet never meant not to have guessed have told hardly know matter le so be jeannie jeannie cried miss fortescue girl be folded in arm for moment lay there face buried on miss fortescues shoulder hair lying in coil arm warm supple clinging clasped round neck for quarter of embrace jealousy of insolent happiness of youth rose bitter in elder woman throat here be young life one very dear to made suddenly complete with pang a overpowering a be brief miss fortescue raged inwardly over unfinished incompleted life next moment in be womanly be true good rose triumphant outward cynicism assumed hardness fell from like peeled bark heart of tree be sound jeannie have felt slack return to eager embrace raised head understand what mean to said have never known miss fortescues arm closed round yes dear have known said though be one of thing never knew about have known dear jeannie jeannie raised to kneeling position by chair inimitable unselfishness of love stung heart be little brute said quietly first forgive then will talk looked up in others face for moment hardly recognised plain strong face be no longer there dim eyed girl sat in chair above be word from to jeannie said be insolence to say one forgives one love have known crowd of confused scarcely remembered moment suddenly sprang into jeannies mind looked like one awakened suddenly from sleep by loud noise tell said miss fortescue shook head thing be past replied have buried again wild bull eye of storm flashed through window miss fortescue drew instinctively away jeannies arm detained do tell said again unless must hurt must not hurt said miss fortescue jeannie suddenly stood up what do mean said be possible that guess aunt em again light of youth flooded miss fortescues face yes dear be possible said father said jeannie simply yes father jeannie sat

of heart familiar figure of aunt have be suddenly transformed care protection for child of sister have on moment become to jeannie thing more sweet tender than have ever dreamed of mask playful severe grotesque even have known be only mask be removed how fair featured soil lay below must not estimate sweet strength even then have be so powerless to imbitter what must have be daily sacrifice in life

after midnight jeannie undressed quickly putting out illumination of candle got into bed how long lay there without sleeping did not know at last myriad voiced rain outside blended indistinguishable into tone knew in dream communed with jack night long storm bellowed flickered about town about four in morning gun of heaven be silent rain began to fall le heavily when jeannie woke soon after six room be filled with transparent aqueous light of clear dawn smell of unutterable cleanliness came in through open window from bed saw last star fade in dove coloured sky short a have be sleep felt inclination to lie in bed got up went to bath room rain gauge be on lead outside stepping out through open window examined saw that two inch of rain have fallen in night flower in garden bed a have

clearness against tenderness of sky above trace of overpast tempest lingered pale blue of zenith melted with imperceptible gradation into dove colour of horizon on west north in south west pink of dawn be already growing gilded before sun imminent to rise already so seemed to jeannie flush of green have spread over grass glistening house roof so long dust ridden looked clean again above intolerable oppression of air be more than sick dream of night to be abroad in exquisite dawn be like coming out of ill ventilated tunnel into coolness of alpine pasture even a looked beam of risen day shot level arrow struck elm tree in close with aptest punctuality thrush scudded out of bush below poured out throatful of repeated song on moment verse from song of song chimed in head rain be

out of doctor hand before epidemic ceased a suddenly a have begun there be now lack rather plethora of nurse for typhoid be nurse favourite disease since in case depends so entirely on nothing be dearer to skilled than responsibility being case jeannie miss fortescue have in fourth week since epidemic began given up place at hospital regular trained nurse be there in abundance there be longer need for to sacrifice of giving up work be far greater than original risk of taking up for several week certainly life have centred on one thing victory over microbe to think only of one thing even for three week of life wear rut in jolt be necessitated by passing out of rut jeannie after momentous midnight talk with aunt have not be encouraged to allude to subject again have wished that curious flood of confidence have passed by in spate like thunder storm have raged simultaneously outside like sediment of gravel storm have made on grass there lingered in miss fortescues manner conscious

thereafter came distress difficulty bunker welcomed jeannies second bunker retained third sky sweeping iron shot be recorded a fourth fifth leaped across green a if wasp have stung jack meantime have laid second nearly dead four be sufficient that shant count said jeannie well begin now handicap be a follows play on till reach green do see then scoring begin be like a lie on green jack after that give stroke hole ill play for crown added with burst of reckless speculation be afternoon of spring day of exquisite temper seldom felt except in much maligned climate april have laid aside outbreak of petulant rain wore face of laughing child great grave down over played be scoured by westerly wind swelled bud smoothed out crease in little button of green be bursting from hawthorn from height admirable expanse of big wholesome country be visible on side to west house of wroxton stood red glimmering in hollow in hill climbed slope of circle in middle rose gray cathedral piercing blue veil of pure air in lower house be enveloped tower be gilded with sunshine north east lay delectable land where broad field alternated with wood round hovered like green mist first outbreak of bursting leaf down centre of valley unseen traceable from livelier flush of green ran river to south there be only down rising falling in strong undulation like muscle of strong arm interlaced overhead skylark carolled unseen in blue dropped when song be done among grass breathless drunken with music earth have renewed lease of life everlasting fountain of youth be unsealed again never since season have begun course be winter farther away never since adam have walked with eve in garden have love touched two life more closely than touched jeannie jack a went over breezy down club in hand detail of play must not be interesting even to golfer to others tedious may be remarked that jack drove long ball started low rose inexplicably toward end of flight that clean ball rising suddenly against blue sky be invariably felt to be stimulating object must be so nice remarked jeannie if doesnt hurt to be golf ball lie there seeing nothing except blade of grass close round then suddenly ground race away from rise rise like one did over bank road drop on smooth short grass of green hole must be unpleasant said jack go trotting over green then suddenly tumble into horrible small dark prison with

have not negatived proposition when have advanced before of late have be very sharp with sister for week past have not looked well habitually have high colour of late have become sallow gray in skin more than once clara have asked whether must not see doctor phbe have always met suggestion with disdainful refusal have played hardly at on mandolin lately when household work be over must sit in chair in corner with hand on lap doing nothing if clara came in when be sitting like must jump up pretend to occupy with something for did not wish sister to see tear when alone must seldom do anything day by day curious gnawing pain below right collar bone grew worse worse pain whatever be be not continuous if slept well at night be usually bad next day have be bad day before if night have be disturbed by in early day usually passed comfortable day little lump have appeared there below skin phbe before bed room glass looked at with anxiety called rheumatic swelling a such rubbed with embrocation did not seem to make better clara phbe be accustomed even when alone to dress for dinner in winter when evening be cold usually only meant donning of sunday clothes when milder day of spring succeeded faced other in low dress by beginning of april clara have already worn low dress more than once phbe never be still chilly said if clara did not take care must catch cold phbe have horror of doctor to call in doctor implied that thought that be ill turkey rhubarb quinine embrocation according to be trinity of greater potency than whole college of surgeon be not naturally nervous even doubted whether epidemic of typhoid have visited wroxton in autumn might not have be made too much of plentiful exhibition of staple drug thought must have be tried first for swelling underneath collar bone tried in succession smarting deafness general upset seemed only to have added to discomfort pain at first have be only dull ache grew intenser at time stabbed pierced now after day of pain sleepless tossing night succeeded be still firmly determined not to see doctor when one afternoon clara being out have met jeannie in street have be persuaded to go to bolton street to have tea with jeannie saying must be kindness since be alone confessed in answer to question of hers that be not well have pain said oh such pain be can do to prevent clara seeing can not sleep for oh miss avesham do tell that be nothing jeannie have felt anxious when saw that day tried to be consoling very likely be nothing said one can not tell do see doctor at once thing worry make ill if there be anything wrong ought to be attended to if be assured be nothing will be relief will not clara will know objected phbe if be anything wrong must fret so oh be absurd said jeannie frankly supposing nothing be wrong need never tell supposing ought to see doctor how must blame for not having insisted where be pain miss phbe with much diffidence alluded distantly to collar bone think be probably rheumatic added jeannie rang bell went to table to write note now miss phbe said be going to see doctor here now dont say wont for be use be writing to dr maitland will be at home by now be sure will come here at once see in way sister will not know poor lady leaned back in chair almost with relief be very kind of said indeed think clara must see if went on longer jeannie gave note to butler when have left

false death of winter be over living thing rejoiced in renewal of world grass of lawn be starred with young crocus gnarled tree put out sheaf of tender living leaf be a have be twelve month ago in life of men such renewal repetition be admitted year pass be year nearer to grim apparition of decay death seemed to long time before footstep of doctor again sounded on stair faced round again into room to meet have not told said a desired there be doubt cancer must operation give chance chance certainly more than doubtful one be of five month growth at least if have come earlier chance must have be better asked jeannie undoubtedly will tell asked have better be told operation must be dangerous if be left end be certain probably though one can never tell not far distant be case where must decide whether to have operation not do recommend scarcely if be in same condition must not have done jeannie stood silent moment oh poor thing poor thing said suppose must tell put hand before eye for space then gave little shake what coward one be said thank very much dr maitland will let know about will tell if wish miss avesham said know better than said jeannie good bye will go upstairs at once to dr maitland shook hand with felt intense admiration for be only who will accuse of being coward said chapter xix jeannie tapped at bed room door phbes voice answered quite cheerfully be just coming down miss avesham said must have come down before just waited to collect now please tell truly dr maitland thought looked very grave be that not so jeannie must hardly believe that brisk cheerful woman be same who have sat so limply undecidedly in drawing room hour ago what have caused change of front must not guess for evidently dr maitland have not be reassuring own part be made easier for yes be very grave said jeannie dear miss clifford be idle for to say how sorry be be very grave indeed phbe stood at window moment with back to jeannie jeannie must see that hand played with blind cord trembled at courage again failed sickening helplessness took place almost immediately phbe turned round again poor gray face be quite composed hand firm please tell what be miss avesham said jeannie rose took hand in hers looked at with infinite compassion be cancer said phoebe drew long sigh will think very singular of miss avesham said be almost relief to hear that fear of think be worse than knowledge can anything be done operation must be attempted said jeannie must be very dangerous not hopeful be glad of said miss phbe for must know miss avesham be terrible coward if there be one thing dread be being pulled about by professional man have three teeth now that ought to come out must think very cowardly of if preferred not to have operation oh thank god bear so well cried jeannie suddenly must not think cowardly think be right coward said be bravest woman ever saw miss cliffords face brightened with pleasure prayed god to let not be very foolish about said tell one more thing must there have be chance if have gone to doctor sooner there must said jeannie simply then will promise something asked phbe anything dont let poor clara know said phbe oh miss avesham supposing put to rather directly do think must go so far a to well to tell just little fib about must save clara great deal of distress for must reproach for not having insisted on seeing doctor will lie to extent said jeannie promise that dr maitland will too phbe shrank back oh put so strongly miss avesham said must not ask to tell lie if must just be little diplomatic if must lead clara off scent so to speak will never know said jeannie thank so much now will put on hat go home wonder miss avesham must be too much to ask to come see to morrow morning be afraid clara will be very much upset can deal with a one else can will send line to dr maitland asking to come tell must do put on hat taking great care to have straight adjusted silk scarf round neck be little chilly afternoon said to catch cold at time of year be so tiresome be curious how much harder be to throw off cold in summer to jeannie there be something infinitely pathetic about poor lady have mortal disease yet possibility of getting cold in head appeared even at first stunning moment to rank at far greater importance in mind in few week now even be beyond mortal aid yet adjustment of silk scarf to shield throat from possible chill be not le advisable scarf adjusted miss clifford paused again to pull down veil to accustomed point at first be too low then too high mattered le than before little pleasure little pain seem to have deeper more intimate hold over certain nature than greater call man going out to be hung have be known to complain that boot hurt jeannie called at villa montrose next morning standing on step while door be being answered heard subdued tremolo of mandolin be shown at once into drawing room there in phbes corner be sitting phbe with one leg thrown over other in approved attitude in front of on brass music stand be funiculus funicula got up with alacrity when jeannie entered lovely morning be not said dr maitland be so kind a to come early told might get up spend quiet morning going out in afternoon if felt inclined recommended drive think will enjoy evidently for phbe day of little thing be not over uncertainty have worried relief of certainty have let tiny occupation resume wonted importance seemed to jeannie condolence congratulation on bravery must be alike misplaced be good to weep with who weep weeping friend be bad company if one doe not show inclination to weep one certainly phbe showed none to continue congratulating one on fortitude be gratuitous courage above virtue brings own reward for be warming to heart clara offered to take off hand work of household continued phbe be very thoughtful of for have noticed said that seemed to have fatigued last few week so miss avesham have be spending holiday morning with music have hardly pain morning be delighted to hear said jeannie see have funiculus know so will accompany clara upstairs employed in looking out towel in bed room heard light hearted rollicking tune vibrate through house guessed jeannie have come clara have marked bedside manner custom when one be ill be to batter with innocent question a to whether must have door shut window opened to look at with anxious deprecating eye to walk on creaking tip toe phbes faint tinkling have be inaudible upstairs to play that song now seemed scarcely proper felt a must have felt if one in house be dead blind have not be drawn down be nearly at end of tour of inspection when few minute later entered drawing room third verse of song be not yet ended closed door with elaborate precaution walking on tip toe to phbes side gazed into face with sad smile phbe only frowned jeannie be taking song at pace be not used to be a much a must do to keep up turn over quick clara said now phbes soul be in thrumming of mandolin verse came to end jeannie turned round thats more pace said remember be with father mother in naples when came out be first sound heard in morning last heard at night have book of neapolitan air ill send round to if like jeannies manner be anything ideal mortal disease attitude clara have expected have expected to find sitting by phbes side with one hand in hers talking about next world lesson to be learned from pain perhaps might with advantage have be found playing hymn on soft pedal instead of be thumping neapolitan song phbe seemed to be enjoying be possible that dr maitland be wrong have told jeannie so in case surely jeannie must have let know there be one jeannie went on running hand gently over key yes be right duet stella damore young man be walking by sea see girl doe not speak to sings to a pass there be star by sea when have finished verse sings like there be star by sea who be that star must hear then sing star of love by sea clara flushed how romantic said did marry doesnt say said jeannie must write extra verse miss clara saying that did jeannie got up from piano began putting on glove must go said whenever feel up to miss clifford send note well have go at mandolin wont forget to let have book now mind do dr maitland tell good bye clara came to show jeannie out stopped in hall oh miss avesham said be phbe better be not what dr maitland thought jeannie shook head better said have not told claras eye filled with tear yes told said be so cheerful thought perhaps be not a bad a said must not comfort with said jeannie comfort if may suggest in little way see still care for little thing have not lost interest in life at seems to do say anything will remind of what be suffering from dear miss clara be not that realize that recommend just because do can do be to help in little way be just that can do poor miss clara looked bewildered puzzled thing matter so little now said can not understand phbe caring for song mandolin now to be sure be never very fond of going to church always say there be great many black sheep who be clergyman now miss avesham oh to think of playing funiculus miss clara delivered herself of incoherent dissatisfaction with shaking head trembling lip be must do to keep from bursting out cry effort tied face into hard knot phbe have evidently taken up mandolin again for little metallic note came from drawing room playing funiculus in few bar quavering voice joined have be speaking in low tone for fear phbe must hear when song began again jeannie spoke louder seems to great thing that can still take interest pleasure in thing said jeannie must encourage must to continue to do seems so strange said clara know poor mother saw clergyman day for six week before died when suggested morning to phbe must ask mr crawshaw to call got quite angry said what for so a agitation dr maitland told be bad for didnt urge conscience have pricked ever since jeannie smiled put in pin cushion then said oh how little must want to see clergyman if be going to die soon fancy wanting clergyman when be dying said half to herself for moment miss clara looked shocked opinion expressed by idol demanded unusual thought before be condemned after little reflection think see what mean said seems so odd well must go said jeannie think must be wise of to let sister do a like to encourage in anything may wish clara sighed be sure must be right said dear miss avesham there be one thing more wanted to ask think do that if phbe have seen doctor sooner must have be more hopeful be sure must have made difference said jeannie with assurance then seeing that doubt still lingered on miss claras face happened to ask dr maitland added happened to be quite true clara looked inexpressibly relieved cant think how worried about since phbe told last night said be afraid might have be however indirectly fault well anyhow neednt worry about more said jeannie went down step turned homeward little shocked at at ease with what miss phbe have called little fib have be spoken one have practised difficult art of lying le than seemed to come quite naturally not for moment did repent if be wrong said to herself god will understand clara stayed for moment looking after jeannie composing then nailed smile to face went back into drawing room phbe be still sitting in chair strumming to herself on mandolin stopped a clara entered wonder if must play accompaniment said want to try song come next amore mysterio will try said clara seated at piano did not make much of success out of for in addition to fact that found four sharp even at best of time scarcely negotiable quantity finger be trembling must scarcely see key then quite suddenly in middle of second part put elbow on piano burying face in hand burst out cry phbe whose mind have be entirely concentrated on own difficulty with mandolin looked up suddenly at cessation of accompaniment then got up went to sister clara said dont cry so dear be very hard on will be lonely think dont make worse for dont make worse for poor clara turned tear stained face to sister phbe phbe cant bear sobbed oh to think of what be coming indeed be not cry for if only be not oh phbe prayed prayed last night might have not hoped god must hear be just a well a ever morning perhaps if have seen doctor sooner cant be because miss jeannie told that must have made difference phbe blessed jeannie in heart so know that nothing have be left undone must have be done said now clara please go wash face please try love to behave just a usual just a have behaved own dear sister year oh be hard know perhaps clara if kneel down together say father will feel better then let make up mind to make best of thing to go on living quite simply ordinarily have seemed right to before see that be not right still there be use in going to be missionary just because of said prayer together when be done phbe kissed sister go upstairs if like dear said have good cry then when come down again if will be so kind will just try amore mysterio again must like to surprise miss avesham by playing when come told did not know morning clara stood irresolute moment then blew nose wiped up face generally will try at once said in rather quavering voice hope will play better time phbe for most part be nature of very strong vitality to whom death seems so unfaceable courage be needed to meet phbe have never be lusty swimmer in wave foam of life have dabbled with foot in perhaps be unacquaintance with thrill throb of mere living helped to face what be before with such simple unconcern have passed life in safe willow water buffeting bracing risk of world have not be affair to straightforward if willow short sighted nature death did not seem unnatural thing grasp of life have never be firm relaxation loss of came with shock finger be holding lightly must come away without struggle claras capacity for suffering be greater in gentle way raged over hideous end to existence required fortitude to meet that phbe met without effort have never rebelled struggled against ordinary necessity of life of death be one from day case grew very rapidly worse that cruel inexorable malady whose only mercy be swiftness with doe work be to very merciful suffering be comparatively little fortnight after came downstairs for last time sitting once
