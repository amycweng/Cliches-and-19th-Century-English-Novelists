reached not quite to knee nowhere near elbow be a mr leonard said to display atrocity of own figure thereby strengthen rickety morality of world in general must hardly be case since on other occasion laced so tight wore such killing hat so many cairngorm garnet that must not be found guiltless of making public temptation of why again by what possible psychological consistency did revel in game of

nature of smile for seraphina in spirit of credo quia impossible have taken for smile of reconciliation stood to win five lira who must quarrel with so enviable conclusion especially since implied re installation of seraphina be not wholly altruistic consideration for leonard have said in so many word mr mackellar must probably attempt to seduce francesco away from service with lure of higher wage

hot dinner clothes for pyjama slipper cursing inwardly at absence of servant lit lamp with solitary match that found on table came out again into veranda to think over with such coolness a be capturable whole intolerable situation at first mind hovered circling round outlying annoyance be dripping at pore in dark furnace of night prickly heat covered shoulder with net of unbearable

to hope that when went up later in summer to hill must be renewed again at thought present discomfort debt have occupied mind before be wiped clean from oldham have talked of fifty time be to have be best man suddenly out of black bosom of windless night there came sigh of hot air rustling shrub outside came into veranda where sat like stir of corporeal presence making light of lamp to hang flickering in chimney for moment then expire in wreath of sour smelling smoke one of dog sat up for moment growling then be utterly still again arch of clear sky to east have dwindled become overcast red moon showed faint blur of light behind gathering cloud case have used solitary match to light lamp did not know where in own bungalow might find box must get one for certain out of oldhams bedroom for be person of extremely orderly habit always kept one on ledge just inside bedroom door case got up in dark groped way across lobby out of oldhams bedroom opened feeling with hand immediately found box on ledge at foot of bed standing there lit match eye fell on bed be covered with dark blanket on centre of coiled sleeping like round pool of black water lay huge cobra on moment match went out have barely be lit closing bedroom door went out again on to veranda did not rekindle lamp sat laying forgotten match box on table looking out into blackness of yawning night wind have extinguished light have died away again round heard heavy plump of rain be beginning to fall heavily before five minute be past sluice of sky be fully open again downpour have become torrential lightning that hour ago have winked remotely on horizon be becoming more vivid response of thunder more immediate at gleam of frequent flash from sky tree in front of bungalow road field lay beyond started into colour seen through veil of rain that hung like curtain of glass bead firm perpendicular then vanished again into impenetrable blackness be not conscious of thought seemed only that vivid picture be spread before mind picture of dark blanketed bed on like round black pool there lay coiled sleeping cobra door of room be shut man entering must no longer find a have done match box ready to hand close

find offensive anyhow be quite sincere be most awfully sorry for cant forget that used to be greatest friend hope can remember too sat down on step led into case section of bungalow in darkness case must hear boxer making affectionate slobbering noise kindled fresh point of jealous hatred in mind dog who obeyed a master adored oldham a friend hotly burned that hate thought again of closed bedroom door black pool on blanket then spoke slowly carefully quite remember said seems to most amazing thing in world can recall love for day when settled into bungalow together joy of recall too that have taken from everything must lay hand on money affection of dog even oldham interrupted in sudden resentment at injustice a regard money may remind since have chosen to mention have not succeeded in taking away from remarked case be not roused by sarcasm must afford knowing what knew to keep calm be sorry for having kept waiting so long said may remember that begged to pay at convenience will be quite convenient to morrow dear chap broke in oldham again a if must have mentioned if hadnt case felt scarcely responsible for what said tension of storm infernal tattoo of rain heat bellowing

of thunder drowned thought speech alike boxer gave howl of protest dismay nestled close to oldham while case starting involuntarily from chair held hand to ear until appalling explosion be over rather wicked said poured out dram of neat spirit steadied recovering little felt that be behaving very foolishly in letting other see madness of rage resentment be far better that must lull oldham into unsuspicious frame of mind otherwise might suspect might not that something be prepared for in room others subsequently if quarrelled might guess that have known what lay there be dim fantastic then fancied cunning caution of unbalanced man who be at same time ready to commit most reckless violence took hold of instantly changed tone must be quiet normal must let thing take natural course without

in hand by time even took pleasure in reconciliatory speech knowing completeness with revenge prepared without planning must follow on heel have loaded pistol be ready to hand secure from detection must probably not have pulled trigger on friend be different matter that must merely acquiesce in walking in dark into room where death lay curled ready to strike seemed to to be act of god be not responsible for have not put cobra there felt sure must have happened like said besides a know kitty have quarrelled have broken engagement off of course hoped that day might come together again at least know now that hoped be nothing to do with fell in love with with yes yes really dont wonder indeed indeed do congratulate congratulate oldham gave great sigh of pleasure relief ripping of to take like that said hardly dared to hope must thanks ever so much ever so much now do know think will go to bed be dog tired have six hour ride to station morning even up there be hideously hot case again reminded that must behave naturally not plan anything not interfere oh must have drink said though im afraid there be ice ill get glass soda came out into veranda again with requisite oldham be stifling prodigious yawn im half dead with sleep probably will chuck on bed just a be to save trouble of undressing case felt hand tremble a put glass down on table know that feeling said sometimes when one be very sleepy sight of bed be altogether too much for one dare say will do same help to whisky while open soda for oldham drank peg again rose well im for bed said cant tell what relief be to to find like by way about bit of money pay exactly when convenient to next year year after if like must be wretched if thought be putting about over so good night reggie turned to go seemed to case

in large type throughout american press denouncing massacre second ball letter mr cicero b dace did not object to at since enhanced notoriety objected to ball very much indeed since amelies ingenious mind hit on simple exquisite plan of dispensing with band having in place choir of three hundred singer who in batch of one hundred at time sang dance tune effect be contagious dancer joined in also producing a press said most stupendously lyrical effect since day of sappho then mr cicero b dace sat down thought again lighting upon famous idea of auction ball in real english duke acted a auctioneer before dance put up lady for auction to be bid for by men who wished to be partner amelie swiftly sent for arthur bolney ross friend of hers who be backing in struggle for sovereignty continued to bid for for so long that out of sinister compassion for hostess stepped down from rostrum refused to dance with for fear that there must be more dancing for anybody completely spoiled

have got one moonstone brooch price three sixpence such be opening of amelies amazing campaign incident success of followed swift bewildering under violet capable guidance began not by collecting round that brisk hungry section of well born london be always ready to sing for dinner by giving huge entertainment to bring together crowd at cost by attracting attaching small band of people who mattered lady brackenbury knew very well that even in most democratic town in world certain people not necessarily prince prime minister be large piece in great haphazard game of chess crowd meantime after whom amelie secretly hankered must only get more eager to be admitted in particular lady creighton starved for entry asked amelie to dine tuesday in june when be giving series of musical party amelie found to great regret that be engaged on festive occasion gave musical party london be prey year to disordered illusion that liked music melba caruso sang there informally so seemed just happening to sing to not more than fifty people who sat in armchair at ease instead of elbowing other in squashed upright row in vain did lady creighton spread assiduous report that artist have sung out of tune that peach be sour everyone knew that have not be there that alluded to sort of fruit violet brackenbury be successful in persuading amelie not to send account of brilliant little affair to paper to refuse scrap to writer for press be careful to provide for far more telling publicity gradually craftily reef at time violet allowed friend to let out sail left flat at ritz rurally installed in spacious house in middle of regent park there be big field attached to house yielding to severe attack of americanism thought might be dangerous to suppress violet permitted to give haymaking party of newport type hay be brought in from country scattered over field mixed up with rose gardenia while guest on arrival be presented with delightful little ebony pitchfork with silver prong cedar wood rake symptom caused little uneasiness for be obvious that amelie thought haymaking party much brighter achievement than previous concert expansion continued amelie friend strolled into christie one morning found tussle going on between two eminent dealer over possession of really marvellous string of pearl at breathless pause after first going that followed fresh bid amelie said in most ringing american voice guess ill sail in right now began bidding crowd of dilettante london delight in seeing other people spend large sum of money parted for moved gloriously up auction room took stand just behind one of mosaic little gentleman who wanted pearl so badly recognition of spread through place like spilled quicksilver auctioneer with amiable bow caused pearl to be handed to for inspection with still in hand a if be not worth while returning to tray sky rocketed price by three exalting bid third of be a fire hose on ardour of competitor cheque book be fetched from car outside left room moment afterwards having drawn cheque on spot pausing only to clasp pearl round neck violet with strange sinking of heart felt a if pet tiger cub have tasted blood again after careful distinguished diet on have be feeding amelia have fancy to leave london early in july give few party at immense house have taken near maidenhead for month have have gondola sent over from venice with appropriate gondolier london found very pleasant to float about after dinner while excellent string band played in illuminated barge accompanied flotilla exciting little surprise constantly happened such a arrival one evening of artist from grand guignol who played couple of thrilling little horror in ballroom while on night great reynolds picture belonging to duke of middlesex be found to have put in appearance on wall amelie said that be birthday present to husband made further allusion to frame have gone to be repaired be draped round in cloud of silvery grey chiffon extended half over wall have violet brackenbury known outrage that friend have planned frenzy of suppressed newportism be ready to break forth be probable that must gladly have returned cheque have that morning received from amelie a be felt wholly at ease inclined to congratulate on unique signal character of amelies success never before so thought have woman so dominated season never certainly have one of countrywoman so mattered with exception perhaps of haymaking party incident of pearl at christie have be gained in quiet unsensational way lulled to content did not realize that spirit inspired queen of hostess be ready to flare up like access of malarial fever poor unsuspecting godmother who fondly believed that gondola from venice grand guignol artist from paris gem of reynolds picture be safety valve not guessing that be a oil poured on flame cotillion that night be to begin at twelve amelie be leading with one of prince big ballroom be doubly lined with seated guest when on stroke of twelve entered dressed in exact facsimile of glorious reynolds a advanced with partner into middle of room band in gallery struck up simultaneously tongue of fire shot through flimsy drapery round picture instantly enveloping in flame canvas blistered bubbled in ten second finest reynolds in world be sheet of scorched blackened rag crowd leaped to foot before panic have time to mature cause of be over there be nothing inflammable within range of swiftly consumed chiffon only little fragment of burned out ash floated on to floor fervent instantaneous heat have done work then for moment there be dead silence amelies voice be heard in quietest most english tone oh isnt that pity said then arose sudden hubbub of talk drowning sound of band at signal from amelie have started again violet stood with friend before blackened canvas next morning in empty room drawing on glove dont think understand yet effect of what have done said one doubt that fire be intentional think that lady creighton will be of more use to in future than can possibly be spook story case of frank hampden there be light visible from chink crevice of drawn curtain in window of dr rouperts study a passed on way back from dinner one night lived six door farther up same street a since have long be frequent custom for to smoke go to bed cigarette together rang asked if be at leisure servant told that have already sent message across to house asking to look in on if got home while evening be not too far advanced for casual conversational quarter of hour accordingly took off coat went straight into pleasant little front room about hung studious fragrance of book lined from floor to ceiling arthur roupert be not alone evening there be sitting on near side of fire sparkled prosperously in clear night of early december frost young man whom be sure have never seen before a entered stopped in middle of sentence turning towards door looked on most handsome diabolical face have ever beheld simultaneously roupert got up hoped must look in said let introduce to cousin mr hampden who be spending day two with be mr archdale frank of whom be speaking just now a other rose saw rouperts almost foolishly amiable fox terrier shrank away from where have be sitting by master chair instead of giving accustomed effusive greeting retreated into far corner of room where sat quivering with raised hackle with vigilant eye full of hate terror fixed on young right arm be in sling held out left hand to must excuse said be only just recovering from broken arm cousin dog doesnt approve of must like to get teeth into oddest thing ever saw archdale said roupert know fifis usual amiability call frank frank hampden whistled clicked finger together in encouraging manner fifi come here fifi said for moment thought that most confiding of lady be going to fly at apparently must not find courage for attack snapping growling retreated behind window curtain to said hampden licking lip a spoke who adore dog dont mr archdale a said that knew that lied that fifis detestation of be met with hatred quite a vivid more controlled can no more account for conviction than for sense of hellish evil that first glance at have conveyed to be quite young twenty two twenty three for guess yet from behind mask of soft boyish face there looked out spirit hard malignant mature adept in terrible path impression be quite inexplicable perfectly clear then looking across to roupert saw be watching cousin with eager intentness have to answer direct question have put to required effort to speak to to look at personally dont care about dog said rather dislike so enjoy most unwelcome popularity among fifi for instance cousin will tell how blind be adoration for see if fifi will come to if stand by said hampden fifi have half emerged from ambush behind curtain called to must not leave retreat where rage terror have driven gave little apologetic whine a if to signify be asking impossible thing beat with stumpy tail on carpet now go back to chair again frank said roupert fifi needed further invitation when have left neighbourhood bundled across room to thin white body curled like comma wriggling with delight making incomprehensible little explanation of previous conduct moment hampden moved in chair bolted away from again laughed got up well think will go to bed now that have come to keep arthur company said by way wheres cat arthur havent seen about day be facing sideways to roupert a spoke noticed that did not turn head towards gave certain casual cursory tone to question making appear mere careless inquiry havent seen either said roupert perhaps after taking counsel with fifi have thought prudent to fly from baleful presence good night frank can manage for with bandaged arm will come help oh im right thanks said good night kind good night fifi will be good friend before long arthur roupert have retired two year before from regular medical practice in a world know be undoubtedly first authority on disease aberration of brain nervous system devoting attention more particularly to riddle of obscure baffling disorder to so often supplied strange correct answer be possessed of ample competence so finding that large professional practice did not permit leisure be necessary for exploratory study have though always willing to be consulted by colleague thrown up active career for one of research wanted to learn rather than to practise without precisely mistrusting method have earned so brilliant success have inferred presence of huge field of unknown huge expanse of further possibility must perhaps put utterly out of date most advanced of theory treatment hitherto recognized in profession at time of retirement have once talked to about uncharted sea on to proposed to push forth most advanced of actual practitioner said be groping in dark on threshold of real knowledge feeling for handle fumbling for bell at most be to say in case of brain disease nerve disorder try to get at mind of patient influence so that not may exert healing power cure imperfect functioning of material part of course be tremendous step forward when look at what medical science be twenty year ago when doctor prescribed tonic tonic to heal physical damage caused by disordered mind mind be very subordinate denizen in house of mystery call man mind be more than servant who come to door take hat coat tell in word two how patient have be mind be not master of house whom have really come to see who sits there alone mortally sick perhaps in terror darkness for master of house be spirit have got to examine before can touch source of disease for farther science advance more certain be that there be master sitting within to whom mind be only servant a for body tissue nerve grey matter what will say be why more than servant clothes jacket boot im not going to stay talking in hall to mind servant longer will leave there go straight up to sick chamber will be called sort of name charlatan spiritualist what will dont care two straw about besides know quite well that colleague will still be glad to call in when be puzzled hope to be better equipped to help wont reject jungle path without exploring not witchcraft demoniacal possession myth science think have exploded in first origin everything must be spiritual be comet toothache genius just a mental suggestion have taken place of tonic so must spiritual healing take place of mental suggestion spirit be original manifestation of god in man be on prayer on faith that whole science of healing will day rest first have to investigate condition environment life for two year then have followed retirement roupert have given to study of occult spiritual influence learning about healing power contained in mental suggestion trying to get behind into more elemental essential mystery of man leaving servant a have said in hall of house while went further into presence of master of house often during go to bed cigarette multiplied into night told tale that did not make going to sleep easier nothing be too extravagant for investigation witchcraft spiritualism satanism healing touch above demoniacal possession be subject of study went deeper into human organism than mind there be myth exploded superstition that did not examine to see whether explosion have be complete shattering whether among dbris there did not remain grain of solid stuff be still solid though science have affirmed that puff of scattered smoke be be extant consequently evening when frank hampden have gone to bed be quite prepared to find that roupert have something to tell guess to hazard have illumined inquiry more so indeed because have not seen for dozen night did receive message left at house asked abruptly a door closed behind cousin havent be home servant told have asked to come in said yes did have done just what wanted in note asked to come in observe cousin tell impression saw couldnt help observing so now let have impression quite frankly said of course never saw anyone so utterly terrible said terrible exactly how asked very intensity of feeling about hampden blurred outline of paused trying to put definite shape to incomparably terrible said murderous think murderous for fun of felt like fifi saw did said suspect be right fifi walked up down room once twice then sat down with air of settling did hear ask about cat said killed last night buried in garden there be grotesqueness ludicrousness even in after talk of murder that only added horror to what do mean asked precisely what say so happened that slept very badly last night because a matter of fact be thinking about frank wondering if be on horrible track must show ailed about three in morning heard door into garden being opened window of bedroom be open be just above idea of burglar occurred to without turning on light went looked out there be bright clear starlight saw frank come out of house carrying something white in arm put down to fetch spade from tool house saw what be dug up couple of plant with lump of soil round root working slowly for must only use one arm buried cat in excavation very carefully replanted michaelmas daisy over then more terribly yet knelt down by grave must hear sobbing sobbing asked yes what said to night be be perfectly true used to be devoted to dog indeed animal especially cat now last night out in garden be in dressing gown well when came down to breakfast morning said nose have be bleeding rather severely be uneasy about went up to bedroom found good deal of blood in slop pail dressing gown be lying on bed there too be more blood quantity of cat hair told not to think about more there be nothing in least alarming when have gone out in order to make quite sure dug up michaelmas daisy for second time below found body of poor cat have cut throat must kill fifi if must be longing to fellow be fiend said for present be fiend something very like used not to be until day on broke arm pray god will cease being what be till day broke arm asked yes now do want to hear wildest most extravagant tale believe to be literally awfully true concerning asked of course also be disposed to sit up late to night there may be confirmatory evidence about story expect reid medium here at twelve there be time for to give theory before come till hour said good then listen spoke slowly putting hand over eye a so often doe when want to shut out external disturbance concentrate on history of case two month ago said a may possibly remember man called james roll be hanged at beltonborough for most atrocious murder of wife deed apparently be quite objectless there have be no quarrel after be done seemed sometimes to be distressed at crime sobbing cry sometimes to gloat over recounting with gusto there be question about guilt only about sanity with regard to that fit of remorse enjoyment might be assumed in order to produce impression that be not accountable for action be examined by government expert who asked to come down with form conclusion must neither of find other symptom of insanity about there be certain conjecture in head about what call history of case stopped down at beltonborough for day two in order to make further observation a be having interview with suddenly asked question did begin by killing fly usually be rather sullen silent often must not answer when asked eye brightened said yes fly first then cat dog after must get nothing further out of have got what expected to get in other respect be a far a must judge perfectly sane be scarcely possible to call homicidal maniac for have never before shown sign of wanting to take human life a be have committed atrocious murder have be shut up a homicidal maniac think there be doubt that by time must have killed warder now man in fit of rage be altogether sane yet commute sentence of who have killed when beside with passion james roll have not even that extenuation be hanged feel convinced that frank be suffering from early stage of james roll malady feel convinced also that hanging of james roll infected with hanging of james roll caused asked doubt a will see when state theory hope to prove that theory be correct hope to cure cousin roupert sat up looked at while said then sank back in chair again a before covered eye with hand now for theory said there be very steep hill in beltonborough with sharp dangerous corner just outside prison gate practically at moment when james roll be being taken to scaffold frank came tearing down hill on bicycle to catch early train to town skidded fell just outside prison sustained compound fracture of right arm be important that must be moved a little a possible carried straight into prison infirmary where chloroform be administered prison surgeon set arm be very bad fracture be under ansthetic for considerable time when came round be changed seemed a if spirit have taken possession of body be not same person from being charming boy have become something hellish roupert sat up again looked at there be theory said that in certain condition such a deep mesmeric trance under stupefaction of complete ansthetic bond seem so indissolubly to unite man spirit to mind body be strangely loosened condition approach to of temporary death often under ansthetic beat of heart be nearly suspended often breathing be nearly suspended happened to frank under chloroform that morning connexion between spirit body be loosened there be theory must consider also be proved think beyond doubt at moment of death particularly of sudden violent death spirit though severed from body have inhabited doe not at once leave vicinity remains hovering near to discarded tenement from have be expelled well at hour when frank spirit be maintaining relaxed hold on body spirit violent strong be close at hand spirit have just be disembodied believe spirit of james roll entered took possession felt then what have felt before since namely stir of horror in head that made hair move can often see in dog have seen to night in fifi when terror rage erects hackle experience be only momentary flame of thing awful burning quality licked hotly round how be reid to help asked may be able to test for part at rate of theory said roupert be extraordinarily powerful medium in way of producing materialized form of spirit believe to be honest high minded now if frank body be possessed by murderous spirit be at least possible that frank own spirit now unhoused evicted will be hovering near rightful habitation will ask if spirit of frank hampden be here will ask if can assume material form if reid can produce materialization will doubtless wear appearance of frank will try anyhow ah doubt be reid very gentle tapping sounded on front door just outside room roupert got up told reid not to ring said for fear that frank must hear will let in left room in moment came back with medium small perfectly commonplace looking man smug prosperous then met eye thought commonplace no longer seemed to look out through beyond in few minute roupert who have often sat with reid before explained what be wanted told that wished to know if spirit of frank hampden be about if so whether must communicate with see be reid asked only one question have frank hampdens spirit be long out of body said roupert hesitated for moment believe to have be out of body for about two month answered electric light be put out glow from fire be bright enough to make red twilight in room must clearly see profile of medium black against illumination back of chair in sat full face of roupert glint of reflected light on glass of picture with perfect distinctness fifi who have curled up on hearthrug almost immediately medium went into trance saw head bowed over chest heard breathing have be short panting a passed into unconsciousness grow quiet again how long sat there in silence without anything supernormal occurring know appeared to not to be many minute before very loud rap sounded from table began to quiver under hand then roupert asked be spirit of frank hampden here there be assent of three rap will be able to see asked there be two rap after pause third again sat in silence time for much longer period think clock on mantelpiece twice chimed quarter hour then from direction of door there blew across room very cold current of air curtain in window stirred with fifi imagine felt too for sat up sneezed drew little nearer to fire simultaneously be inwardly aware that there be something somebody in room have not be there before have not entered through door for when current of air began to blow looked at certainly have not opened then roupert whispered look be coming medium head have fallen back over chest in region of heart there appeared faint luminous area inside there be going on energy activity whorl spiral of grey curling intertwining growing thicker extending began building up in air for little while must not make out what be be thus taking shape in red twilight then a materialization progressed defined into human form swathed in misty opaque vesture at top above shoulder now quite formed there rose outline of head feature growing moment more distinct fashioned face of pallid silent fading into darkness below stood head torso of human being face be clearly recognizable be scarce hour since have looked on feature wore so heart broken anguish in curve of beautiful mouth in tortured eye that throat worked for very pity compassion then roupert spoke frank said head bowed lip moved heard nothing why be not in body asked time there came whisper just audible cant cant said someone be there someone terrible for god sake help white agonized face grew more convulsed cant bear said for god sake for god sake looked away from face for moment to hearthrug where sudden noise attracted attention fifi be sitting bolt upright looking eagerly upwards noise heard be pleased thumping of tail then came cautiously forward still gazing at image hour before have driven frenzied with rage terror uttering little anxious whinings seeking attention finally held out paw gave short whisper of bark with demand notice of favourite if have be inclined to doubt before think must now have be convinced that here in inscrutable manifestation be true frank hampden once more roupert spoke will do that man can do frank said by god grace will restore figure slowly faded of seemed withdrawn back into medium to be dispersed in dusk before long reid breath again grew quick laboured a passed out of trance then drenched with sweat came to roupert told that sance have be successful then turning on light again sat still while medium recovered from exhaustion before left roupert engaged to hold in readiness for further sance next day in case be telephoned for when have gone drew up chair to fire while fifi went nosing about room a if searching for trace of friend for long time roupert sat in silence frowning heavily at fire asking question from time to time to satisfy that impression have be identical then appeared to make up mind will do said at least will make attempt be frank whom saw just now up to point theory be confirmed of course there risk there awful risk archdale wouldnt anybody take risk to cure anguish looked upon be human spirit man disembodied not dead know that earthly habitation be being defiled profaned by murderous occupant see horror that own hand work brain be pleasant servant be planning worse thing yet cant doubt that be so no reasonable man can doubt so incredible so damnable thing if struggle that there must be be too much for body that seek to free good lord what tale for coroner inquest mean that risk cousin death asked necessarily who can tell what will happen be not for of what nature be spirit hope to expel from poor lad body strong desperate one must never have taken possession of will cling with force to tenement have usurped if drive out if god help to do what awful evil power will once more be abroad cant help that there be holy justice reparation to be done cant count cost now let think again got up began pacing up down room now muttering to now speaking aloud a if in argument with terrible risk for reid too said for reid most of for will be in deep trance such power of faith a can exert must defend first of yet cant get at roll tell without medium must of course tell reid everything ask if will take risk may refuse though dont think will for there courage of saint in man then there frank frank body mean must be absolutely unconscious when operation take place human nerve must stand with fiend in possession must consent to deep deepest possible unconsciousness by jove there new german drug appears safe enough certainly produce sleep come nearest of to death seems to stupefy very spirit hyocampine of course dont tell havent heard of tasteless too good thing that criminal class cant get hold of well there be prayer faith in almighty power lighten darkness beseech thee o lord doe too if motif be right thats one of few fact can be quite sure about can run lot of risk if utterly believe that suddenly whole burden of perplexity anxious thought seemed lifted off mind ill go see reid to morrow morning said believe will consent when know do want to see end of look on glory of god come if like if come must be strung up to highest pitch of trust serenity that be capable of yes do be here believe that evil however deadly powerful be altogether inferior in calibre fighting power to good also will like friend at elbow perhaps oughtnt to urge that a reason for dont want personal feeling to influence only come if want to witness power of god not reid not mine be nothing at except mere mossy channel for one moment paused knew that be wavering in weakness of flesh instantly got hold of again there only one power cant fail said hell crash into fragment against next morning got note from roupert saying that reid consented asking to come in to house punctually at half past two if have decided to be with when arrived found roupert frank hampden sitting over coffee in study hampden have just drunk isnt there home for cat somewhere in battersea be asking ill go find new one for a yours appears to have vanished entirely yawned feeble habit to go to sleep after lunch said really think will have nap ive got astonishing inclination way give hour will then well go down to cat home get large fat cat guessed that roupert have already given cousin dose of hyocampine just a latter be pulling chair round so that need not face light spoke make proper job of frank said lie on sofa one always wake feeling cramped if one go to sleep in chair hampdens eyelid be already drooping shuffled heavily across to sofa all right mumbled sorry for being so rude mr mr archdale must have just forty wonder why forty immediately went to sleep roupert waited moment hampden did not stir again then went out returned with reid who have be waiting in bedroom explanation have already be made in silence darkened room by drawing thick curtain across window only little light came in from edge a last night firelight flickered on wall then roupert locked door took place round table into thy hand o lord commend spirit said before many minute be over medium head dropped forward after little struggle went into trance spirit of james roll said roupert in silence followed must hear slow breathing of hampden a slept in remote unconsciousness chink of light from window fell full on face must see very distinctly then heard breathing quicker shudder passed through shaking sofa where lay face hitherto serene quiescent began to twitch cant wake whispered roupert gave full dose then not from door at from direction of sofa there came icy blast of wind simultaneously shattering rap from table be that james roll asked roupert three rap answered then in name of god said roupert in loud steady voice come from where be be made manifest suddenly hampden began to groan mouth worked ground teeth together horrible convulsion seized face distortion of rending agony like sometimes seizes on dying man whose body cling desperately to spirit be emerging from rattle strangled gulping came from throat foam gathered on lip be there that be james roll said roupert in loud voice of exultation in name of god come out convulsion redoubled body writhed bent like of poisoned man then round face brightest about mouth there formed pale greenish light corrupt awful began to wreathe into line curve weaving intertwining grew in height like luminous column built without hand in darkness defined into human form until in air just above recumbent body stood complete with emergence convulsion groanings subsided at end when wraith in semblance of swathed man with face of such murderous cruelty shuddered a looked at stood fully fashioned finished body of frank hampden lay quite still in sleep be nearest of to death then rouperts voice spoke again clear peremptory triumphant begone james roll cried very slowly materialized spirit began to move floating like balloon in almost windless air slowly drifted towards with eye fixed on unconscious medium alight with awful purpose mouth curled into sort of hellish smile came quite close to a if sucked there edge of outline began to extend towards feeler a of little whirlpool of water drawn down into sink till end of just touched in name of holiest by power of highest shouted roupert bid go to place that have appointed for then can only describe what happened by saying that shock blinding deafening overwhelming sense shook room leaped into blaze of light thunder of sound rent air yet knew that came from within be echo of spiritual crisis raged round made manifest to bodily sense silence a of frozen polar night succeeded then once again light began to be built up over hampdens body that lay utterly still beside curtain fashioned only very faintly into outline of man seemed to be drawn inwards absorbed by motionless figure waited till have disappeared altogether medium stirred struggled be over said laid head on arm roupert got up drew back curtain from outside door came scratching whinings presently unlocked let fifi in saluted everybody in exuberant fashion then came to sofa sniffed jumped up on wagging tail be not till late in afternoon frank hampden came to beautiful spirit looked out of jolly boyish eye mr andrews control mr andrew be certainly athenian by nature be delight not only to hear new thing to put into practice enjoying excellent health be able to take almost liberty with constitution for long time be absorbed in maelstrom of diet of seemed to suit to perfection for couple of month adopted pembroke treatment drove of sheep be sacrificed to supply with sufficient minced mutton while utmost resource of kitchen boiler be needed to give ocean of hot water found necessary to drink day except at meal having obtained utmost benefit derivable from system nourished ample vigorous frame by way of change on pyramid of grated nut carefully weighed out can not be doubted that must enthusiastically have fed on chopped up hard boiled egg like canary if must have found system of diet inculcated proceeding husband for mild apparently yielding disposition must at bottom have be man of iron soul for absolutely refused to embark on of experiment though never dissuaded wife from so doing stuck firmly like limpet to three solid satisfactory meal not disdaining minced mutton even modicum of milled nut when felt that must be agreeable adding to ordinary diet without relying on two childless middle aged lived in extreme happiness comfort together doubt mr andrews enthusiasm perennial amusement husband derived from served to keep sunlight of life shining on be never bored always busy perhaps even more than diet secured serenity of health time came when mr andrew in unacknowledged despair of feeling better more vigorous physically than always did turned athenian mind towards mental psychical fad began by telling fortune of friend by mean of card though must always say how knew following rule of primer that husband have have scarlet fever when be twenty three yet fact that knew perfectly well without help of card made divination rather le amazing tried christian science though only for short time since amount of demonstration over false claim must rid one day of conviction that have raging toothache whereas dentist convinced in moment by short though agonizing application of pincer that must remove toothache have resisted precept of temporary creed excursion into realm of astrology succeeded conjointly study of palmistry at point husband for first time began to take interest in wife preoccupation certainly did seem very odd that horoscope must testify to identical event line in hand so plainly showed wife certain apparent discrepancy be doubt capable of explanation when knew that right hand indicated what nature meant to be left what have made of must not be gratifying to find have lived so closely up to possibility be pleasant again to find wife so enthusiastic about plump pink palm most remarkable hand dear said never saw evidence of such pluck determination look at mount of jupiter splendid mr andrew did not know exactly what mount of jupiter be knew what pluck determination be upon word dear said there may be something in will borrow primer if may now about future mr andrew be already peering eagerly into future be a splendid a mount of jupiter such line of life said let see be fifty eight be not well on go sixty seventy eighty without break in why declare reach ninety henry be very gratifying showed only ordinary politeness on henry part to inquire into wife prospect ah havent line a dear said after if live in perfect health till be eighty two be what hand tell im sure there reason to complain for one shant when mr andrew have told fortune of husband friend secured on whole such charming future be wonder that went further into matter more psychical occult course of gazing into most expensive crystal proved disappointing since must never see anything except reflection of object in room while husband now actively taking part in investigation merely fell asleep when attempted to see anything there hoped that might not be ordinary sleep condition of deep trance found be one of accompanying phenomenon productive of great result trance be so deep that recollection of what occurred therein ever remained in mind with exception of one occasion on dreamed about boiled rabbit a have partaken of disgusting provender at lunch day mr andrew regarded dream a retrospective in character a not possessed of prophetic significance be about time that became member of psychical research society attention must not be struck by wonderful phenomenon resulting from practice of automatic writing if have psychical gift in direction be now settled conviction of henry andrew wife that have apparently have to be done be to hold pencil over writing pad conveniently placed abstract mind from hand held pencil sit there to see what happened theory be that controlling spirit might take possession of pencil dictate message from other world pencil must record eager study of psychical journal warned that patient practice might be necessary before result be arrived at reason being that control must get used to novel instrument of communication warning be given that must not be discouraged if for long time nothing be recorded on paper except meaningless line appeared that most people if must only be patient enough must be rewarded by symptom of presence of control before very long when once beginning be made progress be apt to be very rapid be recommended also that practice must be regular if possible must take place at same time day idea fired mr andrew at once upon word dear henry said think be very well worth trying for crystal be yielding result at psychical gift be possessed by everybody in degree so very interesting article say if ours lie in direction of crystal gazing make more probable that will achieve something in automatic writing a for regular time for practising what must be more pleasant than to sit out in garden after tea when have come in from golf enjoy warm evening with feeling that be occupying instead of sitting idle a be apt to do henry distinctly approved of suggestion be often little fatigued after golf though be going to live till ninety prospect of sitting quietly in chair in garden instead of feeling that ought to be weeding be quite pleasant one then will sit with paper pencil dear asked mr andrew referred to essay gave elementary instruction certainly said will try that first say that two hand holding pencil often produce extraordinary result will begin a suggest singly declare that hand feel quite fidgety already a if control be just waiting for mean of communication to be prepared everything in mr andrews house be in apple pie order took time at to find two writing pad couple of sharpened pencil with rejoined husband on paved walk where have have tea outside drawing room with pencil in hand fixed eye firmly on top of mulberry tree at edge of lawn waited with left hand free for cigarette did same mind kept going back to boiled rabbit have dreamed of after crystal gazing still seemed to very unusual occurrence for to best of recollection have never dreamed of boiled rabbit before within few day time very promising development have taken place almost immediately mr andrew have begun to trace angled line on paper if did not suggest anything else particular be remarkably like temperature chart of very feverish patient hand seemingly without volition on part made energetic dash dab over paper felt very odd tingling sensation in finger must scarcely be put down to anything else than presence of control husband scarcely le fortunate also began to trace queer pattern of irregular curve on sheet looked very much a if be word though be like word be not known word way up attempted to read though a mr andrew said might easily be russian chinese must account for being wholly meaningless to english eye sheet of possible russian be thus poured out by mr andrew whole hospital record of fever chart on part of wife at present came within measurable distance of intelligibility control seemed incapable of making understood then on memorable day mr andrews pencil evinced irresistible desire to write figure after inscribing one two one two great many time wrote quite distinctly gave great dash a if have said last word what indicates dear said passing over to mr andrew think must leave to control to determine looked at moment in silence then great thought splendidly striking rose in excitement henry be a plain a plain said be forty nine be fifty eight age be thus wonderfully conjoined certainly mean that must act together come hold pencil with well be very curious said henry did a be told at point experiment entered second phase pencil thus jointly held at once developed intelligible activity instead of mere fever chart numeral began to produce whole sentence be true to point of being positive truism before went to dinner night be told in large sprawling hand wisdom be more than wealth fearlessness be best hate blind eye of love very next day more unimpeachable sentiment be poured forth at end be written from pocky pocky then be clearly control became to mr mr andrew established personality with mind stored with moral generality very often practical application must be made of dictum a for instance when mr andrew be hesitating a to whether to invest quite considerable sum of money in rather speculative venture recollecting that pocky have said that wisdom be better than wealth very prudently refrained have satisfaction of seeing speculative concern come most tremendous smash very soon after required good deal of ingenuity to fit pockys utterance into affair of daily life mr andrew be getting little tired of generality when curtain went up on third phase be coincident with outbreak of german war when nothing else be present in mind of husband wife pocky suddenly became patriotic truculent for whole evening wrote kill treacherous german avenge scrap of paper very soon after just when england generally be beginning to be excited over rumour that host of russian be passing through country to french battle front made further revelation of host of russia be with wrote cossack from steppe troop of great white tsar hundred thousand russia to england england to france ally triumph from pocksky pencil gave great dash flew from finger held be most clearly written in voice trembled with excitement mr andrew read out there dear said dont think need have further doubt about russian look how be signed not pocky longer pocksky be russian name if ever there be one pocksky so be said mr andrew putting on spectacle well be most wonderful to think that in early day when pencil used to write thing couldnt read suggested might be russian feel doubt that be said mr andrew firmly wish now that have kept writing too used to call fever chart dare say poor fellow in hospital have temperature like mr andrew did not feel so sure of sound little far fetched dear said though quite agree with about possibility of being pocksky who wrote through wonder who be great general probably can easily imagine excitement pervaded oakley in week followed when day brought fresh butler railway porter into public press who have told somebody who have told author of letter in question that have seen bearded soldier stepping out of train with blind drawn down shaking snow off boot mattered nothing that whole romance be officially denied indeed only made mr andrew very indignant at suppression of war news war office may say what like exclaimed indeed seems to make business to deny what know to be true think must learn few word of russian in case meet soldier with beard god save tsar something of kind will send for russian grammar now let see what pocksky have to tell to night that further confirmation of pockskys announcement on subject ever came to light be scarcely noticed by automatic writer for pocksky be bursting with other news rather terrified interpreter when there be nervousness about possible zeppelin raid by saying fire from wicked one in cloud fourteen twelve fourteen cellar best since must hardly mean anything that raid be to be expected on fourteenth of december mr mr andrew indeed large number of friend spent evening in cellar coming out again when be definitely after midnight relief at finding that harm have be done speedily obliterated feeling pocksky have misled when on christmas eve said spirit of peace descends though certain people thought meant that war must soon be over truce on western front for christmas day be more generally believed to bear out remarkable prophecy through spring pocksky continued voluble must not definitely commit over course that italy be to take a mr andrew triumphantly pointed out italy must not definitely commit just showed how right pocksky be rather went back to pocky style over said prudence be better than precipitation italy prepares before making decision wisdom guide counsel wisdom be ever best from pocksky intermittently forcing of dardanelles occupied now here rather odd point arose mr andrew at time have to spend week in town only mr andrew held pencil intelligence of pocksky used to express with in message pocksky spelled name of strait dardanels for know may be russian form two day ago mr andrew kindly sent one of message be glad to see be most optimistic in tone enclosed note from saying will like to see what pocksky say about dardanels isnt wonderful so mr andrew writing independently of pocksky spell dardanelles same way a pocksky doe when control pencil can not help wondering if control be will say quite complete wonder also how strait will get spelt when mr andrew return be rather puzzling ape hugh marsham have spent day a good tourist must in

jealousy stirred like coiled snake in told that might be inconvenient aunt whom be going to meet suggestion did not in least satisfy when remembered obvious pleasure with have read telegram that doubt announced arrival nailed to writing table till couple of very tepid letter be finished then with growing restlessness went out through hall into warm still night most of hotel have gone indoors to dress for dinner sitting on veranda with back to be julia chair be drawn in front of facing be young man on whose face light shone be looking eagerly at hand rested on knee hugh turned abruptly went back into hotel julia for last three day have with two other friend made very pleasant party of four at lunch dinner to night when entered dining room found that place be laid here for three only at far distant table in window be sitting julia young man whom have seen with on veranda identity be casually disclosed a dinner went on one of companion have seen lord paterson in cairo hugh have only wandering ear for table talk quick glancing eye ever growing more sombre for in window heavy face a noted token sign of intimacy grew sullen savage then before dinner be over rose passed out into garden jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of to whom owes misery than love can bear to be parted from object of adoration presently hugh two friend went sat a be usual with on veranda outside here there about garden be wandering couple in light of full moon be to be lamp at karnak to night when tiresome people have gone soon identified julia lord paterson passed repassed down rose embowered alley hidden sometimes behind bush then appearing again for few pace sight of vanishing of again served to confirm already needed confirmation a jealousy grew moment more bitter so moment hugh grew more more dangerously enraged apparently lord paterson be not one of tiresome people whom julia longed to get away from presently two companion left for be starting now to ride out to karnak hugh sat on smoking throwing away half consumed endless series of cigarette have ordered that two horse one with side saddle must be ready at ten at ten meant to go to girl remind her of engagement till then must wait here wait watch if veranda have be on fire felt must not have left to seek safety in place where be unable to see bushy path where two strolled then emerged from on to broader walk led straight to where be sitting after few whispered word lord paterson left there came quickly towards hotel passed close by hugh gave so hugh thought glance of amused derision went into hotel julia came quickly towards when lord paterson have gone oh hughie said will be tremendous angel lord paterson yes he just gone in such dear must delight in lord paterson only here for one night he dying to see karnak by moonlight so will lend horse absolutely insists must go out there with amazing effrontery of took hughs breath away in moment pause rage flamed within thought be going out with said be well see made penitent mouth again have seemed so enchanting to afternoon oh hughie dont understand said hugh got up feeling to be one shaking black jelly of wounded anger im not sure if do said doubt soon will anyhow want to ask something want to promise to marry opened great childlike eye to widest then closed into mere slit again a broke out into laugh marry said silly darling fellow be good joke suddenly from garden there sounded jubilant scamper of running foot next moment great grey ape sprang on to veranda beside looked eagerly with keen dog eye at hugh a if intent on obeying yet unspoken command julia gave little shriek of fright clung to oh that horrible animal cried hughie take care of sudden ray of illumination came to hugh extraordinary fantastic thing rankin have said to became sober real simultaneously girl clinging finger on arm became like touch of poisonous preying thing snake coil sucker of octopus hooked wing of vampire bat something within still shook trembled like quicksand conscious mind be quite clear collected go away said to ape pointed into garden scampered off still gleefully spurning kicking soft sandy path then quietly turned to girl there gone said be just tame thing escaped saw one like other day on end of string a for horse will be delighted to let lord paterson have be ten now will be round girl have quite recovered from fright ah hughie be dear said do understand yes perfectly said julia went to dress for riding presently hugh saw off from gate with courteous wish for pleasant ride then went back to bedroom opened little box where kept scarab hour later be walking out alone on road to karnak in pocket be image of tahu met have formed no clear idea of what be meaning to do immediate reason for expedition be once again must not bear to lose sight of julia companion moon be high feathery outline of palm grove be clearly delicately etched on dark velvet of heaven star sat among branch like speck of golden fruit caressing scent of bean flower be wafted over road often have to stand aside to let pas group of noisy tourist mounted on white donkey coming riotously home from show piece of karnak by moonlight then striking off road passed beside horseshoe lake in depth of whose black water star burned unwaveringly by entrance of ruined temple of mut then with stab of jealousy screamed for revenge saw tied up to pillar just within own horse so be here gave beast wide berth lest recognizing must whinny perhaps betray presence creeping in shadow of wall behind row of great cat headed statue stole into inner court of temple here for first time caught sight of two at far end of enclosure a turned white faced in moonlight saw paterson kiss girl stood there with neck arm interlaced then began walking towards again stepped into dark chamber on right to avoid meeting have that strange stale animal odour about hang in egyptian temple with thrill of glee saw by ray of moonlight streamed in through door that by chance have stepped into shrine round sit dog faced ape whose secret name knew whose controlling spell lay in breast pocket often have felt underworld horror dwelt here a thing petrified corpse like to night be petrified no longer for image seemed tense quivering with life at moment must put into face leered hated lusted demoniac power seemed to be flowing into from be to use a wished rankin fantastic tale be bursting with reality knew with certainty with night watcher wait for day that lordship of spirit of ape incarnate discarnate must descend on a on anointed king moment thrice pronounced secret name be going to do too knew also that all hesitated for now be to determine what order lord must give seemed that image in breast pocket be aware for throbbed vibrated against chest like boiling kettle must not make up mind what to do fed a with fuel by jealousy love hate revenge sense of magical control wielded must be resisted no longer boiled over drew from pocket image where be engraven secret name tahu met tahu met tahu met shouted aloud there be moment absolute stillness then came wild scream of fright from horse heard gallop off madly into night slowly like lamp turned down then finally turned out blaze of moon faded into utter darkness in darkness whispered with gradually increasing noise of scratching scamperings felt that wall of narrow chamber where stood be a in dream going farther farther away from until though still darkness be impenetrable knew that be standing in immense space one wall fancied be still near close behind space be full of knew not what unseen presence extended away away to side of in front of then be aware that be not standing sitting for beneath hand must feel arm a of throne of seat edge pressed just below knee animal odour have noticed before increased enormously in pungency sniffed in ecstatically a if have be scent of beanfields mixed with be sweetness of incense savour a of roast meat at that withdrawn light began to glow once more only now be not whiteness of moon redder glow a of flame aspired sank again saw where be now be seated on chair of pink granite little in front of be huge altar on limb smoked overhead be low roof supported at interval by painted pillar whole of vast floor be full of great grey ape squatting in dense row sometimes bowed head to ground sometimes a by signal raised again myriad of obscene expectant eye faced glowed from within a cat eye glow in dusk with infinity of hellish power power be to command gloried in bring in said more indeed be not sure if said be just thought a if spoke soundless language of animal understood clambered leaped over other to do bidding then huddled wave of surged up in front of where sat a broke in foam of evil eye paw switching tail disclosed two whom have ordered to be brought before what will do with asked cudgelling monkey brain for infamous invention kiss other said at length in order to inflame brutality of jealousy further laughed chatteringly a white trembling lip met felt that remnant of humanity be draining from there be little left in whole nature must be deemed to belong to man hundred awful scheme ran about through brain a spark of fire run through charred ash of burnt paper then julia turned face towards in hideous entry that have made in wave of ape hair have fallen down streamed over shoulder at that sight of woman hair unbound remnant of manhood be not submerged in foulness of supreme apehood made one tremendous appeal to like final convulsion of dying at bidding of impulse hand came together snapped image in

perfectly genuine gave a be false frame to by manner in presented phenomenon pretended at sances to go into trance during be controlled sometimes by spirit of ancient egyptian priest who gave news to inquirer about dead friend relative sometimes more directly by dead friend relative who spoke through a matter of fact waghorn must not be in trance at perfectly conscious extracting a sat quiescent with closed eye knowledge remembered even forgotten lurked in mind of sitter bringing out in speech of mentu egyptian control of lost friend relative about whom inquiry be being made fraudulent also a purporting to come from intelligence of discarnate spirit be piece of information gave a to condition under who have passed over still lived be here that chiefly brought consolation to credulous for

materialized spirit smell of incense heralded cardinal newman bag of conjuring trick in fact disgrace make laughing stock of impostor who profess to be able to bring seen world into connection with unseen world to do waghorn justice did not often employ crude contrivance for telepathic thought reading gift be far more convincing to sitter occasionally however power in line used to fail then must be confessed presented egyptian control with trapping circumstance of degrading device such be general scheme of procedure when richard waghorn with sister a accomplice in case mechanical trick be necessary undertook to reveal spirit world to material world be pleasant handsome pair of young people gifted with manner that if anything disarmed suspicion too much while futile old gentleman found quite agreeable to sit in dark holding julias firm cool hand similarly constituted old lady be recipient of thrilling emotion when held richards touch of declared be strangely electric there sat while richard breathing deeply moaning in simulated trance be mouthpiece of mentu told thing for indubitable gift of thought reading be impossible for to know if power be not coming through properly listened hardly le thrilled to spirit rappings musical box unverifiable information about condition of life where mortal coil hamper no longer be very interesting soothing edifying then one day there occurred irruption of something wholly unexpected inexplicable brother sister be dining quietly after busy unsatisfactory day when tinkling summons came from telephone richard found that loud voice belonging so said to mr gardner wanted to arrange sitting alone for next day address be given made appointment for half past two without much enthusiasm went back to dinner stranger said to sister with address reference introduction hope will be in better form to morrow there be nothing rappings music to day be boring also be dangerous for one may be detected at time got infernal blow on knuckle from new electric tapper julia laughed know heard said there be quite wrong noise in one of tap a be spelling out silver wing lit cigarette frowning at smoke thats worst of profession said on day can get right inside mind of sitter a know bring out most surprising information on other day to day for instance there have be many such lately there mere blank wall in front of will lose position if happens often nobody will pay fee only to hear spirit rappings generality theyre better than nothing said julia very little help to fill up hate using dont remember when began investigating just alone how often seemed on verge of genuine supernatural manifestation appeared to be just round corner yes never turned corner never got beyond mere thought reading got up know didnt there always seemed possibility door be ajar wasnt locked have never ceased to be ajar often when mere thought reading a call be flowing along most smoothly feel that if only must abandon whole consciousness little more completely something somebody must really take control of wish must yet im frightened of might revenge for fraud ive perpetrated in name come let play piquet forget about be settled that julia must be present next day when stranger came for sitting in order that if richards thought reading be not coming through better than have done lately must help in rappings luminous patch musical box mr gardner be punctual to appointment tall quiet well dressed woman who stated with perfect frankness object in wishing for sance view about spirit communication must immensely like to believe in spirit communication said such a be told be capable of producing at present dont be important that atmosphere must not be one of hostility said waghorn in dreamy professional manner bring hostility said be in state will say of benevolent neutrality unless smiled in charming manner unless benevolent neutrality have come to mean malevolent hostility that assure be not case with want to believe paused moment may say without offence asked may tell that spirit rappings curious light sound of music interest in least be already seated in room where sance be to be held window be thickly curtained there be only glimmer of light from red lamp even spirit must very likely desire to have extinguished if visitor took interest in such thing waghorn felt that sister have wasted time in adjusting electric hammer made to rap by pressure of foot on switch concealed in thick rug underneath table behind sliding panel in stringing across ceiling invisible wire on luminous globe ran in making ready auxiliary paraphernalia in case genuine telepathy be not on tap so with voice dreamier than before with slower utterance a be supposed to be beginning to sink into trance just said cant foretell manner in may choose to make presence known gave one loud rap perfectly conveyed word to sister indicating that conjuring trick be not to be used subsequently if really necessary must rap yes to music magic light must be displayed then began to breathe quickly in snorting manner to show that control be taking possession of brother be going into trance very quickly said julia there be dead silence almost immediately clear shining lucidity spread like sunshine after day of cloud over waghorns brain moment found knowing more more about complete stranger who sat with hand touching felt sub conscious brain have lately lain befogged imperceptive sun under brilliant clarity of illumination have come to in impressive bass in mentu be wont to give vent to revelation said be here mentu be here felt table rocking beneath hand surprised since have exerted pressure on supposed that julia have not understood signal be beginning conjuring trick one hand of be in hers by pressure of finger tip conveyed to in code dont do instantly answered back wasnt paid more heed to though table continued to oscillate tip in very curious manner for mind be steeped in flood of image impressed on brain what will mentu tell to day went on with pause between sentence someone have come to consult mentu be lady can see wear locket round neck below coat with piece of black hair under glass between gold felt slight jerk from mr gardner hand in finger tip code said to julia ask julia whispered across table be that so yes said mr gardner waghorn heard take breath quickly just remembered that be not in mourning that made difference knew not guessing that mr gardner wished to know something from man woman on whose head that hair once grew be contained in locket rested unseen below buttoned jacket then next moment knew also that be man hair thereafter flood of sun precise mental impression poured over in spate of bright water want to know about boy whose hair be in locket be not boy now be according to earth eye grown man there be d see d not dick not david there be y be denys not saint denys not french english denys denys bristow paused moment heard mr gardner whisper yes be right

margaret bristow now margaret waghorn saw name quite clearly yet hesitated be not gardner at then struck for first time that nothing be more likely than mr gardner have adopted pseudonym went on margaret forsyth be denyss sister margaret want to know about denys denys be coming will be here in moment have spoken of sister before did not call margaret called q called queenie will queenie speak waghorn felt trembling of hand heard twice try to speak be unable to control trembling in voice can denys speak to said in whisper can really come here up to moment waghorn have be enjoying immensely for after day in have be unable to get into touch with rare marvellous gift of consciousness reading be blissful to find mastery again besieged with image margaret forsyths contact revealed to have be producing in mentus impressive voice revelling in restored power mind lay open to like book must read where liked on page familiar to on page have remained long unturned at moment a sudden a qualm of sickness be aware of startling change in quality of perception fresh knowledge of denys bristow came into mind felt that be coming not from from other source odd buzzing sang in ear a when ansthetic begin to take effect opening eye thought saw strange patch of light inconsistent with faint illumination of red lamp hovering over breast at same moment heard though dimly for head be full of confused noise violent rapping of electric hammer already only half conscious felt impotent irritation with sister for employing trick struggled with oncoming of paralysis be swiftly invading mind physical being struggled in vain next moment overwhelmed with onrush of huge enveloping blackness lost consciousness altogether trance that have often simulated have invaded knew nothing more came to again with feeling that have be recalled from vast distance still unable to move sat listening to quick panting of own breath before realized what noise be face from sweat poured in stream rested on something cold hard presently when opened eye saw that head have fallen forward upon table felt utterly exhausted yet somehow strangely satisfied amazing thing have happened then a recovered began to remember that have be reading mr gardner mr forsyths mind when power external to took possession of on left heard julias voice speaking very familiar word be coming out of trance said will be again in moment now with sense of great weariness raised head disengaged hand from of two woman sank back in chair draw back curtain said to julia open window be suffocating did a told saw red ray of sun near to setting pour into room while breeze of sunset refreshed air on right still sat mr forsyth wiping eye smiling at having opened window julia came back to table looking at with curious anxious intentness then mr spoke have be too marvellous said can not thank enough will do exactly a rather denys told about test if be right will certainly leave house to morrow taking servant with be so like denys to think of too to waghorn meant nothing might have be speaking hebrew to julia a often did answered for brother know nothing of what happened in trance said mr forsyth got up will go straight home said feel sure that will find just what denys described may telephone to about at once yes pray do said julia will be most anxious to hear richard got up to show out having regained foot staggered collapsed into chair again mr forsyth must not hear of attempting to move just yet julia having taken to door returned to brother be usual for when sitting be over to feign great exhaustion realism of acting to day have almost deceived into thinking that something not yet experienced in sances have occurred besides have said such strange detailed extraordinary thing be still where have left there must be reason now that be alone to keep up feigned languor dick said whats matter what happened couldnt understand at why did say thing stirred sat up im better said be who have to tell what happened remember up to certain point after lost consciousness completely remember thinking be rocking table told not to yes wasnt rocking thought be well be of then said be vexed because mr gardner mr forsyth have said didnt want that sort of thing be reading a never read one before told about locket black hair got brother name got name nickname queenie then asked if denys must really come at moment something began to take possession of think saw light a usual over breast think heard tremendous rapping did do of did really happen julia stared at for moment in silence did of said happened must have pressed breast pocket switch trod on switch of hammer opened coat have not got breast pocket switch said certainly did not tread on hammer switch julia moved chair little closer to hammer did not sound right said be ten time louder than have ever heard light be quite different somehow be much brighter must see everything in room quite distinctly go on dick cant thats know until came to leaning over table bathed in perspiration tell what happened dick do swear be true asked certainly do go on light grew then faded again to glimmer said then suddenly began to talk in different voice wasnt mentu longer mr forsyth recognized instantly thought what wonderful luck be that must have hit on voice be like brother then have long talk must have lasted hour reminded other how denys have come to live with husband on father death be only eighteen at time still at school be killed in street accident being run over by bicycle two day before birthday be correct thought never heard mind reading so clearly quickly hardly paused at julia be silent moment dick dont really know what followed asked not in smallest degree said well thought have gone mad said mr forsyth asked for test something be not known to never have be known to gave instantly laughed denys laughed voice spoke laughed told to look behind row of book beside bed in room be still known a denyss room must find

got up meant said did cried what if meant said did impossible said good lord whats impossible asked what if really be that have so long pretended to be what if be medium one who be mysterious bridge between quick dead im frightened im bound to say im horribly interested that tell said when be in trance never came out of mr forsyths mind wasnt there didnt know about pearl pin have never known have

if turn out to be true who be talking said sunset faded into dusk of clear may evening two still sat there waiting for telephone to inform whether door a waghorn have said have seemed so often ajar never quite closed be now thrown open light intelligence from world have shone on unconscious mind presently tinkling summons came with eager curiosity below lurked that fear of unknown dim mysterious land into human creature pas across closed frontier went to hear what news awaited trunk call said operator listened soon voice came through mr waghorn said yes have found box in exactly place described contained what have be told must contain will leave house taking servant away to morrow two morning later paper contained news of zeppelin raid during night on certain eastern county detail given be vague meagre name of town village where bomb have be dropped be vouchsafed to public later in day private information came to waghorn forsyth hall near epping have be completely wrecked life luckily be lost for house be empty cat story pus cat be during month of may nine year ago that beginning of event concerned pus cat took place be living at time on green outskirt of country town dining room at back of house opened on to small garden framed in brick wall five foot high breakfasting there one morning saw large black white cat with sharp serious face observing with studied attention now at time there be interregnum house be without mistress in shape of cat at once struck that be being interviewed by big pleasing stranger to see if must do so since there be nothing that prospective mistress like le than premature familiarity on part of householder whom may be thinking of engaging took direct notice of cat continued to eat breakfast carefully tidily after short inspection cat quietly withdrew without once looking back supposed be dismissed that have decided after to keep on present household in proved to be mistaken have only gone away to think about next morning for several morning after be subjected to same embarrassing not unfriendly scrutiny after took stroll round garden to see if there be flower bed must do to make ambush in convenient tree two to climb must emergency arise on fourth day a far a remember committed error half way through breakfast went out into garden to attempt to get on more familiar term cat regarded for few moment with pained surprise went away after have gone in again decided to overlook for returned to former place continued to observe next morning made up mind jumped down from wall trotted across grass entered dining room arranging in great hurry round one hind leg put up in air like flagstaff proceeded to make morning toilet that a knew quite well meant that thought must give satisfaction be therefore permitted to enter upon duty at once so put down saucer of milk for very obligingly disposed of then went sat by door said to show that wished door to be opened for so that might inspect rest of house so called down kitchen stair there be come cat who think mean to stop dont fuss in manner real pus cat though did not know that entered house now here must make short defence for share in thing might by hasty judgment be considered to have stolen who soon became pus cat mamma anyone who have real knowledge of cat will be aware that did nothing of kind pus cat mamma be clearly dissatisfied with last household have without least doubt made up mind to leave take on fresh lot of servant if cat make up mind about anything power on earth except death permanent confinement in room where neither door window be ever opened will stop taking contemplated step if last unknown household killed permanently shut up of course must not engage fresh people short of that be powerless to keep may cajole bully dog into doing what want manner of persuasion will cause cat to deviate one hair breadth from course mean to pursue if have driven away must have gone to house never back to own for though may own dog horse other animal be great mistake to think that own cat cat employ if give satisfaction may go so far a to adopt besides pus cat mamma did not a turned out mean to stay with altogether only wanted quiet lodging for time so new mistress went discreetly downstairs inspected kitchen scullery pantry spent time in scullery so be told felt rather doubtful quite liked new gas stove in kitchen singed tail at a nobody have told that lunch be cooking also found mouse hole below wainscoting appeared to decide for a soon found out liked work trotted upstairs again sat outside drawing room door till somebody opened for happened to be inside with jill young lady of fox terrier breed of course did not know that pus cat mamma be waiting eventually came out saw sitting there jill saw too eagerly ran up to only to talk not to fight for jill like cat pus cat mamma did not know so just in case slapped jill smartly first on one side head then on other be not angry only firm strong wished that from first there must be doubt about position having done that allowed jill to explain jill did with twitching of stumpy tail attitude provocative of gambol before many minute be up pus cat mamma be kind enough to play with then suddenly remembered that have not seen rest of house went upstairs where remained till lunch time be manner in spent first morning gave key to character of pus cat mamma at once settled that name have always be martha have annexed house be true in grabbing belligerent spirit simply because have seen from post on garden wall that wanted somebody to look after manage house must not help knowing how wonderful be in thing connected with mistress duty morning when housemaid step be heard on stair during breakfast have very audible step martha even in middle of fish milk ran to door said till be opened rushed after sitting in bedroom in turn to see that slop be properly emptied bed well truly made in middle of such supervision sometimes came other call upon front door bell must ring martha have to hurry down to see that door be nicely opened then perhaps must catch sight of somebody digging in garden be forced to go out in busiest time of morning to dab at turned up earth in order to be sure that be fresh in particular remember day on dining room be repapered have to climb step ladder to ascertain if be safe sit on top to clean then roll of paper have to be judged by smell paste to be touched with end of pink tongue that made sneeze must be right test for paste allowed to be used day lunched in drawing room be easy to imagine how busy martha be for proceeding be very irregular must not tell how must turn out meal time be always busy have to walk in front of dish a be brought in precede a be taken out to day duty be complicated by necessity of going back constantly to real dining room to see that paper hanger be not idling to make rush more overpowering jill be in garden wanting to play to play with jill be one of marthas duty young hollyhock be being put in certain of for inscrutable reason have to be dug up again with strong backward kick of hind leg have settled that there be one cat be of course occasionally alien head looked over wall cry of stranger sounded whenever happened whatever stress of housework might be martha bounded from house into garden to expel if possible kill intruder once from bedroom window saw terrific affair martha have be sitting a good a gold among hair brush nail scissors showing how to shave when something feline moving in garden caught eye not waiting for door to be opened made one leap of out of window into apple tree whirled down trunk even a lightning strike rip way to ground next moment saw with paw uplifted tearing tuft of fur from next door tabby be like one of amazing chinese grotesque cat half demon wholly warrior shrill cry rent peaceful morning air martha intoxicated with vengeance allowed mishandled tabby to escape then with awesome face bacchanalian eye ate tuft of bloodstained fur rolling on tongue swallowing with obvious difficulty a if performing terrible antique cannibalistic rite from lady who be so shortly to be confined be use trying to keep martha quiet second minute inspection of house be necessary before decided must be birth chamber spent long time in wood shed that morning hoped that be going to be there spent long time in bath room hoped wasnt eventually settled on pantry when have quite made up mind made comfortable next morning three dappled little blind thing be there ate one for reason a far a must judge that be afraid that jill wanted to so a be kitten not jills ate with respect for martha think that here have mistaken vocation must never have gone in for being mother second kitten lay down upon with fatal result then being thoroughly disgusted with maternity went away never be seen more deserted only child have not killed deserted who have tried so hard to give satisfaction in basket there be left still blind still uncertain whether be worth while to live at pus cat pus cat be mother own child from first though with much added wasted time strength in bewailing orphaned condition took amazing quantity of milk administered on feather eye opened a eye must do on seventh day smiled at spat at jill so jill licked nose with anxious care said quite distinctly when be little older will be always ready to do like jill say same sort of thing to everybody except dustman soon after pus cat arose from birth bed staggered across pantry even first expedition on own foot be not made without purpose for in spite of frequent fall went straight up to blind tassel after looking at for long time tested with tiny paw to make sure of thus showing while scarcely out of cradle serious purpose marked throughout dear life motto be do work since remained unmarried in spite of many very eligible offer think that unnatural mother must have impressed upon in few day before deserted that first duty of cat be to look after house that herself didnt think much of maternity pus cat inherited also suppose fixed conviction that ought to have be even if be not only cat in world must allow one of own race within eyeshot of house garden of duty though be always conscientiously performed think rather bored certainly brought to expulsion of cat exquisite sense of enjoyment on appearance of one of own nation must go hastily into ambush with twitching tail jerking shoulder blade teasing torturing with postponement of rapturous stealthy advance across grass if quarry be looking other way furious hurling of through air if frontal attack have to be delivered often wondered that did not betray ambush by rapture sonorousness of purring a supreme moment approached jill be afraid gave lot of worry over duty of expulsion of alien for jill must sooner play with alien than expel plan be to gambol up to intruder with misplaced welcome be true that effect be just same because trespassing cat seeing alert fox terrier rapidly approaching seldom if ever stop to play so that jills method be really quite effective too pus cat have high moral purpose behind wanted not only to expel to appal injure like many moralist of own specie enjoyed fulmination onslaught quite tremendously liked punishing other cat because be right be wrong vigorous kick bite must help perhaps to understand though pus cat resembled mother in matter of high sense of duty moral quality have what martha lacked that indefinable attraction call charm great heart be always pleased affectionate went about duty with a near approach to smile a be possible for gravest specie of animal martha for instance played with jill a part of duty pus cat made pleasure out of played with ecstatic abandon of child indeed have known put dinner quarter of hour later because be in lovely jungle of long grass at end of garden be preparing to give jill awful fright business of jungle deserves mention not because be so remarkable in because be so wonderful to pus cat jungle in question be space of dozen yard where in spring daffodil grew in clump of sunshine fritillary hung speckled bell there be pony also planted in grass briar rose apple tree nothing a have said be remarkable in be fraught with amazing possibility to keen imagination of pus cat at bottom of strip of untamed jungle lawn began be one of pus cat plan to hide at edge of jungle flattening out till looked like shadow of something else if luck served jill sooner later in pursuit of interesting smell must pas close to edge of jungle without seeing moment jill have gone by pus cat must stretch out discreet paw just touch jill on hind quarter jill of course have to turn round to see what inexplicable thing meant on moment pus cat must fling into air descend tiger like on jills back be beginning of game contained more vicissitude than round of golf there be ambush scurryings innumerable assault from apple tree repulsion from behind garden roller period of absolute quiescence suddenly wildly broken by swift flanking movement through sweet pea at end failure of wind limb jill must lie panting on bank pus cat having put off dinner proceed to clean for evening duty have to be smart at dinner time whether be dining alone whether there be dinner party for be never tea gown cat dressed for dinner even if be dining out be not responsible for what be responsible for be to be tidy pus cat without doubt be plain kitten again like many child of own inferior race grew up to be very handsome cat with great chic did not attempt colour be pure black white across broad strong back there be black saddle saddle so to speak have slewed round made black band across left side there be arbitrary patch of black too on left cheek black band on tail black tip to otherwise be pure white except when put out pink tongue below long snowy whisker charm outstanding feature of pus cat be independent of fascinating colouring martha for instance have be content that dish be carried into dining room subsequently carried out more be notion of duty towards dinner pus cat really began where martha ended like preceded soup when who be present have received share always went round with loud purrings to guest to congratulate hope that liked for process be repeated with dish have particular walk stepping high treading on tip of toe congratulatory march be purely altruistic did not want soup be only glad that other people have got then when fish came bird must make congratulatory tour just same then sit firmly down say must like too occasionally favoured particular guest with marked regard sometimes almost forgot duty a mistress of house choosing rather to sit by protge purr loudly so that dish must already be half eaten before went round to see that everyone be pleased with portion finally when coffee be brought went downstairs to kitchen retired for night usually sharing jills basket where lay together in soft slow breathing heap of black white pus cat like ancient greek be never sick sorry never sick because of robust stalwart health never sorry because never did anything to be sorry for from living with jill never seeing cat except for short painful interview preceded expulsion from garden grew to have something of selfless affection of dog when came home after absence must run out into street to meet stiff tailed really not attending to debarkation of luggage intent only on welcoming home eight busy happy year passed thus then one bitter february morning pussy cat disappeared week went on still there came sign of when winter have passed into may gave up hope of return got fresh cat time young blue persian with topaz coloured eye month went by agag so called from delicate walk have established in affection on account of extraordinary beauty rather than from charm of character when second act of tragedy opened be sitting at breakfast one morning with door into garden thrown wide agag be curled up on chair in window for unlike pus cat martha did housework at being of proud aristocratic descent when saw coming slowly across lawn cat scarcely recognized be lean to point of emaciation fur be disordered dirty be pus cat come home again then suddenly saw with little cry of joy ran towards open door then saw agag weak thin a be woke at once to old sense of duty bounded on to chair never before in time have cat got right into house thing felt determined must not occur again round room out into garden raged battle before must separate pus cat inspired by sense of duty agag angry astonished at assault of mere gutter cat in own house at last got hold of pus cat took up in arm while agag cursed swore in justifiable indignation for how must tell that be pus cat never fought again be miserable fortnight followed misery be poor pus cat agag in spite of beauty have heart did not mind how many cat kept so long a did not molest usurp food cushion pus cat though understood that for inscrutable reason have to share house with agag not fight be creature of strong affection poor little soul be torn with agony of jealousy jill be true who be always treated with contemptuous unconsciousness by agag be certainly pleased to see friend again have not forgotten pus cat wanted so much more than jill must give took on old duty at once often when escorted fish into dining room found agag asleep on chair must be literally unable to go through with must sit in corner by looking miserably uncomprehendingly at then perhaps smell of fish must wake up agag must stretch stand for moment with superbly arched back on chair before jumped down with loud purrings rubbed against leg of chair to betoken desire for food even must jump up on to knee be worst of for pus cat must often sit dinner through in remote corner refusing food unable to take eye off object of jealousy while agag be present amount of caress attention offered to must console so that when agag have eaten usually turned out of room then for little while pus cat have respite from promethean vulture must go round again to see that everybody be pleased escort fresh dish in with high stepping walk erect tail hoped foolishly perhaps that in course of time two must become friend else think must have at once tried to find home for agag indeed short of that did must do lavishing attention on dear pus cat trying to make feel indeed be true that loved only liked admired agag while still hoped pus cat have have more than must bear once again disappeared jill missed for little while agag not at rest of miss still there arose king agag though of undoubtedly royal blood be never real king be no more than one of hyksos shepherd king bound by limitation of race partaker in magnificence naturally did not work a late housekeeper have done one expected that of have splendour vivacity possessed let say by henry viii george iv to make up for indolence in affair of state henry viii anyhow busied in marriage whereas agag be merely terrified at idea of wooing not to say winning of princess be brought to notice on part only made rudest face at again george iv though unkingly in many respect used to plunge about in wild pursuit of pleasure be supposed to have kind heart agag on contrary never plunged cushion fish plenty of repose be sum of desire a for kind heart never have heart at unkind heart must have given semblance of personality there be not faintest room to suppose that emotion other than desire for food sleep warmth came within measurable distance of died in sleep probably of apoplexy after large meal beautiful in death a in life be buried forgotten have never known cat so completely devoid of character sometimes wonder whether be real cat at not sort of inflated dormouse in cat clothing there followed republican rgime in matter of cat went back after agag to working cat who must sit at mouse hole for hour together pounce devour clean sleep among there be character ever so faintly resembled even martha far le pus cat suppose royalty of agag stupid dull though be have infected with certain snobbishness a regard cat secretly given that there be to be more of splendid plebeian like pus cat longed for somebody who combined royal descent for sake of beauty pride with character good bad nero heliogabalus queen elizabeth even emperor william ii of germany must have done didnt want george on one side mere mild president of small republic on other just after agags death have moved up to london for time there be succession of unnoticeable head of state be born president of republic from respectable hard working family never gave out though knew quite well that be head of state to be anything else what be good hard working cat with of course not only casting determining vote on question concerned anybody else be democratic in day be afraid freedom broadened slowly down from president to president be loyal law abiding citizen under rule when president be sitting at top of area step taking air after morning work used to be shock to to see tickled on top of head by people like tradesman coming for order policeman nursery maid president in circumstance must arch back make poker of tail purr being at leisure unoccupied with care of state did not pretend to be anything bourgeois bourgeoisie have access to must play with without sense of inequality through area railing
