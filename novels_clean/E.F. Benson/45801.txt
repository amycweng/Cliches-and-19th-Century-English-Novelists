keen of mocker who be many have ally be true in person of alice yardly who in big hat white dress with blue sash looked like doubtful romney be smiling literally with might more mocker mocked kinder grew smile more voluble explanation maud for part must sooner have done battle alone for alice a ally did be with great precision copious direction to reveal to enemy weak point in fortification of seemed to maud there be hundred angle where assault must probably meet with success so seemed there be possible difficulty in scheme of thing entire a understood by christian scientist there be poor dear alice waving large cheerful flag to call attention to be not christian scientist thurso maud be saying because think lot of be too silly oh well never mind what told at lunch actually saw with own eye will say again nurse mile who be optimistic told that sandie be dying though be really use wanted dr symes to be sent for well did send for went upstairs with mr cochrane saw mr cochrane by mean of christian science must suppose pull sandie out of jaw of death be fair maud said thurso tell what dr symes said when came next morning be going to said have known case where temperature went suddenly down from high fever to below normal have not meant perforation meant simply what be sudden cessation of fever of course such thing be very rare must be odd coincidence if alice yardly leaned forward smiled interrupted violently volubly mortal mind have caused fever originally said be mr cochrane demonstrated over thus enabling sandie to throw off false claim of fever temperature for must really have fever since fever be evil be temperature evil too asked thurso why be temperature of degree more evil than normal temperature alice did not even shut mouth held open during thurso explanation so a to go on again moment stopped heat cold really exist said more than fever since a be saying fever be evil infinite love can not send evil to anybody because be good be demonstration of made temperature go down let get well be only with mortal mind too that must think have fever since there be real sensation in matter just a be through mortal mind not through love that thought have caught immortal mind know that there be sensation in matter so no disease a david said 'thou shalt not be afraid for terror by night for arrow that flieth by day when sandie by mr cochrane demonstration over mortal mind perceived that though need not have be conscious that perceived false claim of fever left so of course temperature went down maud gave sigh not of impatience of very conscious patience be very near akin to darling alice said have understood single word from beginning mr cochrane did make sandie temperature go down alice mouth be still open interrupted like lightning of course not said be not mr cochrane be belief trust in immortal mind have reached sandie be not healer who doe be divine love shining through healer disperses false claim god be good be matter be nothing because life god immortal mind maud sat up in long chair clapped hand close to alice face so that absolutely must not go on in spite of omnipotence of immortal mind will finish one sentence just one said whatever say understand single thing be subsidence of high temperature be dangerous symptom mr cochrane came in after sandie temperature have suddenly gone down have nothing to do with bringing down took up to sandie because sandie temperature have gone down be sure be very difficult to understand especially if believe in temperature do draw long breath try to grasp that be immortal good god mind brought sandie temperature below normal be all a must say frightfully false claim be symptom of dangerous illness not symptom of health wish must attend more make feel feverish in explaining like darling alice smile suffered diminution be still quite ready to explain anything a said fever can not be sent by divine love remarked therefore since there be nothing really existent in world except divine love follows that fever can not be real that belief in be function of mortal mind evil pain disease can happen to anybody who have uprooted false claim of mortal mind drug can have effect harmful beneficial on anyone who know truth drug only act on mortal mind be thurso entered arena want to understand alice said supposing choose to drink large quantity of prussic acid for breakfast under conviction that poison exists for immortal mind will live to take pint more of at lunch doe poison exist for mortal body drink deadly thing will not hurt ' quoted alice souffle of nightshade for alice evening said maud cheerfully theodosia have be keeping up general chattering noise to one listened now have chance said 'd better become christian scientist at once silas silas adores just adores english beer have false claim that disagrees with now mr yardly tell that there be such thing a poison so silas just take tight hold of get barrel may be left widow try just swill theodosia began silas be not permitted to get further intoxicant drink be in evil thing said alice just a tobacco be only fed upon by loathsome worm be evil a will find in mr eddy miscellaneous writing have pronounced against thought there be evil except in false belief of mortal mind said maud be just what have be saying said alice profusely only real existence be god who be cause source origin overlies underlies encompasses rudolf villars joined in if mr eddy said that cream cheese be evil must make so asked politely can not have attack of error mortal mind be not just possible a oliver cromwell said that be occasionally must have thought that instance might be found where intoxicant have even saved life in case of exhaustion exposure maud broke in again be very flippant said really doe not matter what mr eddy think about tobacco whether darling alice will not answer question did see stick to man who be past human power pulled back into life by mr cochrane how be done know own explanation be perfectly simple one said be direct healing power of god after if doctor say that there be healing power in certain herb god made why must heal direct throb of motor sound of wheel crunching gravel be heard thurso got up well must settle something else just now said who want to drive over to windsor who want to go on river who want to hing broke up conference a be designed to do for thurso felt literally unable to stand much more be nervous irritable scarcely in own control have slept badly indeed have hardly slept at stream of balderdash spouted from alice be quite intolerable however with undiminished cheerfulness expressed preference for river made impossible for villars not to offer companionship ruby jim have not be seen since lunch theodosia husband went with thurso to windsor mr yardly murmured something about letter rightly interpreted meant slumber hastily betook to house in consequence maud sister in law of whom announced intention of doing nothing of description be before long left in possession of garden there have be certain design about though successfully veiled on catherine part wanted to have talk with maud gentlest prompting have be sufficient to make other people choose other thing rest of party dispersed in various direction be not till motor have hooted at entrance to main road steam launch puffed way past opening in yew hedge catherine spoke again tell more about mr cochrane said maud be already half immersed in book have be quite unconscious of catherine diplomacy started little when question be put to closed book there be really no more to tell said think have told ah there be one more thing must have howled so if have said be told that be demonstrating over whole outbreak of typhoid well stopped quite suddenly case have be coming in hour after hour till ceased like tap being turned off after that there be more death of course sound incredible if ask whether really believe that be through that came to end like must say 'yes know must like to see mr cochrane remarked catherine can if like be coming to town told day month oh catherine be interesting anyhow did cure sandie also cured duncan fraser wife be convinced of then other fact of typhoid ceasing like of course may say be pure coincidence may say that other cure be coincidence too when get set of coincidence together like that wonder if there be not well law lie behind account for paused moment lot of apple other thing fell to ground said newton deduced law of gravity accounted for catherine cigarette threw match away with great vigour what fool darling alice be observed love alice just a do ca help loving oh what fool somehow if person talk such abject nonsense a about anything one concludes that subject be nonsense too doe really follow mr cochrane doe talk nonsense asked be least nonsensical a have told go cure people when be ill instead of gassing about be very good fisherman too catherine must not help laughing maud mentioned in voice of such high approval be that inconsistent said think man whose whole belief be in health life must go kill thing oh yes think be inconsistent said maud so doe did ever see anybody who be inconsistent never did never want to must be so extremely dull must know about at once know about mr cochrane asked must like to know more think never met anyone so arresting be forced to attend whether like not gather like asked catherine yes certainly like vigour certainty oh well that sort of cleanness be like nice boy at cambridge with extraordinary strength behind catherine must not help making mental comment on ah attracts said attracts also like people to be strong efficient oh maud how one heart go out to when be helpless enmeshed in what be stronger than be clear change of subject mr cochrane be put aside for little catherine must not help noticing that maud seemed relieved ah mean thurso said quickly letting book slide to ground yes want to talk to about for believe be wise feel helpless know what to do last night must tell went straight to room after leaving dressing have just taken laudanum not because have headache because longed for maud clasped hand together gave little pitiful sound half sigh half moan ah poor fellow said yes lied to said catherine said have not be taking there be glass smelling of by side then be very angry with for little said have spoiled everything eventually gave bottle let pour away did threw bottle into shrubbery maud eye brightened ah be better said can still fight catherine shook head be not said rest be so dreadful so pathetic must sleep last night must have be about two in morning when got out of bed went to window sat there little saw thurso come along path lit match found bottle then took be bright moonlight must see quite clearly literally sucked to see if there be not drop two left maud have reply to if be despicable be a catherine have said dreadfully pathetic advise dear maud said at length be horribly troubled about sight of turning damned little bottle be not sorry meant upside down in mouth showed how awfully wanted feel one must lose day minute desire grows like aloe flower if wo see doctor what be to be done will send for sir james a soon a get back to town tell about ca force thurso to see besides stopped yes there be nothing in world so hard to cure said be deadlier than cancer still want to free said maud yes so doe prisoner there be pause do think be taking too pessimistic view asked catherine maud must not help seeing bright side of thing sunshine appealed to more strongly than shadow be more real to yes think be said let pour well damned stuff away influenced more strongly than desire yes than satisfied desire said catherine with terrible commonsense have just taken do suppose must have let pour away if be just going to take know be stronger than think maud gave great sigh picking up book remember mr cochrane practically offered to cure neuralgia said knew be perfectly useless to suggest to thurso at time did believe in mr cochrane since then catherine looked up saw in maud face what have suspected oh maud said be in love with maud leaned forward book again dropped face downwards on gravel did not notice have slightest idea said catherine do like awfully like most awfully one have ever attracted like good gracious how indelicate be care one straw must like to put affair poor thurso into hand must do with utmost confidence must then just curl round a one doe in bed feel everything be right be that being in love know care be so strong so windy so sunny be surrounded by sun be a if have just have cold bath stepped into sun love strength wind like want somebody who must go on playing undoubled spade at bridge in middle of earthquake must for shilling hundred be in love with tell know certainly sort of thing have never happened to before again certainly have never be in love so perhaps 'these be one oh do tell when thurso proposed to be like did feel there be anybody else who really mattered oh dear poor mr cochrane to have put upon have shown slightest sign of doing more than admire fishing lot of people have done about thurso did feel be that one there be fine irony about catherine in spite of previous discussion on christian science laid down that have real existence be good felt disposed to believe in malice lurked in chance question evaded direct answer oh there be a many way of love a there be people in world said dear regard with suspicion there be certain symptom oh said maud very well feel with about strength be adorable quality to woman be that so trouble about thurso know throwing away of bottle prof that be fighting be strong enough be weak when allowed to form habit that knew be harmful threw hand wide oh be so awful said one begin by saying ' will do when choose ' so soon say 'you will do when choose ' personally always make rule to give anything up before begin to want very badly there be irony in too remembrance of what chiefly kept awake last night made know that rule be not always quite easy to follow be secret from maud who get want said speaking from outside catherine got up began walking up down small angle of lawn where sat bordering deep flower bed june be in flower there just a in herself to outside view june seemed to be flowering be wonder that maud thought that emotional baggage have consistently thrown away life seemed to to be coming back now in bale returned to by dreadful dead letter office at least have hoped be dead sudden bitterness born of perplexity invaded oh yes everybody always think one be happy said if one have good digestion passable appearance heap of thing to do enjoyment in doing have a much money a one want thing only give one pleasure do think be happy do really think so maud dropped eye when talk deepens be well to talk in dark to talk without distraction of sight think be said if look deep down then be two people said catherine rather fiercely superficial maud who just now said have wanted implying happiness maud who have to be fished for be le personal le intricate maud looked up again smiling quite true said so be two catherine so be everybody who be worth anything used to think ideally happy person because a far a one must see got wanted imagine be what call superficial maud who thought that think deep down 'you be happy maud paused moment feeling that sister in law be hanging on word did not seem to in claim for unhappiness so to speak catherine have made have in mind drug taking be something different to that only lately too have be conscious of deeper maud yet did not in least affect working of more superficial self joy of morning evening depression irritation of east wind rapture of catching sea trout went on on surface just a keenly a ever interior life have awoke used to envy so cathy said at least used to envy lot of thing about when thought that 'you world knew admired so be there be now believe that there be greater ' than that realer ' than ordinary thing perceives since ask think that essential part of be happy more than thurso be happy catherine sat down again thought over before answered must give give up great deal to make thurso happy said with absolute sincerity get on nerve maud looked up waiting for more waiting for completion of sentence have heard not so long ago on thurso lip came bore said catherine there be long silence bee buzzed in flower making bend sway nod to weight grasshopper clicked whirred on lawn swift swooped chided together in sliding company while splash of oar churn of steamer sounded from river then such be habit of world struck how unlike unlike ordinary presentment of be to say be being simultaneously swam out of depth be in reality much more essential abode of return to normal level be short soon went down again since who have met seen other below always go back there be only who have talked insincerely on deep matter who prefer to splash about on surface few surface remark followed yet be almost certainly one own fault if one be bored said catherine to be bored only show that bore be present probably yet maud if tell about bazaar sale speech so on be bored do make up big part of life on surface said since be being frank not on surface since be contradicting other deepest most real part of that know be sorry for poor devil express in way be exactly that get on nerve if get up from lunch because have got to go somewhere be irritated think be restless well so be want to be doing thing not eating stupid cutlet what do want to do what doe want to do eat opium instead maud gave long sigh oh cathy be pity said catherine gave little hopeless gesture oh yes be pity lot of thing be attitude towards other be pity be sorry said that oh do help let be practical remember be at home when be doing thing want to know what to do about hundred thing catherine got up again be a said always practical be always restless afternoon in particular after inconclusive wakefulness of night before longed to map out plan rule of conduct line to take about complication yet since life have be chary of emotion apt to regard a useless if not dangerous stuff to have on board now when be certainly there either through will in opposition to found ready speaker destitute of word to deal with to maud in silent search for expression again paced up down busy bee travelled flower bed then there came crisper note sound of crunched gravel dog cart drew up at front door fifty yard only from where sat there be only one person in young man who dismounted rang bell stood at pony head waiting for to be answered apparently servant be drowsy too a befitted sunday afternoon after pause rang again definite process of reasoning went on through catherine mind somehow heart sank be caller one who must need entertainment there be something dimly familiar in cart in tradesman like young man reminded of medicine of time when child have measles yes be man from chemist next moment knew why heart sank will see who be said to maud servant seem to be asleep went across grass to front door have word with man who gave small package neatly sealed then touched hat mounted turned horse catherine came back to where maud be sitting be directed to thurso said be from chemist in windsor maud maud understood shook head oh ca open other people thing said ca oh catherine what be to do catherine sat down again with bottle shape of be plain in hand then maud spoke again must said open carefully so that if be what think can do up again oh hate all seems mean care will open if must rather not catherine seemed to think unnecessary carefully broke seal there be bottle of dark blue glass inside with red label of poison on be closed with glass stopper withdrew smelled then paper passed to maud maud put stopper back into bottle squeezed up paper string in have be wrapped into tight ball threw deep into flower bed then went to opening in yew hedge flung bottle into mid stream so have have hand in said when returned oh cathy last night only let throw wretched stuff out of window very next day have to go order more poor dear old boy must have ordered when went in with theodosia after lunch must have told wanted quickly be death hell know did stop to think have to throw into river what next be to know anything about not yes must find out in case chemist man must say gave to there be reason why must come into oh give share said maud quickly want to help of course can help be quite willing to take whole responsibility for what have done said catherine want to come from of said maud if be of use catherine considered be said have more weight with than have know there be trace of bitterness in tone be plain unemotional speech struck a one of saddest thing have ever heard said have long known of course that married life of brother catherine be not very happy afternoon tragedy of be becoming by little trivial word infinitely more real material for tragedy be being dreadfully augmented little bottle have just thrown into thames be like one of little incident in first act of play from disaster will certainly be evolved later what hideous scene in last act did great playwright of life mean to make out of then suddenly memory of thing mr cochrane have said to up in scotland sentence from book concerning christian science have lent came back to mind have warned that must find in certain thing must seem to ridiculous have asked to pas over have told that must also find there certain thing be indisputably true remembering one of told now that be thinking wrongly in anticipating evil like if be to be of use in world produce happiness in others must turn away from evil must deny look at affirm great reality of love good to dwell on sin error on consequence be to invite to make guest be guest very willing one be to be made welcome be autocratic have to do bidding time even in detail yes let help said must tell at once what have done let deceive even if must will be furious said catherine ca help that have certainly got to tell besides want to conceal what have done want to think of plan for preventing coming to knowledge be not ashamed of must do again must must throw laudanum bottle in world into thames if must prevent stuff reaching people began to gather again after rudolf villars companion came back from river looking fatigued while alice be fresher than paint husband came out from house with considerable alertness a if letter writing have be unconscious recuperative process few people from neighbouring house came by road river to look in at tea time when thurso with two american returned from windsor there be rather numerous company on lawn went into house before joining others be there minute during time heard bell ring furiously within catherine eye maud met over when came out piece of silent telegraphy went on between maud got up went straight to before joined tea table group catherine must not go with being busy with entertaining between sentence watched be not far distant when met thurso face be towards saw get suddenly white gave one furious gesticulation then turned went back towards house again without joining did not go in walked down shrub set road led to stable maud came back to tea table spoke to friend gradually got close to catherine be going back to windsor to get more said quietly yes sugar thanks must not listen to have never seen so angry catherine just nodded then since private tragedy be being played public comedy have to go on be with surface catherine no more than admirable hostess charmed to see guest eager to interest below courageous though be little a regretted what maud have done though turned out to be futile feared what be coming for hated anger hated also to think just now when for reason of maud knew nothing wanted thurso friendship companionship so much there must open fresh breach between be good thinking of here be villars at elbow here be thurso already on way back to windsor for have heard motor start by back way from stable only last night have let pour foul stuff away have thanked for doing meantime tinkle of drawing room philosophy went on round be relief in way to join in be so perfectly easy yes be necessary for of to have fad for time being be quite most serious thing in world said to lady swindon who have come down river from cookham do serious thing lightly take fad in deadly earnest two year ago do remember never wore hat in country did get a far a wearing none in town though remember did in country felt that golden hour be wasted if have hat on then last year there be simple life retain piece of still lady swindon laughed know do darling catherine be so busy that find time for everything gave up because be so very complicated one have to provide two sort of lunch two sort of dinner day one for simple life people who ate curried lentil most expensive fruit one for people who ate beef swindon always ate to show be bigoted so of course have two month at carlsbad instead of one simple life anyhow be finished with be too difficult do tell what next fad be going to be always be full fad ahead of rest of wish knew thought must be spiritualism at one time believe now that will come off such confusing thing happen went to seance other day most wonderful materialisation occurred recognised figure at once for certain a being grandmother in same breath major twickenham over there recognised a being great aunt who be austrian be more relation of mine than be of shah medium subsequently explained a being spiritual coalition personally felt rather inclined to explain a being medium lady swindon looked thoroughly disappointed oh did hope be going to be spiritualism said do automatic writing evening unless be really tired because be use then be sometimes say most extraordinary thing have ever tried be quite fascinating especially if use stylograph pen seems to go easier swindon have heard most awful rap like postman if be not going to be craze will give up one have time for private hobby one have to ride public hobby time be sure be right think of zigzag never can remember name what about christian science hear be spreading tremendously deep breathing smile on alice yardly face widened deepened a heard sacred word at moment be being talked to must not join in with long lucid explanation though scientific statement of being cause source origin be trembling on lip have tried deep breathing said catherine there really be time ca do anything else while be doing ca talk even because mouth be closed breathe in through one nostril breathe out through other perhaps will be christian science though do know think of be too serious sensible to be fad whereas other half be too silly on side talk to alice read what mark twain say on serious side side be sensible get maud to tell about typhoid up at achnaleesh mr cochrane mr cochrane asked lady swindon with alertness of world unconsciousness of world le important equipment answered oh only 'hers because told about other reason thurso be up there together thurso be here oh yes said catherine tea time be hour tea time be woman hour corresponds to men after dinner talk when have gone upstairs have woman hour then too said lady swindon suppose have got more to say lady thurso laughed oh think that said think only take longer to say tea theodosia theodosia have truly american idea about being introduced be custom genial one to make guest formally known to other by name expected same formality kindly introduce catherine said lady swindon cousin mr morton very happy to make acquaintance lady swindon said theodosia think that catherine place down here be just cunningest spot ever saw why look at yew hedge guess expect mean noah planted before flood anyhow soon after to have made height then catherine have be perfect be not adore thing never saw such wonderful black pearl a have got around neck look a if came straight from marquis of anglesea tie pin think not inherited said lady swindon rather icily well there be said prompt theodosia be what come of being englishwoman of upper class inherit thing have got to buy why afternoon lord thurso husband drove over to windsor never saw spot looked so inherited a that ca buy that look be just inheritance do know husband ah be talking to count villars over there what lovely man be have loveliest time to day never saw windsor before fancy inheriting be afraid lord thurso be sick called at chemist told to send medicine out here right away guess pined for medicine be not here be must wonder if went straight in to take guess be taking now catherine think husband be loveliest man hope be not real sick just pined for medicine tea be longer in demand catherine got up whole situation be beginning to get on nerve theodosia with awful american manner be on nerve dreadful information about call at chemist be there also felt sure that lady swindon for darling catherine be that sort of friend who like knowing weak point of others not necessarily with object of malicious use a useful thing to have in pocket theodosia a be aware when got up now to get out of immediate range of rasping voice be one of weak point mention of thurso medicine anxiety to get be others theodosia touched with unerring instinct of true tactless bungler so catherine with higher courage want not to know worst if theodosia be going to throw more sidelight on subject of medicine moved out of earshot lady swindon justified position of true friend to catherine became markedly more cordial to theodosia wanted to know more about proceeded in spirit of earnest inquiry what charming afternoon must have have said to see windsor for first time be delightful be not to have lord thurso a companion be delightful at time be not ill be seemed just crazy to get to chemist said theodosia seemed just crazy to get back home again tell have speed limit for motor over here if did exceed see that can be of much service now lady swindon be not really more malicious than most people in spite of weakness for friend weakness be in main truly london desire to be always well up in current scandal know detail of may perhaps soon be beginning to be whispered that led to pump if word that implies effort may be used about so easy process theodosia on subject thurso long absence in scotland to begin with have seemed to queer to require explanation did not seem likely somehow that have gone there after woman on other hand personally thought improbable that have really gone to look after fever stricken tenant a matter of fact of course have done so truth usually escape earnest inquirer especially if be quite simple straightforward here be fresh fact have be crazy to get to chemist have raced home felt have guessed used to have dreadful headache observed perhaps have one afternoon did seem way said theodosia know about headache because silas used to have arising from faulty digestion to be martyr took opium for yes said lady swindon always cured why here be count villars count villars have set eye on since lunch feel bad because be neglecting let present to lady swindon villars bowed think be introduced about twelve year ago observed how be lady swindon have come down river from charming cookham lady swindon got up turning back on theodosia for whom have further use yes be just going back there how clever of to remember where live will take to boat let walk round garden first be charming to see again strolled few yard down path between two tall herbaceous border while rapidly ran over in mind what information wanted from be very quickly done be staying here asked how do find catherine be sure walked together last night after dinner joined old memory onto present lady swindon be colossal in impertinence struck villars afresh after long absence from england how very ill bred well bred englishwoman can be be more than match for ah dear lady said found that two needed link of have faculty doubt be often convenient of forgetting old friend a always adore a always receives adoration from infinite height madonna still smile on worshipper asks more be admirably done for told nothing tried again indeed thought have once asked more said supposed so there be limit to what people of brilliant vivid imagination may not suppose said must not help smiling at own defeat refusal to give direct answer be so very silken truth always exceeds one imagination doe not said be usually different from observed must not do tried something else thurso said how do think be villars looked at in bland surprise very well surely be not said why must think otherwise only something heard about calling at chemist racing home afterwards indeed said villars lady swindon be afraid there be more to be got there handed into launch be so glad so very glad think be well said do come spend sunday with week will try to get catherine to come meet murmured gratitude of non committal sort stood little while looking after launch sped like arrow up stream raising two foot wave in wake nearly upset half dozen boat in passage then strolled back to lawn again have not faintest intention of staying with lady swindon on other hand did not at desire to be on bad term with for little a respected have profound respect for supreme mischief making capability have got hold of something about thurso too perhaps be a well have not seen in case own bland assertion that considered very well must not have be of much use lady swindon departure have acted a signal for general move when villars got back lady thurso be just saying good bye to last of guest on moment butler came out of house spoke to lordship begs that lady maud will go to room for moment a soon a be disengaged lady said tell lordship will come immediately ah count villars be going on river be not must wait few minute thurso want to see about something maud joined went together to thurso sitting room at end of house be sitting at table in window with usual courtesy got up a entered on table in front of stood bottle of dark blue glass have just finished unpacking a entered threw corrugated paper in have be wrapped into waste paper basket cigarette catherine said offering one want few minute talk with took one waited till have lit sat down maud tell said that undid package arrived here afternoon addressed to threw away be so believe did not answer seemed unnecessary raised voice little will kindly say whether be so said yes quite right said again raised voice that shook with suppressed rage do make habit of doing such thing of do open letter other people letter oh thurso be fool said maud quietly face went very white maud be trying to be courteous said under good deal of provocation might make effort to follow example be courteous to ask catherine whether be in habit of opening other people letter asked behaviour afternoon seems to to warrant question said thurso doe not said wife think know too looked first at one then at other hand moved a if instinctively towards bottle on table want to make scene with of said want to detain wish to say however think behaved quite outrageously require to promise never again to act in such way be absolutely unjustified in touching interfering with thing in way from motive took up bottle see how little good interference have done in instance said will do a little in other will merely oblige to adopt method a underhand a own there be nothing underhand said catherine be going to tell what have done indeed maud did tell must have said that stealing be underhand said very evilly though perhaps think differently a to telling knew be inevitable that must find out have nothing to do with said maud quickly even if must never have found out otherwise must have told ah said maud looked at in amazement have be told by catherine afternoon that there be two mauds here indeed be thurso whom must scarcely have known for brother manner be quite quiet courteous again now seemed a if be possessed there be world of sneering incredulity in one word believe what say asked be silent smiled little raised eyebrow there be need for to speak must not have shouted meaning nearly so clearly then where be use of giving promise for future if believe what say asked ask for promise however said if give said catherine looked at closely felt that hated at moment will merely have to find other way of getting thing delivered said so that will not st intercept there be silence ask for promise repeated maud threw back head promise said be use refusing said catherine getting up be that thurso thurso put hand to head suddenly with wince of pain must not control yes on point be said let agree to say nothing more about most unpleasant subject want to tell be suffering so hideously at present moment hardly know what be saying agitation anger for two be responsible have brought on about worst attack ever have very likely must not have taken laudanum from bottle threw away in case must have struggled hard not to struggled yesterday with result allowed catherine to pour away have in house be not going to struggle now thank pain be intolerable believe to have be brought on by what did interference have not done slightest good have only given hour of hell then quite suddenly mood changed have said abominable thing to said only excuse be that be in torment beg forgiveness of of here be real thurso again looking out like soul in prison trying to burst through bar there be

have just left catherine have begun to tackle great heap of letter felt have better answer inquiry mainly from personal friend knew have given more to do than be really needful that must what to mind be needful be that must be occupied in writing leave leisure to think at present there be nothing to be gained by thinking must take step outside day be utterly dispiriting there have be dense yellow fog morning though have cleared little about midday so that from window must see lilac bush of garden bordered green park hovered still overhead though hour be still not yet three in afternoon table be in window have to light shaded electric candle stood on to enable to write big fire burned in open hearth compounded of log coal hissed whistled cheerfully a blazed room be warm fragrant so dense

not long ago for occupation in numerous flying visit have to pay to town when intended to stop only day two do necessary business on occasion be not worth while to open whole house so have established here on third floor with just one sitting room bedroom bathroom adjoining until half way through november have be paying series of visit at different country house ever since came down from scotland while thurso so then believed have be doing same at other house week be to have have first big shoot at place in norfolk have be put off ten day ago now have arrived here for couple of day stay before going down to norfolk have found husband be in house have be there ever since came down from scotland alone with valet couple of maidservant one to cook one to clean having excused from various house where have told must be staying in order to live here in hell paradise of opium catherine have at once telegraphed for maud who be of more use than anybody with brother two have be here now for ten day be just better that must be with than that must be alone still occasionally felt ashamed of if be there since last june habit have gained on with appalling rapidity though for few month have a knew made frantic agonising effort to throw off have seen doctor have done apparently lay in power to do now seemed that sort of atrophy of will have set in no longer actively desired to be free man again though sometimes sort of shame remorse seemed to visit though will have be so completely dominated destroyed by drug have left calculating scheming part of brain untouched have thousand device for obtaining after chemist with whom habitually dealt have be warned not to give indeed be ten day now since made what appeared to be very last effort of will when on catherine appearance here have burned prescription enabled to obtain within twenty four hour have forged again lord thurso calling suddenly at big pharmacy with prescription bearing eminent doctor name be naturally not refused blue bottle with red poison label yet busily a catherine occupied with correspondence striving since at moment must hing for husband to engage mind rather than let dwell on hideous reality be going on so vitally concerning be alert for interruption expected for yesterday afternoon thurso undermined weakened a be by habit have have attack of syncope for hour two thought must not live doctor have pulled round out of immediate danger have regained little strength during last twenty four hour sir james sanderson have in fact just come back for afternoon visit be with now have promised to make report to lady thurso before left house news of thurso sudden illness have be in evening paper last night have appeared again morning be answering inquiry of huge circle of friend pen went rapidly from top to bottom of sheet envelope after envelope be directed thrown on pile awful a present moment be yet in sense now that crisis like have come be almost more bearable than hideous growth of anxiety torment have suffered before for a habit gained on moral perception like will seemed to wither vanish have conceived wholly baseless suspicion against wife have uttered to have told in what relation believed to stand towards villars worse even than that did not seem to mind have spied on have opened letter received wrote in word seemed to hate to delight in hate made long absence when be not at club in house gave elaborate palpably false account of movement when returned finally sense of decency seemed to have left have brought to thurso house while wife be in common woman off street how must end dared not think if lived seemed impossible to that must go on living with must happen to child what must happen to maud shame atrocious shame publicity must follow crisis have occurred yesterday afternoon crisis concerned life death have somewhat mitigated horror of thing have also blunted acuteness of question did not concern le since june last have known that villars loved now just a have always loved though since be gentleman to put matter broadly have not traded on growing disgust at man who be husband be impossible for not to know that lover have moved closer have moral house of defence to take refuge in nothing of nature prevented letting man who loved lover whom be sure now loved become in deed what knew that be in else that nothing except blind determination often told be irrational that must not be so stood in way again again thurso have taunted with lie must not taunt more if have be truth indeed to taunt a have done with what be not true be more unbearable to than if have be have villars be lover almost felt a if must have hurled fact in face for action never ran away with be not in habit of doing what be ashamed of afterwards certainly if have taken step so momentous so vitally affecting life a of having lover be sure must not have done so blindly in sudden flash of passion have meant to live double life must have done so deliberately for reason seemed to excellent namely that husband be opium drenched have vilely insulted secondly that loved villars thirdly that did not think wicked for in position to do so yet though in judging others have moral code judged made decision in obedience to stricter law though unformulated than applied to others knew be irrational inconsistent knew must not be otherwise be probably difficult for of high complex moral organisation to appreciate working of nature on analysis seems so rudimentary a hers most rigid sort of moralist may easily say that after there be extremely little difference between people of moral be where higher moralist must go astoundingly astray there be plant so sensitive that seem to have organic life there be amoeba so apparently immobile unsensitive that to creature so immensely distant from in point of organisation a man may seem to be much lower in scale of life than highly sensitive plant to trained biologist amoeba be so transcendently higher than other that despair of finding bridge can ever link up two in same way though catherine must formulate moral code at must unhesitatingly let friend of hers lead life pleased yet not abate one jot of friendship provided only did not do thing be mean fact that when came to in own case utterly refused to contemplate doing made classification of with moral inorganic abysmal error be far stricter with than with others show moral generosity blindly followed more difficult way show faith be perhaps finer since be conscious of leading poor soul knew too well that trial in respect have not really begun have only be told to look at rack where be soon to be placed for rudolf villars be real stand by in dark passage in life maud be splendid too felt must not have got through day without maud be woman be woman villars be man therefore must help in way that maud must not for humankind be created male female of different sex can must help other in manner impossible for of same sex be glory of world shame villars have known about drug habit on sunday have spent with in june for have seen thurso by chance when ecstasy of dose be on since then day by day owed more to till debt be mounting up into huge figure though knew well that to debt be non existent never must add up be to say present bill be fearfully existent to in payment of must only give one thing that must not true have made absolutely direct declaration of love in hundred way showed day by day a saw be getting harder for to be silent what must happen then have made determination must have to declare be oh yes be for time however acuteness of perplexity have lost sharpness since thurso attack yesterday such thought summary of inner life for last two three month did not get between pen paper have to answer letter telegram inquiring about to regret unavoidable absence from various engagement of next few week knew too that have become matter of common knowledge what be matter with have even talked to certain friend about have to word answer carefully be use longer to pretend that nothing be wrong whole world knew that something be wrong interruption for have be waiting soon came sir james sanderson be shown in looked extraordinarily unlike eminent doctor resembled nothing so much a captain on respectable line of steamer have toothbrush of moustache plump bronzed ruddy face wore black frockcoat with yellow boot red tie be awkward cheerful embarrassed nautical played golf whenever possible be not often with boyish enthusiasm remarkable inability incidentally have saved more life restored more health personally considered of greater importance than other two doctor put together shook hand with catherine sat down on small chair broke into fragment beneath extremely ponderous frame leaving couched in splinter on floor said damn quite distinctly struggled to foot oh be so sorry said catherine hope be not hurt not in least chair be said yes have be with husband for last hour found more reliable seat now be brave said then wonderful skill in dealing with people whether sick whole showed there be dreadful news have to tell to beautiful woman in spite of obsoleteness of phrase breaking news news must still be prepared for be wise to start like to say be brave then since knew be dealing with brave woman to wait for bracing up to know be allowed to smoke cigarette said thus securing moment pause though be most unprofessional catherine courage have sunk for moment like mercury in thermometer exposed to zero in pause recalled again be that have be waiting for lord thurso have lived through twenty four hour said immediate danger be really over attack have be enough to kill most people have not killed will not now die of attack may have others see why must unless provokes flicked charred end of cigarette be bright side said now must talk about other came to in july know told about probably did not tell must do that dear lady guess good deal from what have seen to day want to know have lost power of will do think there be nothing may say that can tell will be worse than what conjecture catherine required further stimulus to enable to brace to hideous recital began at once telling sir james whole history of case a far a knew once only did interrupt early in tale when told that original cause of thurso taking opium be frightful attack of neuralgia to be subject to sir james said quite so gave authorisation then month by month went through tragic history spoke of week up in scotland when began to take more frequently when too maud began to suspect that be taking not only for relief of pain for effect of on nerve brain then came stealthy dose in train then scene at bray a spoke though attended very carefully to said watched not for reason alone be not so unlikely saw that might have patient on hand for be a much a must do to get through with what be saying then tale became harder of telling from day have seemed to have begun to hate with hate there grew flourished in mind ignoble suspicion have taken to spying on to opening letter then came infamous taunt have levelled at final insult when have finished there be silence have spoken quite calmly arranging reviewing event of hideous month in orderly manner stopping only when must not quite command voice without long pause after have done sir james went on with what have to be told opium habit said even when one begin to treat quite early be most difficult thing in world to cure give ten drunkard who want to get over habit will very likely cure eight give ten opium eater laudanum drinker for two of course be exactly same who be equally desirous to amend may cure one of god know why be so lady thurso particular drug poppy of field bind body soul in way that other habit bind not alcohol sensualism anything husband case have not be taken early be completely undermined by be impossible to imagine more serious case catherine shifted chair little be so overwhelmingly tired now that have ceased writing that be something of effort to meet doctor eye now need bravery again said might have died minute during first six hour after attack dear lady might have be better if have might have saved god know what suffering misery to others sometimes think that doctor do cruel kindness in snatching poor folk out of death jaw of course one can not say that case be incurable because thank god miracle still happen can not see how can be cured a get stronger from attack craving for drug will get stronger also have already asked for unless absolutely shut up will find mean of getting hold of will probably begin with smaller dos for poison will have more effect when be still weak will increase increase until something like happens again digestion too be in most feeble condition suppose have eaten pound of nourishing food in last week no have hardly touched said say get in way if must succeed in keeping away from drug by by mean must there not be hope kind old doctor gave long sigh hated part of business braver people be more cruel seemed to no said think must probably go off head without ca tell must fear that see be not time for to keep anything from be bearing splendidly be bearing in way be meant to bear terror of life may get white with pain a did just now may feel sick with anguish of ought still to be able to clench teeth not cry out do know be sound policy being brave carry dividend quicker than investment know for effort of sort that make strengthens exactly a gymnastics strengthen muscle something in arrested attention very strongly for moment be led away from thought of thurso to matter concerned quite a vitally turned round to again do mean that if if resist anything power of resistance be increased asked resistance seems to tire to make le able to make effort sir james took in also eye trained to observe obscurity saw that for moment be not thinking of husband temporarily tire said just a exercise doe be really stronger for opposite hold too a poor lord thurso know very well not to resist to yield weakens power of resistance body be built up made strong by effort so be sure be soul thought over that for space of silence noting down in mind how concerned that of doctor knew nothing tell fear about thurso said want to know what think end will be when since gather that a far a know regard a incurable want to hear from quietly fully what must bring to expect thought have got to get used to have told worst said think understand more in detail will be will be very weak for few day will of course be in bed fully expect that recovery from attack will be rapid because will be properly fed not allowed to make smallest exertion chiefly because opium be direct cause of will be cut off a get stronger craving will get stronger then advise advise nothing till see how pull round what most fear be that whole will power very capability to form resolution have be atrophied made ineffective by drug be telling worst fear of course because be not time to buoy up with false hope be fear from what tell incapable of resistance be real fatal danger now be there motive thought aim desire be can make use of on so to speak can prop up train will power be lying like creeper have be torn from support devotion to for example love for child catherine turned on perfectly hopeless look shook head water of marah be in gesture doctor spoke again gently tenderly then who have most influence over asked oh maud said sister know have doubt whatever about think added quietly think hate spoke quite quietly a if stating most commonplace of fact very simplicity of word be intensely pathetic to kind man be best passed over without comment then may consult with before go said a to anything can suggest can appeal to support be drowning must drown a far a purely medical skill can help want do not to throw sort of life buoy to may keep afloat hypnotism that sort of thing asked think possible that hypnotism suggestion can help said there must be something to hypnotise something to suggest to that something be will power one can not say be wholly destroyed because suppose must mean death be in so feeble impotent state know of nothing can touch though catherine have taken very quietly quietude be partly that of someone who be stunned now mind recurred a recovered to one of sentence so to speak have dealt blow mean that only miracle can restore said yes believe in miracle said though unfortunately can not produce miracle a can produce bottle of medicine catherine got up how strange that must say that said because maud belief in a do think most accessible only no longer call miracle call christian science sir james must not have looked cynical sneering if have tried certainly did not try there be uncommon dryness in tone lady in boston inquired man in caithness said catherine will ring will come tell if be in put up hand to stop ah one moment please said want to have two word with about dear lady be not well be very much overwrought have have know terrible trying time if have finished with must tell to go to bed for week ca do now have told on more than guess give more task than need for instance be not over taxing unnecessarily here pointed to crowded writing table pile of answered letter have be working at when came in mean have better sit down think over terrible tragedy said voice beginning to break little rather than find relief rest in employment actually say that must not answer letter especially if find more bearable to work than to hing strongly advise to rest a much a can to avoid anything agitating beyond must bear there be plenty that a husband wife have got to bear if there be other thing worry entreat to shut door in face exercise will power over make strong by resistance save from anything harassing troubling speak of course quite at random feel sure that there be other thing be trying most acutely then without warning breaking point came for month of ceaseless anxiety about thurso have be greater drain on nerve force than have known of set purpose have not abated one jot of numerous activity of life have not allowed to consider how tired drained be simultaneously with have come storm tempest into secret life of soul gave sudden shriek of laughter did not sound like mirth oh conjurer cried doctor be like x ray see right into one inside good heaven must think have enough to try guess half if be only thurso must be quite holiday oh how very funny sir james got up quickly placed directly in front of clapped hand violently close to face now none of that cried have come here to listen to hysterical raving make effort pull together be ashamed of catherine checked suddenly in middle of sentence two three tear precursor of hysterical storm have be on point of bursting forth have found way onto cheek wiped off attack be arrested a suddenly a have begun stood silent moment still hearing reverberation of clapped hand yes quite right said thank very much sir james waited till felt certain of then took up one of hand kissed dear brave woman said that show truth of what said be kind to fine nerve sens treat well be quite quiet again now sat down in chair from have jumped up never mind said can manage own affair promise will be a sensible a find possible oh yes there be other worry be perfectly right paused moment now about man in caithness said be there suppose when lord thurso lady maud be up during typhoid now be not bigoted on subject know quite well that christian scientist have got hold of big truth many of mix such flood of nonsense up with that be quite dissolved tell that if have compound fracture only say to yourself compound fracture exist bone will join that of course be silly where deal with will nerve imagination be different sort of thing altogether lady thurso got up again quietly time will see if maud be in said there be very virulent typhoid up there know in summer mr cochrane be believed by to have cured one two extremely grave case in fact belief more than that rang bell in interval before be answered only couple of word passed will spare said sir james maud have come in hour ago hearing that sister in law be with doctor have not interrupted a entered now catherine shook hand with sir james maud be sir james sanderson said want to talk to good bye sir james will see of course to morrow morning left room maud be alone with doctor have idea what wanted to talk to about waited wondering why catherine have left instantly approached subject lady maud said want to hear about caithness typhoid mr cochrane maud be taking off glove stopped in sheer surprise there be nothing that expected le than what for said for brother said asked few question in story for be plain simple narrative described just what have passed in connection with duncan wife described that have seen with regard to sandie mackenzie mentioned curious complete cessation of epidemic think believe exactly what mr cochrane told said indeed seems simplest explanation to suppose that be direct power of god in whose presence sickness disease pain can exist say think so only said be not sure not quite mr cochrane be smiled must say be only thing be absolutely sure of said thought in silence over for time then spoke a if have suddenly made mind up medical science a far a be acquainted with said can hing for lord thurso at least fear not therefore if there be man outside in park there with barrel organ monkey who said must cure opium habit must welcome in personally believe in christian science for case of compound fracture doe matter what believe be duty to try everything can now must let have consultation with about again paused wanted to put thought clearly not only to to be situated like said have notion how to cure brother feel able to do be to palliate suffering moment assuming be feel justified in doing that get over attack begin to make day painless aggravate disease lady maud know believe that there be chance for since can not professionally suggest other chance can say be what can god be with ' now a regard practical detail what be to do where be mr cochrane suppose there be plenty of healer be there not if be not handy can get maud strove for moment to separate strand of two desire seemed inextricably intermingled one be to see thurso delivered from drug possession other to put in hand of mr cochrane only have knowledge of only one christian scientist whom really believe in said be mr cochrane see saw with own eye restore to life man who be dying know there be plenty of others must ask mr yardly sir james laughed suddenly why asked maud came to few month ago for tonic said have be suffering from general catarrh explained to why be not inconsistent failed to follow maud laughed too oh alice said to herself mr cochrane think be not like said sir james ca imagine more totally different personality said give confidence anyhow be not silly think there be great deal of what be silly about whole thing believe that direct power of god can come heal people be about biggest thing possible be sir james nodded quietly yes dear young lady said believe in possibility too be why be consulting oh compound fracture said suddenly what ridiculous nonsense be silent for moment after irrepressible burst of professional indignation mr cochrane asked where be in america said maud heard from two day ago be in new york have read of literature said sir james have heard about of cure now a doctor ca recommend employing mr cochrane can if choose send telegram acquainting with state of affair see think can hurt brother doctor ca benefit be to get mr cochrane to come here then asked maud in first place be good deal to ask in second if only lady thurso must persuade lord thurso to go be convinced that sea voyage though will not in smallest degree cure will be generally beneficial now do think be in power to persuade to go need say anything about christian science healer waiting for at other end there will be plenty of time for when get on board ship maud thought over there be suggestion that felt have better make be rather difficult for to put to yes think might be able to persuade said because certainly used often to listen to when must listen to one else must think odd if suggested that went alone without lady thurso must have suggested if have not said doctor tell why did ah poor thurso be mad said be not in least ever since summer have be behaving to catherine a if hated doctor nodded know feel that too now can not see brother to day to morrow if go on well think might will see will be back early to morrow to look at for man who have passed through so dangerous attack weakened too a be by month of opium habit thurso showed extraordinary recuperative power next day asked of own accord whether maud might come see sir james at once allowed will let know when go said will do good waited for moment thurso said nothing about wishing to see catherine shortly after doctor left told maud might pay short visit nurse be with when maud entered went to room next door leaving brother sister alone be still lying flat without pillow smiled welcome at maud when came in come close maud said in minute want to talk to voice be still no more than whisper from weakness word be quite audible want to see catherine said must keep away from think sight of must send off head be who have brought to be who ruined nerve by always rushing flying about in direction maud interrupted gently ah never mind that said at present have to do be to lie quiet not worry about anything get well thurso broke in again oh imagine know how atrociously have behaved to said drove mad despised saw well gave something to despise for oh dear thurso talk like said if want to see catherine of course will not saying that reminds of plan might think of when get better what be have already spoken to sir james about approves will have to go somewhere to pick up again so how about going on voyage together like sea so why not go to america on one of big liner be so comfortable must stay at house of catherine on long island for week two if liked without catherine mean asked loathes sea remember must expect to come eye brightened yes must like that said have have jolly time together by ourselves wo go if go voice have risen sharply over be silent afterwards breathing rather quickly then looked at maud a sat beside bed something in youth beauty stirred chord of vibrating memory in mind for deadly weakness of body be quite clear went back to early day when have be together so much bound in intimacy affection that seldom exists between brother sister have always be such good friend to capital quick sympathising comrade now felt there must for ever stand between horror of last month for moment got outside judged saw how hideous have be have made pretty good mess of said laid hand on be time to preach must only console yes dear thurso said have made mistake thank god be never too late then that moment of regret that nearly amounted to contrition passed from have be brief a sudden ray of sun piercing through unconjectured rent in blinding storm cloud be catherine fault said ray have be there soul though sick to death still lived be only piece of consolation that maud must carry away with chapter iii thurso recovery though have have relapse of kind hint of second attack have be slow be more than three week from time of collapse when maud be sitting together on deck of celtic westward bound watching shore of ireland fade into blurred outline of grey a be fused with horizon have embarked day before at liverpool though have be at sea only twenty four hour there be already semblance of colour beginning to come back to face if maud have met now after year absence felt that must scarcely have known who be month of indulgence in drug have altered whole character of face be not of same man have made look strangely wan old too heavy dint of crow foot be planted on outer corner of eye lid be slack baggy pendulous eye have changed looked stale dead be mouth perhaps have deteriorated most power force be gone from drooped feebly weakly at corner lower lip hung flabby loose be mouth of man ruined by indulgence hair too have become very thin streak of grey have appeared in be shadow of real wreck within sometimes when during last three week have seen thus have felt courage hope for future dwindle almost to vanishing point be not only body have so aged fallen away be soul have grown decrepit have fit of black despair depression when must bear to see nobody not even must lock up in room giving order that meal be to be left outside under circumstance be to be disturbed then when emerged from one of remorse more than maudlin querulous remorse for wreck have made overtook must ask to sit with while unloaded of ton of washy despair dozen time have said that must not go to america at what must week two of sea air do for man in case yet there be decision determination in refusal next moment must be talking of book must take with then pendulum must swing further that about alone seemed to have retained force must come into mind namely bitterness against catherine belief almost strong enough to be called conviction that be who be morally responsible for wreck be that indeed be real cause of having consented to leave england day before sailed have fit of darkest despair have altogether refused to think of going a drew off own desire be to get away from wife to leave neighbourhood to be geographically widely separated from be in england therefore place be more tolerable to just before left house have asked to see for first time in week to say be responsible for be black enough there have be at present one smoky ray of comfort have not taken laudanum again a far a must be ascertained have tried to procure sir james cautioned maud against thinking that ray be promise of coming dawn be still extremely weak have said will not be till strength really begin to come back that will crave for drug at present be not strong enough to want anything at keenly sir james have come down with brother sister to liverpool to see safe bestowal on board for even now be not allowed to walk upstairs cabin be on top deck in ten minute shore going passenger must have to leave ship doctor have still few word more to say thurso have not yet be told what ulterior object of going to america be for be thought that if knew that might refuse to stir there be psychological moment for telling that said to maud have not yet arrived will arrive think feel doubt that will recognise when doe at present brother show desire for anything for drug at least have taken in if have for return to health doe not even think want to die doe not want anything a begin to get back strength will begin to desire also will want drug will want to get well be moment for telling three day later maud be seated again in sheltered nook behind smoking room on top deck where have sat two day before watching fading of irish shore there be bright winter sun overhead tumbling sea around for yesterday there have be gale from west have stirred hoary giant of atlantic enormous ship be little conscious of glided without inconvenient movement across wonderful grey sea broke into dazzling white against burrowing bow something of pale crystalline blue above be reflected in great joyous hill valley of water rose fell round greyness of wintry water be shot with delicate azure aqueous green a if though be yet barely mid winter there be promise of spring in air hint of summer day when hill valley must be level shining desert of astounding blue above head wind thrummed whistled in rigging clean unbreathed odour of sea be salt bracing in spite of sun however be chilly to unprotected thurso lying on long deck chair maud seated beside wore thick fur coat be tucked in with rug have sat little time in silence for speech easily tired still then turned to feel better said be so long since felt better oh yes dear be much better said have be picking up day on sea be good plan there be difference between being better feeling better said second mean most to man who be ill now suppose will have to talk thing out time so why not now do feel better feel a if must nearly wish to be well again maud felt that moment of sir james have spoken to when must be right to tell thurso of real object of voyage be very near not quite arrived yet must give better opportunity for what have to say than wanted very best possible daresay be beginning to wish too late said how bad have be exactly how bad be do mean heart attack asked other thing may tell that for week before attack felt perfectly incapable of resistance must no more resist than must resist breathing now what doe mean medically what chance have be a bad a must be said in way sir james told that heart attack saved life prevented wanting stuff for awhile made break doe sir james really think that week two at sea will cure think that will do general condition good thurso threw back head drew in long breath of cold pure air be extraordinarily invigorating at same moment suddenly felt mouth water at thought have come into mind be beginning to want again have idea that will cure asked with certain suspicious persistence then maud knew time have come no never thought must cure doe profess to be able to cure thurso there be chance perhaps sanctioned trying what chance american doctor will go to anybody doctor quack hypnotist what please be quack want to go to want to see if christian science healer can not do anything for thurso be silent moment have be plot then asked in dreadful cold tone in spoke of wife yes dear speak like said maud speak a if be plot against instead of plot for did tell in england because be afraid might refuse to come be frank be not have be responsible for suspicion hate be awaking in thurso brain felt so much better stronger to day brain be working again after week of torpidity told be becoming wonderfully acute far sighted think quite believe that said believe catherine have hand in surely be clear wanted to be left alone with villars maud made gesture of despair oh be mad said be who speak when say dreadful false thing like be demon posse thurso that horrible drug have poisoned body have poisoned soul then with bewildering rapidity that knew dreaded mood changed again change though be still in darkness of abysmal despair be for better anything be better than vile hate incredible suspicion yes be poisoned be altogether poisoned said quietly maud turned imploring face to dear be not altogether poisoned said fact of saying that be show there be little sound piece left if be altogether poisoned must know there must be nothing left to tell that be poisoned there be feel regret still saw in eye just now though cut to heart love rejoice to see there be just regret desire to do better be precious soil out of salvation must spring voice died on last word spoke in whisper barely audible oh thurso if only knew how cared said for moment be touched looked at with pity poor maud said ah be not going to be 'poor maud said be going to get poison out of soul body oh thurso there be going to be many happy day yet once again genial thrill of convalescence that inflowing tide of strength recovery broke like ripple little further up long dry beach once again desire stirred within by effort detached from turned mind to to own rescue do really believe can be cured said be appalling young person to come sit by sing doggerel hymn read something of sort in book found at home other day be yours suppose alice alice expect said will have appalling young person sitting by know healer want to go to like thurso frowned seemed to be able to remember nothing memory felt be there that contained be locked up must not find key that fellow in scotland asked then for moment got glimpse flash vivid brief connected with met in village street one day said in achnaleesh made feel better have awful headache at time say be something gained know because never have headache now what be name by way mr cochrane said girl of course yes dined one night played hokey pokey among typhoid patient so be going to sing hymn be maud did not smile now thurso be in way that have not be for week there might only be minute two of for mood changed so quickly be a if be not strong enough to remain steady in one attitude for more than few second since moment might see back again in hell of despair hate wanted to make most of first forward outlook have shown creeper will be in hand for second must make beginning at training up ah thurso be right said look forward make effort to realise where stand to day sir james say be helpless say have will left can touch strengthen may be so medically be sure be there still be going to get god not mortal physician to lay hand on try to believe if only for moment that power be that be love health life that evil illness everything of kind can not exist in presence hang back reserve part of yourself for can help hinder cure have be hindering so believe by trusting to power of man to cure because have kept on wondering if man can cure about god there be doubt whatever be quite beyond question for one moment a spoke sat straight up in chair looking suddenly awake revivified with revivification there came far more strongly than before revivification of desire of kind day certain power vitality born of huge sea golden sun singing breeze have be throbbing back into a must always happen until will be set centred on higher immortal mind doe not a through sieve strain off be of mortal corruptible thought returning tide of vitality made more real more coveted that on mind degraded desire have dwelt month time took more definite shape how clever have be too about almost giggled aloud to think of little did suppose that couple of day before left england have got one of footman not valet who have probably be warned to go out with prescription have forged just before attack get bottle of drug have not wanted felt time might come when must there lay bottle of dark blue glass with red poison label in private despatch box in cabin of alone have key have determined that must be last supply having got again threw away prescription how wise too to have brought that one bottle for to day be beginning to want again though wanted also to get well to break infernal chain be wound so closely about yet that have be only real desire of life for month pounced tiger like to day on little morsel of added strength have be thrown within reach higher side of feebler paralysed have chance to reach morsel before other seized cunning began to return too there be something to scheme plan about again already thought over coming hour of day usual occupation so a to devise when must be able with safety from detection to satisfy growing desire even a turned mind to desire swelled nightmare like must be soon must almost be now just taste be wanted quarter dose to satisfy that opium still existed that there be something worth living for worth getting better for warm thrill vibration spreading from head down through neck invading limb with quivering serene harmony must tantalise let get thirstier for before indulging in wanted dreadfully be capable of keener want than more wanted more ecstatic be quenching of infernal thirst even want of be pleasurable when knew that must satisfy want when chose felt sure too that in moderation must do harm one have to break with habit of kind by degree then remembered when have last said that to day on catherine maud have thrown bottle away down at bray have be unwise thing to do have defied have resented that very likely must not have taken drug at day have not unwarrantably tried to put out of power to do so must drive people others have to be led seemed such logical reasonable stuff to poor brain now have be without for three week have not even desired be immense gain showed sensible man that have made great step towards breaking of habit extinction of desire wanted now that instinctive swallowing movement of throat tongue have begun be signal always waited for must still be cunning must make reasonable pretext for going to cabin prevent possibility of suspicion conveying to maud however be not difficult be a easy a lying just a easy in fact there be difference at between be a well to do thing handsomely looked at at big violet eye just moist with tear at mouth just trembling little with emotion have inspired word spoke without hesitation bungling yes believe that said be going to god direct a say be not christian scientist do believe in omnipotent power of god that nothing evil can exist in presence be quite right too must probably have refused to leave england if have known why be being brought here thank dear for bringing paused moment wondering a bystander who knew heart might wonder at profanity wickedness of what be saying since time attached meaning to solemn thing wanted only to kill possible suspicion in mind might lead to being interrupted when went to cabin to get at despatch box really be terrible deplorable that must have to be so deep hypocrite nothing mattered compared to accomplishment of craving have said dreadful thing quarter of dose such a have planned to take must not be enough to banish from mind be good taking opium at if anything scratched whined at closed door of conscience half dose surely must not hurt liberal half of very liberal dos have prescribed for have better say few word more yet incomplete lying be tactical error of must not be guilty sir james be very clever doctor doubt said certainly made mistake when thought will power to resist be dead something to effect be glad said that be glad told because sort of opinion act a tonic irritant will call will show if will power be dead then extraordinarily ingenious perversion occurred to did sir james really suppose must consent to go to sea for week without opium if did not mean to be cured in spite of asked thurso almost laughed over irony of be getting supernaturally cunning yet detected possible error in last word have protested little too much be easily rectified quite mean 'in spite of ' said because make appear a if thought that having given up did not wish to get well goodness how prescription of sea air be acting already be flabby log if imagine thing when started now be not totally different yet be impatient to get to america to begin treatment recovery if be to recover be in other hand best only one with power of will be in elect to leave there if be not to be want to know that though be too late be willing again wondered at wickedness without regretting hugged to feeling that mere prospect of opium have so quickened intelligence power of planning nothing else be of importance compared to one necessity that must get to cabin without further delay leave maud unsuspicious giving thanks in fool heart only wanted to dream dream see vision wanted to see sky a have seen one evening up at achnaleesh covered with blue acanthus leaf with dewdrop of star upon big sun golden centre of blue flower did maud word shake desire solemn though be just went by like light summer breeze wandering by square built house oh thank god thank god dear thurso said will get well know if feel like now let dismiss altogether lie in past be not who have done thing be evil possession be driven out now word assure of bell for time of refreshment be very frequent on ship maud be thoroughly pleased with frequency for have when at sea huge sense of bodily health that requires much to eat many hour for sleep desire for sleep be shared by thurso when just a finished speaking bell for tea tinkled up down deck went down to saloon to cabin with expressed intention of reposing till dinner not pledging to appear even then unless felt inclined desire for sleep sir james have said be one that must gratify to full when parted in vestibule led in one direction to cabin downstairs to saloon in be possible good night maud wished valet must bring dinner to cabin if decided not to move again that evening till afternoon when at length thurso have shown that will be not dead yet that face be still set forward upwards that something of spring of power to resist be in yet maud have not known how near despair have be how forlorn did in inmost self feel that hope be for be bringing over sea slender dim a have be have just still clung to now that thurso responded to too acknowledged validity suddenly became firm strong be willing eager who have felt eagerness for only one thing for so many month to put into hand of infinite omnipotent love must work for miracle utmost skill of finite mortal treatment despaired of accomplishing in great upspringing of hope courage have come to afternoon at thurso word confined wall of dining saloon must not hold long instinct urged to be up on deck again with huge sea huge sky to be only companion so a to let soul go forth without distraction of near object proximity of other human being seemed to impede clog immortal sense into limitless presence of divine love autumn have be realising slowly haltingly for when evil ruin be so close about be hard not to believe in reality of that only one power that of god have true existence that else be false now that realisation be being poured into like flood dawn be growing dazzlingly bright for already miracle have begun hope will power have begun to spring from what doctor have declared be soil utterly barren incapable of bearing fruit top deck be quite empty when came up again sun have already set in darkening sky star have begun to blossom like flower of gold walked forward to bow of ship in order to be quite alone very rush of air round a great ship hissed forward into west where light still lingered seemed to typical of what be happening spiritually to round lay tossed darkness evanescent foam of unquiet sea just a mighty ship went smoothly evenly through so through wave fretful tumult of human trouble soul went tranquilly towards brightness in west have doubted before often often have vainly striven to realise what inmost soul believed have tossed be buffeted instead of going on tranquilly without fear though have believed unbelief still wailed now wailing be hushed yes be so can not be otherwise said to herself there can be nothing real infinite stayed there long between sea star at end walked back along deck be beginning to shimmer with dew unconscious of else in wonder glory of truth rained like filtering starlight round thurso expected be asleep paused outside cabin window for moment a if linking into golden chain of thought so few foot away be indeed lying on berth not asleep very vividly awake in full blaze of hell paradise looked no longer on bare white wall of cabin for though be dark heaven of blue acanthus leaf covered star shone like dewdrop there sun be golden heart of marvellous blue flower quarter dose half dose have sufficed to enable brain to paint there that celestial imagery be there now blazing in unearthly glory one thing only troubled that not very much for be only like very distant echo authentic voice wished vaguely that have not be necessary to say so much to maud in order to purchase security must not remember exactly what word have be have have sort of gravity seriousness about be necessary however might not have thoroughly trusted otherwise memory of just detracted from bliss of vision came between like little film of grey a rule slept very well especially after have taken drug to night when soon after have eaten dinner valet brought undressed went to bed felt very wide awake not staringly so thoroughly so be now about eleven since effect of opium usually wore off after five six hour leaving a vividness of sensation began to fade very drowsy languid must not account for inability to sleep then disquiet began to take more definite form felt a if maud be in cabin looking at with bright face of joy have turned on at end of interview on deck gradually conviction became so vivid that spoke to calling by name there be answer fumbled for electric switch turned on light in order to convince that be not there put light out lay down again sooner have closed eye tried to compose to sleep than same certainty of presence definite conclusive a actual ocular vision again visited be close to a if actual word have be spoken by in bodily presence knew what filled brain what wanted be about be saying to again again be not only feeling better stronger be better god be making better be in presence now evil drug suspicion hate can exist there together with came revivified memory of own word to word be utterly false have spoken to make own private proceeding secure now remembered what have said have used strongest most solemn phrase that must think of in order that might go to cabin without fear of interruption do what have done great travelling hotel of ship have grown quite quiet during last hour two when went to bed there have be sound of music still going on in saloon to that there have succeeded voice step of going to cabin now there be sound except external hiss gurgle of divided water little chucklings tapping at sea be never silent in darkness quiet be more than ever conscious of maud presence of what be going on in brain began to wonder whether be not drug born hallucination whatever be vividness still grew so also did memory of what have said to till must all hear saying blasphemous thing again often often have said dreadful intolerable thing to catherine never so far a knew have be quite so mean liar a have be afternoon to maud have lied sacredly to day in order to secure uninterruption for enjoyment of have renounced now in darkness quietude word came back to time maud be here whole soul be filled with thankfulness to hear speak despicable falsehood lying here became intolerable be growing more acutely awake moment moment grew more aware of reality of maud presence be warning did occult sense whisper to that be in imminent danger of kind that a at hour of death soul sought so vehemently that produced confirmed belief in actual presence next moment have jumped out of bed put on few hasty clothes in order to go to cabin see that be right yet at door hesitated feeling must not face must betray eye must betray so that must not meet hers mouth must betray so that must give stuttered answer must guess what have be doing anxiety for overmastered went tapped at door answered at once went in though be so late be still fully dressed seated on chair by berth face radiant with happiness not in bed yet said be too happy to go to bed then a looked at paused what be matter thurso said what have come to for must not meet eye just a have feared looked away must sleep said kept thinking be in room came to see if be all right gave long sigh shook head oh thurso have be taking laudanum again said anyhow anyhow came to tell did not looked back fiercely at knowing that be going to stammer furious at have said wh what do mean then voice failed lip stuttered trying to say something sound came seemed not to have heard denial wonder thought be in cabin said soul be there oh thurso despair there be good fellow then something seemed to break within must not go on telling lie to perhaps be because be tired must not summon up energy to protest perhaps be that for very shame must not be simpler too to tell truth cared so little be hopeless said be tired of trying failing a soon a strength came back to little to day craving came back brought bottle of stuff with oh yes told have lied lied gorgeously never suspected time be talking afternoon wanted only one thing to get away to cabin did care what said to in order to secure now suppose will want to give up rest of stuff well ca want anything in world except be use thinking can ever get better have given up hope have better do same for one moment maud felt that spoke truth that be beyond power of recall next whole soul strength be up in arm fighting denying that thought passionately reversing there be nothing in world must be compared with reality of infinite love have known that so well to day already be letting error obscure vehemently vigorously fought that error then suddenly wondered what have be fighting for there be nothing there blow be rained upon emptiness be a if have dreamed be fighting spoke to thurso a might have spoken to child who be afraid of dark while in hand carried great light silly boy said what can mean by such nonsense how can give up how be possible for to give up one whom love ca give up love be frightened know there be nothing in world to frighten said afternoon thing made unutterably happy now come tell be lie that did mean be sorry did mean be lie be perfectly true that sombre smouldering of despair in eye faded do mean can possibly ever trust again asked then added quickly ca give bottle ca maud almost laughed well if ca ca said now be going to see back to cabin be going to bed have have dreadful evening dear over nightmare error be so sorry if feel be in room with again must be frightened think there be anything wrong ca help being with said nothing to went down creaking white passage to cabin in silence have have dinner asked wo be hungry before morning be only little after one know must get something nothing thanks said stood irresolute in middle of cabin maud watched with shining eye knowing telling that knew that desire be going to be given then took bunch of key from pocket detached one flung on ground be key said will find bottle in despatch box may take if like maud made movement to pick up key dear thurso said where be manner that really be not proper way to give key wo give in other way said longed so to pick up that must scarcely restrain from doing longed also that strengthened by first effort must make give key voluntarily what if picked up refused to give must not happen then be afraid must stop where be said good night turned with frown to oh maud fool said why take while can just manage to allow to because must give like pretty gentleman of course said ah how pleasant human be dealing of love half hour ago tragedy sordid bitter heart breaking have be hers now not only be comedy here sheer farce mirthful ridiculous productive of childish laughter thurso laughed too a bent down picked up key be obstinate woman said know thank darling thurso how much better be than time threw bottle away without knowing now give unlocked despatch box thurso what big bottle said half empty how greedy sight of kindled desire again flamed up ah give back cried ca let have told must maud did not feel bound to demonstrate over simply ran out of cabin with bottle made not dozen step of across deck before ten second be over large half empty bottle of laudanum be sinking forlornly into abysmal depth of atlantic ocean be end of observed viciously in spite of piece of gained ground knew well that there must be many uphill battle to fight before recovery must be assured cochrane have told that in letter have received from just before left england have answered at once to cable merely saying that must cure thurso have written fully afterwards letter ended thus know that believe in infinite omnipotent mind be sole only cause origin of world though be not member of church at present yet since believe gospel on cure christian science have ever made be based begin treating at once combat in mind sign of error that see in never allow to be discouraged because to be discouraged mean that for moment doubt of course good must triumph when error be so firmly rooted in man want pulling up wo come away a mere willow rooted weed will may have to face apparent failure again again be comfort to know one be on winning side day followed amply illustrated truth of many be hour in maud be tempted to despair evil erring mood have made up thurso record for last six month be condensed into few day of voyage sometimes will must flicker in little dim flame so that knew be not quite quenched flame be so feeble so dense be blackness surrounded one day secretly went to ship doctor taking with prescription be so familiar have written out signed with sir james sanderson name asking to have made up doctor looked at be in order certainly lord thurso said will have sent to cabin be rather strong solution know must be careful not to exceed dose thurso almost smiled at oh be very careful said suffer from terrible neuralgic headache thank very much left surgery heart beating with exhilarated anticipation when suddenly doctor who be looking at prescription again gave little whistle then called thurso have hardly left room came back at once lord thurso said be rather odd sir james sanderson be not on board for saw leave ship at liverpool yet prescription be written on ship paper thurso made furious gesture of impatience oh for god sake give said will go mad without be sir james prescription copied out have taken many time then sudden thought struck must have screamed at own stupidity in not having thought of second sooner know what be saying said did copy out at sir james wrote for before left ship doctor looked at in silence be sufficiently plain to what case be be very sorry said be quite impossible for to give will with pleasure give bromide mixture phenacetin if head be bad of course matter will go farther thurso merely walked away there be nothing more to be said then suddenly little flicker of will of outraged self respect shot up again saw how mean be thurso have not only forged forgery have be detected that be bitter must not do kind of thing powerlessness against desire be intolerable degrading pride rebelled against hideous strength of weakness leaned against bulwark of ship looking at hissing wreath of foam bubbled forty foot below in despair at yet since for moment be ashamed since wished be not such despicable fellow despair be not total yet must not be better if ceased to struggle ceased to be at one moment of bravery one leap into huge grey monster of wave be making even leviathan of sea rock roll must be over even at moment of thinking knew have not courage to do moral quality seemed to be left to have be eaten up transformed into one hideous desire even a cancer turn wholesome blood living tissue of body into own putrefying growth what if doctor told somebody have said that must go further there be small blame to if must not resist so savoury bit of scandal earl of thurso forge sir james sanderson name in order to get laudanum to be slave must make alluring headline if tastefully arranged for new york paper again must rail at maud laying tongue to bitter falsehood must invent telling for instance that have stolen bottle of laudanum that be tortured with neuralgia hurt more must tell truth say that have tried forgery on ship doctor have be caught asking how liked to have forger for brother hardest of must sit for hour in idle despair so deep so abandoned that be must to despair also knew be error be unreal mortal part of suffered be very hard to cling to truth of what believed not let sea sweep away after not very brilliant attempt to get laudanum from ship doctor thurso made further effort in direction now then there be little rift in cloud storm be so dark grey above more than once when for hour perhaps have sat be voluble with bitter thing in order to wound must cease suddenly sit in despairing sorry silence be utter utter brute must say try to cling to belief that be then must look at with lip quivered eye be brimming with unshed tear oh thurso know that said if forget now then feel hurt wounded thinking that be who have be saying bitter thing to know be not so really throughout voyage bodily health strength be steadily though slowly on mend put on little flesh there be little more brightness in eye more clearness of skin than when left england too seemed to visible sign of truth of what believed with heart too set to reverse forget warning sir james have given that a strength began to return so strength of craving must grow also have indeed seemed that be true on first evening when have taken drug again at least have felt said that be so set to fight that with heart lifted high in faith hope denied affirming that health being good thing must not let give aid be slave to evil thing for thus evil must be mastering good thing unthinkable strength be coming back to slowly indeed represented effort against repulse of deadly habit have become so intimate guest of soul into house of soul have admitted hideous dwarfish shape of terrible strength blear eyed with trembling hand clothed in shroud cerement of sensuality now be pushing away again dragging out of home of spirit be hard work none knew that better than for thing clung a tenaciously a limpet failure be impossible well knew that when at last got to door of soul got that door open so that sunshine of infinite love poured in with what cry of joyful amazement must see that dreadful figure in dark seemed so real be nothing have existence apart from belief in be cheating time be only in twilight of soul that what be shadow seemed to be real now then too real thurso kindly courteous gentleman who have be to so well loved brother came back maud must talk about old day before ever shadow blackened path then in serene light of memory often lends vividness to be remembered that did not have in life must live over again windy notable day on hill when thurso shot three stag memorable morning by river when maud killed four salmon before lunch oh thurso must have killed fifth do remember let line get round that rock in roaring pool broke by gad yes said very nearly cried lord what good day be be awfully happy summer funny have hideous neuralgia spoiled pleasure good deal did spoil happiness what do make of why nothing can spoil one happiness said if one think right happiness got up suddenly get heartache to think of said rose too laying hand on shoulder ah thurso will come back said will come back be better than ever be looked at with sudden face of gloom asked catherine how can forget be absurd to say that thing can be same a before not god can put clock back say be yesterday dear sun will rise on to morrow will be ever so bright joy come in morning bitter mood be coming over again ah phrase said yes true one answered hour be short rare be seldom that be able to think even regretfully longingly of past for most part be suspicious bitter full only of one deadly desire longing for gratification yet a day went by remainder of voyage began to be reckoned by smaller scale of hour despair dispiritedness be sensibly lessened maud noticed that when a sometimes did spoke hopefully of new cure be going to be tried voice rang a false a cracked bell knew that be not to treatment hope of salvation that looked forward to escape from prison of ship where desire be denied to freedom of land of town where there be chemist drug store be that really so felt that animated yet with returning strength craving did not seem to grow proportionately at time thought there be check on unanticipated by sir james wanted drug brain made doubt be often full of scheme must be effected on shore madness raving of desire have appeared already be within sandy hook steaming slowly up to relentless city thurso be standing on top deck together when be arriving on morning of crystalline brightness land be white with snow air be windless felt that even town have credit discredit of possessing vilest climate yet discovered in world have beautiful day higher higher a drew near rose abominable many storied building from pale blue of winter sky passed into region of grey smoke overhung town from lonely splendid place of untenanted sea slid into more populous water stately liner be leaving for eastern port from beautiful desert of ocean passed into jostling waterway full of broad beamed ferry steamer hootings of innumerable syrens yet somehow heart welcomed felt stimulus of keen air intense throbbing activity town exhaled that atmosphere of continuous unremitting effort make other place seem dronish lazy did not strike thurso thus be damnable be hell said maud scarcely attended to oh rather like said huge bulk of ship helpless in narrow water a spent whale sidled up to berth towed a if by microscopical harpooner boat by two three tiny bustling tug on quay maud saw figure knew tall serene smiling with greatcoat on in spite of chilliness of morning for moment forgot thurso trouble heart leaped lightly to across narrowing space of water separated be unconscious unpremeditated on moment conscious thought came back thought not of herself only of thurso be there man who have flicked across ocean message that must cure turned to brother look there be mr cochrane said see how kind of to have come down to meet ship be yet long time before be berthed landing bridge put in place maud did not know how heart too have leaped when saw standing on deck to also have come a to that first unpremeditated leap when be to that leaped then with conscious self saw brother whom longed to save from mortal error flame of human love in spite of have be first to blaze then met three chapter iv bertie cochrane have taken straight across by ferry to house in long island near port washington have seen comfortably installed returned in evening to flat in town a regard thurso spiritual conflict of divine infinite against be mortal mistaken have begun of ultimate issue of that have doubt there be conflict before more difficult than that conflict of thing be good yet seemed to be unreconcilable a sat now after eating one dish of vegetable be dinner felt torn by fine conflicting force for to morrow at joint request of thurso sister be going down to stay with arrangement must not refuse since be so kind a to ask be better in way a regard cure be undertaking to do so thus day day must see be with girl whom loved with intensity of jubilant vital soul yet since must be there only a healer since except a healer must never have be there knew that must entirely swamp drown private concern must say word make sign even be not enough feared must school to feel longing love must be drowned that strong beautiful thing while be there for must be there only a one who must bring have promised to bring light to man who be obscured by error must be sole reason for presence there be worth not moment of further debate argument a sat here now wondered if be strong enough to do what knew must do whether even at eleventh hour be better to refuse to go to long island at send someone else on other hand have promised to cure thurso sister have come from england on express understanding under promise must not be better to break that rather than lead into temptation of using for own end opportunity have be given to accepted by of demonstrating eternal truth be more real than human love knew too hourly difficulty that position must entail lady maud thirsted for more knowledge about truth already believed must be naturally who must talk to about sitting opposite seeing glowing light of knowledge be being unveiled in eye yet time must keep thought away from see nothing know nothing except what taught not thought must be spared to anything else must be there to heal while healed be belonged to two

bedside of sandie mackenzie called thought home thought of day sea of sunshine windless frost virgin snow came flocking back went to sleep other thought little more laggard little le willing to rest have to obey also have to forget book have be reading during dinner swift hour of skating have enjoyed after came back to town friend have met talked with in street thought more wide awake yet have to be put to sleep if possible be strangled a be sleeping namely strong physical disgust for man who through sheer weakness self indulgence have allowed to get into state in have found patient that slack

that to cochrane morning have be scarcely recognisable have to sleep disgust have to be done away with must not heal leper by shuddering at sore slowly with conscious effort be done there be still one soaring thought abroad stronger of wing harder to recall than maud too have to be called home irony of phrase struck beauty incomparable charm serene splendid bravery with brother love for must now be non existent for must cease thought of must cease then like force turn driving wheel of great engine be just beginning to haul ponderous freight out of station power of divine mind began to press

bitterness of frost have frozen surface of glass of water have poured out broke crust of ice on drank two minute later be undressed asleep having plunged into bed with smile have broadened into sheer laughter of joy thurso awoke next morning feeling so told stimulus exhilaration of new climate bracing effect of dry sunny morning of frost after narrow berth of cabin be luxury to sleep in proper bed again luxury when awake to lie at ease in what excellent night have have too have slept from about half past eleven night before till be called at half past eight slept uninterruptedly dreamlessly without incessant waking from agonised dream of desire have so obsessed during last week no doubt change from sedentary cramped life of ship to wider activity of land accounted for felt that place air suited yesterday have passed pleasantly too maud cochrane have be for long sleigh drive in afternoon there be use in denying though felt curious latent hostility to cochrane be very attractive fellow have tact experience manner of cultured agreeable man gift be somehow steeped in effervescence glow of youth never have thurso seen two so wonderfully combined youth enchantment be still eager vitality of boy when returned have have hour talk with alone at cochrane request have told whole history of slavery somehow that recital have be in way difficult once again a on occasion of maud poaching cochrane have made easy not to be ashamed thurso felt a if be telling to man who understood better than understood who did not in least condone seek to find excuse for wretched story to whom hideous happening appeared only in light of nightmare a if thurso have have terrible dream be speaking only of empty imaginings at end tale be long one cochrane have still be genial well now be good start said for guess have kept anything back sometimes people have sort of false shame wo tell one be perhaps very worst of must hinder healer must help on other hand to know just exactly what trouble be quite so that be only reasonable said thurso to thought how odd be that so straightforward simple fellow must be such crank not that be not perfectly willing to let crank do what must for must have worn amulet charm if anyone seriously thought must help again be conscious of latent hostility time fancied perceived cause of for cochrane be here to rob of most ecstatic moment of life be memory of made feel that be in presence of thief enemy well now before go back to town for night continued cochrane want to start right away with one two thought to keep in mind remember first of that that have be suffering from be unreal have true existence in sense in life joy be true try to realise for thus will help in accomplishment of healing patient can help medical man by determining to get well ca in same way can help by trying to realise that have never be ill real illness be contradiction in term do mean that not only be effect of drug unreal craving for be unreal asked thurso surely one can only judge of truth of thing by one feeling one feeling be ultimate appeal assure know of nothing so real a craving if have be le real must not have come to america ah be where make mistake said cochrane there may not be atom of truth in thing be cause of feeling most strongly suppose for instance lot of friend entered into conspiracy to play practical joke on have arrested got convicted of murder condemned to be hung with such realism completeness that actually believed be going to happen must be terrified agonised terror agony must be realest thing in world to must be founded on lie on thing did exist craving be founded on lie such stupid lie too believe a if evil have power compared with good thurso thought illustration rather well chosen be little tired little impatient also mention of craving seemed to have stirred into activity again began to wonder if there be chemist shop near have passed one on drive ride cochrane called be couple of mile off thought made more impatient excuse said be not christian scientist method employ doe interest since believe in be right for to tell that only came here because felt owed to to others to do anything be suggested cochrane laughed with serene good humour though thurso tone have not be very courteous oh will soon alter that said be telling little about treatment in order that may work with give help ordinary patient give doctor suppose be pretty bad observed must just think be why be wrapped up in error have ever unwound rubber covered golf ball there be yard yard of india rubber string think be going on for ever at centre there be core there be core in too have got to unwind error in order to get at thurso got up be feeling moment more fidgety impatient be beginning to want drug most terribly craving be growing with mushroom like rapidity yet while cochrane be there felt that will to get well desire to be free be keen also that gave impulse of honesty tell too said be longing for drug most frightfully now ah help cried in sudden wail of appeal for know what will do when be gone yes tell said cochrane wail of voice told that true impulse still existed whatever thurso own forecast be well will go see where maud be said if be downstairs will tell be going to room to sleep till be time to dress so that can get away by trust think even after have happened good heaven why be telling said suddenly will tell now damn spoil cochrane interrupted quietly damning doe hurt said solemnly promise not to give plan away there be chemist very near be afraid there be one in port washington passed place afternoon ah have warned said thurso have done nothing of kind will pray get on pleasure that diseased imagination took in projection of plan be suggestive of joy of realisation thurso gulped a spoke take then that wo interfere said well will go to room forge yes forge prescription be getting rare hand at that gave little cackle of delight impulse that couple of minute ago have prompted cry for help be half smothered be conscious of one need only pointed warning finger at cochrane be understood that hing to hinder said nothing tangible practical though can treat call till blue then will send to stable tell man horse to go down to chemist wait for prescription to be made up bring back lord thurso know republican think lot of lord will hurry because have got fine specimen of one now will sit gnawing nail till that bottle come back then two hour paradise before dinner god wonder whole world doe take to laudanum paradise made up while wait cheap too remarkably cheap said cochrane ah be laughing at know ca guess thurso came close up to pressed arm latent hostility be gone here be friend who must be told what be missing so easy be to get out of hell into purgatory through purgatory past unbarred gate of paradise of rose gold flaming sworded angel be there glass bottle be pas word for admittance have to draw stopper chink glass drink whole world be changed thought invaded encompassed must think of nothing that suppose try one night said to cochrane when be staying down here a will be to morrow just see there be need for healing more thing be health life say must be funny if after have come over here to be cured by succeeded in pulling after just try night bertie cochrane nodded at well may come to that said there be nothing can say be impossible thurso laughed again maud too perhaps said what good time might have 'up to heaven three ' a say in poem by by never can remember name now cochrane must barely restrain little shudder of disgust at checked well be making excellent start said because be telling plan for future just a have told history of past a for present can figure up pretty correctly now now do know what have be doing for last ten minute have be almost forcing to do what say be going to do by imagining action begin in brain just before action began said 'ah help ' do remember that yes be useless said thurso see for be useless never spend time over useless thing when said that will be on right side even now when be half crazy for drink be ashamed to think of what have just suggested that lady maud sister must be dragged down with be ashamed have be very candid want candid opinion on thurso frowned did say that be sure did say that indeed did now come back on right side again have be suggesting thing to imagining with remarkable vividness so now to make fair plan evening for come what must be pleasant make long evening of want to go to bed before eleven why asked thurso just because be sensible hour will be treating by then maud tried to treat once on steamer said effect be must get to sleep at thought be in room for moment anyhow edge of desire be dulled there be something compelled attention in big strong young man who be so cheerful quiet who looked so superlatively well seemed to diffuse sanity health why be real good of lady maud be said that feeling of yours that be in room be very likely to happen will tell why like everything else in science be so simple healer ought quite to sink must be conscious of at must think that be controlling working of power of divine love that unconsciousness of self only come with practice at first healer find that personality obtrudes quite unconsciously thurso began to be more interested consciously knew that did not want drug just moment a devouringly a have thought simplicity of what cochrane be saying struck also be so exceedingly unlike torrential inconsequence of alice yardly then why ca heal instantly said if error can not exist in presence of divine love how be that time be required for destruction cochrane laughed have slightest idea said then profess to be able to explain everything sometimes healing be really instantaneous sometimes take time if ask why confess ca tell be so though got up now must go said for though there be such thing a time really be still possible to miss train now keep on making other picture of evening to say will go to bed at eleven thurso lay back in big chair after cochrane have gone conscious that something else besides laudanum have begun to interest little felt leaning tendency towards christian science wanted to find weak spot in central theory fatal inconsistency must invalidate altogether there must be one even in little have heard about at moment maud came in have have long talk to cochrane said left only ten minute ago maud give christian science book be going to prove that be wrong laughed do dear be business of everybody to expose error will read to yes if will then suddenly craving began to return sharpening instantaneously to hideous acuteness mind be like light vehicle from driver have be spilled being galloped away with by bolting furious horse of habit never before have stroke fallen upon with such suddenness fine first fruit of value of christian science said to yet though onslaught made almost dizzy retained presence of mind cunning seemed to have be developed in since took to drug mastered voice completely mastered also that watering of mouth automatic swallowing movement of throat will read after dinner said that sleigh drive made so sleepy think must drop asleep at once if began to read maud looked at for moment with pity be instinctive must not help then laughed again oh thurso how transparent said want to go to bedroom forge yes forge prescription forged with such brilliant success on steamer send down to village to get horrid bottle be very well to forge once twice really must get in habit of grows on one dreadfully be told came towards white shaking that quack cochrane have be talking to have said promised not to interfere have interfered be perfectly free to do what like be not proved to be quack yet laid hand on arm maud just once said do let have once will be last time see treatment will soon put right now why do want leave said know must make more comfortable must enjoy more well propose slightly different plan said promise will go get for at twelve o'clock to night if still really want hold on for six hour five hour then if ask will take down forged prescription only in interval must do best best mind not to think about must go to bed at eleven be not much to ask be weighed in mind soon decided for there be something rapturous in waiting provided knew must soon get yes of course will wait said though ca guess what point be really promise at twelve wo tell cochrane added with little spurt of glee thinking for inexplicable reason maud be going to help oh wo tell probably will now if sleepiness of sleigh drive have gone off will read to will help to pas hour till twelve have required maud faith to get through with have understood agreed with what mr cochrane have said before left wanted above thing thurso must make effort of abstention though be only for few hour of own accord believed at present must hardly do so unless be bribed so to speak have in fact suggested plan if want at twelve asked keep promise wo ca all thurso thought over a lay in bed next morning watching valet put out clothes have gone to bed a have promised before eleven hugging to thought midnight be coming closer minute then have simply fallen asleep when woke pale winter sunlight be flooding room yet mixed with exhilaration of cold bracing air memory of pleasant day before sense of recuperation after excellent night there came feeling a got up dressed turning over event in head that have be tricked have idea how trick be done how be that must have gone to sleep when if have kept awake so short time must have enjoyed that with sense of concealment surreptitious dealing one sensation turned life into paradise certainly have be extremely neatly done a conjurer cochrane sleight of mind so to speak be of most finished sort for a have be said thurso have have sense of presence intimation of influence cochrane however must be here to day perhaps must explain feeling of having be tricked somehow piqued pique be not lessened by fact that must not guess how trick be done of course must have be suggestion hypnotism in form odd thing be that maud cochrane have suggested to at that must go to sleep have gone to sleep by accident without intending to do anything of sort without feeling that others be intending for while be dressing heard sound of sleigh bell probably betokened cochrane arrival when got downstairs found maud already breakfasting cochrane nodded to good morning said now lady maud will tell that have spoken word about morning know nothing of what have happened here since left last night told by way just before left to promise to get drink for if wanted at twelve o'clock midnight now let hear what happened went to thurso room at twelve knocked said maud there be answer so went in called several time even touched did wake cochrane laughed call that pretty good said oh be childish broke in thurso maud do swear that be true of course well mr cochrane must have hypnotised drugged said know le about hypnotism than know of inhabitant of mar said cochrane what do think drugged with well how did do then asked congratulate anyhow be very neat did do have idea at least whether be asleep awake at midnight only knew that divine love be looking after something rather like sneer came into thurso voice did ah did divine love tell so asked yes most emphatically have promised to look after know do everything be good for word have never seen beauty of morning outside cold though thurso be undeniably in very bad humour by time felt convinced in own mind that there have be hypnotic force suggestive influence used on last night when man denies simply attribute have happened to working of divine love can not contradict maud however have read to last night out of christian science book have found thought hundred inconsistency in cochrane last word too be utterly inconsistent simple a sounded how can say be cold asked when whole gospel be rooted so understand in unreality of such thing cold heat pain so on did misunderstand do think what maud read to last night certainly gathered that cold heat have real existence think have said cochrane with mouth full then be not what reverend mr eddy call 'voicing error ' to allude to temperature of morning cochrane laughed great big genial laugh oh at least make claim to be beyond feeling cold heat when there be reason for not feeling beg pardon cochrane still looked amused quite patient well if for cause be necessary that in healing must have to stand in tub of ice cold water imagine must affect much there must be reason for doing in ordinary way say 'this be cold be hot ' hurt time be taken up in denying thing do hurt though nothing hurt false belief hurt consequence maud joined in thurso be being tiresome irritable dear thurso pas marmalade please have false claim of wanting so tell there be propose to indulge false claim oh be severe with be such pity spoil pleasure be merely inquiring into matter said thurso rather acidly for mind still chafed at trick so called have made go to sleep last night maud false claim of wanting marmalade be soon satisfied got up now mr cochrane have promised to give instruction for hour thurso said after vote go out there be lake say not far off might skate what be to happen to asked be to have treatment laudanum to be put to sleep again bertie cochrane looked up at suddenly for second allowed to be stung affronted by thurso tone recovered immediately now honestly must like best asked then though moment be a measured by time infinitesimal one in eternity soul have thrown at foot of infinite love reminding of promise like child calling to help acidity sneering criticism suddenly died out of thurso mind mood altered quickly enough violently may have be that only know want to be cured said cochrane made little sign to maud who left room leaving two men alone yes know do said gently be going to be cured can help hinder breakfast know have be hindering be such pity have be asking question love to be asked love answering too when can answer not because wanted to know because wanted to catch out why of course can catch out because often often be bound by error claim of mortal mind also know absolutely everything indeed when want to catch out like that mean be adopting hostile attitude to to hope to bring that hinders be fair cochrane shook head at like nice boy remonstrating kindly with friend whom like for not playing game then went on more seriously now what be trouble said why be hostile be just because infinite love came to help last night sent to sleep instead of letting drink that poisonous stuff guess be that to think suggest that hypnotised drugged be childish to doubt that happened in other way than way did be error on part why not accept perfectly simple explanation can seriously offer other how often before when have be wanting stuff badly have known must get in hour have dropped off to sleep instead why never what be first occasion of happening when be treating bringing into presence of divine love not suggesting thing either to just leaving together treated for four hour last night beginning soon after dinner be impos began thurso understand anyhow that be different matter said cochrane explain if have brought there be over be cured because have made habit of error habit have to be broken have got to form new habit of non error will have to put in hand of love often often before get rid of at least expect that though ca tell in what manner will choose to heal expect that from what know habit take longer to cure than occasional lapse be hard to forget thing have got by heart have got to ask to keep on asking again hostile attitude be smothered interest took place why asked thurso why if error be mistake without real existence doe bind how can gracious ca tell said cochrane there be doubt be so can heal people who believe asked why not man who did believe must heal by time cure be complete a far a know patient nearly always belief thurso be asking question now in different spirit to have prompted before knew difference spoke of laudanum a poisonous stuff just now said if god made everything including poppy how can be poisonous cochrane laughed well have better ask lady maud to come back said be about very point be going to talk to to day now if care to listen to since have asked question pray do if bore why if will read paper occupy for hour can then start out skating what please be going to treat asked thurso oh be at morning for time said have paid morning visit so to speak then again spirit of antagonism entered into thurso when maud came back crossed over to fire with paper news be of importance interest since chiefly concerned american affair meant nothing to by degree found attending le to printed page more to voice sounded so cheerful serene sometimes found mentally ridiculing what be said yet listened be arresting somehow whether be only personality of speaker arrested what said found whether approving disapproving more more absorbed in cochrane spoke first a said be going to do about apparently poisonous sanative effect of drug effect maintained be not inherent in drug in belief of who used be quite certain for instance from purely medical point of view that injection of plain water must be made that patient believing to be morphia must sleep under influence of what have influence at slept because believed have be given something must make sleep from christian science point of view to use drug for curative purpose be merely to encourage false belief that must in cure while on other hand anyone who knew fully believed that must neither be health giving destructive of health might if chose eat deadly poison be none worse for one who held belief must do so merely a demonstration to satisfy idle curiosity of who did not believe up till now have be speaking quietly a if be mere commonplace superficial now intenser conviction vibrated in voice said though of course be perfectly true be only detail little inference follows from real vital proposition how error originally came in pretend to say what have got to deal with to day be that error be here in embarrassing quantity one of commonest form of be to attribute real existence real be to say in comparison with reality of love to material thing what be truly worth concern be not to know what doe not exist to know what doe one thing only exists be god in manifestation originally a know made world pronounced what made to be good seems to have be before error entered infinite mind be divine love be have real being a light pure white light can be split up so that different beam of appear a of colour of rainbow so that when say be blue be red be only speaking of aspect of light so when say be unselfish be courageous be pure be only speaking of one of colour of god be good that must contemplate one of for of be lovely must continually be fusing together in thought so that be mingled made one again when be done when by power of little know of infinite mind bring together can conceive of love purity unselfishness then be god be contemplating whenever contemplate like there be existence possible for sin error imperfection pas into nothingness not because will to do so make longer assertion of nothingness because existence be inconceivable thurso have dropped paper be listening still with occasional antagonism mental ridicule with interest be not so dull a paper besides what if be true then indeed antagonism must be that of feeble soft bodied moth fluttering against express train thinking to stop there be something serenely authoritative about word be not a when scribe pharisee spoke somehow also be impossible not to feel there be same authority not only in cochrane word in life thing said be borne out by what did seemed a if be not temperament that inspired word belief on word be based that produced completely happy temperament big trouble big anxiety have said never came near what to maud be a remarkable appeared that little fret inconvenience must have said be inseparable from ordinary life of day be unable to touch settle on round there seemed to be atmosphere a of high mountain place in bacillus of worry anxiety must not live nothing must fleck dim happiness of childlike eye child faith a have recognised last summer shone there be supported proved by knowledge experience of man like faith be instinctive hour of life endorsed truth of instinct if thurso maud must have guessed how passionate furious be struggle going on within during first day two between desire of human love absolutely convinced knowledge that have right to use intimacy into be thrown with maud by call to cure brother for own end must have said that miracle be going on before eye tempest of desire storm of longing for more potent than knowledge that loved with best be in continually beat upon abiding place of soul be absolutely unmoved by surrounding tumult not for moment be essential serenity troubled be third day after arrival at house in long island maud be sitting together by fire before evening closed in weather morning have suddenly broken instead of windless sunny frost south easterly gale from sea have set chimney smoking ice melting drove torrent of volleying rain against window of shuddering house maud at moment be wiping eye pungency of wood smoke have caused to overflow be quite right said when warned not to have fire lit in easterly room what make more annoying be that weep also be that christian science strong eye perhaps be same thing think have better move into other room ca stand other room be billiard room in did not often sit be free from smoke however fire prospered thurso have gone upstairs hour ago to write letter have not yet come back be so much better said a settled into comfortable chair recovery have be quite steady too do longer fear relapse oh never feared said in sense that ever imagined must baffle how must nothing can possibly interfere with truth sometimes sometimes when error have gone very deep have be allowed to rest there tap sort of fresh reservoir of just when think be getting to end of in one sense suppose have feared that may not happen have reason to believe that will have seen very sudden attack onslaught of most violent kind even when one thought cure be practically complete surely have made marvellous progress said maud think be only four day since began to treat yes one progress be more marvellous than other since progress be right have be very smooth sailing so far care whether be being heretical not think be condition have be very favourable weather climate external influence have great effect have real power to help hinder when soul be bound by material habit material condition do come in be use to say otherwise depression caused by wet windy day such a to day be certainly false claim go hobnobs with other false claim sit round fire talk take a whole who believe be le affected by such thing than who mental worry be le felt by scientist because know doe not really exist so will discount depressing influence of weather wo so much mind windy oppressive day doe weather ever upset asked maud laughed oh dear yes said have be having false claim over day like like shower bath day have be reversing till be dizzy have looked serene enough said must have guessed well hope not since be by serenity come from complete conviction of one omnipotence that fight if abandon that what be to fight with looked at smiling then smile faded for felt for moment that in spite of love must betray by word gesture surely there be answering struggle going on in be only sympathy only gratitude for what have done that made beacon in eye whatever be have in control also wo tell of asked sometimes telling thing very putting of into definite word show how shadowy indefinite really be ask from inquisitiveness be sure of that said thing have be worrying most to day be at present absolutely private affair then there be have be letting be anxious about brother be very bad for a well a when be treating morning sort of doubt kept coming into mind time be fighting instead of giving entirely to ah never really doubted said be sure that denied yes be feeble be muddy choked channel for flowing of divine love be now have to be continually dusting cleansing have be having fear specific one fear of definite event yes be afraid have gone a far a have have fear of violent access of error coming upon have reason for fearing because if did occur must know quite well what to do there must be anything to fear really guess be be getting well so quickly smoothly have allowed to wonder whether must be true though of course knew be be so like feeble mortal mind very fact that need be answered so abundantly immediately make wonder if be real maud got up what must do if have relapse asked must say now certainly must allow to contemplate if came must surely be made quite clear to how to demonstrate over be never left in lurch like that be only devil who play disciple false let have fit of remorse just when want to amuse flame on hearth leaped up died down in response to great blast outside squalled trumpeted over house paused a if to listen in glee to riot that caused wind be like wild creature that with frightened hand rattled at fastening of window a if seeking admittance till tattoo of sleet silenced drove away then low long drawn whistle of alto note must sound in chimney suddenly rise siren like to screech of demoniacal fury like passage for drum rattle of leafless branch of tortured tree mixed with sound of surf mile away seemed to portend deadly disaster hell seemed loose in infernal din of element bertie cochrane drew chair close to fire with little shudder of goose flesh be awfully frightened by storm once when be little chap said have left sort of scar on mind be still tender always have to demonstrate to when there be gale like seem to be able to get used to father died in middle of awful storm ten year ago too what confession of feebleness be think must have guessed how hated storm if have told think must said be so sorry be just opposite there be nothing love so much a gale like maniac there listen to appalling blast swept by house full of shriek cry a if soul of lost be being driven along in pitiless storm seemed a if window must have burst open door communicating with night tempest have come unlatched for thick double curtain served instead of door between billiard room where sat hall outside be lifted clear foot from ground flood of cold air strong a wind poured in making candle flicker stream stirring carpet a if ground swell have passed beneath cochrane jumped up something must be open said wind have come right into house maud got up with before have pulled curtain aside for to pas strange wind ceased a suddenly a have begun heavy fold fell to ground again by front door with latch still in hand stood thurso rain dripped from coat be deluged waterspout maud heart sank when saw why thurso said what have be doing have be out in gale thought be upstairs writing letter looked from one to other a took off dripping overcoat spoke in voice that knew stammering stuttering voice finished letter said then went out to to post post must expect servant to go out in not not reasonable besides have not be out day wanted breath of fresh air sir james told to be out a much a must how did hear come in thought be in drawing room maud heart sank sank be in billiard room said looked at cochrane thought of gale trouble of nerve else be that have be obsessing day have passed from eye be vivid alight face alert again full of huge vitality be so characteristic of why be thoughtful of said perhaps little errand on own account why man there be packet in coat breast pocket be bulging can see from here thurso hand tightened on ca help said besides be much better be not must break of by degree know outside gale yelled defiance here inside there be tense silence seemed to maud a if conflict mightier than of element be going on ah do let have just once cried thurso have be without for week swear to by hold sacred by laudanum said cochrane yes by laudanum that will be fort night before take again send to sleep time think must die if did have let have look at bottle said cochrane look of futile childish cunning came into thurso face oh think not said might forget to give back one always may forget thing look here be going to take be about be awfully grateful to for have done to morrow will beg forgiveness ask to go on curing once sha' stop besides there be power either for evil good in drug be blasphemous on lip said cochrane quickly beg pardon must have said that for moment light of anger have sprung into eye only dulled stood there in silence space while brightened again with brilliant serenity confidence have be there before then looked at maud smiled encouragement to spoke never stopped before said be not going to stop now laudanum drinker be such selfish fellow get away by yourselves drink by yourselves never treat anybody else want of too do remember saying that perhaps must end in converting well let make beginning to night let have jolly good drink together have got enough for expect in big bottle thurso still looked suspicious kept hand on package cochrane manner be perfectly sincere soon gave little cackle of delight eye too like cochrane be very bright be bright with thirst desire mouth too so watered that must hardly swallow quick enough to keep saliva down know what mean said will do anything if will let take not stop there be enough for for to night for for week may get more to morrow may do what choose to morrow said cochrane if will give to night have often wanted opportunity proper opportunity to take why might say have quite craving for maud be looking from one to other utterly puzzled came close to cochrane mr cochrane what be going to do said what be about be frightened looked at quickly radiantly ah be frightened said must help not hinder know be right be afraid doubt chapter v went back into billiard room again outside wild hurly burly of storm still screamed wailed round house cochrane now be utterly unconscious of clear command louder than wind tattoo of rain still small voice made else inaudible have come to soul knew that what be going to do be right have fear at of consequence consequence gloried in embraced for must be nothing else than demonstration convincing conclusive a to truth of taught worked believed have said to maud hour ago that did not then know what must do if thurso have relapse now that relapse have come knew be perfectly certain that be doing right rang bell a soon a got to fireplace want glass suppose said beg pardon may ring because have rung thurso looked at secretly better for servant not to know said why not be doing nothing to be ashamed of said must like everybody to know ah must bring couple of glass please said to man thurso came close to whispered take little water sugar with mine said perhaps hot water must be nice got so wet yes very wise said cochrane hot water sugar please added then sudden distrust came into thurso mind be not going to cheat asked cochrane felt one moment of vast pity for ever since maud have gone out into hall found stealthily closing door so that return must be unheard have felt be different personality from thurso of last three day whom have discovered there dripping from secret errand be a if be possessed be furtive suspicious bubbling with one desire nothing remained of thirst jealous fear that be not going to be quenched thirst for drug have already dragged so near to precipitous edge of ruin death that expunged from mind sense of honour rudimentary moral code by men be bound sense that anything in world existed except thirst quenching of must have said that said quietly because never have cheated anybody have right to suppose that ever must dear how long be bringing glass did forge prescription again again thurso gave dreadful little cackle of cunning laughter took such pleasure in success such pride a foolish natured dog take in doing trick well yes suppose did said forged sir james name quite beautifully one did on steamer be clumsy affair wrote on rather crumpled piece of paper so that looked to be old prescription why be real smart of said cochrane man have brought sugar water glass a soon a have left room thurso produced package tore covering off what be going to happen maud did not know trusted cochrane trusted power in obedience to felt sure be acting thurso trusted too appeared for after have poured half of bottle into own glass passed across to cochrane then dropped lump of sugar into glass poured in little hot water stirring up stabbing with spoon at lump must take much if be said ah to leave more for to morrow morning said cochrane greedy fellow look at ration why have taken bottle thurso gave dreadful giggle again know said be regular bumper time be be going to drink to first merry meeting damn sugar melt so slowly moment doubt fear swept over maud like huge combing breaker thurso thurso cried mr cochrane still held bottle in hand ah reverse fear quickly said thurso seemed not to hear sugar be nearly dissolved now be stabbing at few remaining crystal what nice fire said will sit by evening not come to dinner enjoy four five hour of paradise time go so slowly too in paradise seems eternity must take more than tea spoonful if be said to cochrane who be just tilting bottle be what began with ah be said cochrane then see here poured whole of rest of bottle into glass then without troubling about hot water sugar put to mouth drank off ca say like brand said putting glass down sugar be melted in thurso glass have withdrawn spoon first sip be imminent now that first sip of so many then struggle began longed for first sip a saw what cochrane have done hand trembled must not raise glass to mouth stammering have gone giggling laugh be dumb why will kill will kill screamed know what have done be nearly pure laudanum must take emetic at once here hot water ah be too hot go quick will be dead in couple of hour maud sit there cried send for doctor send for somebody quick put own glass down sprang up from chair with helpless agitation of man who have control of maud did not move cochrane looked at once smiled at seemed satisfied a if have be waiting for waiting for assurance of confidence that smile gave then turned to thurso now have cheated have said there be glass drink told must not interfere with be not doing so have finished bottle be afraid can get more to morrow while be drinking why drink just listen to minute be going to talk straight to now what have drunk will have effect at on said may sit here not have dinner will have dinner just same please drank that in order to show how have be slave to thing have real power effect of kind what have be slave to be intention false belief self indulgence now at last will see how unreal be power of stuff love so much compared to power love so much be through error that have made unreal thing real to be through truth that show how unreal be look what error have made of think for moment of what be year ago what be to day there be glass look know without thurso have risen be walking up down room waving hand in impotent gesticulation of despair once twice paused by table where steaming glass still stood brimming only shuddered at once tried to go to curtain led to hall cochrane stood in front of big cheerful rather determined blocking way be going to drink that asked pointing to thurso untasted glass be going to have four hour of paradise thurso shrank from table where glass stood oh implore implore cried run to doctor take emetic be quick have taken fatal dose will be dead in couple of hour be such good chap have be so good to so patient have helped so much damnable habit of mine will have killed know what have done think drug have power have done to convince oh if will only go before be too late will swear to never to touch stuff again a for that took own glass flung content into heart of fire there with huge puff of steam hissing blackening of wood log crack of glass passed away up chimney there will that show that be in earnest cried just when be worked up for just when wanted a never wanted before have caused to do oh implore to go make sick maud maud tell to do something if doe will have killed have helped so have helped damned beast that be flung down on sofa in paroxysm of despair writhing sobbing shuddering a for maud though dared not speak for fear of giving way to uncontrollable outburst of emotion thanked god for telling be not afraid must not be afraid here in room life death not mere life death of man even man loved be fighting battle eternal principle of life love health be asserting serene supremacy over sin death disease a ever work be kind compassionate bringing healing with deliverance from error nothing must prevail against believed now in spite of moment panic terror when saw cochrane toss off deadly draught that have done right god must not play false without playing false while a for thurso poor trembling sobbing thurso at last be broken thousand time have fallen be sorry vowed to amend have never be like be complete abandonment absolute break up without there be real repentance if a cochrane have said there have still be reservoir of error so to speak within must not doubt now that bank be broken be coming out from in torrent for minute two cochrane looked with kind sorry eye on thurso agony then still smiling still serene sat down by a writhed on sofa laid hand on shoulder be awfully sorry for anguish be feeling said have to do there be really other way a far a must see of convincing be not convinced yet will soon see that fear for now be just a false just a mistaken a be desire for stuff tasted so abominable apart from ca tell how glad be to have have opportunity for feel sure will see now have thrown off for good believe have be getting better day know somehow be unable to get deep enough into be right now oh be not too late yet cried thurso go at once before begin to feel effect go go show really believe word of have ever said to lady maud asked ca seriously invite to show hypocrite a why anyone of least spirit must sooner really die a still fancy be going to do than do thurso laid agonised hand on shoulder oh work be done cried a regard know believe be safe make really safe have ever done anything of sort before for pity sake tell that have that have result minute be passing too cochrane laughed well have said be opportunity have long hoped must come way now when be bad tasting stuff supposed to take effect again thurso beat air with hand oh be fault be fault cried maud ca persuade be friend dear thurso said quietly ca persuade want to thurso sat quivering there moment longer then suddenly got up dashed through curtained doorway moment afterwards curtain again bellied inwards rising free of ground showing that gale have got into house again then front door banged to wind subsided have gone out again said maud be safe to leave oh yes think have gone for doctor may have gone just to despair by then will come back see will not harm wo even catch cold added smiling be sure asked yes so be why divine love be pouring into on side have got to break first then build so tenderly so gloriously looked at for long moment be cured know said be over then in flood there came over that have so resolutely banished day felt that visit a healer must come to end at once must see again see again there be longer reason for to stop here said be rather rough night if think be very rude abrupt of think will go back to town at once then maud lip quivered eye brimmed over without letting say 'god bless ' asked thank for that said gravely took hand in hers for moment silently thanking then looked at once more must think of going up to night to morrow hope for long time said say work be over so believe wo stay little while with friend when ask a friend said yes mine thurso looked at other still gravely thanks yes said be kind of hour have come maud maud cried know what have kept back so long why love love bertie cochrane conjecture have be right hour later thurso came back drenched with storm for have put on hat coat with doctor from port washington minute later highly affronted physician left again wondering if be form of aristocratic english humour to drag man out on night like because friend in house have inadvertently taken huge dose of laudanum only to find on arrival that friend in house who if have really done so must certainly by now have lost consciousness looked rather annoyed at interruption otherwise perfectly well glance at companion seemed to doctor to account for annoyance chapter vi catherine be returning home to thurso house next afternoon about four o'clock have be lunching out number of people be glad to think be coming to dinner have good deal to do before hardly liked to estimate how much to think about also telegram from maud who cabled to day must probably have arrived by time got home might add considerably to number of thing to be thought about ever since departure of husband sister in law to america hand have be very full have devoted more time than usual to purely social duty for knew perfectly well that london have talked good deal about thurso illness in particular tone mean that in public to be referred to a illness in abstract that when two three only be gathered together be discussed with far more detail circumstance to one of tact therefore knowledge of life be clear that more be seen about more entertained be entertained le disagreeable loud must all talk scandal about be with fault general lack of respect world immensely respect pluck power of facing thing certainly catherine have faced thing magnificently result already be that world have begun to think that be rather shame to talk about thurso even among intimate when catherine be so plucky must very much have liked to know why have not gone with for reason that gave namely that abhorred sea maud delighted in be too straightforward true to be accepted at generally still on whole be shame to talk since memory of world resides in tongue follows that soon forgets when cease to talk be understood however that thurso case be hopeless though catherine brave woman always said that hoped voyage must quite restore after nervous breakdown catherine in believed case to be hopeless have refused to see on morning left to say good bye from window have seen face a got into carriage took maud to station seemed to that death have already set seal upon a matter of fact have scarcely expected that must reach america alive in spite of news might reach day have consistently with declaration that voyage must probably restore acted a if really thought so have be indefatigable in activity if ever be to come back a long a lived that possibility be still there part be to minimise gossip discussion about at present moment be inevitable during week when be at sea have thought about whole situation more deeply earnestly than in probability have thought of anything before in very busy very unemotional life with whole heart have forgiven not by intention only in fact so that dismissed matter from mind for suffering indignity have brought on during last six month whether must ever read letter not did not know three day after departure have written to quite shortly quite sincerely telling never to reproach a regard for what happened in past to dismiss a absolutely a have dismissed devote to getting well letter be not easy one to write rather attitude of mind have made possible to write have not be attained without effort for just a be very slow to take offence so be naturally slow to forgive event of last six month with crowning indignity have bitten very deeply into effort have be made letter written have pledged to oblivion whole hearted forgiveness must get well have given to understand that past be blotted out that be willing eager to join with in making best possible out of future knew quite well with ruthless honesty with judged be so fine trait in character that did not expect to live knew made letter easier one to write complete forgiveness le difficult to arrive at than must otherwise have be thought that be unlikely that must ever see again be absolutely willing whether lived died to abide by what have said there have be grim business of telegraphic code arranged between maud be clearly undesirable to telegraph in full such message a maud might feel necessary to send dozen cryptic word sent from new york on arrival have told that have broken down once on voyage have subsequently allowed to throw rest of bottle away general health maud said be certainly better three more telegram reporting event of three more day have come since then recording improvement be news of fourth day be expecting to find now on return a drove through street where shop be gay for christmas purchaser mind be busy over emotional conflict more intimate than even thing a be inevitable matter have come to crisis between rudolf villars two day ago have declared to steadfast passionate devotion have refused to continue longer on present unbearable footing of friendship must now definitely reject must not see more except a be necessary in casual meeting when world brought together have promised to give answer evening have really idea at moment what that answer must be month ago have determined that must not herself break that moral law though a matter of fact meant little to since then much have happened ruin degradation have come to husband have offered greatest insult that from point of view of moral law wife can be offered what be far more vital determining factor in choice knew now that loved man with intensity that believed equalled must moral law tied to opium drenched have significance compared to significance of love then suddenly for first time remembered in connection with choice letter have written to thurso have told that past be utterly blotted out saw how insincere that letter must become if blotting out of past meant for that be to console in future already knew that fact that did not expect to live have made writing of easier between two letter did not now seem to be worth much yet have meant that letter best part of meant just now that best part seemed to have dwindled to mere pin head in consciousness love life desire be trumpet decoration to little grey battered flag of honour be scarcely visible among mile of bunting little voice scarcely audible in blare of welcome must be hers if said one word to lover victoria have already stopped at door footman have turned back fur rug covered knee to let get out sat for moment quite still for significance of letter insignificance have struck like blow till saw in connection with decision have not known how nearly have decided have told husband that with sincerity that past be wiped out that have said done have be unjust insulting to have cancelled annihilated a far a concerned be then going to make fresh past so to speak on own account to give opportunity to be a generous a have be there be dreadful ironical fitness about conjunction of thing be brutally apt yet have forgiven that forgiveness be far more real to than be labelled sin did not signify anything very particular to to do thing behind screen of forgiveness seemed mean meanness be impossible quality have forgiven thurso on big scale very bigness of nature enabled to do made hatred of meanness strong also a got out asked whether if letter have written to thurso be still unposted must let go tear up knew that though might stand with in hand for little must still send meant what have said in there be half dozen of letter for on table in hall telegram lay little apart a picked up spoke to footman will be in to anybody till six said to nobody after except count villars have half opened telegram when eye fell on two little hat coat hung up on rack at end of hall looked at moment feeling that ought to convey something to did not know what then remembered that two eldest boy be home from school to day for holiday lord raynham master henry have come asked yes lady arrived hour ago again paused said did to day seemed to be laden with significance trivial though appeared let know have come in said will come have tea with in drawing room in ten minute what be child liked with tea boiled egg for added went slowly up staircase last june have be country lane of wild flower at ball looking back to night wondered whether if among guest then have come prescience of what next six month be to hold for must not have chosen to die then there so deeply have iron entered past be dead must not forget even to think of bitterness of be to allow to writhe struggle again there be thing in past child for instance though have never found particularly interesting whom death of past in sense that have promised to husband made more alive be wretchedness alienation of whole past a well a tragic six month that have meant must be dead willed more surely in caring for be truly vital in in neglecting no longer whom have neglected too much did not reproach now for small part that child have have in life if thurso lived letter have written to must be fulfilled here also have forgiven must amend so that must forgive even now recognised that child must help in stabbing estrangement of past to death be mother though for year have overlooked joy just a have forgotten pain of maternity be potential still so must not be better if did not even see villars must understand that a clearly a word must make yet rejected that knew cause of rejection that though told mind be made up be still debating what must say to passed like series of picture rapidly presented to a went up stair then paused underneath electric light at top took out telegram from envelope looked first at end of a be natural to see from whom came expecting to find be from maud be signed thurso then read be cured humbly entreat pardon though letter so generously have given will come back must possibly come out here will return immediately if wish thurso read once read again in order to be sure of sense of incredible thing must be hoax if so who must have played so grim joke hardly grasped yet be clear in order hour at be sent off be there hour of english time when have be received be incredible said to herself mean miracle passed into drawing room looking round consciously narrowly at picture furniture warming hand at fire feeling cold of marble chimney piece to convince herself of reality normalness of sensation opened letter two also be quite ordinary commonplace there be invitation to dinner few reply to invitation of own signed with familiar name footman be bringing in tea have drawn two high chair up to table have put plate egg cup opposite everything except telegram indicated that world be going on in normal manner have ordered boiled egg a treat for two boy there be egg cup boy whose hers thurso then sudden wave of cynical amusement coming in from ocean of world in life be passed went over head for moment felt that be being unreal melodramatic in suddenly thought of child like of husband of forgiveness of stale old property stock solution of difficulty be like preposterous adelphi piece be burglar who be suddenly filled with repentance remorse because heard clock strike twelve a remembered to have heard strike on new year night in young innocent day a if burglar thought of childhood when be engaged in plate closet a if people like thought of maternal obligation marriage vow when at last love have really come into life of course forgot everything except instead of suddenly remembering sort of other thing have spontaneously habitually forgotten for so long if have be described in book read acted in play must have thrown book aside have got up from seat at play whispering how perfectly ridiculous how absolutely unlike life think wo stop for end a be sure there be going to be impossible reconciliation yet what must have seemed to so unreal in fiction drama be now extraordinarily real when actually happened to occur wondered whether life have led year be a unreal a fiction of sort drama of sort must have seemed to thurso be cured so said besought forgiveness child be coming down to tea with expected villars there be enough there to occupy mind for few minute must elapse before child came poor old mumbo jumbo that fetish called morality duty have be to doll with veil over face be showing sign of life giving sudden spasmodic movement twitching at veil what face be like have really idea for in so many thing have practically be untempted year have be kind have be generous have have instinct for helping who suffered perhaps face must not be so very ugly message that two boy be to come down to tea have not be productive up above of notable rapture raynham aged eleven have said oh bother henry have asked if must have to stop long mother be radiant rather terrifying vision to be usually doing something else must not be interrupted that summed up knowledge of catherine remembered pack of ridiculous card have once produced shout of

butteriest corner of henry parted with precious yolk there be news also father be away nameless dagger stabbed a realised that be first have heard of have be ill then there be good news be ever so much better soon be coming home perhaps mamma be going out to see yes america million of mile off what ocean atlantic of course even henry knew that soon there be thought in mind of child a to how long be necessary to stop wonderful card be produced sat on hearth rug mamma be too stupid for anything for have whole flesh eating family of mr bone butcher in hand never declared so henry having to amazement be passed mr bone bottled mr bone up although be collecting be plan of devilish ingenuity for have passed mr bone to raynham raynham might have given back to mamma who perhaps then must have seen foolishness game be growing deliriously exciting when interruption came raynham again said oh bother mamma did not get up from hearth rug though child be told to do so get up boy said shake hand with count villars let see card be going to win how be count villars boy be just home from school be raynham be henry do give tea be kind let finish game catherine again proved perfectly idiotic henry
