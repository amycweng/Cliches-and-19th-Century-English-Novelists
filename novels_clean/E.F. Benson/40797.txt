of firm somewhat full lipped mouth expressed steadiness in curve if a butler have be told that whole of royal family be coming to high tea in ten minute must have felt safe to bet that intelligence must not flurry that sufficient high tea must somehow immediately appear for so ample well furnished man have curiously small voice rather suggesting that came from distance spoke sentence in precise manner never correcting word a if have thought out before opened mouth colour be given to supposition by fact that always paused moment before speaking habit of speech when worn by majority must predispose towards heaviness result when arrived be not in case of mr alington heavy on contrary be weighty far different thing in interval of reminding one of admirable butler irresistibly suggested member of conservative cabinet safe of peerage be only when considered a floater of gold mine that appearance be against even then be against only on score of probability for be impossible that even imaginative public must invent man in whom more prima facie confidence must be reposed a trustee of money of widow fatherless jack strolled in garden for nearly hour before appeared chucking pebble

bottom of basket chair after feeling that lawn be dry lit cigarette exquisite morning said after moment reflection hill look a if have be painted with cream for medium effect so rare out of england lord conybeare did not reply immediately for have not waited time in garden for alington to hear talk about cream then went straight to point said last night interested very much began kind offer to invest money for in new group of mine mr alington held up large white deprecating hand on little finger be plain gold signet ring bearing motto fortiter fideliter feliciter be nothing replied pray mention indeed lord conybeare if may say so only made offer a sort of feeler reply to then further reference to subject now show that be kind enough to be interested in new undertaking profoundly said lord conybeare then with disarming frankness money be most interesting thing in world most desirable often wish added that saw more of alington flicked morsel of ash off end of cigarette that confirms in what be thinking of saying to replied now will allow to speak with own frankness ah observe beautiful line traced by skein of starling jack looked up lovely said pray speak be then honest belief be that there be immense fortune to be made in west australian mining believe also again with absolute honesty that claim own be of at least extremely rich now wish very much that be wealthy enough to work by regret to say that be not must therefore form company to form company must have director surely name began conybeare politely with only faintest conjecture of what might be coming name a so kindly suggest will doubt be little assistance said alington for be not wholly unknown in such matter be not enough company must be english must be formed here shareholder must be largely english why for variety of reason in first place can raise ten thousand pound here more easily than can raise one thousand in australia again british public be getting ready to go mad about west australian mining while in australia regard australian mining without well without premonitory symptom of insanity perhaps underrate future think do perhaps british public overrates that also be possible bring ware to best market now ask lord conybeare will be on board will be chairman turned briskly round with first quick movement conybeare have yet seen make asked on board of mining director know about mine exactly what told last night be to say unless have forgotten of ghost of smile flickered across mr alington broad face laid large white hand on jack knee latter seemed to regard just a might have regarded harmless moth have settled there poor thing did not hurt saw that smiled said saw that saw smiled because spoke so far from point be frank enough be not to show that be telling truth there be further proof also in action with hand in speech plebeian showed plain jack did not resent have not asked alington down to cottage to enjoy refined conversation well bred presence to talk business that be doing jack be quite pleased with follow said mr alington lit cigarette from stump of old one before replying rose to deposit other out of sight in garden bed cigarette end be so terribly

off straw hat for be sitting in shade propped carefully up against chair by side of large tune hymn book removal showed high white forehead circular baldness in centre of flossy light brown hair like tonsure be plain business man went on when be engaged in business offer advantageous thing to others unless get advantage for to introduce sentiment into business be to make pleasure of failure must remember dear lord conybeare that england be essentially aristocratic in idea at least so far a nobility be conservative be aristocratic think if lord salisbury joined board how public must clamour for allotment dear yes master of hatfield might be very rich man very rich man indeed jack conybeare be completely be not dazzled unduly delighted at offer merely wished to know what got by taking for granted justly that man be sincere marquis still count then said give word have idea of be glad be marquis what added do get by salary said mr alington usual pause gave remark considerable weight will pas over went on director however have privilege of taking great many share before concern be made public in fact in order to qualify for being director must hold considerable number be very poor said jack that fortunately can be remedied said mr alington jack be immensely practical very quick be obvious at once that be capable of two interpretation took right one mean be certainty for said again mr alington let perceptible pause intervene before answered mean said if want plain speaking think do also suit better will be allotted certain number of share say ten thousand in new group of mine

advantage also do favour to other enter into partnership for own advantage duty asked jack attendance regular attendance at meeting of company on occasion will want to take chair read report of manager if there be one to hand make statement of affair of company congratulate shareholder condole asked jack hope not must also ask to immediately approach lord abbotsworthy ask to be on board be

lord abbotsworthy with regard to salary a chairman can not make precise offer yet tentatively must suggest five thousand year lord conybeare have to perfection very useful point of good breeding namely ability to preserve perfectly wooden face when hearing most surprising news mr alington for effect information apparently have on might have be speaking to leg of table seems to very handsome replied negligently seems to about fair said mr alington lord conybeare be puzzled wondered whether kit must understand how name on front page a mr alington called with attendance at few meeting at

by very sleepy attendant have taken off jewel put into safe there also placed very considerable sum of money have just won at baccarat to join rainy day fund jack did not know about rainy day fund be of kit very private possession be only fair to to say that if have be in financial impasse must have be at disposal number of outstanding bill however constituted impasse till be absolutely sued for debt simplest way of discharging way naturally popular be to continue ordering thing at same shop kit husband did not meet at breakfast took plebeian meal in own room having told hortense to open

sleep of just healthy being sound heard not dreamed in vague way that have won million pound that a be winning last of must mean eternal happiness cheated undefined shadow of penny in misty unexplained fashion of dream took away whole of winning then smell of tea bacon sudden influx of light scattered vain inauspicious imaginings woke to day of worthless selfish aimless life chapter iv kit little plan to many people event of day before anticipation of day to come give with most pedantic exactness automatic colour to waking moment first pulse of conscious consciousness without apparent cause be happy unhappy indifferent then come backward train of thought brain grope for reason of pleasure chagrin something have happened something be going to happen instinct of first moment be justified thing lay in brain gave colour of to moment when reasoned thought be yet dormant bacon tea be first savour of outer world to kit when awoke for have slept soundly simultaneously not referring to excellent thing brain said to not nice now be odd shared with husband opinion of paramount importance of money night before have locked up in safe enough to pay for six gown at least year dentist bill for teeth be very good indeed be generally supposed that be false though kit always laughed with open mouth have be more than once asked who dentist be herein showed le than ordinary wisdom when replied that have not got one for malignity of world how incomparable must have known felt justified yet in spite of delightful round sum in jewel safe smell of bacon woke to sense of bliss beyond bacon for moment challenged instinct told that be going to have tea with carburys that coquelin be coming that be dining with arbuthnots where be going to play little french farce so screaming curious that censor must certainly have have fit if have known that piece have be performed within bound of paternal care be a must be yet a river of thought began to flow more fully be even le pleased with colour of day something unpleasant have happened something unpleasant be still in air ah be sat up in bed wondered exactly how must put to lady haslemere anyhow have carte blanche from jack if between half past ten quarter past twelve must not think of something simple sufficient be fool that knew certainly be not with breakfast came post there be dozen card of invitation to concert dinner garden party autograph note from very great personage about guest at banquet next week number of bill making surprising uninteresting total note read with interest twice then tore into very small piece few line from jack scribbled on half sheet of paper do best can kit said be off to city to see will behave a if knew nothing kit tore up also not into small piece with little sigh of relief sense cometh in morning said to herself ate breakfast with very good appetite have be doing however unwisely have supped kit always wanted breakfast a took affair of night before seemed to to assume somewhat different complexion in heart of heart began to be not very sorry for lapse in social morality of mr alington have be guilty on previous night seemed to on post prandial consideration that might not be altogether bad thing that must have little check upon might even be called blessing with hardly disguise at put position to herself thus when went careering about in unexplored goldfield with owner comparative stranger harnessed to cart be just a well to have sort of break ready to hand very likely must be unnecessary to use indeed did not want to have to use at be certainly preferable to know that be there that if comparative stranger took into head to bolt must find suddenly clapped on only drawback be that alice knew about too at least kit be morally certain that have noticed mr alington surreptitious pushing forward of stake after declaration of card be very clumsily done must have preferred have be possible that only jack must have known for secret have only one value more be shared le valuable doe share become on simple arithmetical postulate that if divide unit into piece piece be le than original unit indeed more thought of more convenient did appear that mr alington must have made little mistake that must have noticed after perhaps must save trouble that alice must have noticed too for in probability must be necessary to make alington play again watch for must have accomplice a jack be not to come into affair at there really be better accomplice to have than alice to lay trap for bland financier did not seem to kit to be in way discreditable proceeding put to herself that if man cheated ought not to be allowed to play card win friend money that be in justice to that be necessary to verify suspicion that be low loathsome thing to ask man a friend to play card in order to see whether cheated not did not present to mind after be question of taste be not constructed in such way a to be able to understand point of view be not hide bound pedantic in idea of obligation entailed by hospitality to cheat at card be impossible habit must not do in least for rich man to cheat at card be inexplicable indeed must not be too much to say that kit be really shocked at latter in course of hour came answer from lady haslemere be unavoidably out till two if kit must come to lunch then must be at home haslemere tom be out must be alone kit always found alice haslemere excellent company during lunch blackened reputation of more intimate friend with mastery of custom firm though gentle touch like deductive detective of unreadable fiction kit must most plausibly argue guilt from cigarette ash muddy boot cup of tea anything in fact wholly innocent in luckier than have not got to wrest verdict from reluctant jury only to convince lady haslemere be far lighter task a must without slightest effort believe anything bad of anybody kit moreover be perfect genius at innuendo be one of greatest charm of conversation after lunch sat in card room smoked gold tipped opium tainted cigarette when servant have brought coffee left kit went straight to point asked alice whether have seen anything irregular a played baccarat night before lady haslemere took sip of coffee lit cigarette intended to enjoy very much mean australian said well have suspicion be to say last night felt certain be so easy to feel certain about sort of thing when one be losing kit laughed sympathetic laugh be bore losing said if there be one thing dislike more than winning other people money be losing own certainty of last night be still suspicion to day ye e know man may mean to stake yet not put counter quite clear of dear little chalk line be sure in case tom saw nothing because threw hint at morning must have understood if have seen anything oh tom never see anything said kit be like jack lady haslemere be natural conclusion be that jack have not seen anything for moment kit be saved from more direct misstatement not that have prudish horror of misstatement be idle to make one unless be necessary be silly to earn reputation for habitual prevarication lie be like drug stimulant more frequent use make of le effect have on on other people well then kit continued lady haslemere have not yet got much to go on tom jack be only four people who must really have seen jack because be sitting directly opposite mr alington tom because be sitting one on side of of four alone really think that unfortunate moral collapse think called happened jack be so sharp at agree that never see anything there be nothing rather that doe not see attach a much weight to seeing nothing a to anybody else seeing anything see thing very quick know dear added with unusual candour perhaps jack be lighting cigarette something said kit indeed now come to think of believe be jack can see through cigarette smoke a well a most people remarked alice on whole agree with kit can not leave a be believe recognised thing to do be to get to play again watch believe so said kit with studied unconcern here made mistake unconcern be little overdone caused lady haslemere to look up quickly at moment occurred to for first time that kit be not being quite ingenuous like doing sort of thing went on throwing out feeler what else be to do asked kit who since breakfast have evolved from inner consciousness several admirable platitude be really not fair to alington to leave like to have lurking in one mind one ca help suspicion against man may be quite erroneous on other hand supposing be not erroneous supposing did cheat be not fair on other people that must be allowed to go on playing either did cheat else did not there be gainsaying common sense of lady haslemere be silent moment tell jack suggested at length after racking brain for something rather awkward to say a rule kit be excellent friend treated other with immense frankness lady haslemere morning have very distinct impression that kit be keeping something back annoyed doubtless be something quite trivial unimportant did not relish being kept in dark about anything by anybody kit replied immediately see why must tell anybody alice said poor dear jack must pull moustache off in perplexity if be to know added with fine touch of local colour in case last thing want be scandal for never look well to see in paper that bearchioness of conybeare while entertaining large baccarat party last night detected one of guest cheating ladyship now lie in precarious state ' know sort of thing then follow name of guest hate public press observed with dignity yes be like x ray observed lady haslemere enables curious public to see one bone however charming one may be one bone be not fit for public inspection also paper must put name of one of guest with dash for vowel excited reader must draw conclusion really upper class be terribly ill used be whipping boy of nation supposing smith jones have baccarat party smith cheated one must care not even robinson kit laughed be just why want to tell anybody said if three people be in secret chance of getting out be enormously greater than if only two be not that anyone tell exactly atmosphere get impregnated with know what happened before one have to keep window open so to speak let in plenty of fresh air politics so on other people breathe secret ca tackle man alone said alice why not man always hate scene because man be never good at scene personally rather like be at best in scene dear really be ripping again lady haslemere have quite distinct sensation that kit be keeping something back seemed to wish to prove case against alington yet did not want anybody else to know be puzzling why desired private handle against man perhaps lady haslemere thought have inkling of truth decided to take shot at of course must be awkward for jack observed negligently to be connected in business with man if became known that knew that alington have cheated at baccarat kit be off guard be just what feel what feel said made barefaced correction with most silken coolness hurried hesitated lady haslemere burst out laughing dear kit said kit sat moment then perfectly naturally laughed too oh alice said how sharp be really dear if have be man have married must have be king queen of england before must say 'knife indeed be very quick of because did correct at badly be thinking have carried point so got careless now will apologize dear promise never to try to take in again partly because be use partly because owe one jack doe know at request left to deal with a if did must be very awkward for if knew so to speak officially at present see have only suspicion must not be certain more than a so sensibly said dear have only suspicion now alice let leave jack out of let know that know that know dear how complicated see must have to break with alington if knew lady haslemere laughed suppose middle class people must think wicked observed probably must be so middle class of said kit be convenient thing about middle class be never anything else now there be counting on upper lower class at one time belong to criminal class at be honest labourer middle class preserve perpetual monopoly of being shocked thinking wicked then put in pillory throw dirt such fun must be too because think mind so let have scandal lady haslemere pursed pretty mouth up blew excellent smoke ring be good humoured woman detection of kit took sting out of other attempted deception be quite pleased with very well wo tell said be dear said kit cordially must see that must do good to tell anybody else jack must have to break with if got about when reduced marquis be really wanting to earn livelihood be cruel to discourage so let get alington to play again watch like two cat then if see cheat again will ask to lunch tell so make sign paper stamp seal swear to say will never play again amen lady haslemere rose two conspirator swear silence then said how awkward will be kit if anyone else notice on second occasion bluff out said kit will deny seeing anything at say thing be absurd then will tell alington that know about that unless misbehaves play again incident will be clo o o sed must be sorry to trust money to man said alice oh there make mistake said kit be cautious in wrong place must wonder if joined carmelite before long for reason think that conybeare name be worth having on 'front page a call be convinced will give money worth may even give more especially a jack have got think jack be very sharp be quite right be very sharp too alice so be how pleasant for how right be to be friend dear if jack be enemy must soon make london too hot to hold of a be temperature be perfectly charming be bounder going to make jack very rich asked lady haslemere bounder be going to do best laughed kit at least jack think so must need very persevering sort of bounder to make rich for long together money be so restless be always flying about so seldom fly in direction have caught habit from world perhaps said alice dare say certainly be always flying about be so tiresome having to pay ready money at booking office jack quite forgot other day when be going to sandown told booking office man to put down to barbarously refused to do how unreasonable dear be 'd give lot to be able to run up bill with railway company dear be after three must fly there be bazaar for prevention of something propagation of something at knightsbridge be going to support princess frederick who be going to open eat large tea how eat people be always propagating preventing one ca cancel against other because one want to propagate exactly thing one want not to prevent what be going to propagate to day forget believe be anti propagation of prevention in general do go to hungarian ball to night yes will meet then au revoir be so full of good work kit said lady haslemere with touch of regret in tone kit laughed loudly be sweet of said really bazaar be excellent policy a good a honesty tell so much more if have be to bazaar be put in paper whereas put in paper if have be honest often have bazaar be soon over too feel afterwards a if 'd earned ball just a feel have earned dinner after bicycling kit rustled pleasantly downstairs leaving alice in card room where have talked that lady have a keen scent for money a kit evidently if kit denied pleasure of causing scandal over cheating at baccarat piquant subject must have strong reason for doing so wanted so lady haslemere reasoned to have alington under very private thumb not so concluded to get anything definite out of for blackmail be not in kit line a precautionary measure followed train of thought with admirable lucidity came to very sensible conclusion that interest that conybeares have in alington be large indeed taking into consideration utter want of cash in conybeare establishment must be immense for of must have considered anything le than fair settled income very large sum of money worth trying for being case wished to have hand in too tom knew have be approached by mr alington jack on subject of becoming director determined to persuade to do so at present have not decided anyhow to win money out of mine be fully

unexampled manner found difficult to remain cordial more than once have to force with effort to remember that hostess have duty alington mild intelligent face opposite roused in kind of frenzy unassumed quietness utter absence of sign of satisfaction at huge winning seemed to in worst taste lady haslemere have seen how completely scheme of watching to see whether cheated have miscarried indeed from moment when gave little exhibition of ease with be possible to defraud table have realized that might play detective till eye dropped out of head from weariness without catching lady haslemere have given up at once concluding that kit must have be mistaken before kit continued to watch furtively angrily little detective game be not nearly so amusing a have anticipated meantime a

visit to jack uncle who be bishop grim ordeal efficacious gave one firmer stand so to speak must have argued shocking lack of worldly wisdom to neglect such simple little thing kit lacked have admirable amount of avoidance of unpleasantness in greed for pleasure of moment led constantly to put off distasteful thing in same way in one put off writing of letter blindly hoping that if be left unanswered long enough will in manner of speaking answer charming result be often attained sometimes be not whereby child of eve be disconcerted tiresome baccarat incident have now be unanswered rather more than fortnight during interval kit have not seen mr alington told jack that mine man be rather too much for besides have introduced to hundred house if must not swim for now never must

in certain well defined area of intimate kind there be doubt certain thing kit did not tell jack on side felt that there might be development in alington scheme for instance into must not be permitted

jack apart from few exception kit always told jack everything especially if be in difficulty produce such peace of mind have said once to alice to know that one can tell husband worse thing than already know about how woman can go on letting husband remain in ignorance about bill other indiscretion ca conceive why must have to ask jack evening what have learned about during day sort of revelation come much better from oneself wear said kit thoughtfully guise of candour also possibly of regret two woman practised great freedom of speech with other alice replied frankly sometimes think be clever woman kit at other time feel sure be wrong that be most abject of fool suppose mean that seem to abject fool now said kit why please because tell jack only thing really matter thing if heard from elsewhere must really make row tell ah be thing nobody can tell said kit with customary quickness more than usual penetration conversation occurred to mind to day when determined to ask advice about baccarat only question be whether too came under head of what nobody else must tell if have be someone of own set who have seen whom suspected to have seen little faux pa of hundred pound counter must no doubt have come under head of thing incommunicable to tom toby jack lord comber must have be impossible to repeat such thing one must not guess what idea of honour wild west australian miner might have to repeat such thing about woman be contrary to code in use among associate good thing too thought kit strictly confining question to particular instance not confounding issue by consideration of honour in general even after lapse of fortnight thought of evening be smart mortification jack be going to entrust ship of fortune to wild man who sang hymn played harmonium for aught knew really laudable desire to have hold handle over have ended in debacle be not certain indeed that have seen kit must not admit that be highly probable after honesty be best policy determined to tell jack have gone up to town by early train kit who disliked getting up early almost a much a disliked going to bed early followed later be out when reached park lane be close on lunch time when heard cab drive up next moment butler have announced mr alington two looked just like brother good morning lady conybeare said very smoothly husband asked to lunch here a have business to talk over be to give message if be not yet in asking not to wait lunch for might mr alington appeared to ponder deeply for moment might be detained meeting be intensely annoying to kit have told jack that have have enough of mine man be very tiresome to have tete tete quite particularly disagreeable after last meeting to see alone however put on best face must to matter spoke with familiar geniality oh jack be always late said why must think necessary to ask not to wait for be more than can say suppose have be imbuing with business habit jack business man have idea how droll seems to wife mr alington let lunch at once be so hungry kindly ring bell just behind please mr alington sat still moment then rose with deliberation did not ring be lucky to find alone lady conybeare said for truth be there be little matter wanted to talk over with kit rose swiftly from seat before have finished sentence rang bell herself be answered immediately a man came into room indeed what be that said be lunch ready poole let go in mr alington be always so hungry in london elsewhere kit must scarcely help smiling a spoke have intention whatever of talking little matter over with mr alington especially if be one have in mind must not help feeling amused by simplicity of mean by have put stopper on possibility of private talk wished to hold private communication with man have done part in launching for convenience of jack have given to understand rather given other people to understand that be ami de la maison washed hand of be very kindly going to make jack fortune in return for benefit received have distinctly said that arrangement be one of mutual advantage be give take be on same level a grocer bootmaker except tradesman gave in hope of eventually taking while mr alington took a went along at best be sort of cash down shop kit did not habitually deal with such did not consider dangerous be so well pleased with own adroitness that very unwisely determined to drive advantage home so a followed through folding door into dining room what be little matter referred to asked again feeling perfectly secure in presence of servant in room mr alington closed eye for moment before took seat murmured brief grace to opened moment afterwards with short sigh kit riposte to thrust did not seem to have ruffled disconcerted in least broad butler like face be a serene a ever be matter thought might have preferred to discus alone said a seem to wish will tell here other night when have pleasure of playing baccarat with won on natural flush of anger rose to kit face man be intolerable insolent before servant too a spoke felt sudden fear of looked full in face with mild firmness breaking toast with one hand while with other manipulated macaroni on end of fork stop said kit quick a curl of whiplash mr alington did not wince will be so kind then a to give opportunity of speaking to privately about said be quite of way of thinking be far better discussed so quite see kit felt trembling be not accustomed to such bland brutality at hand of anyone must have be scarcely more surprised if stationer butcher have suddenly appeared in room urged propriety of private talk alington be true have be to house have right to consider guest that made even more intolerable apparently have idea of distinction between guest guest must be shocking thing if be overlooked meantime went on eating macaroni with superb mastery over elusive provender in silence since kit did not reply dining room be one of most charming room in london rather dark a dining room must be wall of sober tint green bare for half dozen small picture of barbizon school if alienable must long ago have be alienated to supply chronic scarcity of money in conybeare establishment be wonderful example kit hated since must not be sold make feel like man on desert island with million of gold sovereign food have said once chair be armed upholstered in green brocade thick ispahan carpet made noiseless foot of who stand wait partly partly distraction of thought brought about red mullet be at kit elbow full ten second unperceived must not make up mind what to do bitterly repented having said stop just now to alington for vehemence of interjection gave away have practically admitted that something have occurred on night played baccarat earnestly desired not to have discussed in public fool must have seen with distaste for man did not put label to with odiously familiar deference have agreed with have assumed right of discussing thing with in private again must not quarrel with conybeare application to business early visit to city frequent conference with alington unexampled preoccupation showed for certain that there be great issue at stake for must not give such trouble for few five pound note passed through mind very rapidly at end of ten second leaned back in chair saw red mullet took two of yes be quite right said will talk of afterwards ah here be jack morning jack jack nodded to alington took seat have heard news kit asked lot toby be engaged to miss croesum told in train morning be coming to see afternoon kit for moment forgot other worry oh how delightful cried dear toby lily be most charming so pretty do know mr alington have met at house think heiress be not believe have little money said kit one have heard people say so mere gossip perhaps jack laughed low noiselessly will be so pleasant for toby observed if be true kit sighed what pity that be not custom for bride to settle money on husband brother jack said yes give in order to escape death duty what opportunity for unusual kindness people have well be charming anyhow said kit noticed went for stroll in punt yesterday afternoon thought promising punt be so often matrimonial agency be afraid of tipping up like ordinary boat proposed to in racing pair something skittish do remember jack said 'd do anything in world if must only row straight to shore kept to hardly fair be mr alington mr alington smiled like elderly clergyman at school feast smile be suggestive of liking to see young people happy wonder matrimonial news doe keep few punt for use of client went on kit in nervous anxiety to get lunch over a quickly a possible have made up mind about alington in last half minute so be desirous of getting word with intention being to deny charge point blank in turn accuse punt evening hymn do wonder with people who ca quite make up mind to propose mr alington looked mildly interested at surprising information appeared to be weighing carefully a ate quail before giving support might keep small choir harmonium a well went on kit believe respectable middle class go to evening church on sunday sing hymn very loud out of one book propose to other afterwards dear toby how happy will be how nice how exceedingly nice murmured sympathetically alington kit have by time finished lunch rose ca stop see eat jack said come mr alington will go have coffee jack will join on hot july day kit often sat in inner hall be cooler than drawing room be charming place of palm parquetry with furniture at angle general atmosphere of coolness sequestered corner coffee came immediately with cigarette kit took one mr alington however explained that except on sunday did not allow to smoke till after dinner find little abstinence very helpful gave a modest excuse servant withdrew kit began playing with subject be afraid thought very abrupt at lunch said have great objection to discussing matter be conceivable might be better kept private before servant when mentioned baccarat thought better to stop even at risk of seeming very brusque will hardly believe mr alington here voice sank to low confidential murmur will hardly believe only few week ago saw man cheat at baccarat at friend house very distressing be not talked over with friend found most difficult to decide what to do sort of thing might so easily get about be so dangerous to speak before servant think talked over with lady haslemere remarked mr alington kit be stirring coffee smiling sweetly be getting on beautifully at word peculiarly calm delivery hand stopped stirring smile faded think also agreed to ask suspect to play again in order to watch went on impassive butler be not so lady conybeare think suspect be none other than kit put down coffee cup leaned back in chair thing have gone wrong have meant to have got first inning on subject of baccarat cheating be rather afraid be clean bowled quick a be must not see answer mr alington did not however look at did pause longer than be necessary to sip coffee tactic be little open little obvious lady conybeare if will allow to say so went on delicious coffee exchanged so many glance with lady haslemere then looked up at must not fail to see be watching for something man expect like to be suspected of so very paltry crime a cheating at baccarat crime so hopelessly void of grandeur man be sure like trap being laid for by whom be entitled to consider friend before go on to point have in mind must like to say word about cleared throat sipped coffee again what lady haslemere saw went on did husband suspect too doe not matter what saw be have declared natural saw a thought push fifty pound counter over line be that not so there be question of 'thought said kit whom sense of danger made more incautious saw do quite true if have observed little more closely must have seen something else now ask few time have played baccarat together did ever see fail to stake not to knowledge quite so if have looked at table moment before must have seen have nothing staked what happened be have staked four ten pound counter two five then seeing that have more smaller one withdrew to substitute one fifty for at moment received card taking up forgot for moment to substitute fifty looked at card declared natural saw push forward fifty pound counter quite openly so thought clumsily never occurred to for moment there be need of explanation kit anger alarm be growing on very clumsily said saw be stupid of doubt not to have explained at time said really have idea company be so suspicious paused for moment mild temper be roused at thought of kit behaviour perhaps people be right to be suspicious added with raised intonation shot went home kit face grew shade paler must not conceivably show that knew what meant for must be to accuse instead put insolence voice must hold into reply what proof have of truth of what say asked fighting desperately on battle ground of adversary choosing fact that say said mr alington also there be corroborative evidence if choose to adduce showed other night meaning merely to give hint have wanted must have cheated very neatly be credible then even supposing that be one of people who cheat must have done so clumsily kit in heart believed man superficial woman cunning refused to give up hold still hoped might have over only answer to hold be afraid have over make blunder at time said in most fiendish manner unfortunately believe what say mr alington sipped coffee again momentary irritation have quite died down must not have found kinder christian in england fortunately however that matter very little replied doe not make man popular among observed kit if be known to cheat at baccarat understood other night to say that sort of thing be common in australia must advise to remember that think differently here kit have lost temper completely did not stop to weigh word worse than lost head lashed out insult with foolish defiance mr alington crossed one leg over other mouth grew shade more compressed precise large pale eye turned suddenly unluminous stale like snake kit grew frightened again when woman be frightened a well a angry be not likely to score off perfectly cool man there be moment pause lady conybeare said at length have chosen to treat a knave a fool dislike very much being treated a knave fool by accuse of cheating have reason to believe doe not seem to very shocking may ask why interrupted kit mr alington held up hand a if to deprecate reply just now accuse of cheating clumsily foolishly continued can really think must be so tragic as a to come to with mere assertion did not cheat have given chance to believe of own free will have regret to say refused will now force to believe force repeated thoughtfully have witness person then present who saw withdraw smaller counter replace larger kit laughed uneasily how very convenient said what be name lord abbotsworthy remarked alington even took precaution of calling attention to what have done be lucky did ask lord abbotsworthy one of director said kit almost beside with anger rising from chair one of director a say replied friend need hardly remind that husband be of director on moment jack came out of dining room cast one glance at kit face took cigarette strolled discreetly upstairs when wife be on war path have not asked alliance did not give will be upstairs when wife have finished talk said over shoulder to alington come see before go pause sobered kit yes continued alington have moment before asked to change money for small counter left with only few small one luckily will remember seeing withdraw substitute stake lady haslemere must have be wise to consult before taking somewhat questionable step of watching fault of judgment mere fault of judgment kit figuratively speaking threw up hand desperate hope that alington be lying be longer tenable await apology added there be long silence kit be not accustomed to apologize to anybody for anything indifference to man except in so far a must financially serve have undergone startling transformation in last hour indifference have given place first to anger at insolence then to fear placid serene face have become to image of infernal juggernaut whose car rolled on over body of men yet whose eyelash never quivered pride battled with fear in mind fury with prudence juggernaut butler no longer contrary to ascetic habit lit cigarette well said when judged that pause be sufficiently prolonged kit have sat down again in chair be conscious only of two thing inward struggle absorbing hatred of man seated opposite supposing refuse to apologize asked at length will regret very much said probably will regret more come lady conybeare by what right do make enemy of again there be silence kit knew very well how everyone must talk if detestable business became public understood to be threat contained in alington word knew also that rupture between jack must inevitably follow must not be likely to lead to financial success in business of mine will require also to tell lady haslemere husband if also have at time suspected into what deplorable error have fallen continued alington dropping out word a drop strong drug into graduated glass careful to give neither too much too little suddenly kit made up mind having done that determined to act with best possible grace apologize mr alington said apologize sincerely wronged abominably will do in point a suggest mr alington did not move muscle accept apology said please do favour not to treat like fool again for be far from being fool speech be not easy swallowing for kit have to take what threw alington got up have to go upstairs to see husband said because have good deal of business share of new group will be on market in few day paused moment give thought to matter lady conybeare said be much better must be friend ah by way regarding that matter on meant to speak to that unfortunate affair of hundred pound counter know what mean give thought to assure that will not be through that go further fully believe never meant only did not correct mistake instantaneously so correction became impossible be not so broad face brightened beamed like face of father speaking lovingly consolingly to son about petty fault held out hand to kit wavered must have given anything in world to say what affair of hundred pound counter know what mean must not be physically perhaps morally incapable of giving word utterance alington have made afraid be beaten cowed accuracy of intuition astounded then gave hand have word for on subject good bye said au revoir

not to tell of people at cottage that be coming have said that be wrong sort of precaution to take must be sure to know failure in secrecy be ghastly failure so difficult to explain afterwards for

say there be long silence toby drew vile briar pipe out of pocket noticed that lord comber even in growing agitation cast agonized glance towards putting back in pocket lit cigarette like pipe think said forgot for moment toby sat down again in big chair smoked placidly intended to get answer if be unsatisfactory if worm turned refused to go must have to consider whether must must not telegraph to jack felt that must be extreme step hoped must not have to take lord comber reflection be not enviable to begin with toby have most uncomfortable angular mind attitude towards life will not consent to be fitted into round hole adapt to nice easy compromise tactful smoothings over of difficult place be elbow mentally considered elbow unbending joint if intended to carry point must not meet one half way held horrible threat over one head if defied might easily carry out own argument considered excellent to telegraph to jack implied that there be something to telegraph about square freckled brute must not must not see really be too exasperating conducted own life so largely by employment of tact finesse diplomacy toby must have called lie that be most disconcerting to find in conflict with someone who not only did not employ refused to recognise a legitimate weapon indeed be in dilemma be impossible to contemplate telegram being sent to jack be equally impossible to contemplate what must happen if kit came found gone annoyance of going of missing week with be immense gave sort of cachet to be seen staying with kit alone at watering place be more indisputably than ever on sort of pinnacle in world year everyone must think so very daring be sort of fame really coveted to be in world eye doing rather risky thing with extremely smart woman moreover in selfish superficial way be very fond of be always amusing always ready to be amused laughed chattered continually when be alone week with be sure to be excessively entertaining week have proposed that must do herself written charming note kept will be quite alone wo speak to soul have said that from kit who a rule demanded hundred thousand people around about be immense compliment because thought a debated thing while toby sat smoking be quite contemptible struggle be le difficult despicable man in dilemma though motif consideration compose that dilemma be tawdry ignoble doe not suffer le than fine spirit if anything more for have sustaining sense of duty to guide reward ted comber happiness pleasure in life of have great deal be chiefly composed of trivial unedifying ingredient to be intimate not only privately also publicly with kit be one of unutterable brother in law sat smoking in best armchair after presenting ultimatum if word from must have sent toby to siberia must have gone must be good deed to rid society of such outrage again yielding with bad grace have disadvantage for though have personal liking for toby great many people with whom desired to be on best of term have there be certain house to liked to go where toby be eminently at home though have enemy in plenty thought little about toby must be most undesirable addition to be perfectly capable of turning back on one assigning reason of behaving with brusqueness ought so lord comber thought to be sufficient to ensure anybody being turned neck crop out of well cushioned society chariot in lounged knew very well cursed unfairness of fate that toby social position be far firmer than own while whereas cared very much for toby did not care at ted made welcome because took great pain to be pleasant to amuse people have always quantity of naughty little story have to be whispered very quietly then laughed over very loud whole affair be effort though reward be worthy men knew for most part disliked men be so terribly unreasonable once last year only name have be cut out of house party by hostess absurd husband be not well to multiply occasion for such untoward possibility took up gold topped scent bottle for third time by effort almost heroic though there be so little heroic in cause resumed frank unresentful manner disagree with utterly toby said will do a suggest mind speaking straight out what think well seem to to have interfered in most unwarrantable manner a have done so dare say from excellent motif though care straw about motif must make best of will go to morrow morning will telegraph now to kit to say ca stop here now said did wish to quarrel with that hold to let remain friend toby for if anyone have grievance be what will say to kit god know will be furious if thing come out will tell whole truth lay whole blame on toby rose be only fair said good bye lord comber smoothed hair before glass when suddenly idea struck so brilliant so simple that must hardly help smiling opened door will just walk with to top of stair said again taking toby arm really be quite sorry to leave have got quite attached to dear little room think be rather pretty so sorry sha be able to come see mother at cottage be fault good bye toby toby went downstairs lord comber hurried back to room have no longer smallest resentment against toby smile of amused satisfaction testified to changed sentiment rang for man sat down to write telegram be addressed to kit ran a follows impossible to remain here excellent reason do come to aldeburgh instead arrive there to morrow afternoon go to hotel read over poor toby thought to what lesson not to interfere chapter xiv chairman director during beautiful august weather mr alington be very busily employed in london at time be notable lover of country taking in homoeopathic dos only enjoying copy of nature by turner far more than original thing be indeed somewhat disposed to dr johnson characteristic superficial heresy one green field be like green field though took walk for pleasure down fleet street took many hansom to broker for business for financial scheme have darted like meteor across augur brain on night on received manager report have meteor like left shining golden furrow shining furrow indeed have grown ever more brilliant golden illumined whole of speculative heaven by end of month reading of augur be ready to be practically fulfilled now stock exchange be justly unjustly supposed to be place where sharp shady deed be done mr alington already prince in financial world did not much fear bear bull raid rigging market have firm belief in soundness board consisted of jack conybeare tom abbotsworthy australian manager mr linkwood man a hard headed a teak at time board constituted on such line be new thing when prospectus be sent out there be many business men who rather raised eyebrow at effect on whole be precisely what mr alington have desired indeed anticipated surely name of couple of nobleman one of whom be prominent supporter of bishop in house of lord whose wife be really synonymous with word bazaar opener other prospective duke be guarantee of good faith of proceeding british public might not be aware that lord conybeare knew much about mine department be well looked after by mr alington manager a shrewd pair a must be found between pole certainly innovation a be sort of board so reasoned inventor looked well british public followed prognostication of alington with touching fidelity though did not give jack credit for ignorance about mining such authority on guano must certainly be well informed man if of aristocracy who be in indigent circumstance be sensible enough to set to make little money who must quarrel with three acre gold mine be just about what jack be worth again enemy of unearned increment be delighted here be fine example horny handed marquis third section of public so small however a not to really have voice at who consisted chiefly of conybeare acquaintance sounded discordant note god help shareholder said prospectus gave glowing perfectly honest account of property called carmel group for one knew better than alington how excellent policy honesty be in moderation in right place mount carmel lay in centre on one diagonal carmel north south on other carmel east west very rich vein of ore ran through carmel north mount carmel carmel south extending on evidence of bore hole whole length of three carmel east west be outlier from main reef in there be good deal of surface gold very easy to get at must soon become dividend payer ore in two however be much more refractory than in main reef in two three experiment have be made have be found possible to extract only per cent of in other three ore be very different in quality very rich experiment have yielded five ounce to ton mine must not become dividend payer in immediate future a good deal of developing work must necessarily be put through first at one point by curious fault in stratum reef came to surface be from here specimen have be taken there be now difficulty about water for very satisfactory arrangement have be come to with neighbouring property mill of hundred stamp must soon be increased if mine developed a well a director have reason to believe must be now in course of erection on carmel east finally wished to draw special attention to remarkable yield of five ounce to ton from vein running through carmel north other two result spoke for director proposed to put property on market in following manner two company be offered for subscription one owning carmel east west other north south central mine two group must respectively be called carmel east west carmel vendor mr alington received fifty thousand pound down fifty thousand pound worth of share rest of share after certain allotment made to director be thrown open to public subscription capital to be subscribed for be three hundred thousand pound in carmel east west five hundred thousand pound in carmel crown be to be paid on application crown on allotment remaining fifteen shilling for special settlement at not le time than two month cheque to be paid into carmel company limited at account with lloyd prospectus be quietly favourably received public a mr alington have seen be nearly ready to go mad about west australian gold be not ill pleased that madness did not rise to raving point at once new group fully believed be genuine paying concern be to say supposing have floated one company embracing mine company be judiciously honestly managed shareholder must be sure of large dividend for considerable number of year scheme have formed did not have a end object large dividend for considerable number of year though did not object to a such quiet favourable reception of prospectus pleased greatly very much valued reputation of steady shrewd man must not have suited plan nearly so well if one other group have gone booming up immediately whole of capital be very soon subscribed large purchase two have be made from australia looked well for company showed that on spot carmel group be well thought of friend of mr alington whom often spoke of a one of acutest men knew mr richard chavasse be one of large holder gave great deal of satisfaction so told jack be down at kit cottage in buckinghamshire on first sunday in september alone with lord conybeare have good talk over prospect of mine collateral subject jack got on excellently alone be already in dear conybeare alington stage must not be better pleased with reception market have given to carmel group said alington see have followed advice dear conybeare invested largely in east west company jack be lounging in long chair in smoking room morning be hopelessly wet violent scudding rain beat tattooes on window scourged glory from garden yes have paid ten thousand half crown twice said even half crown mount up used to think nothing of have followed advice to letter can no more pay special settlement than can fly be quite right said alington assure there will not be slightest need for by way stock exchange have given special settlement at mid october account dear what opportunity poor lord abbotsworthy have missed must not take advice even now share be at slight premium have invested in fact larger half of first year salary exactly by way want salary to be printed very large in balance sheet put in sequestered corner periphrase will people wo like know whole concern will be discredited be so prejudiced that also need not trouble said alington in fact have paid salary doe not appear at in balance sheet lord conybeare frowned do mean pay five thousand pound year out of own purse certainly service to be worth that pay most willingly shareholder undoubtedly must not do indeed dear conybeare benefit that name lord abbotsworthy yours particularly have done be immense british public be so aristocratic at heart at purse unless be day bankrupt assure be not in least likely one will ever know about remuneration know that altogether like said jack in what kit called scruple voice always irritated exceedingly child said once must give point to jack in dissimulation to alington also scruple voice did not seem thing to be taken very seriously really see that need concern said after usual pause in fact thought have settled to dismiss such matter for to manage a choose consented to be on board a business matter be quite willing to give sum in return for service now shareholder must not think rate at figure shareholder know nothing about business do jack laughed how unappreciated have be year said think will put advertisement in time blameless marquis be willing to be director of anything for suitable remuneration mr alington held up hand gesture frequent with ah must object to very strongly said consider remuneration retaining fee if like must keep director exclusive can not have joining threepenny concern may be going about indeed concern at carmel belong to carmel said thoughtfully jack took copy of mining weekly from table have seen asked there be column about carmel mine most favourable written must say by someone who know mr alington did not appear particularly interested be glad have put in week said promised to make effort have seen think be good wrote practically at least wrote city editor at rate be kind enough to write under suggestion might say under dictation one ca have too many friend observed conybeare well can hardly call friend never set eye on till two day ago then be more enemy called tried to blackmail dear alington what have be doing asked jack mr alington paused laughed gently tried to blackmail not because have be doing anything because have not done something because have not offered share in fact squared that very easily paid asked jack of course be comparatively cheap became like balaam came to curse went away blessing mine australia with small cheque in pocket copious note for article to have be referring do mean to say that be liable to be called on by city editor made to give money not to crab mine asked jack incredulously well not by city editor said mr alington though wish be certainly by fair percentage be most convenient custom when one be doing thing a be on fairly large scale matter to very little whether pay mining weekly hundred pound so that article be worth far more to than just a dear conybeare be worth far more to than paltry sum give a director chairman mr alington spoke with silken blandness yet with under current of proprietorship a if be pupil teacher delivering address to school child be telling beautiful little story with moral see be surprised went on really there be nothing surprising about paper give opinion what matter whose mine editor editor probably know nothing about so be mine if small cheque change hand over opinion be concern of balance be worth while to pay appears to be worth editor while to accept only wish custom went further that one must go direct to time say ask what be price for column sometimes one can do mean with time be always little risky be very anxious for instance last week to get good notice of prospectus of ours in city journal did what be perhaps rather rash though turned out excellently mr metcalfe second editor be slightly known to know to be poor blessed with large family poor men so often be have son whom want to send to oxford mr alington paused again with look on face like embodied spirit of charity organization may be supposed to wear when hears of really deserving case jack listened quite attentively though long speech be apt to bore felt a if be learning business lad be charming young fellow went on charity organization clever too likely to get exhibition scholarship well asked father to call on offered two hundred pound for article a appears in mining weekly have in hand be indignant most indignant wondered how have face to make such offer said must not do what have suggested for twice money took rightly to mean that must gave four hundred pound will help very considerably a pointed out to in son expense at oxford went away after little further conversation with tear of gratitude in eye tear of gratitude dear conybeare two day afterwards there appeared in city journal very nice article if may say so considering wrote greater part of really very nice article about carmel be glad to help young fellow to give chance very glad told father so putting in exactly way mr alington sighed gently modestly at reminiscence like retiring man humbly thankful for opportunity of aiding in good work jack for moment be puzzled then remembering be dealing with man of business laughed thing be excellently recited with praiseworthy gravity stage have lost actor observed even if world have gained director admirable dear alington why why keep up with assure be not shocked mr alington looked up in surprise actor not shocked keep up queried understand be inimitable said jack mr alington got up understand said with certain warmth wrong from word that have doubt of sincerity by what right if please jack be grave in instant beg pardon said see be in wrong heat died out of mr alington face there be reproach in mild benignant eye kind christian gentleman looked gently at jack be granted willingly said please dear conybeare make such mistake in future let ask to assume that be sincere till have vaguest cause for supposing be not english law assumes man innocence till be proved guilty be ask treat a must treat suspect when have such cause please come to state much harm can be done by nursing suspicion by not trying to clear up harm will remember be nearly done to in way before luckily have opportunity of explaining error to lady conybeare jack have uncomfortable sense that man for blandness of respectability must show claw suspected that claw have be shown quite unmistakably to kit on occasion to mr alington so delicately alluded for have come upstairs after talk with in hall with distinct appearance of having be severely scratched mr alington only paused long enough to let bare justice of demand sink in let explain went on have suspected of insincerity luckily have stated suspicion with great frankness beyond reach of mistake be case wanted very much article by metcalfe in city journal when called that morning be prepared to pay a much a two hundred pound for not more eventually paid four hundred pound twice that sum partly doubt because be necessary that must not be able to say that have attempted to bribe must demand that believe that fact of thereby giving young fellow good chance made pay sum willingly did not haggle over though be perfectly certain must have got what wanted for le believe jack found saying that believed mr alington grew even more silken seraphic be delighted to do said in private account have entered two hundred fifty pound a cheque to metcalfe senior for business purpose one hundred fifty pound a charity be charity entered a such certainly must have made friend of metcalfe senior junior if only knew said jack yes be delighted to have done so have also incidentally made metcalfe senior confederate from business point of view that also plea how marvellously thing work together for good come in morning lesson to day jack felt difficult to know what decorum demanded of bribing morning lesson in one breath be little hard to reconcile if have assumed stated that believe man to be actor if assures be not beg pardon must be understood that accept bona fides at rate have to appear to do so jack who did not consider more than amateur found task difficult under eye of one who be capable of such astonishing histrionic feat who must act so containedly before scenery sceptical audience unctuous voice quoting lesson for day be miracle miracle like of barren fig tree seemed so unnecessary however everyone have inalienable right to pose be point of good manner to assume that nobody exercise mr alington rose with sort of soft alacrity walked across to window sheet of rain be still flung against streaming pane glory of garden be battered beaten thick vapour half steam half mist rose from water of river warmed by summer travel careful eye detected break on horizon will have fine afternoon said to jack with leave therefore will get prospectus for will be glad to run over few point with jack looked out over drenched landscape bet sovereign doe not clear said mr alington took little green morocco note book from pocket done dear fellow said will just record will certainly lose must have given two to one if have asked left room in few minute returned with sheaf of paper now if will give attention for hour so said will tell that a director need know a shareholder asked jack mr alington rattled gold pencil case between teeth felt disposed to trust chairman good long way ignoring scruple voice yes will tell also said keep two well apart dear conybeare chapter xv week by sea toby thought wise to call at link hotel on morning following interview with lord comber to make sure of result of interference while buck waited grinned in garden of wanted to bet that worm have kept word gone be willing to lay odds on thus wager be possible toby face be agape with smile when came back laughed for full minute behind laurel bush be satisfactory everybody be pleased be not least unlikely that lord comber at moment be laughing too have heard from kit same evening in reply to telegram that must start for aldeburgh not stanborough next morning

outside world be shrouded made dizzy in trouble of eddying snow a great sonorous blast trumpeted lulled again red of fire must brighten fade in sort of mysterious sympathy with bugling riot overhead that kit must be doing nothing looking at fire be unusual thing be odd that must be alone even odder that if alone must not be occupied toe of bronze coloured shoe rested on fender leaned forward in low armchair in sat stretching out hand towards heat fire shining through flesh of finger made look a if be lighted from within thing red luminous in be already growing dusk have enough light to think by quite enough thing to think about room be furnished with great simplicity educated eye must see how extremely expensive such simplicity must have be there be rug two on floor few table chair of empire on rug few picture on crimson satin wall kit perhaps be most expensive thing present for wore pearl glowed like mist smoored moon in fire light did not look a happy a possessor of pearl excellent digestion ought to look there be something of hard tired look of suffering mental physical about face though be alone made now then nervous apprehensive little movement everything be going wrong from money upwards downwards for at present moment kit hardly knew how to arrange precedence of various embarrassment financial one be at rate most tangible though perhaps least feared for fiftieth time afternoon ran over in beginning have be altogether jack fault kit be past finding consolation added annoyance in have great faith in alington power of making fortune though personally be detestable to for various excellent reason have wanted to invest famous nest egg from one cause have grown to upwards of three thousand pound in mine under alington advice after last private interview did not like to go to straight so asked jack to tell in what mine to place little money have saved word saved when used by kit always made jack smile be absurd strongly opposed to risking saving at have told to make quite happy if must leave thing to go on saving quietly there must be enough for of statement in repugnant almost blasphemous to kit who firmly held doctrine that there never can be enough money for one still le for two know what mean kit have said for matter one day perhaps share will go down will sell out in panic lose lot will not sell out will lose more be impossible for always to be instructing have not got data leave to alington besides did know have money to invest be affair said kit have be lucky lately then put into consols gamble more said jack with fine inconsistence of gambling fever on come talk about other time have got twenty hundred thing to do now then in flare of pride temper kit have determined to manage for herself have put couple of thousand pound into carmel east be in november at time when for reason known perhaps to alington certainly to one else in market carmel be behaving in peculiarly mercurial manner week after have made investment pound share be standing at little above par have declined rapidly to fourteen shilling might only be bear raid be too proud to ask jack for advice again remembering ill omened remark about not selling so losing more telegraphed to broker to sell out at once done share began to rise again in le than fortnight time owing to telegram report from mine stood at nearly two pound reckoned up almost with tear what have lost added to what might have gained formed maddening total eighteen hundred share if have only held on must have be worth close on three thousand six hundred pound instead have sold when stood at fourteen shilling for thirteen hundred pound when jack few morning later came into room with cheque for five hundred pound gave felt that only accentuated bitterness of little present kit said just for to play about with what good thing be wise did not concern with thing did not understand oh bless day when went down to city dinner met alington wore orange dress remember must be rather graceful if paid for now how much have made jack asked eight thousand wish be eighty be result of having capital be going to pay bill perhaps be very wearing kit be not accustomed to cry over spilt milk jack present made up greater part of what have actually lost though be only small proportion of what might have gained one learns by experience thought for experience be synonym for one mistake have be consummate fool to be frightened mine be still quite young if within few month share be worth double original value be likely to be good investment even at present price again invested two thousand pound in since then price have steadily gone down share be quoted week ago at nineteen shilling time though taxed admirable nerve be not going to be frightened with object of averaging have spent remaining spoonful of nest egg in buying more thus reducing whole price to thirty two shilling per share thus when again went up a still believed must do must sell a soon a touched two pound a jack have sold clear though not so much a have done still something worth having averaging have be singularly unsuccessful morning abominable thing have stood again at fourteen shilling have be too much for kit nerve went to jack with whole story have simply shrugged shoulder be odiously unsympathetic told so rejoinder be always irritating irritation produce varies directly according to amount of damage involved kit irritation follows be considerable oh jack what be use of saying that have cried angrily come to be helped not to be moralized to ask now a favour to telegraph to mr alington say know nothing about thing although be director well perhaps doe want money be not wise kit knew even a spoke to take fretful discourteous tone have long be maxim with that courtesy be duty greatest perhaps one owned to with whom one be intimate that be most foolish to let familiarity breed brusqueness besides never paid except with tradesman others to put nose in air a rule be not guilty of breach of prudence to day be horribly worried anxious about many thing jack must say told so seemed unbearable did not reply immediately then taking cigarette from table near usually do want money remarked kit made great effort recovered temper self control dear jack said have be rude apologize very seldom be rude do justice to admit that also have be stupid foolish be in awful hole do telegraph to alington like good boy ask what be to do must really be very glad of little money if can spare jack looked at curiously be utterly unlike kit to behave like debt hitherto have sat lightly on have often said that nothing be so nice a having money nothing so easy a to get along without again kit nest egg of three thousand pound seemed to surprising sum have not a far a knew played much in summer autumn except for fortnight spent at aldeburgh have be together winning certainly must not have be fifth of that must not conceive how have got look here kit said will have money if must though just now want literally penny can lay hand on for mine affair be playing for big stake if thing come off a expect what be much more satisfactory a alington expects will be rich when say rich mean lot think have better have talk oh will telegraph to alington about affair at once kit felt wretchedly nervous upset that morning while jack wrote telegram threw into chair stood before fire lit cigarette hoping to soothe jangled nerve snow have already begun to fall air be biting shivered after few whiff threw cigarette away tasted evilly in mouth felt undefined dread of what be coming not in least inclined for talk luckily jack be going up to town in hour talk must not last long waited till servant have taken telegram then came stood in front of fire how did get three thousand pound asked abruptly won have told so said kit where when be large sum know kit often pry into affair be angry with dear jack keep book with name address of people from whom have won sixpence neither of if come to be famed for well kept account book where at hundred place when last summer autumn voice died little on word jack turned flicked ash off cigarette knew that kit must not have won amount hated to think that be lying to true be asking sort of question did not ask other must not help air be ominous must have borrowed be given suspicion cut to quick for though like did not give two thought to running up huge bill at tradesman risk yet be quite different thing to borrow from one own class for knew rightly that kit must never be so foolish a to go to money lender to be given money by one friend manner be so strange must not avoid thought that there be something behind did alice haslemere lend asked suddenly kit taken off guard saw gleam of hope yes said quickly not meaning to lie then remembering have told that have won added in same breath jack made quick step back to table at have be writing there be manner of use in talking if ca tell truth said how much money do want kit kit tried to answer must not be only conscious of great desolating helplessness slowly sob gathered in throat jack waiting for answer heard quick taken breath in moment be by best of ready to help if possible forgetting everything except kit be in trouble poor old girl said what be matter be there something wrong kit wo tell indeed be friend cry so never mind tell other time if like there will leave will be better alone kit nodded head touched lightly kindly on shoulder turned to go before have got to door spoke be nothing jack said controlling voice with effort be out of sort think never mind about money can push along got up from chair went towards door worry jack said went to own room where knew that one must disturb shut in jack must be away day till evening must be alone few people be coming down with then from town among toby wife ted comber several others of set on whole be glad be coming be better to be distracted than to brood over thing brooding will

dining room have tried dozen way of making hour pas be impossible to go out snow have begun before jack have left be getting momently thicker falling in giddy frenzied wreath air be bitterly cold must see dimly through whirling atmosphere line of shrub in garden standing with thick white mantle on couple of puffy feathered sparrow crouched on window sill kit in bitterness of heart hated going to window frightened away dropped stiffly down on lawn below half walked half fluttered to shelter of bush near then sudden compunction came over throwing open window flung out crumb from lunch tray sudden movement only scared off altogether stood long at window looking out on to blinding desolation then by violent effort detached for moment from thing troubled must have to be taken dealt with must hing alone jack have to be told something jack electric light be out of order about quarter past three of howling winter afternoon left place by fire unread book rang for lamp then there be order also to be sent to stable detained man minute to give knowing that when have gone must be alone again omnibus brougham must meet train horse must be roughed be there telegram for lordship one have

astonishing ever increasing vehemence line must be deep in snow perhaps almost impassable in case train must bring jack rest must be late kit felt that element snow storm be malignant being fighting

kit knew to loss alington jack following advice to gain way in have be worked be simplicity share have be issued at par have risen almost immediately to twenty five shilling alington be disposed to put down partly to own reputation a result of report from mine chiefly for be modest even when alone to effect of noble body of director a vendor have fifty thousand share fully paid at point sold out unloading very carefully under several name taking very decent little profit for man of simple taste butler like appearance natural effect of extensive sale be to cause share to drop downward tendency be accelerated by unpromising news from mine followed immediately on sale ore a stated in prospectus be refractory extracting be costly yielded very small percentage of gold mr alington whom several large holder substantial city men consulted about time be not sanguine result be bad there be denying three week of dropping market brought share to condition be in on day of november on kit sold out for first time closed at thirteen ninepence seller fourteen threepence buyer seemed to alington to be low enough for second step a did not want market to lose confidence altogether sent telegram out to manager in australia mr linkwood laconic to intelligent fellow perfectly comprehensible new process alington ran also sent one to mr richard chavasse invest next morning received from mr linkwood following reply carmel east ninety per cent of gold extracted by buelow process strong support by australian market linkwood now evening before certain large purchase in carmel east have be made in england not by name under mr alington have previously unloaded for weakness of such course be obvious followed up next morning by very large purchase in own name by publication of telegram from mr linkwood also saw several business men to whom gave full explanation have telegraphed said with absolute truth to manager to try buelow process a saw have yielded admirable result instead of twenty got ninety per cent of gold out concerning strong support of australian market must doubt receive further news by cable have information later than telegram have published effect of on market already predisposed to go booming after westralians be natural inevitable share went up nearly half during day next morning when further private cable instantly made public recorded that shrewdest of financier mr richard chavasse have bought to extent of forty thousand pound ran past thirty shilling week later stood at two pound owing to steady support from private investor there be spurious report that dividend might be expected so extraordinary successful have month crushing proved to be be unfortunate moment selected by kit to make second purchase simultaneously alington who for week past have be very carefully unloading telegraphed to jack to do same sold out largely under own name week passed share moved slowly back depressed by large sale though there be still considerable demand for in england then came telegram from australia saying mine looked much le hopeful vein have be working so successfully for past two three month came suddenly to end owing to dip in stratum if struck again must probably be struck only at much deeper level must entail considerable development following on came large sale in australia mr richard chavasse in consequence of wire from england being among share went down to nineteen shilling then possibility of war between england france depressed still further subsided quietly to fourteen shilling where for mr alington at present cared be at liberty to remain thus closed first act of great deal leaving suspicious market such be position on sunday morning with regard to carmel east west when mr alington looked out on snow muffled street

anticipated event with precision of great general market have rushed like starving folk when granary be opened at carmel east west after have reached highest point big sale began there have followed something like panic west australian mine be still new to public greater financier viewed with suspicion sudden scare over carmel east west suited mr alington exactly for must be sure to bring down price of second carmel group namely north south central mine have seen six month ago have worked for very end at present have holding in mount carmel except share held to qualify a director have delayed purchase in till panic created by mercurial behaviour of sister group must have brought down price lower went better must be pleased for intended to make coup over compared to what have pocketed over carmel east west must be mere bagatelle for carmel required adventitious aid from marquis consequently sudden resignation of tom abbotsworthy from board event have taken place day before did not trouble at did care to know what cause regret to find press of work prevented covered mine knew be magnificent property quite able to stand on own foot in prospectus have purposely understated probable value in doing so be altogether free from possible censure mine have seemed to promising have said so when share be suitably low intended to buy must lay hand on purposely also have undercapitalized eventually meant to issue fresh share five hundred thousand pound already subscribed be not more than sufficient to work carmel north mount carmel carmel south of same group believed to be a remunerative a others panic over carmel east west have already affected other group yesterday evening one pound share after week decline stood at fifteen shilling proposed to let go down if kindly must till have sunk to ten shilling thereabouts then buy for be worth send telegram to mr richard chavasse to do same at thought of mr richard chavasse put thumb into armhole of waistcoat

be best described a creation here again a in so many of dealing of providence with man mr alington often marvelled to see working of thing together towards good in first instance there have not be wanting to forbearance to give mr richard chavasse over to police vague feeling of compassion at thought of deft shirt studding hand given over bleeding to oakum picking sewing of mail bag how amply be that sweet pity rewarded man bound to by fear be far safer repository for large sum of money amounting sometimes to forty fifty thousand pound over mr chavasse have control than someone over whom held such check must mr chavasse attempt to get off with money even so stringent be alington regulation for strict sober conduct of life leave colony wired word from to bank must place ex valet confession of complicity in burglary in hand of police alington in fact have speculated largely in chavasses have wit to see from beginning that more comfortable position gave more man of wealth mark made securer must be beggar with power of attorney may easily decamp with spoil possibly baffle pursuit for solid man interested in mine though slightly recluse exclusive be hardly possible to evade capture besides who in sens must not prefer to live delicately than to dodge detective certainly mr chavasse be completely in sens did not attempt escape what alington meant to do with after grand coup in carmels have not yet certainly determined in interval mr chavasse ex valet lived in house in melbourne rent free cost mr alington perhaps eighty pound month how admirable investment be that how small percentage of coinings for master did that eighty pound month represent already have often happened a in case of carmel east that alington in england wanted to run up price of mine strong

have hardly determined what to do must chavasse make so deplorable blunder doubt must be caught doubt identity must be proved must be landed in place of tread mill oakum picking there must be other revelation a well not touching chavasse however never seriously contemplated such possibility for did not believe that man must ever try to escape be comfortable where be comfortable people will think twice before risk prosecution for burglary alington be far too acute to think of frightening keeping continually cowering exasperation might drive to undesirable ruin instead gave very fair allowance

carmel must rise rainbow hued above ruck of other mine altogether position be good one for last six week have brought from manager most excellent private account of mine for most part have saved up till booming began mr linkwood also advised very strongly fresh issue of share have at present for instance only eighty stamp mill whereas at rate at be now getting gold out there be easily work for mill of hundred fifty two hundred stamp be on strong support in australia by convenient mr chavasse mr alington chiefly relied that at rate must be final touch intended first of to make large purchase of own in england ten thousand share at least immediately publish encouraging news from mine must preface a have so often done before by wire to mr richard chavasse in few hour must bring forth accustomed reply strong support in australia though must have preferred having somewhat larger sum at own disposal for grand coup have reason for wishing to start boom at once speculator have recovered from scare of carmel east west already before have moved in matter quotation for carmel have risen from lowest price of ten to eleven shilling up to sixteen be sufficient in opinion to show that public be already nibbling for professional operator knew be not entering market be correct moment to give fresh impetus there have be nineteen day account just before easter have made market dull since then have begun to show more vitality other reason also be be beginning for instance to be little nervous about immediate success of dealing in motor trade patent be floated into company in few instance only have share be well supported in more than one have incurred loss recoverable doubt in time even to man of mean be serious worse than if ill success continued must not be best thing for name be most anxious to get carmel really booming while prestige be still high again many fresh mine have be started in western australia since original flotation of carmel group financial sense led to distrust greater part of several have be grossly mismanaged from first grossly misrepresented others suspected did not exist at wished to hit psychological moment when speculator be ready a improvement in carmel share have shown to invest before have seen too much of west australian mine to make shy moment considered have come accordingly instructed broker to make own large purchase be ten day before settling day hoped to sell out again before ten day be passed have at first intended to purchase only ten thousand share going over scheme step by step being unable to see how be possible with combination of satisfactory news from mine own purchase mr chavasse strong support in australia that share must fail to rise decided to purchase five thousand share more than must pay for be humanly impossible that share must not rise consequently on thursday telegraphed out to manager to send long cablegram embodying private news have be receiving for two month back to broker made own purchase on friday morning same afternoon sent cipher telegram to mr chavasse telling to invest whole of capital then lying at melbourne bank in carmel in cipher to manager bidding wire strong support in australia thus in twenty four hour coup be made went back to passion music print to wait quietly for news of strong support in australia already in few hour after own purchase backed up a be with first of favourable report from mine share have risen three eighth effect on market therefore of australian support considered level headed man of business a be to be inevitable be dining out that evening with lord haslemere be disposed in anticipation to enjoy lady haslemere be true be apt to be tedious when talked about own transaction in city asked whether rise in mine of nobody have even heard be likely to continue be not clever of to have bought share at one half for within week have risen to two sixteenth got tip out of truth mr alington however have indifference of professional in money matter to scrannel operation of amateur when in answer to question of appeared that lady haslemere have only twenty share in marvellous mine have worked up into perfect fever of indecision a to whether must take certain eleven pound profit be very brave fly at fourteen felt really powerless to understand agitation evening directly after dinner collared cornered finance be in

lady devereux who played bach quite divinely be among lady haslemere guest even a left room to talk over hostess microscopic operation on stock exchange saw go across to piano be true that preferred very large round sum of money of own to hour of fugue prelude infinitely preferred hour of fugue prelude to about seven sixpence of lady haslemere be lit cigarette with tremulous hand want to ask advice very seriously said put three hundred pound into carmel week ago since then share have gone up half now what do advise to do mr alington will sell out not want to make such mess a poor dear kit did really be too stupid took one advice lost most frightfully poor thing have head little nest egg told mean to put completely into hand do expect carmel will go higher mr alington stroked back of head tried hard to look genial yet serious be difficult lady haslemere have closed door between next room must hear faintly regretfully divine melody on steinway grand here be esteemed lady who be quite a rich a anyone need be certainly so rich a to be normally unconscious of presence absence of fifty pound note consulting gravely have let cigarette go out in anxiety about infinitesimal affair if have have fortune at stake must willingly have given very best attention regretting only that lady devereux have chosen moment for playing bach to be shut off from exquisite treat for small sum affecting woman who be not affected by small sum be trying ca undertake to advise lady haslemere said can tell have done have bought twenty five thousand share in carmel to day have not faintest intention of selling out to morrow lady haslemere clasped hand be flash of lightning against night light good gracious be nervous cried must be able to eat sleep twenty five thousand have gone up three eighth to day why have scored over nine thousand pound since morning about if sold be to say mean to do so be going to chance mine going still higher certainly believe in also believe price will rise very considerably yet lady haslemere bit lip be clearly summoning up power of resolution mr alington for moment felt interested be a might have told bit of observer whether lady haslemere won eleven pound fourteen did not care at that must care so much be instructive then struck knee lightly with fan will not touch three hundred said turned on mr alington face portentous with purpose mr alington sat equally grave for moment corner of mouth lost sedateness at last broke out laughing oh know how ridiculous must seem to said lady haslemere if have never earned penny life have idea how extraordinarily interesting be to do so may think that ca matter to whether gain ten pound lose twenty to gain oh be thing mr alington smiled with peculiar indulgence well frankly be inexplicable to said now if be playing for large stake must understand though seldom get excited well be what be going to do be going to play for very big stake indeed confidently expect to turn up natural have anything more to ask for if not will allow will go listen to lady devereux have be so much looking forward to hearing play again lady haslemere rose have wanted to have general financial talk a well

never be great lover of country seemed to to day a if heavy accumulation of year have be lifted off disclosing capacity for enjoyment none perhaps least of have suspected must be gently censured in regard have made mistake in thus stifling shutting up so pure proper source of pleasure must certainly take to task for put under tuition of country sight sound have tea under twinkling shade of pine copse at end of lawn presently after mr alington again took straw hat with design of stroll in fresh cool of approaching evening other two lady preferred to enjoy in inaction waiting for arrival of adventurous slip carriage guest about whose fate mr murchison reiterated anxiety so mr alington secretly not ill pleased started alone be about half way down drive when met telegraph boy going towards house in expansive kindly manner detained moment with few simple question a to name age finally just a turned to walk on asked for whom be delivering telegram boy drawing out of pouch showed address mr alington opened slowly wondering a have often wondered before why envelope be orange paper pink be from broker very short looked for considerable time at eight word contained terrible panic in carmels share unnegotiable wire instruction at first read quite blankly seemed to that word though be simple plain enough conveyed nothing to mind then suddenly huge intense light hot dazzling beyond description appeared to have be uncovered somewhere in brain word burned blinded let pink paper fall bowing sidling on gravel of drive then stooped down with curious groping manner picked up again put neatly back inside envelope asked boy for form on scribbled few word hing wrote will come up immediately gave boy shilling waving away change then going to grassy bank bounded drive sat down except for moment when brain doubt instantaneously stunned refused to tell meaning of word have be absolutely composed alert telegram gave hint a to cause of panic without casting about for other possibility put down at once to one weak point mr chavasse determined gave further thought wondered idly without much interest what felt be beyond have idea what felt except that be conscious of slight qualm of sickness so slight so purely physical to seeming that must naturally have put down have not appeared simultaneously with news to small error of diet otherwise brain though perfectly clear capable of receiving accurate impression be blank there be whisper of fir tree round little point of sunlight flickered on yellow gravel of drive a branch stirred in wind lady haslemere be voice sounded thin high from lawn near have always remarked unpleasant shrillness of tone straw hat have fallen off be conscious of dismay agony of regret that have not sold out two hour ago sense of disaster sat there five minute at outside then went back to lawn lady looked up in surprise at quickness of return marked change in sleek feature uncertainty in step voice too when spoke be neither hurried unsteady differently modulated mr murchison said have just received worst news about about venture of mine be of importance in fact there have be fear great panic on stock exchange over carmel may be driven back to station at once be necessary must return to london be great regret to to miss visit lady haslemere congratulate on promptitude in selling stood there bland respectable for moment while mr murchison murmured incoherent sympathy surprised at extraordinary ease with polite commonplace rose to lip courteous necessary word seemed to speak without direction from blow have fallen upon must thought have descended internally for surface behaviour seemed a equable a ever be conscious only of continuance of qualm of sickness of little uncertainty in movement action have intended for instance a far a intended anything to go away a soon a have said good bye wait for carriage alone found lingering foot did not take away wondered why straw hat be in hand fanned with though did not feel hot perceiving yet still holding stopped fanning bit rim gently then aware that be doing that put on again so good bye said for second time ah lady haslemere asked for tip well if panic be really serious have doubt be buy carmels at lower price for be worth if have nerve assure that can not find better investment good bye good bye again perhaps oh doe signify may order carriage then mr murchison thank so much lifted hat turned went to house chapter ix slump london evening paper day be full of extraordinary scene have taken place on stock exchange before opening of market that morning carmel have be eagerly inquired for owing to activity produced by very extensive purchase on day before hour before mid day news have be cabled from australia that there be very strong support in market there for same mr richard chavasse alone having purchased fifty thousand pound worth of share closely following on came news from mine last crushing have yielded five ounce to ton new unsuspected reef have be struck combination of cause led to one of most remarkable rise in price ever known market so said one correspondent completely lost head practically business be done except by mining broker share day have started little above thirty shilling by four o'clock have reached astounding figure of l s d well known broker who have be interviewed on subject said that never in course of long experience have known anything like sober steady dealer in own word went screaming raving mad boom in westralian gold be true have long be expected nothing must account for extraordinary demand doubt fact that mr alington have purchased largely day before have prepared way for for be considered among mining operator one certain man to follow sequel to unparalleled rise be even more remarkable buying a have be stated be much stimulated by news of strong support in australia indeed be have be signal for rush about four o'clock when share be at highest considerable realization be being made though buying still went on sudden uneasiness be manifested be due to fact that telegram announcing strong support in australia be contradicted by later one saying that market in carmel be absolutely inactive upon first general distrust of telegram from mine be manifested then literally in few minute panic set in a unaccountable a previous rise business came to standstill for in hour everyone be wanting to sell carmel buyer must not be found few of heaviest plunger cleared out with thousand to credit majority of holder be caught share became simply unnegotiable market closed on scene of wildest confusion when exchange be shut street became impassable to late hour mob of excited jobber continued trying to sell just before going to press came report mr alington who have left town day suddenly returned be picking up share must lay hand on at purely nominal figure settling day must be remembered occurred next week committee of stock exchange be going to investigate matter of false telegram kit jack have come down to goring day to join toby wife there kit be steadily gaining strength evening being little tired have gone to bed before dinner now dinner being just over lily have left others to see how be jack toby be given to sitting over wine a soon a lily went upstairs removed into hall to smoke evening paper have just come in jack took up with eagerness for stake in carmel be large one read through account of what have taken place quite quietly leaned back in chair thinking unlike lady haslemere few night ago did not let cigarette go out at length spoke expect have gone smash toby said threw over paper read account of what happened to day on stock exchange added toby did not reply took paper only thing to be thankful for be did sell out just before panic remarked jack toby read on in silence till have finished why asked because must look a if have known that first telegram be false what extraordinary nerve alington must have do see that have be buying share can lay hand on understand about first telegram said toby do thank god supposing be real smash will have lost much jack eight thousand pound more than indeed unless price go up again before settling day for have only paid for about share toby be silent moment wondering how jack have ever have eight thousand pound to invest of late year latter understood silence acknowledged justice of difficulty made three thousand over carmel east west explained that with year salary a director make eight invested bought more toby looked up did that fellow give five thousand year a director asked that fellow did toby whistled committee of stock exchange be going to investigate whole affair appears said wo that be rather unpleasant if get into salary exceedingly mind let kit know toby until one have more certain news took turn up down room in silence extremely annoying said with laudable moderation ca imagine what have happened who be responsible for first telegram alington can not have caused to be sent merely to make market active for be certain to be contradicted man came into room with telegram on salver handed to jack reply paid lord said jack turned over in hand without opening unable to make effort then suddenly tore open unfolded thin pink sheet be from alington can meet to morrow morning at room st james street ran scribbled affirmative gave back to man will have to go up to morrow said to toby alington want to meet in london will go of course what blessing one be gentleman doe scream sweat now not word to anyone may not be a bad a look jack started off early next morning drove straight to alington room sound of piano playing came from upstairs somehow gave sense of relief people in extremis play piano said to a mounted stair alington got up a soon a came in be glad be able to come said be expedient necessary almost must see have happened asked jack mr alington took telegram from pocket handed to unexpected always doe in fact jack took read chavasse left for england by p o yesterday understand dear conybeare do said be very short story quite little romance in way in few word told jack story of burglary chavasse confession idea of using a independent operator in australia make doubt what have occurred said man have drawn out somewhat considerable balance left at melbourne for to invest when ordered have taken off with have also expect got hold of own confession clever rogue telegram asked jack who sent telegram about strong support in australia mr alington opened mild eye to widest dear fellow said at least of course caused to be sent a usual two day ago despatched one cipher telegram to valet of mine telling to invest to manager telling to wire betrong support in australia ' did a told chavasse did not be jack be silent moment did not take long to grasp whole situation for be very simple what next said alington shrugged shoulder unless share go up again before next settling day will almost certainly be bankrupt said then why if paper be correctly informed did go on buying last night because must get carmel dirt cheap said if go up be so much richer if be done in case unfortunate contretemps about foolish valet doe not affect value of mine gold be there just same nobody will believe that put in jack for present a say for immediate present will not realize will think lucky to part with share enormously below value fortune depends on how soon realize there will be inquiry into matter undoubtedly bogus telegram be not officially recognised by stock exchange alington be certainly at best so thought jack when thing happened sleek unhurried respectability little trying conventional at ordinary time though unaltered in became admirable rare manifestation of self control flurried quickening marked precise unhurried sentence remained just a leisurely a ever a in day when carmel east west be behaving in so mercurial manner though so consonantly with wish so now when greater coup have struck so back handedly against did not cease to be imperturbably calm lucid though without breeding in ordinary sense of word have to notable extent that most characteristic mark of breeding utter absence of exaltation in unexpected prosperity complete composure in disaster there be nothing affected about be a always unimpulsive master of in social mill seemed lack of animation in mill of adversity became thing to respect take very quietly said jack be mere habit said alington by way hope dear fellow that wife be better much better thanks went to goring yesterday so saw in paper how much have in carmel eight thousand pound cash half of share have bought only not paid for ah will be difficulty more like impossibility unless go up before settling day be sorry for said alington for must have recommended buying even more be going to bluff thing out be going to buy buy chavasse may go hang will make attempt to get fifty thousand pound fifty thousand exclaimed jack involuntarily fifty thousand indeed must not before ship touch at cape if buy be known to be buying be still conceivable that confidence may be restored that damage done by absurd unreasonable panic yesterday may be repaired say that rush for share be not insane panic be not le so now dear fellow congratulate on way have taken must make financier aequam memento rebus in arduis how horace have trick of stating simple thing inspiritingly divine gift what do suppose will find out at inquiry asked jack ah need not fear inquiry in least will not touch salary a director be sort of thing see have on mind must perhaps be serious for be if became bankrupt then be true private account where salary figure must be made public surest mean of avoiding be that share must go up again before settling day be with view be buying now with view must recommend to desperate measure desperate oh certainly must remind that case be fairly so see be lunch time will lunch here of course kit have not yet risen when jack went up to london that morning found lily alone in garden when came down illness have left very weak frail though be getting on rapidly felt very different from kit who few week ago must dress twenty time day
