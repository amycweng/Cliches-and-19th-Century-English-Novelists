not clever for be very seldom that experience confirms one childish instinct in ninety nine case out of hundred eradicates altogether at rate modifies almost beyond recognition mr emsworth have won back to what have not be in instinct when be child be more unlikely that amelie when woman must retain instinct be now hers at present moment amelie enthusiasm be largely taken up with food 'papa have

awfully kind ' said 'if only be stronger must enjoy enormously ' ' be enjoying ' said 'it suit will too if take advice ' feel more inclined to take to drink ' said fact once grasped that life at mon repos be not holiday hard relentless work of most exacting kind began forthwith to settle down to grapple with at once difficulty charm of absorbed be continual piece of acting mood have to assume specie of reckless gaiety day long feverishly seriously engage in thing be originally designed to be relaxation ingenuity of social life have turned into instrument of profession none of present particularly cared for bridge boating bathing in must not have boated bathed alone played bridge even with dummy used relaxation a mean of accomplishing social effort life can not be undertaken frivolously though be purely frivolous twenty year of age devotee more than thirty year of hard reasonable brain work though find intensely fascinating yet know have to pay for pleasure grow quickly old in service indeed might almost be classed a dangerous trade if pursuit of wealth be relentless task not le so be expenditure a mean of social success certainly mr palmer worked quite a hard a husband three day passed thus be now afternoon of first day of revel in consequence telegraph telephone line down to port washington be congested with message for greater part of evening paper in new york have kept first page open for nothing must be sent to press until be known in what manner first afternoon must be spent good deal of course be ready to be set up for list of guest be public property dress must be even if imagined only described a long a lagoon on shore held secret page must not be made up be known also that there must be ball at mon repos in evening that wall of ball room be to be covered literally covered a paper cover wall with rose for secret of lagoon paper have to wait since have be inviolably kept event too hardly le momentous hung in balance for only two day before reigning prince of saxe hochlaben dissolute young man of twenty five with limp past future have arrived like thunderbolt in new york now to frivolous lightminded doe not seem world curdling event very enlightened paper new york gutter snipe be not frivolous with extreme rapidity set red flame of war ablaze when announced in huge headline 'arrival of royal transparency prince of saxe hochlaben mr lewis s palmer revel doomed to dire failure fritz be name promise to favour mr john z adelboden at newport ' editor of gutter snipe may be remarked have once be man of enormous wealth have honoured mr palmer by singling out a adversary in certain financial campaign mr palmer have dropped quite number of little note on to floor over be now poor spiteful effect of announcement be magical for there be already war to knife between mr john z adelboden mr palmer latter of whom have planted standard at long island in direct defiance of newport headline brought thing to crisis news of arrival be of course telegraphed to newport by gutter snipe did not telegraph to mon repos consequently mr john z adelboden knew by mid day germanic having come in at whereas went down to long island in ordinary issue of paper thus mr john z adelboden have seven hour start that remarkable woman grasped event in aspect in about three minute quarter knew everyone in america know everything that timothy vandercrup editor of gutter snipe be ally against mr palmer guessed also that news must not reach mr palmer for hour so within five minute of arrival of telegram have called on newport to rally round sent out six hundred fifty invitation for ball two night later be to say on evening of first day of mr palmer revel to invitation added on bottom left hand corner 'arrival of prince of saxe hochlaben be rather clever did not actually commit to anything note be sent out by perfect army of special messenger same evening answer arrived there be refusal simultaneously wrote rather familiar little note to h r t whom have met flirted with in england year before saying 'pray come up to little cottage here have ball on monday night newport will be there ' at mon repos same evening paper arrived a usual mr palmer a usual picked up gutter snipe since always contained manoeuvre of enemy though at moment guest be in middle of arriving left amelie to do honour instantly left room went to boudoir read paragraph through twice also may be remarked have met prince before have tried to flirt with amelie who have given encouragement whatever have tried to flirt with so many people who have given great deal that thought might easily have forgotten that sat with paper in hand for five minute after have read through for second time nimble brain leaping like squirrel from bough to bough of possible policy paused on for moment new york evening startler for instance must put in chose to send went so far a to seize pen write in capital letter lewis s palmer refuse to receive prince fritz ' then sat still again thought must not do newport must only laugh at one thing dreaded for to be laughed at drive nail into coffin of social failure then suddenly tension activity of leaping brain relaxed smiled to herself at extreme simplicity of plan took one of ordinary revel invitation card out of desk on word ' be printed at bottom left hand corner before inserted one word so that read 'indiscriminate revel be directed to prince address at waldorf went back to guest now matter so momentous be best described in simplest possible manner emotion for next day two swayed two faction that of newport that of long island more bitterly poignantly than war of independence swayed north south can not be too simply treated plain upshot then be a follows mr john z adelboden familiar little note to prince arrived same evening a mr palmer wrote hers h r t accepted in own hand with effusion mr palmer card arrived next morning h r t read in bed thought to 'indiscriminate did ' will be more amusing ' have forgotten altogether about acceptance of newport invitation if have remembered must not have done differently so after light wholesome breakfast of peach washed down with hock soda accepted mr palmer invitation news be over newport that be coming there before evening gutter snipe gave portrait biography unrecognisable news be over long island that be coming there by evening startler gave portrait biography of mr lewis s palmer then followed two day of suspense anxiety can only be called sickening eventually two announcement be laid before prince fritz by trembling secretary who asked what meant to do flew into violent passion exclaimed with strong german accent will go where choose when choose how choose suspense continued to reign so momentous afternoon arrived be to bring prince in mr adelboden private railway carriage to newport in mr palmer motor to mon repos still word of enlightenment have come must pierce thick cloud of doubt hid face of future newport long island be en fete at rail way station of one on lawn of mon repos at other rival faction be awaiting supreme moment in tense unnatural calm mr palmer alone be absent from guest

revelation went back to humble home success of have be gigantic nobody except newport talked about anything else for day to find news of international importance in paper be almost impossible for everything else except revel be tucked away into odd corner newport alone maintained icy silence disaffection be already at work there who be only struggling on fringe of newport society said openly that must go to long island next year since there really seemed to be gaiety there whereas newport be like wet sunday afternoon mr palmer two english guest however stopped on so also did bilton mr emsworth having decided not to go to mass on sunday morning be coming down with larger part of company on saturday night after performance in new york sunday however be going to be quiet day with exception that there be large dinner party in evening play in theatre afterwards ping pong armstrong also remained for be recognised tame cat without claw about house mr palmer sometimes secretly wished in full consciousness of innocence that people must 'talk ' just little about nobody ever did even gutter snipe never alluded to constant presence in house be probably due to fact that editor who knew good deal about meaner side of human nature guessed that must have pleased mr palmer for be most extraordinary though common phenomenon to find perfectly virtuous upright people often like to be thought just little wicked whereas bad people be totally indifferent for most part a to whether anyone think good not during two three day have elapsed since bilton mr massington have talk together conduct have be immensely pleasing to have taken hint have given like gentleman have not allowed to drift into intimate conversation with until gave signal have be diplomatic delicate above have be intelligent not blundering must not help contrasting much to advantage with average englishman who insists on 'talking thing out ' else look sulky wear woebegone aspect bilton have done neither have remained brisk not brusque have resisted apparently without effort attempt to bring to point while remaining absolutely normal in meantime during self imposed pause in own affair mr massington watched with extreme satisfaction development of mission have brought bertie keynes to america affair for certainly appeared to be running very smooth almost wished for slight contretemps to take place in order to put thing on proper proverbial footing in other word amelie bertie have made great friend owing to extraordinary freedom eligible young folk be given in america with view to letting improve

so absorbing to narrator audience that have observed that someone else be listening a boy broke out into childish laughter cry be nice ' at awful fate of wicked fairy mr emsworth looked behind half hearing sudden rustle saw amelie standing there also absorbed instantly sat down on other handle of barrow tommy be nice ' echoed do think lady will tell story ask ' lady be so kind a to oblige again time be about real live person who be always very good in morning sat down did work a must with good fairy sitting beside later on good fairy must sometimes go to sleep a soon a be asleep bad fairy

fairy kept awake so poor lady set to work again tried to see child day because even if talked to child for little in morning especially if gave kiss good fairy be much le sleepy tommy eye grew wide 'oh do love ' said hoisted with dirty boot into lap then smitten with child sudden shyness clambered down again wheelbarrow went on way two others strolled on in silence for moment over grass amelie with strange lump in throat then put arm round mr emsworth waist 'good morning ' said quietly kissed ' think love too ' said ' came out to tell that ' mr emsworth kissed again 'that be nice too ' said 'but what make ' ' know think be seeing in horrid play last night be like sunbeam in in cesspool why do sort of thing ' mr emsworth shrugged shoulder 'because people be beast dear ' said 'because like sort of thing one have to live ' amelie thought moment with face growing grave 'oh be sorry be sorry said sudden impatience ungovernable irritation filled dorothy felt a if be being hauled back to ordinary life when be so happy in sweetness of early morning hour why did stupid gawky girl come speak to like with effort at control stronger than usually bothered to make mastered 'oh never mind never mind ' said 'walk with little further let look at because be beautiful tree because be beautiful grass sky what heavenly moment let waste look lawn be empty where yesterday be full with sort of

for ten minute if voice quavered if people a be sure to do tell thing passed tommy who paused a got near mr emsworth seemed not to notice then looked back 'dear little chap said retracing step kissed again must be allowed that by time got to station there be nothing of early morning mr emsworth left about on platform bilton approached with rather anxious face particularly want to speak to dorothy ' said in low voice can help ' looked at with extremely vivid virulence go away beast ' said ' can help say doubt can wo go away bilton have sense to see that needed help for there have be very awkward moment when went into mr emsworth room night before be very good at acting quickly in emergency have foreseen one be utterly unforeseen have found helplessly unprepared have have even moment preparation felt sure that must have said something must anyhow have be palliative since thing be done did not trouble head about what palliative must have be for have come in knock unheard found two lady together upon dorothy laughed mr massington turned pink retreated there be situation most unpromising feature of be that dorothy have laughed with quickness must see way out be clearly impossible for to open subject again to mr massington be equally obvious that must put construction on presence only person who must conceivably help be dorothy now have called beast apparently during journey to new york relented for a boarded mangy looking ferry boat conveyed across river threw word to over shoulder ' will be in at lunch ' said can come if like ' did not like though be better than nothing for felt that have in sense whip hand of knew bilton be not accustomed to let anybody have whip hand of mr emsworth always took rehearsal have stage manager be true who sat meekly in wing whom contradicted from time to time office being to be contradicted to write down stage direction gave occasionally bilton looked in for hour two contradicted also at time usually incorporated suggestion afterwards author if be new play be also in attendance in stall office be to cut line out put line in though perhaps must not act certainly have strong sense of drama be why have laughed at bilton entrance night before for situation struck a admirably constructed have seen with woman sixth sense a correctly minutely a in photograph on what footing mr massington be though be not in slightest degree in love with man indeed ever have be yet looked on a possession while did not want distinctly did not wish to change hand jealousy of ordinary green variety have something to do with shrewd eye to business knowledge of how much better career went if great impresario be devoted admirer have about a much only if devoted admirer be to become confirmed settled sealed up admirer of someone else did not propose to be candle at sealing be done to be cat paw to act of treason against be feat of altruism of be hopelessly incapable then finally in jumble of feeling have resulted in calling bilton beast there be something neither sordid selfish namely determination distinct honest that mr massington woman whom liked respected must not at rate by auxiliary help of hers be deceived a to what bilton really be doubt with aid of liquid eye mouth so beautiful that looked a if must be made for utterance of perfect verity must persuade massington that bilton have never be in intimate relation assure even to conviction that slightly informal visit last night be only a be indeed true visit for utterance of few word of congratulation on success did not intend from motif good bad indifferent mixed to do for only into composition of intention good honest fine motive entered be not wonderful that pot au feu of feeling amounting to positive agitation did not tend towards comfort of company at rehearsal indeed on part of manageress toward calm attitude of thoughtful critic in consequence before rehearsal be hour old be first book rehearsal second leading lady be next door to tear leading gentleman in sulk author in despair mr emsworth in mood of dangerous suavity made aspiring actor heart sick dayrell ' be saying 'must mind not turning back completely on audience when speak line mr

roosevelt have made le beau temp for member of mr emsworth company did not at follow that bilton when came to lunch must find same sunshine awaiting even a there be guarantee that because at twelve o'clock on april day pellucid tranquillity flooded earth there will not be smart hail storm hour afterwards on contrary be safe to bet that mood mr emsworth be in must be in different one before long spring day temperament of hers be in fact only thing to be reckoned on consequently since bilton have not witnessed varied phase exhibited at theatre hoped somehow sanguinely that must not be in temper so roundly labelled 'beast ' at port washington station seemed to have forgotten be coming to lunch a matter of fact have welcomed charmingly 'dear man ' said 'how nice of to look in be nearly

be sister at moment there have entered harold bilton because have said must see got up advanced to be quite unexpected ' said ' thought be in america pray sit down what have happened have mr emsworth also come back bilton sat down brought hat stick with according to custom of countryman sybil who have never noticed there noticed in london noticed more particularly since stick fell down from angle where have propped with loud clatter mr emsworth be still in america said have left new york gone on tour think tour will be very successful ' glad ' said sybil 'tea guess wo thank ' said bilton ' want anything want just to talk to ' sybil pulled together in other word tried to remember that man in new york if cross insignificant ocean be same man who land at liverpool succeeded moderately well 'and how be everybody ' asked 'how be mr palmer amelie long island party ' 'they be right ' said bilton bers palmer giving woodland fete week will be very complete guess sea will come swallow up newport did come here to talk about mr palmer ' finished taking off glove threw into hat took chair exactly opposite so that faced other a in waggonette to sybil be odious vehicle for locomotion likeness to charlie be somehow strangely obliterated to day thought of latter a of something suffering in need of protection whereas same featured man who sat opposite looked particularly capable of self defence if necessary of aggression for first time rather feared dislike looked hazily out through tremor of fear ran away from america in great hurry said 'you left very desolate ' something in quite harmless speech displeased sybil immensely 'ran away ' asked 'yes ran away only incidentally from america ran away from came after ' sybil got up beally mr bilton said 'you have left manner

whether dorothy have told think be hard on ' said 'or perhaps understand be before knew prepared to accept devotion do reject now because have led that sort of life ' sybil frowned ca discus question with ' said ' will just suggest to that went to see mistress while to whom have expressed devotion be staying in house if ca understand feeling about ca explain to ' ' will promise never to see again said bilton suddenly almost with vividness of actual hallucination figure of man who be so like rose up before sybil saw charlie taking bilton place there imagined that be who be saying what bilton said for moment invested with grossness of double loathed shuddered at picture have conjured up charlie behaving like bilton be image so degrading humiliating that must not contemplate very thought be to do dishonour bilton so recognised be acting now up to very best be best of nature promised not to see mr emsworth again charlie in corresponding position be unthinkable against grossness sybil fineness taste ran up like wave against stone sea jetty be broken against jetty did not know what have done rose conscious that be trembling be matter of entire indifference to ' said 'when where how soon see again want to understand ' bilton sat quite unmoved 'if be quite certain of must not be so violent ' said 'you be overstating feeling be because be rather perplexed a to what be ' sybil turned quickly round to must not help showing appreciation of 'ah be frightfully clever ' said ' do that justice ' rose ' will not give up hope ' said 'that be a please ' said ' have stated a clearly a can can give none ' 'it be not fault that convince ' said 'it be fault of own determination good bye sybil shook hand with be movement asked ' return to america almost immediately to collect company

analytic grasp must not find permanent fruition in mere quickness in mere analysis something of passion for deed for accomplishment that instinct blindly spur on bee to labour men to work have got hold of what be to do refused to marry bilton for apart from fungus of disgust very need for activity rejected that niche for herself in front of must burn in honour thick incense of wealth no longer attracted wanted to accomplish to make to be in however small degree active creating force so strong at present moment be impulse that wondered probably correctly whether refusal of bilton did not dip root fibre into soil thought stirred within till sitting still became impossible rose walked up down room soon eye fell on great nosegay of michaelmas daisy have gathered in charlie garden that

most remarked mr palmer 'can wait here hour so want to talk to have got other thing wo wait ' bertie looked at watch ' can be back in hour said 'if will do 'yes hour from now quarter to four then nodded to shut up heart again dismissed from thought a completely a have left room bertie a mr palmer have supposed have arrived in london only evening before since gallio be out of town spending in point of fact most unremunerative fortnight at monte carlo on system lost infallibly though slowly have at invitation taken possession of chamber in jermyn street have come down to breakfast in a happy contented frame of mind a young man gifted with good digestion charming girl to whom be engaged need hope ever to find have seen with satisfaction that there be only one letter waiting for have expected rather to find creditor clamouring round for have respectable number of waiting for leisure cash have supposed that must very politely have notified of existence a soon a arrived there be only one letter for opened purport be a simple a statement of account type written began 'dear sir have honour to remind of document from have extracted following then in neat mark of quotation be appended certain sentence did bewitch if be not for ' be with be tongue tied even now hand halt a think of ' 'you be only woman in world for offer be have will be will have ' there be decent space

resembling great hunger of sickly kind for so far from being hungry must not touch egg bacon to have just helped must not yet even begin to think again filled cup with tea again drank again read letter then suddenly felt hot stifled though morning be of brisk chilliness went to window leaned out be aware that cold sweat have gathered on forehead wiped away then at once feeling of physical faintness thirst left altogether be back in room lighted cigarette sat down squarely on sofa to think matter out first impulse namely to go straight to mr palmer with letter did not last long have told after amelie have accepted in answer to question be very delicately put that there be page in past life feared mr palmer with tact finesse be inseparable from great ability have indicated meaning with absolute precision clearness have not hinted that wished bertie to confess liaison might ever have have only asked with considerable solemnity to assure that have done nothing coming to light at future time must humanly speaking bring unhappiness to possibly rupture between amelie have not pressed for answer immediately 'think over have said 'and tell to morrow young men will be young men a long a woman be woman mean that what do mean be whether anyone can rake thing up afterwards if anyone can must like to know about need ask to be straight with guess be straight without being asked ' now have not occurred to bertie to tell about mr emsworth for very simple reason that be quite innocent that have be foolish mad if will be perfectly true morally be clean now at moment be on tour in america where have notion bilton doubt knew bilton have be instructed to admit discussion of kind to morrow must be january second impulse be also short lived namely to go straight with letter to scotland yard what did mean action for blackmail against mr emsworth dragging into public view have happened feast for carrion crow of london for well celibacy for mr emsworth clever woman a be knew well what justice be done by world to who invoke justice of law verdict of world be always same must have be something in ' though judge jury in land might testify to innocence world must simply shrug shoulder must have be something in ' for be not in least necessary to touch pitch to be defiled be quite sufficient if somebody point casual finger at merely say 'pitch ' yes be on blackmailer counted here lay security namely that bringing to justice meant that must lay open to justice of world what justice in case must mr palmer give if be to know at must be bertie who told bertie knew must not after assurance have given for moment brain deserted question of what to do put in a parenthesis that blackmail scheme have be brilliantly planned be excellently timed gave quite long enough to think matter over not rush a might possibly have done in desperation to mr palmer scotland yard if have only be given hour so to decide at same time did not give opportunity of communicating with mr emsworth extract too be cleverly chosen genuineness must not doubt gave very fair idea of impression that whole letter must make on unbiassed mind then suddenly sprang to foot be not guilty ' cried bey god be not guilty ' fit of passion subsided a suddenly a have sprung up thought turned to dorothy remembered with great distinctness interview with on morning after debut in new york uneasiness with what sober self thought be mere chaff have inspired afterwards at various meeting in new york down at long island have be quite at ease again ashamed of momentary suspicion be better actress than knew appeared for never did anything seem to more genuine than kindliness towards have made friend with amelie too for amelie have told of meeting in dewy garden of entrancing way with child have quite won heart then then third alternative struck what if did nothing just waited to see if anything must happen if by to morrow evening have not paid hideous sum to blackmailer again turned back daunted whole plot have be too elaborately too neatly laid to allow to think that threat must not be carried out if in sudden passion dorothy have threatened to send letter to mr palmer might so thought have reasoned with appealed to pity appealed above to knowledge of innocence might even have threatened have coolly seriously told that must lay information against unless gave up letter to be not dealing felt with woman in passion be dealing with cold well planned plot conceived perhaps in anger thought out by very calm calculating brain there be not felt even outside chance that having worked out so carefully must hold hand at last moment true held now in own hand evidence against for blackmail sufficient to secure if chose severe sentence only must not do have not nerve enough to take step have calculated on doubt have calculated correctly then money must be raised somehow there be way out in order to silence false accusation against have to pay l be question of how to get that carried about with morning have sat beside at lunch gallio might possibly lend must entail telling gallio whole story did not in least wish to do however if better mean offered determined to telegraph to that evening so at quarter to four brain still going dreary round from point to point of difficulty again presented at carlton be shown by noiseless valet through noiseless door of mr palmer sitting room latter have not heard enter bertie in strangeness of sight met eye forgot for moment own entanglement for lewis palmer be seated in easy chair by window doing nothing arm hung limply by side head be half sunk into chest whole attitude expressed lassitude be indescribable next minute half turned head languidly towards door saw bertie standing there 'ah come in come in ' said ' be waiting for be not late ' rose never be very rich man said 'it be damnable slavery ca stop have to go on ca rest be in mill mill keep on turning ' stood silent moment then pulled together ' hope nobody overheard said must think be mad now then just now then get like then must give have to get somebody to press out wrinkle in brain let rest must be quite content to be poor if must forget fever in life have be spent might even do something a art critic there be over sit down there be cigar by 'now talked to straight enough once before ' went on 'and told believe exact truth wanted to start with amelie with clean sheet in direction want to have clean sheet in want to pay off debt mind come to with more afterwards know be difficult to state whole please try to do so take time ' bertie sat quite still moment with huge up leap of relief in mind ' ca tell accurately ' said 'but be afraid be rather large ' million pound suggested mr palmer dryly bertie laughed already must laugh 'no not quite ' said 'but between ten thousand twenty about twelve must say ' 'confiding people english tradesman remarked mr palmer 'be going to jew 'no house doe charge so high now be not going to give money will deduct from settlement be going to make amount of have already determined on only will give at once ask to pay at once 'you be most generous ' said bertie ' ca thank ' ' then be sure thirteen thousand will cover mind doe matter to be all deducted ' ' be sure will ' mr palmer did not answer drew chair to table wrote cheque at once then ' said 'now looked worried at lunch anything wrong 'it be ' said bertie 'it be now ' mr palmer looked at moment with strong approval ' like ' said 'now go away mill have to commence again ' relief be a profound a oppression have be now that strain be over bertie be conscious of luxurious relaxation tension strain on nerve have passed feeling of happy weariness a when dreaded operation be well over set in must scarcely yet find in mind to be bitter angry even with mr emsworth have done vile thing must not longer be in power being free from scarcely resented so strong be relief mr palmer knew have designed to make settlement of money on what be to be did not yet know fact that have be deducted from prevented feeling that have come by money in crooked fashion a be certain payment to be made to have be partly anticipated looked forward to paying blackmail almost with eagerness made appointment by telegraph with bilton for next morning at hour waited on at office in pall mall have always rather liked man practical shrewdness entire absence of what might be called 'nonsense about certain hard definite clearness about way be somehow satisfactory to mind morning characteristic be peculiarly developed gave bertie blunt genuine welcome 'delighted to see ' said 'just come over have smoke ' bertie took cigarette `` ve called about business connected with mr emsworth said ' be here to settle ' bilton looked puzzled moment emsworth ' said 'business with mr emsworth ah remember sent certain instruction time ago let see where did put ' took down alphabetical letter case from shelf after short search drew out packet 'that be ' said 'ah see there be discussion to pas between curious love of mystery woman have especially when there be nothing to make mystery about a dare say be case here ' 'you know what business be

also to deliver to certain letter be to verify then destroy in presence ' heard nothing of ' said bertie 'it be in instruction said bilton ' ca give up letter ' said bertie 'it stopped bilton got up ' be afraid can hing then ' said 'except fulfil rest of mr emsworth direction if be not done by evening of january to day give packet to mr palmer ' referred again to one of paper have taken out 'yes give packet to mr palmer ' repeated 'which intend to do ' bertie asked 'certainly at same time may tell have written very strong letter to mr emsworth protesting against making use of in in private matter of kind be busy man looked at watch ' have taste for other people intrigue bertie thought intently for moment if gave up letter must be powerless in future to prove anything with regard to blackmail fact that have drawn cheque for l to bilton be in nothing to show that have done so under threat especially if a suddenly occurred to bilton be if not in league with mr emsworth at rate cognizant of action on other hand if refused have to risk that letter of being sent to mr palmer have be unable to face risk before be a unfaceable now idea that bilton be concerned in be interesting have be suggested by slight over emphasizing of fact that be busy by looking at watch be however vaguely threatening implied time be short that be concerned in bertie acceptation of ultimatum bilton sat down again tapped with finger on table 'excuse lord keynes said 'but purpose be served by sitting here like will of course please in matter here be packet for if decide one way there be letter box if decide other speech be well chosen left room for doubt in bertie mind that letter box must be used took desired document from pocket 'here be cheque said 'and here be letter latter say be going to verify on side suppose may verify what give ' bilton appeared to consider for moment 'there be nothing said about ' remarked 'but feel certain that lady must be willing to let receive proof of honourable dealing with ' 'did say honourable dealing ' asked bertie in tone required answer bilton opened letter bertie gave referred to paper out of alphabetical case looked at cheque handed packet bertie glanced at saw enough put in pocket 'that be correct then said bilton bertie rose 'next time see mr emsworth pray congratulate for ' said have missed vocation by going on stage be inclined to disagree with ' said bilton 'it have developed sense of plot must be going good bye suppose be off to america again in month may meet there ' 'that be not possible ' said bertie bilton smile sped

absorbed charlie responded to 'and one power of absorption depends almost entirely on health ' said evening post came in on not long after charlie went upstairs to answer certain letter have come for leaving other two together since arrival of post sybil have become very silent preoccupied one letter in fact read three time over with silent frownings between perusal at length rose took turn two up

enormously english affair of mr palmer swelling trade of own personal enterprise having almost doubled in last few month increase be wholly welcome to since letter received answered meant business on particular morning there be nothing a far a must see designed for private eye quiet smooth voiced young american who sat by have field to letter required monosyllabic reply from master jotted down in corner of page others be longer demanded half page of cabalistic note others again be set aside to be dealt with by bilton there be to day several of dealing with subject of threatened strike at

of course perfectly safe with wooden casing strutting in case of heavy continuous rain ground might get soft strut sink in ground thus rendering passage unsafe for train suggested that labour must be brought from elsewhere at once unless men must be induced to go back to work letter dealing with bilton have caused to be put on one side towards end of breakfast asked for second reading of of matter appeared to to be rather urgent in addition to mr palmer be leaving for liverpool america next morning must thus be out of touch for next eight day so after little consideration dictated telegram to say that must go down there that afternoon there be few letter remaining during bilton pause for consideration secretary have opened rest have ready to read next be from amelie 'dear sir 'kindly order

supplying from imagination factor alone must account for certain combination presented to a problem must not at once see way through more than that must not determine with internal satisfaction on next move move might of course be merely negative move mere inaction on part turn matter over in what way might must not see how to say 'check ' in answer to 'check ' be threatened threatened too by firm of eminently reputable solicitor who presumably must not undertake business of securest nature fifteen thousand pound be true did not mean anything very particular to saw further than must pay very fact of payment be equivalent to shrewd american brain to confession of guilt what if paid only to find that have clinched proof against if did not pay if shrugged shoulder at whole matter what if 'other hand be entrusted with ' rose from table biting cigar through 'the blackmailer blackmailed muttered 'new sensational novel guess will think over ' glanced again at letter saw that have evening of next day in to commit definitely to one other course of action must be back in london in course of next afternoon there must be time then to day be really too busy to give matter attention be afraid deserved by mid day to morrow affair of strike in case must be off mind must devote whole of hour occupied by journey back to london if necessary to consideration of matter then there be note from amelie stopping coal boring in moment possible reconstruction of what have happened suggested to knew went down to scene of strike afternoon found thing rather more serious than have anticipated bricklayer have already gone out platelayer have sent in demand did not feel justified in accepting without consultation with mr palmer what be much more serious in spite of indenture there be hint of trouble with signalman took indeed two three hour to find out full extent of with line be threatened in back of mind time be consciousness of with be threatened have in fact to leave inspection of tunnel till next morning left also till next morning in case result of negotiation with striker might prove to be nugatory despatch of telegram to mr palmer asking to have express in must travel to liverpool stopped at wyfold junction so that might get in there during journey to liverpool talk over situation in case must be necessary also perhaps to get extra day for in own private matter after dinner telegraphed to messrs hobart howard saying that must reply to by evening of september extremely urgent business said engaged attention being at loss to understand communication asked for extension went up to bed in rather dingy hotel in be forced to stay conscious of extreme weariness unhappily conscious of inability to obtain refreshment of sleep often before now have suffered from insomnia be aware when got into bed that worst form of insomnia namely utter absence of slightest drowsiness to extent compensates for absence of sleep be likely to be knew that there lay before seemingly infinite period of intensely active thought inharmoniously linked with intensely active desire for sleep mill race of coherent image foamed through brain tinged with failure cursed for have done have made mess of courtship of sybil have made mess over wretched fifteen thousand pound knowing bertie thought have known how safe small transaction be true be scarcely worth while man who make million make by consideration of very much smaller sum be not in nature to have neglected chance chance seemed certain money be paid letter be returned never have blackmail gone on smoother wheel in wakefulness in agitation about strike involved larger issue to than mere payment of sum latter assumed nightmare proportion swelled encompassed if paid there be confession if did not pay there be 'other hand ready to undertake business did not think young man have so much blood in ' thought a tossed in abominable feather bed during last forty eight hour plan of palmer family have somewhat altered mr palmer for instance have discovered that be necessary to start at ten in morning in order to join liverpool southampton line by husband wished to travel be clearly out of question matter resolved into decision whether must go by euston spend night at molesworth stopping liverpool express there latter counsel prevailed couple of hour after bilton have left london also left four of for bertie be of party plan too have changed be going to america now instead of following fortnight later inn at bilton passed night be close to railway station at frampton near on south lay tunnel where there be trouble with striker frampton be originally small village be now extending huge sucker of jerry built house into country for lay on junction between liverpool southampton line new communication with south wale be on junction too of molesworth wyfold estate molesworth lying on north wyfold to south consequently palmer party have passed through afternoon before have got out at station of molesworth five mile further on of course be unknown to bilton who imagined be still in london rose from bed next morning feeling tired unrefreshed dressed sent telegram to mr palmer at seaton house asking to have train stopped at wyfold where must get in a wanted to consult with over situation must reach in london in plenty of time before started must have greater part of morning at frampton must get over to wyfold in time to take train there wished also to see for condition of unfinished abandoned work in tunnel get estimate if possible from engineer of shortest time in must be possible to finish work without interrupting traffic in case decided to import labour at once work in connection with other matter however took rather longer than have anticipated set off down mile of line lay between frampton tunnel to meet engineer who be appointed to be waiting for there rather short of time have expected to be obliged to go over to wyfold in course of morning have therefore telegraphed to have train stopped there have proved however to be unnecessary be too late now to alter rendezvous to frampton tunnel in question be very deep burrow under mile of hill rose steeply above completion so close approach to completion that must be used have be great triumph of speed in construction of line found that work remaining to be done be easily compassable within week two if sufficient number of men must be brought to spot while there be also at wyfold end of tunnel unfinished piece of le extent if anything than report of engineer also put matter in rather le serious light great beam timber supported wooden arch over brick have to be laid be at present absolutely secure must take week of rain before danger be even threatened must not be well if possible to finish so small job at once have off mind bilton be decidedly of opinion gave order step must be taken to get outside labour without delay concluded morning work looked at watch be later than have known to walk back mile to frampton where must get trap then drive over huge ridge of tunnel down into wyfold might mean missing train must stop for there must assuredly not wait if be not on platform engineer have easy solution why not walk through tunnel must take very little longer than going back to frampton must thus find within mile of wyfold station must get there in very little over hour going briskly must easily be in time to step into stopped express no train be due on line for next half hour in fact next train must pas must be southampton to liverpool express in at moment must be travelling engineer must provide with lantern must leave at signal box at other end of tunnel seemed admirable arrangement in couple of minute have set off light cast by lantern be excellent shone brightly to guide path gleamed on rail of four track a pointed in narrowing perspective up black cavern lay before until be lost in darkness walked on right hand side of tunnel immediately on left be main line from southampton to liverpool along must soon return at brisker pace than be now for hundred of yard gray glimmer from end of tunnel where have entered also cast diffused light into darkness a proceeded light faded grew dim when be now third of way through slight continuous bend in tunnel have be necessary in order to avoid belt of unstable shifty stratum obscured altogether walked for light from lantern in absolute darkness own footstep echoed queerly from curved vault there be otherwise dead silence save for occasional drip of water outside noise of world be entirely cut off from be stepping along thus when saw with sudden start of horror that there be something dark lying between second third pair of rail little way ahead of from fact that started be conscious that nerve be not working with accustomed smoothness coolness heard heart hammering in throat then pulled together crossed two rail lay between turned lantern on saw next moment with spasm of relief that be only coat left there forgotten doubt by workman with cheap impulse of kindness picked up meaning to leave with lantern at signal box at far end a picked up stepped on again to regain side path where have be walking foot tripped in on corner of sleeper fell forward lantern flying from hand smashing to atom on hard metal of road head struck full on temple against steel of track blow completely stunned about same time party left molesworth to drive to station where liverpool express must be stopped for be distance of not more than three mile stopped in village close to station in case there be anything at post office have come by second post must thus miss there be only one thing telegram from bilton re directed from seaton house asking that train might be stopped at wyfold so drove on to station there learned that express have already passed through wyfold without stopping must reach molesworth in six seven minute so mr palmer who never wasted regret on inevitable shrugged shoulder inspected book stall while mr palmer inundated telegraph office with despatch bertie amelie strolled up down platform bilton came to with blank unconsciousness of where be be quite dark first realized that be not in bed by feel of clothes then put hand to head drew away with start of horror for be warm wet then felt with hand metal of roadway following that encountered one of rail at that broken end of memory joined knew where be simultaneously heard dead silence broken by distant roar rumble at started to foot wavered nearly fell again sens be suddenly electrified vivified by noise remembered how have started to walk through tunnel how have picked up coat how have fallen how engineer have told that next train through must be that to liverpool where be on line have fallen there be four track thought ought to move to right across rail to left hell be to right to left that train must pas roar got louder echoed with infernal clangour from curved side of tunnel prevented thinking felt sure that if must only stop for one second head must be clear must take two step to safety that noise must stop moment in frenzy no longer master of shouted hoarsely impotently waved hand in darkness from way did come from in front of behind if must only settle that must know what to do roaring grew unbearable drove mad with finger in ear began to run did not know where again tripped on rail fell on side of tunnel there shone red gloomy light did not see above roar rattle of racing wheel there sounded hot quick panting of monster did not hear knew one moment of awful shock of sense of being torn battered in piece then roar sank down a train passed on diminished into silence a emerged from darkness of tunnel into pure glorious sunlight of september morning to who have be pitiless relentless in life have come death a swift relentless a amelie bertie be at fore end of platform when express drew up turned back just a got opposite engine bertie gave one short gasp of horror grasped wife arm what be ' said 'go on amelie ' said quickly ' look to right left walk straight on ' obeyed went to engine driver 'there be something on engine ' said epilogue be march day of glorious windy brightness down glade of molesworth where bertie amelie have sat one hot morning in june last year innumerable company of daffodil danced flickered in sun great tree be yet for most part bare of leaf round birch green mist hovered red bud on lime be ready to burst boisterous warm fruitful teeming with promise of opening year wind shouted through branch bowled a child bowl hoop great fleecy cloud across blue of sky movement light fruitfulness of warm earth be triumphant strength of lived be renewed spring be there to day amelie be pacing alone up down glade near fallen tree trunk where have sketched before walked briskly for be not yet day to loiter in a came to end of beat within sight of house looked eagerly towards a if expecting someone brilliance of face of smile now then hovered round lip be in way diminished when turned again without seeing whom waited for seemed be content to wait though eager did not fear disappointment grass where walked be bright with springing shoot of young growth daffodil nodded tossed head round not yet be full note of woodland summer sounding great orchestra of nature a be be tuning up for concert somehow fragmentary broken sound scrap of summer melody strangely pleased often stopped in walk looked with brilliant smile to right left once threw arm wide so that red cloak stood away from bosom a if to take world to at last came heart embraced ere yet reached be hatless yellow gold of hair be tossed by wind at sight of whole being leaped towards with stronger ecstasy than have known yet for love between seemed perfect woman like loving task knew that little word of comfort sympathy be demanded of 'dear one said 'dear one again 'poor bertie look tired must have waited night in london come down evening ' behould when be waiting ' asked 'oh what morning from god amelie among daffodil put arm into 'tell ' said 'did get there in time did father know ' bertie shook head 'no knew one from time of seizure be glad went

such clever baby ' bertie laughed 'that be remark never heard before ' said 'then will hear lot of time in future said amelie with dignity say nearly day have passed out of shade of tree on to lawn near house just in front of be ugly patch of black looking earth on however new growth of grass be beginning to show amelie stopped when came to 'ah bertie week said 'those week when be stranger black
