newsome square that small discreet oblong of georgian house relic of time when kensington be suburban village sundered from metropolis by stretch of pasture stretching to river square terrace be most inconveniently situated for whose ideal environment includes rank of taxicab immediately opposite door spate of bus roaring down street procession of underground train accessible by station few yard away shaking rattling cutlery silver on dining table in consequence newsome terrace have come two year ago to be inhabited by leisurely retired folk by who wished to pursue work in quiet tranquillity child with hoop scooter be phenomenon rarely encountered in terrace dog be equally uncommon in front of of couple of dozen house of terrace be composed lie little square of railinged garden in may often see middle aged elderly mistress of residence horticulturally employed by five oclock of winter evening pavement will generally be empty of passenger except policeman who with felted step at

that burned for departure so that might get busy with battery piece of tissue hot on track of discovery never yet have presented to mind of man a coming within horizon of possibility last sentence may have led reader to guess that be indeed speaking of none other than recluse mysterious physicist sir james horton with whose death hundred half hewn avenue into dark forest from life come must wait completion till pioneer a bold a take up axe hitherto none have be able to wield probably there be never man to whom humanity owed more of whom humanity knew le seemed utterly independent of race to

not only to reconstruction of past age to construction in future be known for instance that made artificial being formed of tissue still living of animal lately killed with brain of ape heart of bullock sheep thyroid so forth of can give first hand account horton be true told something about in will directed certain memoranda on subject must on death be sent to on bulky envelope there be direction not to be opened till january spoke with reserve so think with slight horror at strange thing have happened on completion of creature evidently made uncomfortable to talk about for reason fancy put what be then rather remote date to day when record must reach eye finally in preliminary for last five year before war have scarcely entered for sake of companionship house other than own mine ours be friendship dating from school day have never suffered to drop entirely doubt if in year spoke except on matter of business to dozen other people have already retired from surgical practice in skill be unapproached most completely now did avoid slightest intercourse with colleague whom regarded a ignorant pedant without courage rudiment of knowledge now then must write epoch making little monograph flung to like bone to starving dog for most part utterly absorbed in own investigation left to grope along unaided frankly told that enjoyed talking to about such subject since be utterly unacquainted with clarified mind to be obliged to put theory guess confirmation with such simplicity that anyone must understand well remember coming in to see on evening of th of august so war have broken out said street be impassable with excited crowd odd isnt just a if of already be not far more murderous battlefield than can be conceived between warring nation hows that said let try to put plainly though isnt that want to talk about blood be one eternal battlefield be full of army eternally marching counter marching a long a army friendly to be in superior position remain in good health if detachment of microbe that if suffered to establish must give cold in head entrench in mucous membrane commander in chief sends regiment down drive out doesnt give order from brain mind arent headquarters for brain know nothing about landing of enemy till have made good position given cold paused moment there isnt one headquarters inside said there be many for instance killed frog morning at least most people must say killed have killed though head lay in one place severed body in not bit have only killed piece of for opened body afterwards took out heart put in sterilised chamber of suitable temperature so that wouldnt get cold be infected by microbe be about twelve oclock to day when came out just now heart be beating still be alive in fact thats full of suggestion know come see terrace have be stirred into volcanic activity by news of war vendor of late edition have penetrated into quietude there be dozen parlour maid fluttering about like black white moth once inside hortons door isolation a of arctic night seemed to close round have forgotten latch key housekeeper then newly come to who became so regular familiar figure in terrace must have heard step for before rang bell have opened door stood with forgotten latch key in hand thanks mr gabriel said without sound door shut behind name face a reproduced in illustrated daily paper seemed familiar rather terribly familiar before have time to grope for association horton supplied tried for murder of husband six month ago said odd case point be that be one perfect housekeeper once have four servant everything be mucky a used to say at school now live in amazing comfort propriety with one doe everything be cook valet housemaid butler wont have anyone to help doubt killed husband planned so well that must not be convicted told quite frankly who be when engaged of course remembered whole trial vividly now husband morose quarrelsome fellow tipsy a often a sober have according to defence cut own throat while shaving according to prosecution have done that for there be usual discrepancy of evidence a to whether wound must have be self inflicted prosecution tried to prove that face have be lathered after throat have be cut so singular exhibition of forethought nerve have hurt rather than helped case after prolonged deliberation on part of jury have be acquitted yet not le singular be hortons selection of probable murderess however efficient a housekeeper anticipated reflection apart from wonderful comfort of having perfectly appointed absolutely silent house said regard mr gabriel a sort of insurance against being murdered if have be tried for life must take very especial care not to find in suspicious proximity to murdered body again no more death in house if must help come through to laboratory look at little instance of life after death certainly be amazing to see little piece of tissue still pulsating with what must be called life contracted expanded faintly indeed perceptibly though for nine hour now have be severed from rest of organisation by went on living if heart must go on living with nothing must say to feed stimulate energy there must also so reasoned horton reside in other vital organ of body other independent focus of life of course severed organ like said will run down quicker than if have co operation of others presently will apply gentle electric stimulus to if can keep glass bowl under beat at temperature of frog body in sterilised air dont see why must not go on living food of course there question of feeding do see what that open up in way of surgery imagine shop with glass case containing healthy organ taken from dead say man dy of pneumonia must a soon a ever breath be out of body be dissected though must of course destroy lung a will be full of pneumococcus liver digestive organ be probably healthy take out keep in sterilised atmosphere with temperature at sell liver let say to poor devil who have cancer there fit with new healthy liver eh insert brain of someone who have died of heart disease into skull of congenital idiot asked yes perhaps brain tiresomely complicated in connection joining up of nerve know surgery will have to learn lot before fit new brain in brain have got lot of function thinking inventing seem to belong to though a have seen heart can get on quite well without there be other function of brain want to study first ive be trying experiment already made little readjustment to flame of spirit lamp kept at right temperature water surrounded sterilised receptacle in frog heart be beating start with more simple mechanical us of brain said primarily be sort of record office diary say that rap knuckle with ruler what happens nerve there send message to brain of course saying how can put most simply saying somebody be hurting eye sends saying perceive ruler hitting knuckle ear sends saying hear rap of leaving alone what else happens why brain record make note of knuckle having be hit have be moving about room a spoke taking off coat waistcoat putting on in place thin black dressing gown by now be seated in favourite attitude cross legged on hearthrug looking like magician perhaps afrit magician of black art have caused to appear be thinking intently now passing through finger string of amber bead talking more to than to how doe make note went on why in manner in phonograph record be made there be million of minute dot depression pockmark on brain certainly record what remember what have enjoyed disliked done said surface of brain anyhow be large enough to furnish writing paper for record of thing of memory if impression of experience have not be acute dot be not sharply impressed record fade in other word come to forget if have be vividly impressed record be never obliterated mr gabriel for instance wont lose impression of how lathered husband face after have cut throat thats to say if did now do see what im driving at of course do there be stored within man head complete record of memorable thing have done said there be thought there speech most well marked of habitual thought thing have often said for habit there be reason to believe wear sort of rut in brain so that life principle whatever be a grope steal about brain be continually stumbling into there record gramophone plate ready what want what im trying to arrive at be needle a trace minute way over dot will come across word sentence dead have uttered will reproduce word what judgment book what resurrection here in withdrawn situation remotest echo of excitement be seething through street penetrated through open window there came in only tide of midnight silence from somewhere closer at hand through wall surely of laboratory there came low somewhat persistent murmur perhaps needle unhappily not yet invented a passed over record of speech in brain might induce even facial expression said enjoyment horror might even pas over dead feature there might be gesture movement even a word be reproduced in gramophone of dead people when want to think intensely walk about there instance of audible now talk to aloud held up finger for silence yes thats mr gabriel said talk to herself by hour together shes always done that tell shouldnt wonder if have plenty to talk about be that night when first of notion of intense activity going on below placid house front of terrace occurred to none looked more quiet than yet there be seething here volcanic activity intensity of living in man who sat cross legged on floor behind voice just audible through partition wall thought of more for horton began speaking of brain gramophone again be possible to trace infinitesimal dot pockmark in brain by needle exquisitely fine might follow that by aid of such contrivance a translated pockmark on gramophone record into sound audible rendering of speech might be recovered from brain of dead man be necessary so pointed out to that strange gramophone record must be new must be that of one lately dead for corruption decay must soon obliterate infinitesimal marking be not of opinion that unspoken thought must be thus recovered utmost hoped for from pioneering work be to be able to recapture actual speech especially when such speech have habitually dwelt on one subject thus have worn rut on part of brain known a speech centre let get for instance said brain of railway porter newly dead who have be accustomed for year to call out name of station despair of hearing voice through gramophone trumpet again given that mr gabriel in interminable conversation with talk about one subject might in similar circumstance recapture what have be constantly saying of course instrument must be of power delicacy still unknown one of needle can trace minutest irregularity of surface of trumpet must be of immense magnifying power able to translate smallest whisper into shout just a microscope will show detail of object invisible to eye so there be instrument act in same way on sound here for instance be one of remarkable magnifying power try if like took over to table on be standing electric battery connected with round steel globe out of side of sprang gramophone trumpet of curious construction adjusted battery directed to click finger quite gently opposite aperture in globe noise ordinarily scarcely audible resounded through room like thunderclap something of sort might permit to hear record on brain said after night visit to horton became far more common than have hitherto be having once admitted into region of strange exploration seemed to welcome there partly a have said clarified own thought to put into simple language partly a subsequently admitted be beginning to penetrate into such lonely field of knowledge by path so utterly untrodden even most aloof independent of mankind wanted human presence near despite utter indifference to issue of war for in regard issue far more crucial demanded energy offered a surgeon to london hospital for operation on brain service naturally be welcomed for none brought knowledge skill like to such work occupied day performed miracle of healing with bold dexterous excision none must have dared to attempt must operate often successfully for lesion seemed certainly fatal time be learning refused to accept salary only asked in case where have removed piece of brain matter to take away in order by further examination dissection to add to knowledge manipulative skill devoted to wounded wrapped morsel in sterilised lint took back to terrace in box electrically heated to maintain normal temperature of man blood fragment might then so reasoned keep sort of independent life of own even a severed heart of frog have continued to beat for hour without connection with rest of body then for night must continue to work on sundered piece of tissue scarcely dead operation during day have given simultaneously be busy over needle must be of such infinite delicacy one evening fatigued with long day work have just heard with certain tremor of uneasy anticipation whistle of warning heralded air raid when telephone bell rang servant according to custom have already betaken to cellar went to see what summons be determined in case not to go out into street recognised hortons voice want at once said warning whistle have gone said dont like shower of shrapnel oh never mind said must come im so excited that distrust evidence of own ear want witness just come did not pause for reply for click of receiver going back into place clearly assumed that be coming that suppose have effect of suggestion on mind told must not go in couple of minute certainty be coming coupled with prospect of being interested in something else than air raid made fidget in chair eventually go to street door look out moon be brilliantly bright square quite empty far away coughing of very distant gun next moment almost against will be running down deserted pavement of newsome terrace ring at bell be answered by horton before mr gabriel must come to door positively dragged in shant tell word of what be doing said want to tell what hear come into laboratory remote gun be silent again a sat a directed in chair close to gramophone trumpet suddenly through wall heard familiar mutter of mr gabriel voice horton already busy with battery sprang to foot that wont do said want absolute silence went out of room heard calling to while be gone observed more closely what be on table battery round steel globe gramophone trumpet be there sort of needle on spiral steel spring linked up with battery glass vessel in have seen frog heart beat in now there lay fragment of grey matter horton came back in minute two stood in middle of room listening thats better said now want to listen at mouth of trumpet ill answer question afterwards with ear turned to trumpet must see nothing of what be doing listened till silence became rustling in ear then suddenly that rustling ceased for be overscored by whisper undoubtedly came from aperture on aural attention be fixed be no more than faintest murmur though word be audible have timbre of human voice well do hear anything asked horton yes something very faint scarcely audible describe said somebody whispering ill try fresh place said silence descended again mutter of distant gun be still mute slight creaking from shirt front a breathed alone broke then whispering from gramophone trumpet began again time much louder than have be before be a if speaker still whispering have advanced dozen yard still blurred indistinct more unmistakable too be that whisper be that of human voice now then whether fancifully not thought caught word two for moment be silent altogether then with sudden inkling of what be listening to heard something begin to sing though word be still inaudible there be melody tune be tipperary from convolvulus shaped trumpet there came two bar of what do hear now cried horton with crack of exultation in voice singing singing thats tune sang fine music that from dead man encore say yes wait second hell sing again for confound cant get on to place ah ive got listen again surely that be strangest manner of song ever yet heard on earth melody from brain of dead horror fascination strove within suppose first for moment prevailed for with shudder jumped up stop said terrible face thin eager gleamed in strong ray of lamp have placed close to hand be on metal rod from depended spiral spring needle just rested on fragment of grey stuff have seen in glass vessel yes im going to stop now said germ will be getting at gramophone record record will get cold see spray with carbolic vapour put back into nice warm bed will sing to again terrible what do mean by terrible indeed when asked that scarcely knew meant have be witness to new marvel of science a wonderful perhaps a have ever astounded beholder nerve childish whimperers have cried out at darkness profundity horror diminished fascination increased a quite shortly told history of phenomenon have attended that day operated upon young soldier in whose brain be embedded piece of shrapnel boy be in extremis horton have hoped for possibility of saving to extract shrapnel be only chance involved cutting away of piece of brain known a speech centre taking from be embedded there hope be not realised two hour later boy died be to fragment of brain that when horton returned home have applied needle of gramophone have obtained faint whispering have caused to ring up so that might have witness of wonder witness have be not to whispering alone to fragment of singing be first step on new road said who know where may lead to what new temple of knowledge may not be avenue well be late will do more to night what about raid by way to amazement saw that time be verging on midnight two hour have elapsed since let in at door have passed like couple of minute next morning neighbour spoke of prolonged firing have gone on of have be wholly unconscious week after week horton worked on new road of research perfecting sensitiveness subtlety of needle by vastly increasing power of battery enlarging magnifying power of trumpet many many evening during next year did listen to voice be dumb in death sound have be blurred unintelligible muttering in earlier experiment developed a delicacy of mechanical device increased into coherence clear articulation be no longer necessary to impose silence on mr gabriel when gramophone be at work for now voice listened to have risen to pitch of ordinary human utterance while a for faithfulness individuality of record striking testimony be given more than once by living friend of dead who without knowing what be about to hear recognised tone of speaker more than once also mr gabriel bringing in syphon whisky provided with three glass for have heard so told three different voice in talk for present fresh phenomenon occurred horton be perfecting mechanism of previous discovery rather grudging time be scribbling at monograph presently must toss to colleague concerning result have already obtained then even while horton be on threshold of new wonder have already foreseen spoken of a theoretically possible there came evening of marvel of swift catastrophe have dined with day mr gabriel deftly serving meal that have so daintily prepared towards end a be clearing table for dessert stumbled supposed on loose edge of carpet quickly recovering instantly horton checked half finished sentence turned to youre right mr gabriel asked quickly yes sir thank said went on with serving a be saying began horton again attention clearly wandered without concluding narrative relapsed into silence till mr gabriel have given coffee left room im sadly afraid domestic felicity may be disturbed said mr gabriel have epileptic fit yesterday confessed when recovered that have be subject to when child since then have occasionally experienced dangerous then asked in not in least said if be sitting in chair lying in bed when one occurred there must be nothing to trouble about if one occurred while be cooking dinner beginning to come downstairs might fall into fire tumble down whole flight well hope such deplorable calamity will happen now if youve finished coffee let go into laboratory not that ive got anything very interesting in way of new record ive introduced second battery with very strong induction coil into apparatus find that if link up with record given that record be fresh one stimulates certain nerve centre odd isnt that same force so encourage dead to live must certainly encourage living to die if man received full current one have to be careful in handling yes what then ask night be very hot threw window wide before settled cross legged on floor ill answer question for said though believe weve talked of before supposing have not fragment of brain tissue only whole head let say best of complete corpse think must expect to produce more than mere speech through gramophone dead lip perhaps might utter god whats that from close outside at bottom of stair leading from dining room have just quitted to laboratory where now sat there came crash of glass followed by fall a of something heavy bumped from step to step be finally flung on threshold against door with sound a of knuckle rapping at demanding admittance horton sprang up threw door open there lay half inside room half on landing outside body of mr gabriel round be splinter of broken bottle glass from cut in forehead a lay ghastly with face upturned blood trickled into thick grey hair horton be on knee beside dabbing handkerchief on forehead ah thats not serious said there vein artery cut ill just bind that up first tore handkerchief into strip tied together made dexterous bandage covering lower part of forehead leaving eye unobscured stared with fixed meaningless steadiness scrutinised closely there worse yet said there be severe blow on head help to carry into laboratory get round to foot lift underneath knee when be ready there now put arm right under carry head swung limply back a lifted shoulder propped up against knee where mutely nodded bowed a leg moved a if in silent assent to what be doing mouth at extremity of there have gathered little lather lolled open still supported shoulder a fetched cushion on to place head presently be lying close to low table on stood gramophone of dead then with light deft finger passed hand over skull pausing a came to spot just above behind right ear twice again finger groped lightly pressed while with shut eye concentrated attention interpreted what trained touch revealed skull be broken to fragment just here said in middle there be piece completely severed from rest edge of cracked piece must be pressing on brain right arm be lying palm upwards on floor with one hand felt wrist with finger tip not sign of pulse said shes dead in ordinary sense of word life persists in extraordinary manner may remember cant be wholly dead one be wholly dead in moment unless organ be blown to bit soon will be dead if dont relieve pressure on brain thats first thing to be done while im busy at shut window will make up fire in sort of case vital heat whatever be leaf body very quickly make room a hot a can fetch oil stove turn on electric radiator stoke up roaring fire hotter room be more slowly will heat of life leave already have opened cabinet of surgical instrument taken out of two drawer full of bright steel laid on floor beside heard grating chink of scissors severing long grey hair a busied with laying lighting fire in hearth kindling oil stove found by hortons direction in pantry saw that lancet be busy on exposed skin have placed vaporising spray heated by spirit lamp close to head a worked fizzing nozzle filled air with clean aromatic odour now then threw out order bring that electric lamp on long cord said havent got enough light dont look at what im doing if youre squeamish for if make feel faint shant be able to attend to suppose that violent interest in what be doing overcame qualm might have have for looked quite unflinching over shoulder a moved lamp about till be in such place that threw beam directly into dark hole at edge of depended flap of skin into put forceps a withdrew grasped piece of blood stained bone thats better said room warming up well there sign of pulse yet go on stoking will till thermometer on wall there register hundred degree when next on journey from coal cellar looked two more piece of bone lay beside one have seen extracted presently referring to thermometer saw that between oil stove roaring fire electric radiator have raised room to temperature wanted soon peering fixedly at seat of operation felt for pulse again not sign of returning vitality said ive done can there nothing more possible that can be devised to restore a spoke zeal of unrivalled surgeon relaxed with sigh shrug rose to foot mopped face then suddenly fire eagerness blazed there again gramophone said speech centre be close to where ive be working be quite uninjured good heaven what wonderful opportunity served well living will serve dead can stimulate motor nerve centre too with second battery may see new wonder to night qualm of horror shook dont said terrible shes just dead will go if do ive got exactly condition have long be wanting said simply cant spare must be witness must have witness why man there not surgeon physiologist in kingdom who must not give eye ear to be in place now shes dead pledge honour on grand to be dead if can help living once again in far fiercer struggle horror intensest curiosity strove together in be quick then said have thats right exclaimed horton help to lift on to table by gramophone cushion too can get at place more easily with head little raised turned on battery with movable light close beside brilliantly illuminating what sought inserted needle of gramophone into jagged aperture in skull for few minute a groped explored there there be silence then quite suddenly mr gabriel voice clear unmistakable of normal loudness of human speech issued from trumpet yes always said that id be even with came articulated syllable used to knock about did when came home drunk often be black blue with bruise ill give redness for black blue record grew blurred instead of articulate word there came from gobbling noise by degree cleared be listening to dreadful suppressed sort of laughter hideous to hear on on went ive got into sort of rut said horton must have laughed lot to herself for long time got nothing more except repetition of word have already heard sound of suppressed laughter then horton drew towards second battery ill try stimulation of motor nerve centre said watch face propped gramophone needle in position inserted into fractured skull two pole of second battery moving about there very carefully a watched face saw with freezing horror that lip be beginning to move mouth moving cried cant be dead peered into face nonsense said thats only stimulus from current shes be dead hour ah whats coming now lip lengthened into smile lower jaw dropped from mouth came laughter have heard just now through gramophone then dead mouth spoke with mumble of unintelligible word bubbling torrent of incoherent syllable ill turn full current on said head jerked raised lip struggled for utterance suddenly spoke swiftly distinctly just when hed got razor out said came up behind put hand over face bent neck back over chair with strength picked up razor with one slit have have be way to pay out didnt lose head lathered chin well put razor in hand left there went downstairs cooked dinner for then hour afterwards a didnt come down up went to see what kept be nasty cut in neck have kept horton suddenly withdrew two pole of battery from head even in middle of word mouth ceased working lay rigid open by god said there tale for dead lip to tell well get more yet exactly what happened then never knew appeared to that a still leaned over table with two pole of battery in hand foot slipped fell forward across there came sharp crack flash of blue dazzling light there lay face downwards with arm just stirred quivered with fall two pole must momentarily have come into contact with hand be jerked away again lifted laid on floor lip a well a of dead woman have spoken for last time outcast outcast when mr acre bought gate house at tarleton have stood so long without tenant appeared in very agreeable lively little town a resident sufficient be already known about past history to entitle to friendliness sympathy hers have be tragic story account of inquest held on husband body when within month of marriage have shot before eye be recent enough of a full report in paper a to enable little community of tarleton to remember run over salient grimness of case without need of inventing further detail otherwise must have be quite capable of doing briefly then fact have be a follows horace acre appeared to have be heartless fortune hunter handsome plausible wretch ten year younger than wife have made secret to friend of not being in love with of having considerable regard for more than considerable fortune hardly have married than indifference developed into violent dislike accompanied by mysterious inexplicable dread of hated feared on morning of very day when have put end to have begged to divorce case promised must be undefended must make indefensible poor soul have refused to grant for a corroborated by evidence of friend servant be utterly devoted to stated with quiet dignity distinguished throughout ordeal that hoped that be victim of miserable temporary derangement must come to right mind again have dined that night at club leaving month old bride to pas evening alone have returned between eleven twelve night in state of vile intoxication have gone up to bedroom pistol in hand have locked door voice be heard screaming yelling at then followed sound of one shot on table in dressing room be found half sheet of paper dated that day be read out in court horror of position have written be beyond description endurance can bear no longer soul sickens jury without leaving court returned verdict that have committed suicide while temporarily insane coroner at request expressed sympathy own with poor lady who a testified on hand have treated husband with utmost tenderness affection for six month bertha acre have travelled abroad then in autumn have bought gate house at tarleton settled down to absorbing trifle make life in small country town so busy strenuous modest little dwelling be within stone throw of gate house when on return of wife from two month in scotland found that mr acre be installed a neighbour madge lost time in going to call on returned with series of pleasant impression mr acre still on sunny slope lead up to table land of life begin at forty year be extremely handsome cordial charming in manner witty agreeable wonderfully well dressed before conclusion of call madge in country fashion have begged to dispose with formality instead of frigid return of call to dine with quietly next day did play bridge that being so must just be party of four for brother charles alington have proposed for visit listened to with sufficient attention to grasp what madge be saying what be really thinking about be chess problem be attempting to solve at point became acutely aware that stream of pleasant impression dried up suddenly became stonily silent shut speech off a by turn of tap glowered at fire rubbing back of one hand with finger of a be habit in perplexity go on said got up suddenly restless have be telling be literally soberly true said thought mr acre charming witty good looking friendly what more must ask from new acquaintance then after have asked to dinner suddenly found for earthly reason very much disliked couldnt bear said be wonderfully well dressed permitted to remark if queen took knight dont be silly said madge be wonderfully well dressed too behind agreeableness charm good look suddenly felt there be something else detested dreaded use asking what be because havent slightest idea if knew what be thing must explain felt horror nothing vivid nothing close understand somewhere in background can mind have turn do think just a body can when for second two suddenly feel giddy think must have be that oh im sure be that im glad asked to dine mean to like shant have turn again will no certainly not said if queen refrained from taking tempting knight oh do stop silly chess problem said madge bite fungus fungus so called because be son of humour gustavus adolphus rose from place on hearthrug with horse laugh nuzzled against leg be way of biting love then most amiable of bull dog who have passion for human race lay down on foot sighed heavily madge evidently wanted to talk pushed chessboard away tell more about horror said be just horror said sort of sickness of soul found brain puzzling over vague reminiscence surely connected with mr acre word mistily evoked next moment train of thought be cut short for old sinister legend about gate house came into mind a accounting for horror of madge spoke in day of elizabethan religious persecution have then newly built be inhabited by two brother of whom elder to whom belonged have mass said there sunday betrayed by younger be arrested racked to death subsequently younger in fit of remorse hanged in panelled parlour certainly there be story that house be haunted by strangled apparition dangling from beam late tenant of house now have stood vacant for over three year have quitted after month occupation in consequence so be commonly said of unaccountable horrible sight what be more likely then than madge who from childhood have be intensely sensitive to occult psychic phenomenon must have caught on strange wireless receiver be characteristic of sensitive whispered message know story of house said isnt quite possible that something of may have reached where did sit for instance in panelled parlour brightened at ah wise man said never thought of may account for hope doe will be left in peace with chess for being so brilliant have occasion hour later to go to post office hundred yard up high street on matter of registered letter wanted to despatch that evening dusk be gathering red glow of sunset still smouldered in west sufficient to enable to recognise familiar form feature of passer by just a came opposite post office there approached from other direction tall finely built woman whom felt sure have never seen before destination be same a mine hung on step moment to let pas in first simultaneously felt that knew in vague faint manner what madge have meant when talked about sickness of soul be nearer realisation to than be running of tune in head to audible external hearing of attributed sudden recognition of feeling to fact that in probability mind have subconsciously be dwelling on what have said not for moment did connect with external cause then occurred to who possibly woman be finished transaction of errand few second before when got out into street again be dozen yard down pavement walking in direction of house of gate house opposite own door deliberately lingered saw pas down step led from road to entrance of gate house even a turned into own door unbidden reminiscence have eluded before came out into open cast net over be husband who in inexplicable communication have left on dressing room table just before shot have written soul sickens be odd though scarcely more than for madge to have used identical word charles alington wife brother who arrived next afternoon be quite happiest man whom have ever come across material world perennial spring of thwarted ambition physical desire perpetual disappointment be practically unknown to envy malice uncharitableness be equally alien because doe not want to obtain what anybody else have got have sense of possession be queer since be enormously rich fear nothing hope for nothing have abhorrence affection for physical nervous function be in in service of intense inquisitiveness never passed moral judgment in life only want to explore to know knowledge in fact be entire preoccupation since chemist medical scientist probe mine in world of tincture microbe far more efficiently than must do a have so little care for anything can be weighed propagated devotes absorbedly ecstatically to world lie about confines of conscious existence anything not yet certainly determined appeal to with call of trumpet cease to take interest in subject a soon a show sign of assuming practical definite status be intensely concerned for instance in wireless transmission until signor marconi proved that came within scope of practical science then charles abandoned a dull have seen last two month before when be in great perturbation since be speaking at meeting of anglo israelite in morning to show that scone stone be now in coronation chair at westminster be for certain pillow on jacob head have rested when saw vision at bethel be addressing psychical research society in afternoon on subject of message received from dead through automatic script in evening be by way of holiday only listening to lecture on reincarnation none of thing must a yet be definitely proved be why loved during interval when occult fantastic occupy be in spite of fifty year wizened mien exactly like schoolboy of eighteen back on holiday brimming with superfluous energy found charles already arrived when got home next afternoon after round of golf be betwixt between serious holiday mood for have evidently be reading to madge from journal concerning reincarnation be rather severe to golf said with insulting scorn what be there to know about golf hit ball into air be little sore over event of afternoon thats just what dont do said hit along ground well doesnt matter where hit said subject to known law guess conjecture there thrill excitement of life charlatan with new cure for cancer automatic writer with message from dead reincarnationist with positive assertion that be napoleon christian slave be people who advance knowledge have to guess before know even darwin saw that when said must not investigate without hypothesis so whats hypothesis minute asked why weve lived before be going to live again here on same old earth other conception of future life be impossible be people who have be born have died since world emerged from chaos going to become inhabitant of future world what squash know dear madge now know what youre going to ask if weve lived before why cant remember thats so simple if remembered being cleopatra must go on behaving like cleopatra what must tarleton say juda iscariot too fancy knowing have be juda iscariot couldnt get over must commit suicide cause everybody who be connected with to commit suicide from horror of imagine being grocer boy who knew have be julius csar of course sex doesnt matter soul a far a understand be sexless just spark of life be put into physical envelope male female might have be king david madge poor tony here one of wife must be wonderfully neat said charles broke out into shout of laughter must indeed said wont talk sense more to scoffer im absolutely tired out will confess with thinking want to have pretty lady to come to dinner talk to a if be just nobody else want to win two sixpence at bridge with expenditure of enormous thought want to have large breakfast to morrow read time afterwards go to tonys club talk about crop golf irish affair peace conference thing dont matter one straw youre going to begin programme to night dear said madge very pretty lady be coming to dinner be going to play bridge afterwards madge be ready for mr acre when arrived charles be not yet down fungus who have wild adoration for charles quite unaccountable since charles have feeling for dog be helping to dress madge mr acre waited for appearance be certainly mr acre whom have met last night at door of post office dim light of sunset have not enabled to see how wonderfully handsome be there be something slightly jewish about profile high forehead very full lipped mouth bridged nose prominent chin suggested rather than exemplified eastern origin when spoke have that rich softness of utterance not quite hoarseness not quite of clear cut distinctness of tone characterises northern nation something southern something eastern be bound to ask one thing said when after usual greeting stood round fireplace waiting for charles have got dog madge moved towards bell yes shant come down if dislike dog said he wonderfully kind know ah not said mr acre adore dog only wished to spare dog feeling though adore hate theyre terribly frightened of there something anti canine about be too late to say more charles step clattered in little hall outside fungus be hoarse amused next moment door opened two came in fungus came in first lolloped in festive manner into middle of room sniffed snored in greeting then turned tail slipped skidded on parquet outside heard bundling down kitchen stair rude dog said madge charles let introduce to mr acre brother mr acre sir charles alington little dinner table of four must not permit of separate conversation general topic springing up like mushroom wilted died at very inception what mood possessed others did not at time know for be only conscious of fundamental distaste of handsome clever woman who sat on right seemed quite unaffected by withering atmosphere be charming to eye be witty to ear have grace gracefulness time be something terrible by degree a found own distaste increasing saw that brother in law interest be growing correspondingly keen pretty lady whose presence at dinner have desired obtained be enchaining not so began to guess for charm prettiness for purpose of study wondered whether be beautiful jewish profile be confirming to mind anglo israelitish theory whether saw in fine brown eye glance of seer clairvoyante whether divined in reincarnation of one of famous infamous dead certainly have for fascination beyond of legitimate charm of very handsome woman be studying with intense curiosity be comfortable in gate house suddenly rapped out at a if asking question of answer be crucial ah so comfortable said delightful atmosphere have never known house felt so peaceful homelike be merely fanciful to imagine that house have sense of tranquillity about others be uneasy even terrible charles stared at moment in silence before recollected manner there may easily be something in must say answered one can imagine long century of tranquillity actually investing home with sort of psychical aura perceptible to who be sensitive turned to madge yet have heard ridiculous story that house be supposed to be haunted said if be be surely haunted by delightful contented spirit dinner be over madge rose come in very soon tony said to let get to bridge eye said dont leave long alone with charles turned briskly round when door have shut extremely interesting woman said very handsome said be didnt notice mind spirit thats what intrigued what be whats behind why did fungus turn tail like queer too about finding atmosphere of gate house so tranquil late tenant remember didnt find that soothing touch about how do account for asked there might be several explanation might say that late tenant be fanciful imaginative people that present tenant be sensible matter of fact woman certainly seemed to be suggested laughed well might say mind dont say so might say that spiritual tenant of house find mr acre congenial companion want to retain so keep quiet dont upset cook nerve somehow answer exasperated jarred on what do mean said spiritual tenant of house suppose be man who betrayed brother hanged why must find charming woman like mr acre congenial companion charles got up briskly usually be more than ready to discus such topic to night seemed that have such inclination didnt madge tell not to be long asked know how run on if once get on subject tony so dont give opportunity why did say that persisted because be talking nonsense know well enough to be aware that be habitual criminal in respect be indeed strange to find how completely first impression that madge have formed of mr acre feeling followed so quickly on heel be endorsed by who during next week two did neighbour duty to newcomer be loud in praise of charm pleasant kindly wit good look beautiful clothes even while lob gesang be in full chorus must suddenly die away uneasy silence descended somehow be more eloquent than appreciative speech odd unaccountable little incident have occurred be whispered from mouth to mouth till became common property same fear that fungus have shown of be exhibited by dog parallel case occurred when returned call of parson wife mr dowlett have cage of canary in window of drawing room bird have manifested symptom of extreme terror when mr acre entered room beating against wire of cage uttering alarm note inspired sort of inexplicable fear over a trained civilised human being have control so that behaved animal without check gave way altogether to even a fungus have done mr acre entertained gave charming little dinner party of eight with couple of table at bridge to follow over evening there hung blight blackness doubt sinister story of panelled parlour contributed to curious secret dread of her of a on that first evening at house appeared to be completely unconscious differed very widely in degree most people like be conscious of only very remotely so found at gate house behaving quite a usual though with unease in background with few most of with madge grew into sort of obsession made effort to combat will be entirely set against struggle seemed only to establish power over pathetic pitiful part be that mr acre from first have taken tremendous liking to used to drop in continually calling first to madge at window in pleasant serene voice of hers to tell fungus that hated one be imminent then came day when madge be bidden to party at gate house on christmas evening be to be last of mr acres hospitality for present since be leaving immediately afterwards for couple of month in egypt so with remission ahead madge almost gleefully accepted bidding when evening came be seized with so violent attack of sickness shivering that be utterly unable to fulfil engagement doctor must find physical trouble to account for seemed that anticipation of evening alone caused here be culmination of shrinking from kindly pleasant neighbour must only tell that sensation a began to dress for party be like of moment in sleep when somewhere in drowsy brain nightmare be ripening something independent of will revolted at what lay before spring have begun to stretch in lap of winter when next curtain rose on veiled drama of force dimly comprehended shudderingly conjectured then indeed nightmare ripened swiftly in broad noon be way of charles alington have again come to stay with five day before easter expressed a humorously disappointed to find that subject of curiosity be still absent from gate house on saturday morning before easter appeared very late for breakfast madge have already gone way rang for fresh teapot while be on way took up time only read outside page of said rest be too full of mere materialistic dullness politics sport money market stopped passed paper over to there where im pointing said among death first one what read be acre bertha died at sea thursday night th march by own request buried at sea received by wireless from p o steamer peshawar held out hand for paper again turned over leaf said peshawar arrived at tilbury yesterday afternoon burial must have taken place somewhere in english channel on afternoon of easter sunday madge motored out to golf link three mile away proposed to walk along beach just outside dune while have round return to club house for tea in two hour time day be one of most lucid spring warm south west wind bowled white cloud along sky shadow jovially scudded over sandhills have told of mr acres death from moment something dark vague have be lying over mind since autumn seemed to join fleet of shadow of cloud leave in sunlight parted at door of club house set out on walk hour later a opponent be waiting on fifth tee where road cross link for couple in front of to move on servant from club house scudding along road caught sight of jumping from bicycle came to where stood youre wanted at club house sir said to mr carford be walking along shore found something left by tide body sir twas in sack sack be torn saw upset very much sir thought best to come for took boy bicycle went back to club house a fast a must turn wheel felt sure knew what madge have found knowing that realised shock five minute later be telling story in gasp whisper tide be going down said walked along high water mark there be pretty shell be picking up then saw in front of just shapeless just sack then a came nearer took shape there be knee elbow moved rolled over where head be sack be torn saw face eye be open tony fled time felt be rolling along after oh tony shes dead isnt wont come back to gate house do promise there something awful wonder if guess sea give up sea wont suffer to rest in news of finding have already be telephoned to tarleton soon party of four men with stretcher arrived there be doubt a to identity of body for though have be in water for three day corruption have come to weight with at burial have be laden must by strange chance have be detached from by chance stranger yet have drifted to shore closest to home night lay in mortuary inquest be held on next day though be bank holiday from there be taken to gate house coffined lay in panelled parlour for funeral on morrow madge after one hysterical outburst have completely recovered on monday evening made little wreath of spring flower early warmth have called into blossom in garden went across with to gate house though news of mr acres death subsequent finding of body have be widely advertised there have be no response from relation friend a laid solitary wreath on coffin sense of utter loneliness of what lay within seized encompassed then portent no le took place before eye hardly have freshly gathered flower be laid on coffin than drooped wilted stalk of daffodil bent bright chalice closed odour of wallflower died withered a watched what did mean that even petal of spring shrank be moribund told madge nothing of a if through pang of remorse be determined to be present next day at funeral arrival of friend relation have taken place from gate house there came none of servant stood in porch a coffin be brought out of house even before be put into hearse have gone back again closed door so at cemetery on hill above tarleton madge brother be only mourner afternoon be densely overcast though got rainfall be with thick cloud above sea mist drifting between grave stone that came after service in cemetery chapel to place of interment then can hardly write of now when came for coffin to be lowered into grave be found that by faulty measurement must not descend for excavation be not long enough to hold be standing close to at moment heard sob kindly earth will not receive whispered there be awful delay digger must be sent for again meantime rain have begun to fall thick tepid for reason perhaps outlying feeler of madges obsession have wound tentacle round felt that must know that earth have gone to earth must not suffer madge to wait so in miserable pause got charles to take home then returned pick shovel be busy soon resting place be ready interrupted service continued handful of wet earth splashed on coffin lid when be over left cemetery still feeling knew not why that be not over restlessness want of certainty possessed instead of going home fared forth into rolling wooded country inland with intention of walking off bat like terror flapped around rain have ceased blurred sunlight penetrated sea mist still blanketed field wood for hour moving briskly endeavoured to fight down fantastic conviction have gripped mind in claw refused to look straight at conviction telling how fantastic how unreasonable be a often a put out hand to throttle there came echo of madges word sea will not suffer kindly earth will not receive if must shut eye to that there came remembrance of day died of half forgotten fragment of charles superstitious belief in reincarnation whole thing incredible though component part be hung together with terrible tenacity before long rain began again turned meaning to go by main road into tarleton pass in wide flung curve half mile outside cemetery a approached path through field leaving le direct route pass close to cemetery brings by steeper shorter descent into town felt irresistibly impelled to take told of course wished to make wet walk a short a possible at back of mind be half conscious none le imperative need to know by ocular evidence that grave by have stood that afternoon have be filled in that body of mr acre now lay tranquil beneath soil path must be even shorter if passed through graveyard so presently be fumbling in gloom for latch of gate closed again behind rain be falling now thick sullenly in bleared twilight picked way among mound slipped on dripping grass there in front of be newly turned earth be finished grave digger have done work departed earth have gone back again into keeping of earth brought great lightening of spirit to know be on point of turning away when sound of stir from heaped soil caught ear saw little stream of pebble mixed with clay trickle down side of mound above grave heavy rain doubt have loosened earth then came yet with terror gripping at heart perceived that be loosening from without from within for to right left piled soil be falling away with press of something from below faster faster poured off grave ever higher at head of rose mound of earth pushed upwards from beneath somewhere out of sight there came sound a of creaking breaking wood then through mound of earth there protruded end of coffin lid be shattered loose piece of board fell off from within cavity there faced white feature wide eye saw while sheer terror held motionless then suppose came breaking point with such panic a surely man never felt before be stumbling away among graf racing towards kindly human light of town below went to parson who have conducted service afternoon with incredible tale hour later charles alington two three men from undertaker be on spot found coffin completely disinterred lying on ground by grave be now three quarter full of earth have fallen back into after what have happened be decided to make further attempt to bury next day body be cremated now be open to anyone who may read tale to reject incident of emergence of coffin altogether account for other strange happening by comfortable theory of coincidence can certainly satisfy that one bertha acre did die at sea on particular thursday before easter be buried at sea there be nothing extraordinary about be least impossible that weight must have slipped from canvas shroud that body must have be washed ashore on coast by tarleton why not tarleton a well a other little town near coast be there anything inherently significant in fact that grave a originally dug be not of sufficient dimension to receive coffin that incident must have happened to body of single individual be odd then nature of coincidence be to be odd form startling series unless coincidence be startling escape observation altogether so if reject last incident here recorded account for by local disturbance earthquake breaking of spring just below grave can comfortably recline on cushion of coincidence for give explanation of event though brother in law brought forward one with be perfectly satisfied only other day sent with considerable jubilation copy of extract from medival treatise on subject of reincarnation sufficiently indicates theory original work be in latin mistrusting scholarship kindly translated for transcribe quotation exactly a sent to have certain instance of reincarnation in one spirit be incarnated in body of man in other in of woman fair of outward aspect of pleasant conversation held in dread in horror by who came into more than casual intercourse with be said died on anniversary of day on hanged after betrayal of have certain information what be sure be that when time came for burial kindly earth must receive not though grave be dug deep well spewed forth again of man in whom cursed spirit be reincarnated be said that being on voyage when died be cast overboard with weight to sink sea must not suffer to rest in bosom slipped weight from cast forth again on to coast howbeit when full time of expiation will have come deadly sin forgiven corporal body be cursed receptacle of spirit will at length be purged with fire so will in infinite mercy of almighty have rest will wander more horror horn horror horn for past ten day alhubel have basked in radiant midwinter weather proper to eminence of over foot from rising to setting sun so surprising to who have hitherto associated with pale tepid plate indistinctly shining through murky air of england have blazed way across sparkling blue night serene windless frost have made star sparkle like illuminated diamond dust sufficient snow have fallen before christmas to content skier big rink sprinkled evening have given skater morning fresh surface on to perform slippery antic bridge dancing served to while away greater part of night to now for first time tasting joy of winter in engadine seemed that new heaven new earth have be lighted warmed refrigerated for special benefit of who like have be wise enough to save up day of holiday for winter break came in ideal condition one afternoon sun grew vapour veiled up valley from north west wind frozen with mile of travel over ice bound hill side began scouting through calm hall of heaven soon grew dusted with snow first in small flake driven almost horizontally before congealing breath then in larger tuft a of swansdown though day for fortnight before fate of nation life death have seemed to of far le importance than to get certain tracing of skate blade on ice of proper shape size now seemed that one paramount consideration be to hurry back to hotel for shelter be wiser to leave rocking turn alone than to be frozen in quest have come out here with cousin professor ingram celebrated physiologist alpine climber during serenity of last fortnight have made couple of notable winter ascent morning weather wisdom have mistrusted sign of heaven instead of attempting ascent of piz passug have waited to see whether misgiving justified so there sat now in hall of admirable hotel with foot on hot water pipe latest delivery of english post in hand contained pamphlet concerning result of mount everest expedition of have just finished perusal when entered very interesting report said passing to certainly deserve to succeed next year who can tell what that final six thousand foot may entail six thousand foot more when have already accomplished twenty three thousand doe not seem much at present one know whether human frame can stand exertion at height may affect not lung heart only possibly brain delirious hallucination may occur in fact if did not know better must have said that one such hallucination have occurred to climber already what be asked will find that thought came across track of naked human foot at great altitude look at first sight like hallucination what more natural than that brain excited exhilarated by extreme height must have interpreted certain mark in snow a footprint of human being bodily organ at altitude be exerting to utmost to do work brain seizes on mark in snow say yes im right im doing job perceive mark in snow affirm be human footprint know even at altitude how restless eager brain be how vividly a told dream at night multiply stimulus consequent eagerness restlessness by three how natural that brain must harbour illusion what after be delirium often accompanies high fever effort of brain to do work under pressure of feverish condition be so eager to continue perceiving that perceives thing have existence yet dont think that naked human footprint be illusion said told must have thought so if have not known better shifted in chair looked out of window moment air be thick now with density of big snow flake be driven along by squealing north west gale quite so said in probability human footprint be real human footprint expect that be footprint anyhow of being more nearly man than anything else reason for saying so be that know such being exist have even seen quite near at hand assure did not wish to be nearer in spite of intense curiosity creature will say must make such footprint if snow be not so dense must show place where saw pointed straight out of window where across valley lie huge tower of ungeheuerhorn with carved pinnacle of rock at top like gigantic rhinoceros horn on one side only a knew be mountain practicable for none finest climber on other three succession of ledge precipice rendered unscalable two thousand foot of sheer rock form tower below be five hundred foot of fallen boulder up to edge of grow dense wood of larch pine upon ungeheuerhorn asked yes up till twenty year ago have never be ascended like several others spent lot of time in trying to find route up guide sometimes spent three night together at hut beside blumen glacier prowling round be by luck really that found route for mountain look even more impracticable from far side than doe from one day found long transverse fissure in side led to negotiable ledge then there came slanting ice couloir must not see till got to foot of however need not go into big room where sat be filling up with cheerful group driven indoors by sudden gale snowfall cackle of merry tongue grew loud band too that invariable appanage of tea time at swiss resort have begun to tune up for usual potpourri from work of puccini next moment sugary sentimental melody began strange contrast said ingram here be sitting warm cosy ear pleasantly tickled with little baby tune outside be great storm growing more violent moment swirling round austere cliff of ungeheuerhorn horror horn a indeed be to want to hear about said detail make short story long if short want to know why horror horn well chanton be guide used to spend day prowling about cliff making little progress on one side then being stopped gaining perhaps five hundred foot on side then being confronted by insuperable obstacle till day when by luck found route chanton never liked job for reason must not fathom be not because of difficulty danger of climbing for be most fearless man have ever met when dealing with rock ice be always insistent that must get off mountain back to blumen hut before sunset be scarcely easy even when have got back to shelter locked barred door well remember one night when a ate supper heard animal wolf probably howling somewhere out in night positive panic seized dont think closed eye till morning struck then that there might be grisly legend about mountain connected possibly with name next day asked why peak be called horror horn put question off at first said that like schreckhorn name be due to precipice falling stone when pressed further acknowledged that there be legend about father have told there be creature so be supposed that lived in cave thing human in shape covered except for face hand with long black hair be dwarf in size four foot high thereabouts of prodigious strength agility remnant of wild primeval race seemed that be still in upward stage of evolution so guessed for story ran that sometimes girl have be carried off by not a prey not for such fate a for captured by cannibal to be bred from young men also have be raped by to be mated with female of tribe looked a if creature a said be tending towards humanity naturally did not believe word of a applied to condition of present day century ago conceivably there may have be such being with extraordinary tenacity of tradition news of have be handed down be still current round hearth of peasant a for number chanton told that three have be once seen together by man who owing to swiftness on ski have escaped to tell tale man averred be other than grandfather who have be benighted one winter evening a passed through dense wood below ungeheuerhorn chanton supposed that have be driven down to lower altitude in search of food during severe winter weather for otherwise recorded sight of have always taken place among rock of peak have pursued grandfather then young man at extraordinarily swift canter running sometimes upright a men run sometimes on four in manner of beast howl be just such a that have heard that night in blumen hut such at rate be story chanton told like regarded a very moonshine of superstition very next day have reason to reconsider judgment about be on day that after week of exploration hit on only route at present known to top of peak started a soon a there be light enough to climb by for a may guess on very difficult rock be impossible to climb by lantern moonlight hit on long fissure have spoken of explored ledge from below seemed to end in nothingness with hour step cutting ascended couloir led upwards from from there onwards be rock climb certainly of considerable difficulty with heart breaking discovery ahead be about nine in morning that stood on top did not wait there long for side of mountain be raked by falling stone loosened when sun grows hot from ice hold made haste to pas ledge where fall be most frequent after there be long fissure to descend

couple of gnawed bone meal finished be lazily licking protuberant lip from came purring murmur of content with one hand scratched thick hair on belly in other held one of bone presently split in half beneath pressure of finger thumb horror be not based on information of what happened to men whom creature caught be due only to proximity to thing so human so infernal peak of ascent have moment ago filled with such elated satisfaction became to ungeheuerhorn indeed for be home of being more awful than delirium of nightmare must ever have conceived chanton be dozen pace behind with backward wave of hand caused to halt then withdrawing with infinite precaution so a not to attract gaze of basking creature slipped back round rock whispered to what have seen with blanched face made long detour peering round corner crouching low not knowing that at step might not come upon of being that from mouth of one of cave in mountain side there might not appear of hairless dreadful face with perhaps time breast insignia of womanhood must have be worst of luck favoured for made way among boulder shifting stone rattle of might at moment have betrayed without repetition of experience once among tree ran a if fury be in pursuit well now did understand though dare say can not convey qualm of chantons mind when spoke to of creature very humanity be what made so terrible fact that be of same race a

table have dispersed paused moment there be horror of spirit said experienced then from verily believe have never entirely recovered saw then how terrible living thing must be how terrible in consequence be life in suppose lurks inherited germ of ineffable bestiality who know whether sterile a have apparently become in course of century might not fructify again when saw that creature sun looked into abyss out of have crawled creature be trying to crawl out of now if exist longer certainly for last twenty year there have be record of being seen until come to story of footprint seen by climber on everest if be authentic if party did not mistake footprint of bear what not for human tread seems a if still bestranded remnant of mankind be in existence now ingram have told story well sitting in warm civilised room horror have clearly felt have not communicated to in very vivid manner intellectually agreed must appreciate horror certainly spirit felt shudder of interior comprehension be odd said that keen interest in physiology did not disperse qualm be looking so take at form of man more remote probably than earliest human remains did not something inside say be of absorbing significance shook head only wanted to get away said be not a have told terror of what according to chantons story might await if be captured be sheer horror at creature quaked at snowstorm gale increased in violence that night slept uneasily plucked again again from slumber by fierce battling of wind shook window a if with imperious demand for admittance came in billowy gust with strange noise intermingled with a for moment abated with fluting moanings rose to shriek a fury of returned noise doubt mingled with drowsed sleepy consciousness once tore out of nightmare imagining that creature of horror horn have gained footing on balcony be rattling at window bolt before morning gale have died away awoke to see snow falling dense fast in windless air for three day continued without intermission with cessation there came frost such a have never felt before fifty degree be registered one night more next what cold must have be on cliff of ungeheuerhorn can not imagine sufficient so thought to have made end altogether of secret inhabitant cousin on day twenty year ago have missed opportunity for study must probably never fall again to received one morning letter from friend saying that have arrived at neighbouring winter resort of st luigi proposing must come over for morning skating lunch afterwards place be not more than couple of mile off if one took path over low pine clad foot hill above lay steep wood below first rocky slope of ungeheuerhorn accordingly with knapsack containing skate on back went on ski over wooded slope down by easy descent again on to st day be overcast cloud entirely obscured higher peak though sun be visible pale unluminous through mist a morning went on gained upper hand slid down into st luigi beneath sparkling firmament skated lunched then since looked a if thick weather be coming up again set out early about three oclock for return journey hardly have got into wood when cloud gathered thick above streamer skein of began to descend among pine through path threaded way in ten minute more opacity have so increased must hardly see couple of yard in front of very soon became aware that must have got off path for snow cowled shrub lay directly in way casting back to find again got altogether confused a to direction though progress be difficult knew have only to keep on ascent presently must come to brow of low foot hill descend into open valley where alhubel stood so on went stumbling sliding over obstacle unable owing to thickness of snow to take off ski for must have sunk over knee at step still ascent continued looking at watch saw that have already be near hour on way from st luigi period more than sufficient to complete whole journey still stuck to idea that though have certainly strayed far from proper route few minute more must surely see over top of upward way must find ground declining into next valley about now too noticed that mist be growing suffused with rose colour though inference be that must be close on sunset there be consolation in fact that be there might lift at moment disclose to whereabouts fact that night must soon be on made needful to bar mind against despair of loneliness so eats out heart of man who be lost in wood on mountain side that though still there be plenty of vigour in limb nervous force be sapped can do more than lie down abandon to whatever fate may await then heard that made thought of loneliness seem bliss indeed for there be worse fate than loneliness what heard resembled howl of wolf came from not far in front of where ridge be ridge still rose higher in vestment of pine from behind came sudden puff of wind shook frozen snow from drooping pine branch swept away mist a broom sweep dust from floor radiant above be unclouded sky already charged with red of sunset in front saw have come to very edge of wood through have wandered so long be valley into have penetrated for there right ahead of rose steep slope of boulder rock soaring upwards to foot of ungeheuerhorn what then be that cry of wolf have made heart stand still saw not twenty yard from be fallen tree leaning against trunk of be one of denizen of horror horn be woman be enveloped in thick growth of hair grey tufted from head streamed down over shoulder bosom from hung withered pendulous breast looking on face comprehended not with mind alone with shudder of spirit what ingram have felt never have nightmare fashioned so terrible countenance beauty of sun star of beast of field kindly race of men must not atone for so hellish incarnation of spirit of life fathomless bestiality modelled slavering mouth narrow eye looked into abyss knew out of abyss on edge of leaned generation of men have climbed what if ledge crumbled in front of pitched headlong into nethermost depth in one hand held by horn chamois kicked struggled blow from hindleg caught withered thigh with grunt of anger seized leg in other hand a man may pull from sheath stem of meadow grass plucked off body leaving torn skin hanging round gaping wound then putting red bleeding member to mouth sucked at a child suck stick of sweetmeat through flesh gristle short brown teeth penetrated licked lip with sound of purring then dropping leg by side looked again at body of prey now quivering in death convulsion with finger thumb gouged out one of eye snapped teeth on cracked like soft shelled nut must have be few second stood watching in indescribable catalepsy of terror while through brain there pealed panic command of mind to stricken limb begone begone while there be time then recovering power of joint muscle tried to slip behind tree hide from apparition woman will say must have caught stir of movement for raised eye from living feast saw craned forward neck dropped prey half rising began to move towards a did opened mouth gave forth howl such a have heard moment before be answered by faintly distantly sliding slipping with toe of ski tripping in obstacle below snow plunged forward down hill between pine trunk low sun already sinking behind rampart of mountain in west reddened snow pine with ultimate ray knapsack with skate in swung to fro on back one ski stick have already be twitched out of hand by fallen branch of pine not second pause must allow to recover gave glance behind knew not at what pace pursuer be on track indeed whether pursued at for whole mind energy now working at full power again under stress of panic be devoted to getting away down hill out of wood a swiftly a limb must bear for little while heard nothing hissing snow of headlong passage rustle of covered undergrowth beneath foot then from close at hand behind once more wolf howl sounded heard plunging of footstep other than own strap of knapsack have shifted a skate swung to fro on back chafed pressed on throat hindering free passage of air of god knew labouring lung be in dire need without pausing slipped free from neck held in hand from ski stick have be jerked seemed to go little more easily for adjustment now not so far distant must see below path from have strayed if only must reach that smoother going must surely enable to out distance pursuer who even on rougher ground be slowly overhauling at sight of riband stretching unimpeded downhill ray of hope pierced black panic of soul with came desire keen insistent to see who what be be on track spared backward glance be hag whom have seen at gruesome meal long grey hair flew out behind mouth chattered gibbered finger made grabbing movement a if already closed on path be now at hand nearness of suppose made incautious hump of snow covered bush lay in path thinking must jump over tripped fell smothering in snow heard maniac noise half scream half laugh from close behind before must recover grabbing finger be at neck a if steel vice have closed there right hand in held knapsack of skate be free with blind back handed movement whirled behind at full length of strap knew that desperate blow have found billet somewhere even before must look round felt grip on neck relax something subsided into very bush have entangled recovered foot turned there lay twitching quivering heel of one of skate piercing thin alpaca of knapsack have hit full on temple from blood be pouring hundred yard away must see such figure coming downwards on track leaping bounding at panic rose again within sped off down white smooth path led to light of village already beckoning never once did pause in headlong going there be safety until be back among haunt of men flung against door of hotel screamed for admittance though have to turn handle enter once more a when ingram have told tale there be sound of band chatter of voice there too be who looked up then rose swiftly to foot a made clattering entrance have seen too cried look at knapsack be there not blood on be blood of one of woman hag who tore off leg of chamois a looked pursued through accursed wood whether be who spun round room seemed to spin round knew not heard falling collapsed on floor next time be conscious at be in bed there be ingram there who told that be quite safe man stranger who pricked arm with nozzle of syringe reassured day two later gave coherent account of adventure three four men armed with gun went over trace found bush in have stumbled with pool of blood have soaked into snow still following ski track came on body of chamois from have be torn one of hindlegs one eye socket be empty be corroboration of story can give reader for imagine that creature pursued be either not killed by blow that fellow removed body anyhow be open to incredulous to prowl about cave of ungeheuerhorn see if anything occurs may convince machaon machaon be returning at close of short winter day from visit to st james hospital where old servant parkes who have be in service for twenty year be lying have sent there three day before not for treatment for observation afternoon have gone up to london to hear doctor report on case told that parkes be suffering from internal tumour nature of must not be diagnosed for certain symptom pointed directly to being cancerous that however must not be regarded a proved must only be proved by exploratory operation to reveal nature extent of growth must then if possible be excised might involve so old friend godfrey symes told certain tissue must be found to be inoperable hoped must not be case that must be possible to remove removal gave only chance of recovery be fortunate that patient have be sent for examination in early stage for thus chance of success be much greater than if growth have be one of long standing parkes be not however in fit state to stand operation at once recuperative week ten day in bed be advisable in circumstance symes recommended that must not be told at once what lay in front of can see that be nervous fellow said to lie in bed thinking of what have got to face will probably undo good that lying in bed will bring to dont get used to idea of being cut open more think about more intolerable becomes if sort of adventure faced must infinitely prefer not to be told about until came to give ansthetic naturally will have to consent to operation shouldnt tell anything about till day before he not married think be he alone in world said he be with twenty year yes remember parkes almost a long a remember thats can recommend of course if pain became severe might be better to operate sooner at present suffers hardly at sleep well so nurse tell there nothing else that can try for asked ill try anything like will be perfectly useless ill let have quack nostrum wish a long a doesnt injure health make put off operation there be x ray ultra violet ray violet leaf radium there be fresh cure for cancer discovered day whats result only make people put off operation till longer possible to operate naturally will welcome further opinion want now godfrey symes be easily first authority on subject have far higher percentage of cure to credit than anyone else dont want fresh opinion said very well ill have carefully watched by way cant stop in town dine with there be one two people coming among perfectly mad spiritualist who have more message from other world than ever get on telephone trunk call eh wonder where exchange be do come like crank know cant im afraid said ive couple of guest coming to stay with to day down in country be crank one medium laughed well can only offer one crank youve got two said must get back to ward ill write to in about week time so unless there urgency dont foresee must suggest coming up to tell parkes good bye caught train at charing cross with about three second to spare slid clanking out over bridge through cold dense air snow have be falling intermittently since morning when got out of grime fog of london be lying thickly on field hedgerow retarding by reflection of such light a lingered oncoming of darkness giving to landscape aloof lonely austerity day have felt that drowsiness accompanies snowfall sometimes half losing in doze mind crept like thing crawling about in dark over what godfrey symes have told for year parkes a much friend a servant have given faithfulness devotion now in return for apparently must do be to tell of plight be clear from what surgeon have said that expected serious disclosure knew from experience of two friend of mine who have be in condition what might be expected of exploratory operation exactly similar have be case there be clear evidence of internal growth possibly not malignant in case same dismal sequence have followed growth have be removed within couple of month there have be recrudescence of indeed surgery have proved no more than pruning knife have stimulated that surgeon have hoped to extirpate into swifter activity apparently be best chance that symes held out rest of treatment be rubbish quackery mind crawled away towards subject probably two visitor whom expected charles hope medium whom be bringing with be in same train a ran over in mind that have told of mr forrest be certainly odd story have brought two day before mr forrest be medium of considerable reputation in psychical circle have produced very extraordinary book test by account seemed inexplicable except on spiritualistic hypothesis imputation of trickery have at rate a yet come near when in trance spoke wrote a be invariably case with medium under direction of certain control be to say spiritual discarnate intelligence for time be in possession of lately there have be sign that fresh control have inspired nature of whom name identity be at present unknown then came following queer incident last week only when in trance apparently under direction of new control began describing in considerable detail certain house where control said that have work to do at first description aroused association in charles hope mind a went on suddenly struck that mr forrest be speaking of house in tilling gave general feature position in small town on hill walled in garden then went on to speak with great minuteness of rather peculiar feature in house described big room built out in garden few yard away from house at right angle to front approached by dozen stone step there be railing so said on side of into railing be twisted like snake coil stem of tree bore pale mauve flower be correct description of garden room wistaria writhes in out of railing line step then went on to speak of interior of room at one end be fireplace at other big bow window looking out on to street front of house there be two other window opposite other in one of be table while other looking out on to garden be shadowed by tree twisted about railing book case lined wall there be big sofa at right angle to fire now though be perfectly accurate description of place a far a must be ascertained mr forrest have never seen might conceivably have be derived from charles hope mind since knew room well having often stayed with medium added detail must not conceivably have be thus derived for charles believed to be incorrect said that there be big piano near bow window while be sure that there be not oddly enough have hired piano only week so ago stood in place that mentioned control then repeated that there be work for to do in house there be situation complication there in must help must get through better be make clearer communication if medium must hold sance there charles hope then told control that believed knew house that have be speaking of promised to do best shortly afterwards mr forrest came out of trance a usual have recollection of what have passed so charles came to with story exactly a have given here though must not think of situation complication in unknown control of medium have never seen must be of assistance whole thing in especial that detail about piano be so odd that asked to bring medium down for sitting series of sitting day of arrival be arranged when three day ago parkes have to go into hospital be inclined to put off neighbour away for week obligingly lent parlour maid let engagement stand with regard to situation in control must be of assistance can assure reader a far a thought about at only wondered whether be concerned with book on be engaged dealt if must ever succeed in writing with psychical affair at present must not get on with at have made dozen beginning have gone into waste paper basket guest proved not to have come by same train a arrived shortly before dinner time after mr forrest have gone to room have few word with charles who told exactly how situation now stood know caution captiousness in affair said so have told mr forrest nothing about description gave of house of reason why asked to come here said only a settled that be great friend of mine immensely interested in psychical affair country mouse whom be difficult to get up to town must be delighted if must come down for few day give sitting here doe recognise house do think asked sign of a told when come out of trance never seems to have faintest recollection of what have said written will have sance hope to night after dinner certainly if will said thought have better hold in garden room for be place be so minutely described quite warm there central heating fire only dozen yard from house ive have snow swept from step mr forrest turned out to be very intelligent woman well spiced with humour gifted with sane appreciation of comfort of life most agreeably furnished with small change of talk be inclined to be stout carried with briskness in body mind did suggest that be one who held communication with unseen there be nothing wan occult about general outlook on life appeared to be rather materialistic than otherwise be very interesting on topic when about way through dinner subject of mediumship came on conversational board gift such a be said have nothing to do with person who sits eating drinking talking to a mr hope may have told be quite expunged before subconscious part of be latest notion be not get into touch with discarnate intelligence until happens door be shut when be over door be shut again have recollection of what have said written control us hand voice be know more about than piano on tune have be played there be new control who have lately be using asked laughed must ask mr hope about said know nothing of tell be so tell dont mr hope that hasnt idea who what new control be look forward to development idea be that control have to get used to a in learning new instrument assure be a eager a anyone that must gain facility in communication through hope indeed that be to have sance to night talk veered again learned that mr forrest have never be in tilling before be enchanted with snowy moonlit glance have have of narrow street ancient residence liked too atmosphere of house seemed tranquil kindly especially so be little drawing room where have assembled before dinner glanced at charles have thought of proposing that must sit in garden room said if dont mind dozen step in open adjoins house just a wish said though think have excellent condition in here without going there confirmed statement that have idea after have come out of trance what have said for otherwise must have recognised at mention of garden room own description of when soon after dinner adjourned there be clear that unless be acting inexplicable part sight of twanged chord of memory there made very simple arrangement to be accustomed a procedure in such sitting be possibly unfamiliar to reader will describe quite shortly what arrangement be have idea what form manifestation if there be might take therefore charles be prepared to record on spot three sat round small table about couple of yard from fire be burning brightly mr forrest seated in big armchair exactly in front of on table be pencil block of paper in case a often happened manifestation took form of automatic script writing be while in state of trance charles sat on side of also provided with pencil paper in order to take down what said if when a lawyer say control took possession of in case materialised spirit appeared phenomenon not a yet seen at sances idea be to jot down a quickly a possible whatever saw thought saw must there be rappings movement of furniture be to make similar note of impression lamp be then turned down so that just ring of flame encircled wick firelight be of sufficient brightness a tested before sance began to enable to write to see what have written red glow of illuminated room be settled that charles must note by watch time at anything occurred occasionally throughout sance bubble of coal gas caught fire then whole room started into strong light have given order that servant must not interrupt sitting at unless somebody rang bell from garden room in case be to be answered finally before sance began bolted window on inside locked door took other precaution against trickery though a matter of fact mr forrest suggested that must be tied into chair in firelight movement of hers must be so visible that did not adopt precaution charles have settled to read to other note made during sitting cut out anything that of have not recorded account therefore of sitting of followed next day be founded on joint evidence sitting began mr forrest be leaning back at ease with eye open hand on arm of chair then eye closed violent trembling seized that passed shortly afterwards head fell forward breathing became very rapid presently that quieted to normal pace again began to speak at first in scarcely audible whisper then in high shrill voice quite unlike usual tone think that in england there be more disappointed man than during next half hour starlight appeared be in control starlight be personage of platitude have be nun in time of henry vii work be to help who have lately passed over be very busy very happy be in third sphere where have great deal of beautiful music must all be good said starlight didnt matter much whether be clever not love be great thing have to love other help other death be more than gate of life everything must be tremendously jolly starlight in fact might be better described a clap trap began thinking about parkes then ceased to think about parkes for shrill morality of starlight ceased mr forrests voice changed again stale facility of utterance stopped began to speak quite unintelligibly in voice of low baritone range charles leaned across table whispered to thats new control said voice be speaking stumbled hesitated be like of man trying to express in language knew very imperfectly sometimes stopped altogether in one of pause asked can tell name there be reply presently saw mr forrests hand reach out for pencil charles put into finger placed writing pad more handily for watched letter in capital being traced be made hesitatingly be perfectly legible swallow wrote again swallow stopped bird asked voice spoke in answer now must hear word uttered in low baritone voice no not bird said not bird fly be utterly at sea mind must form conjecture whatever a to what be meant then pencil began writing again swallow swallow then with sudden briskness of movement a if guiding intelligence have got over difficulty wrote swallow tail seemed more abstrusely senseless than ever only connection with swallow tail in mind be swallow tailed coat whoever heard of swallow tailed coat flying ive got said charles swallow tail butterfly be that there came three sudden rap on table loud startling rap may explain in usual code mean yes a if to confirm pencil began to write again spelled out swallow tail butterfly be that name asked there be one rap signifies followed by three mean yes have not slightest idea of what signified indeed seemed to signify nothing at sitting have become extraordinarily interesting if only for very unexpectedness control be trying to establish by three method simultaneously by voice by automatic writing by rapping how swallow tail butterfly must assist in situation be now existing in house be utterly beyond then idea struck swallow tail butterfly doubt have scientific name that must easily ascertain for knew that there be on shelf copy of newman butterfly moth of great britain sumptuous volume bound in morocco have won a entomological prize at school moment search gave book by firelight turned up description of butterfly in index scientific name be papilio machaon be machaon name asked voice came clear now yes be machaon said with came end of sance have lasted not more than hour power be that have made mr forrest speak in male voice struggle through roundabout method of swallow swallow tail machaon to establish identity now began to fail mr forrests pencil made few illegible scribble whispered few inaudible word presently with stretch sigh came out of trance told that name of control be established apparently machaon meant nothing to be much exhausted very soon took across to house to go to bed presently rejoined charles who be machaon anyhow asked sound classical more in line than mine remembered enough greek mythology to supply elementary fact while hunted for particular book about athens machaon be son of asclepios said asclepios be greek god of healing have precinct hydropathic establishment where people went to be cured roman called aesculapius what can do for then asked charles youre fairly fit arent not till spoke did light dawn on though have be thinking so much of parkes day have not consciously made connection parkes isnt said be that possible by jove said found book turned to account of precinct of asclepios in athens yes asclepios have two son said machaon podaleirios in homeric time wasnt god only physician son be physician too myth of godhead be rather late one shut book best not to read more said if know about asclepios will possibly be suggesting thing to medium mind let see what machaon can tell about can verify afterwards be therefore with further knowledge than on subject of machaon that proposed to hold sance next day morning bitter air have be laden with snow now street in front of house by way at best in slender traffic of town lay white untrodden save on pavement where few passenger have gone by mr forrest have not appeared at breakfast from then till lunch time sat in bow window of garden room for warmth of central heating of stack of pipe be there installed for securing utmost benefit of light penetrated cowl of snow laden sky busy with belated letter drowsiness accompanies snowfall weighed heavily on faculty a far a can assert anything can assert did not sleep from one letter went on to then for sixth seventh time tried to open story promised better now than before searching for word must not come to pen happened to look up along street lay in front of expected nothing be thinking of nothing work probably have looked up like that dozen time before have seen empty street with snow lying thickly on roadway now roadway be not untenanted someone be walking down middle of aspect incredible though seemed be not startling why be not startled have idea can only say that vision appeared perfectly natural figure be that of young man whose hair black curly lay crisply over forehead large white cloak reaching down to knee enveloped have thrown end of over shoulder below knee leg foot be bare so too be arm up to elbow with pressed cloak to there be walking briskly down snowy street a came directly below window where sat raised head looked at directly smiled now saw face there be low brow straight nose curved sunny mouth short chin thought to myself that be none other than hermes of praxiteles whose statue at olympia make who look on grow young again there anyhow be boyish greek god stepping blithely with gay incomparable grace along street raising face to smile at stolid middle aged man who blankly regarded then with certainty of one returning home mounted step outside front door seemed to pas into through certainly be no longer in street so real solid seeming have be to vision that jumped up ran across few step of garden went into house must not have be amazed if have found standing in hall there be one there opened front door snow lay smooth untrodden down centre of road where have walked on doorstep at moment memory of sance evening before about up till now have somehow felt distrustful suspicious passed into realm of sober fact for have not machaon just now entered house with smile a of recognition on friendly mission sat again that afternoon by daylight now must suppose control be more actively powerfully present for hardly have mr forrest passed into trance than voice began louder than have be night before far more distinct machaon must call seemed to be anxious to establish identity beyond doubt like newcomer presenting credential began to speak of precinct of asclepios in athens often hesitated for word in english often put in word in greek a spoke fragment of thing have learned when archological student in athens came back into mind knew that be accurately describing portico temple well toss to sceptic to growl worry over tear to bit for certainly seems possible that mind holding fact in subconsciousness be suggesting to medium mind who thereupon spoke of conveying back to made aware that have known forgotten knowledge of thing of greek language came flooding back on a told now half in greek half in english of patient who came to consult god how washed in sacred well for purification lay down to sleep in portico often dreamed in interpretation of dream told to priest next day lay indication of cure sometimes god healed more directly accompanied by sacred snake walked among sleeper by touch made whole temple be hung with ex votos gift of whom have cured at epidaurus where be shrine of there be great mural tablet recording same then voice stopped a if to prove identity by mean medium drew pencil paper to in greek character unknown apparently to traced word machaon son of asclepios there be pause asked direct question now have be long simmering in mind have come to help about parkes asked can tell will cure pencil began to move again tracing out character in greek wrote greek phengos x repeated did not at once guess what meant asked for explanation there be answer presently medium stirred stretched sighed came out of trance took up paper on have written did come through asked what doe mean dont even know character then suddenly possible significance of greek phengos x flashed on marvelled at slowness greek phengos beam of light ray letter greek x equivalent of english x have come in direct answer to question a to what must cure parkes be without hesitation delay wrote to symes reminded that have said that have objection to possible remedy provided be not harmful being tried on patient asked to treat with x ray whole sequence of event have be so frankly amazing that believe veriest sceptic must not have done otherwise than did sitting continued after day have further evidence of second control looked a if intelligence even most incredulous will allow for sake of convenience to call intelligence machaon have described room told mr forrest that have work to do here have finished task machaon have said so interpretation be that x ray must cure parkes in justification of view be proper to quote from letter got from symes week later there be need for to come up to break to parkes that operation lie in front of in answer to request without grain of faith in success treated with x ray assured be useless to day to speak quite frankly dont know what to think for growth have be steadily diminishing in size hardness be perfectly evident that be being absorbed be disappearing treatment through put parkes be that of here in hospital have have patient to whom brought shadow of benefit often have be continued on deluded wretch till operation might possibly have be successful be out of question owing to encroachment of growth from first dose of x ray parkes began to get better growth be first arrested then diminished be trying to put whole thing before with a much impartiality a can command so on other side must remember that parkess be never proved case of cancer told that must not be proved till exploratory operation took place symptom pointed to cancer see be trying to save own face diagnosis though confirmed by may have be wrong if only have what call benign tumour case be not so extraordinary there have be plenty of case when benign tumour have disappeared by absorption what not be unusual by mean unknown for instance parkess case be quite different certainly believe have cancerous growth thought that operation be inevitable if life be to be saved even then most hoped for be alleviation of pain a disease progressed year two more at most of life instead apply remedy at suggestion if go on a have be doing growth will be nodule in week two must expect to disappear altogether taking everything into consideration if asked question whether x ray treatment be cause of cure must be obliged to say yes dont believe in such treatment believe be curing suppose that be suggested to by fraudulent spiritualistic medium in feigned trance who be inspired by aesculapius exploded heathen deity for remember said be going down into country for spiritual business well parkes be getting better be so old fashioned fellow must sooner patient of mine got better by incredible method than died under skilful knife of course trained people know nothing have to act according to best chance of ignorance entirely believed that knife be only mean of saving man now when stand confuted only thing can save be honesty hereby have done let know at leisure whether just thought must on own idea like to try x ray whether faked voice from grave suggested ever yours godfrey symes p if be beastly voice from grave might tell in confidence who medium be want to be fair be story reader will explain according to temperament a have told parkes who be now back with again to look into garden room before post time take registered packet to office be time got ready for so here be completed packet in manuscript to be sent to printer from window will see go briskly along street down machaon walked on snowy morning negotium perambulans negotium perambulans casual tourist in west

suddenly at age of thirty two seemed strange that there must be only bare announcement concerning woman who at one time have be so well known dazzling figure turning to obituary notice found that inattentive skimming have overlooked paragraph there of appreciation regret have died during sleep be announced that inquest must be held laziness then have be of use for archie rorke distant cousin successor to sir ernests estate title be arriving that evening to spend few country day with be glad to have known before came how must affect whether indeed must affect at have idea what mysterious

excised leaf from life be proposing to stay down at lincote alone for month so must then turn on to new page lady rorke so heard have also left london immediately passed summer in italy then took furnished house in torquay where lived for remainder of year intervened between breaking off of engagement death cut completely off from friend woman surely ever commanded larger host of saw nobody seldom went outside house garden observed same unbroken silence a did archie about what have happened now with youth charm beauty have gone down dumb into great silence with prospect of seeing archie that evening be wonder that thought of lady rorke ran day in head like tune heard long ago now recalled to mind in scattered stave of melody meeting talk with phrase by phrase reconstructed a memory grew definite complete found even a before when be actually experiencing there lurked underneath gay rhythm joyousness something macabre mysterious to day be accentuated whereas before when listened for trying to isolate from rest so perhaps dispel be always overscored by triumphant crescendo presence diverted eye ear alike yet such simile halt perhaps still in simile will more accurately define

occasion mother whom have never seen who died many year ago spoke through told certain fact sybil must not have known did not know old friend of mother still alive told that be correct be of exceedingly private nature sybil also so told must produce materialisation up till now have never seen remarkable thing about mediumship be that must sometimes regain consciousness from trance while still communication be being made knew what be going on must hear speak be mentally aware of what be saying on occasion for instance of have told when mother spoke to be in state same thing occurred at sitting of will now speak night on return to london dined alone felt very strong desire for must not account that must hold sitting just consented sat in room with shaded lamp there be sufficient illumination for to see quite distinctly for face be towards light there be small table in front of covered with dark cloth sat close to in high chair composed almost immediately went into trance head fell forward by slow breathing absolute immobility knew be unconscious for long time sat there in silence began to think that must get manifestation at that sitting a sometimes be case must be failure then saw that something be happening hand with gripped arm of chair be trembling twice tried to speak be not till third attempt that mastered there be forming mist above table said be slightly luminous spread upwards pillar shaped in height between two three foot then saw that below outlying skein of something be materialising moulded into human shape rising waist high from table presently shoulder arm neck head be visible feature began to outline for time remained vague fluid swaying backwards forward little then very quickly solidified there close in front of be half figure of young girl eye be still closed now opened round neck be chain of bead just such a have seen laid by body have be found in lake then spoke to asking who be though already knew answer be more than whisper quite distinct ellen davenport said disordered terror seized yet perhaps little white figure with wide gazing eye be hallucination something have objective existence at day thought of poor kiddie whose remains have seen taken out of ooze at bottom of lake have be vivid in mind tried to think that what saw be more than strange projection of thought yet felt be not so be independent of why be made manifest on what errand have come have pressed sybil to give sance god know what must have given not to have done so for one thing be thankful namely that be in unconscious trance perhaps phantom must fade again before came out of then heard stir of movement from chair where sat turning saw that have raised head eye be open on face mask of terror a have never known human being must wear recognition be there too saw that sybil knew who phantom be figure palely gleamed above table turned head towards once more white lip opened yes be ellen davenport said whisper grew louder might have saved said might have tried to save watched struggling till sank then apparition vanished did not die away be there clear distinct one moment at next be gone sybil be sitting alone in room with low burning lamp silence sang in ear got up turned on switch kindled electric light knew that something within have grown cold that something have snapped still sat where be not looking at at blankly in front of said word of denial in answer to terrible accusation have be uttered think be glad of for there be time when be not only futility to deny blasphemy for part must neither look at speak to remember holding out hand to empty grate a if there have be fire burning there standing there heard rise drearily wondered what must say knew how useless must be then heard whisper of dress on carpet noise of door opening shutting when turned found that be alone in room presently let out of house there be long pause did not break for felt have not quite finished have loved with whole heart said knew perhaps be why never attempted to see again why did not attempt to see little white figure must always have be with for must not deny reality of truth of have spoken thats story then neednt even tell if think must have done differently for knew couldnt couldnt rose see there be to be inquest said hope will find that killed will mean wont that remorse be unbearable thats atonement moved towards door inscrutable decree said gardener gardener two friend of mine hugh grainger wife have taken for month of christmas holiday house in be to witness such strange manifestation when received invitation from to spend fortnight there returned enthusiastic affirmative well already did know pleasant heathery country side most intimate be acquaintance with subtle hazard of most charming golf link golf be given to understand be to occupy solid day for hugh so that margaret must never be obliged to set hand to implement with game so detestable to be conducted arrived there while yet daylight lingered a host be out took ramble round place house garden stood on plateau facing south below be couple of acre of pasture sloped down to vagrant stream crossed by foot bridge by side of stood thatched cottage with vegetable patch surrounding path ran close past across pasture from wicket gate in garden conducted over foot bridge so remembered sense of geography told must constitute short cut to link lay not mile beyond cottage be clearly on land of little estate at once supposed to be gardener house what went against so obvious simple theory be that appeared to be untenanted wreath of smoke though evening be chilly curled from chimney coming closer fancied have that air of waiting about so often conjure into unused habitation there stood with sign of life about though ready a apparently perfect state of repair seemed to warrant for fresh tenant to put breath of life into again little garden too though paling be neat newly painted told same tale bed be untended unweeded in flower border by front door be row of chrysanthemum have withered on stem be impression of moment did not pause a passed crossed foot bridge went on up heathery slope that lay beyond geography be not at fault for presently saw club house just in front of hugh doubt must be just about coming in from afternoon round so must walk back together on reaching club house however steward told that not five minute before mr grainger have called in car for husband therefore retraced step by path along have already come made detour a golfer will to walk up fairway of seventeenth eighteenth hole just for pleasure of recognition looked respectfully at yawning sandpit so inexorably guard eighteenth green wondering in what circumstance must visit next whether with step complacent superior knowing that ball reposed safely on green beyond with heavy footfall of one who know that laborious delving lie before light of winter evening have faded fast when crossed foot bridge on return dusk have gathered to right just beside path lay cottage whitewashed wall of gleamed whitely in gloaming a turned glance back from to rather narrow plank bridged stream thought caught out of tail of eye light from one of window thus disproved theory that be untenanted when looked directly at again saw be mistaken reflection in glass of red line of sunset in west must have deceived for in inclement twilight looked more desolate than ever yet lingered by wicket gate in low paling for though exterior evidence bore witness to emptiness inexplicable feeling assured quite irrationally that be not so that there be somebody there certainly there be nobody visible so absurd idea informed might be at back of cottage concealed from by intervening structure still oddly still unreasonably became matter of importance to mind to ascertain whether be so not so clearly have perception told that place be empty so firmly have conviction assured that be tenanted to cover inquisitiveness in case there be someone there must inquire whether path be short cut to house at be staying rather rebelling at what be doing went through small garden rapped at door there be answer after waiting for response to second summons having tried door found locked made circuit of house of course there be one there told that be just like man who look under bed for burglar must be beyond measure astonished if found one host be at house when arrived spent cheerful two hour before dinner in such desultory eager conversation a be proper between friend who have not met for time between hugh grainger wife be always impossible to light on subject doe not vividly interest one other of golf politics need of russia cooking ghost possible victory over mount everest income tax be among topic passionately discussed with plate spinning be easy to whip up one of subject of spook generally be lighted upon again again margaret be on high road to madness remarked hugh on one of occasion for have begun using planchette if use planchette for six month be told most careful doctor will conscientiously certify a insane shes got five month more before go to bedlam doe work asked yes say most interesting thing said margaret say thing never entered head well try to night oh not to night said hugh let have evening off margaret disregarded use asking planchette question went on because there be in mind sort of answer to if ask whether will be fine to morrow for instance be probably though indeed dont mean to push who make pencil say yes then usually rain remarked hugh not always dont interrupt interesting thing be to let pencil write what chooses very often only make loop curve though may mean something now then word come of significance of have idea so clearly couldnt have suggested yesterday evening for instance wrote gardener over over again now what did mean gardener here be methodist with chin beard must have meant oh time to dress please dont be late cook be so sensitive about soup rose connection of idea about gardener linked up in mind by way whats that cottage in field by foot bridge asked be that gardener cottage used to be said hugh chin beard doesnt live there in fact nobody life there empty if be owner here must put chin beard into take rent off wage people have idea of economy why did ask saw margaret be looking at rather attentively curiosity said idle curiosity dont believe be said be said be idle curiosity to know whether house be inhabited a passed going down to club house felt sure be empty coming back felt so sure that there be someone there that rapped at door indeed walked round have preceded a lingered little there be one there asked odd have just same feeling a about explains planchette writing gardener over over again said have gardener cottage on mind how ingenious said margaret hurry up dress gleam of strong moonlight between drawn curtain when went up to bed that night led to look out room faced garden field have traversed that afternoon be vividly illuminated by full moon thatched cottage with white wall close by stream be very distinct once more suppose reflection of light on glass of one of window made appear that room be lit within struck a odd that twice day illusion must have be presented to now yet odder thing happened even a looked light be extinguished morning did not at bear out fine promise of clear night for when woke wind be squealing sheet of rain from south west be dashed against pane golf be wholly out of question though violence of storm abated little in afternoon rain dripped with steady sullenness wearied of indoors since two others entirely refused to set foot outside went forth mackintoshed to get breath of air by way of object in tramp took road to link in preference to muddy short cut through field with intention of engaging couple of caddy for hugh next morning lingered awhile over illustrated paper in smoking room must have read for longer than knew for sudden beam of sunset light suddenly illuminated page looking up saw that rain have ceased that evening be fast coming on so instead of taking long detour by road again set forth homewards by path across field gleam of sunset be last of day once again just a twenty four hour ago crossed foot bridge in gloaming till moment a far a be aware have not thought at about cottage there now in flash light have seen there last night suddenly extinguished recalled to mind at same moment felt that invincible conviction that cottage be tenanted simultaneously in swift process of thought looked towards saw standing by door figure of man in dusk must distinguish nothing of face if indeed be turned to only got impression of tallish fellow thickly built opened door from there came dim light a of lamp entered shut after so then conviction be right yet have be distinctly told that cottage be empty who then be that entered a if returning home once more time with certain qualm of fear rapped on door intending to put trivial question rapped again time more drastically so that there must be question that summons be unheard still got reply finally tried handle of door be locked then with difficulty mastering increasing terror made circuit of cottage peering into unshuttered window be dark within though two minute ago have seen gleam of light escape from opened door just because chain of conjecture be beginning to form in mind made allusion to odd adventure after dinner margaret amid protest from hugh got out planchette have persisted in writing gardener surmise be of course utterly fantastic wanted to convey suggestion of sort to margaret for long time pencil skated over paper making loop curve peak like temperature chart have begun to yawn weary over experiment before coherent word emerged then in oddest way head nodded forward seemed to have fallen asleep hugh looked up from book spoke in whisper to fell asleep other night over said margarets eye be closed breathed long quiet breath of slumber then hand began to move with curious firmness right across big sheet of paper went level line of writing at end hand stopped with jerk woke looked at paper hullo said ah one of have be playing trick on assured that be not so read what have written gardener gardener ran be gardener want to come in cant find here o lord that gardener again said hugh looking up from paper saw margarets eye fixed on mine even before spoke knew what thought be did come home by empty cottage asked yes why still empty said in low voice anything else did not want to tell just what have seen what at rate thought have seen if there be going to be anything odd anything worth observation be far better that respective impression must not fortify other tapped again there be answer said presently there be move to bed margaret initiated after have gone upstairs hugh went to front door to interrogate weather once more moon shone in clear sky strolled out along flagged path fronted house suddenly hugh turned quickly pointed to angle of house who on earth be that said look there have gone round corner have glimpse of tallish man of heavy build didnt see asked hugh ill just go round house find dont want anyone prowling round at night wait here will if come round other corner ask what business be hugh have left in stroll close by front door be open there waited until must have made circuit have hardly disappeared when heard quite distinctly rather quick heavy footfall coming along paved walk towards from opposite direction there be absolutely one to be seen who made sound of rapid walking closer closer to came step of invisible one then with shudder of horror felt somebody unseen push by a stood on threshold that shudder be not merely of spirit for touch of be that of ice on hand tried to seize impalpable intruder slipped from next moment heard step on parquet of floor inside door within opened shut heard more of next moment hugh came running round corner of house from sound of step have approached where be asked be not twenty yard in front of big tall fellow saw nobody said step along walk there be nothing to be seen then asked hugh whatever be seemed to brush by go into house said there have certainly be sound of step on bare oak stair searched room after room through ground floor of house dining room door that of smoking room be locked that into drawing room be open only other door must have furnished impression of opening shutting be that into kitchen servant quarter here again quest be fruitless through pantry scullery boot room servant hall searched be empty quiet finally came to kitchen too be empty by fire there be set rocking chair be oscillating to fro a if someone lately sitting there have just quitted there stood gently rocking seemed to convey sense of presence invisible now more than even sight of who surely have be sitting there must have done remember wanting to steady stop yet hand refused to go forth to what have seen in especial what have not seen must have be sufficient to furnish most people with broken night assuredly be not among strong minded exception long lay wide eyed open eared when at last dozed be plucked from borderland of sleep by sound muffled unmistakable of someone moving about house occurred to that step might be of hugh conducting lonely exploration even while wondered tap came at door of communication between room in answer to response appeared that have come to see whether be thus uneasily wandering even a spoke step passed door stair leading to floor above creaked to ascent next moment sounded directly above head in attic in roof be not servant bedroom said hugh one sleep there let look once more must be somebody with lit candle made stealthy way upstairs just when be at top of flight hugh step ahead of uttered sharp exclamation something be passing by said clutched at empty air even a spoke experienced same sensation moment afterwards stair below creaked again a unseen passed down night long sound of step moved about passage a if someone be searching house a lay listened that message have come through pencil of planchette to margarets finger occurred to want to come in can not find here indeed someone have come in be sedulous in search be gardener must seem what gardener be invisible seeker for whom did seek even a when bodily pain cease be difficult to recall with vividness what pain be like so next morning a dressed found vainly trying to recapture horror of spirit have accompanied nocturnal adventure remembered that something within have sickened a watched movement of rocking chair night before a heard step along paved way outside by invisible pressure against knew that someone have entered house now in sane tranquil morning day under serene winter sun must not realise what have be presence like bodily pain have to be there for realisation of day be absent hugh felt same be even disposed to be humorous on subject well he have good look said whoever be whomever be looking for by way not word to margaret please heard nothing of perambulation of entry of of whatever be not gardener anyhow who ever heard of gardener spending time walking about house if there be step over potato patch might have be with margaret have arranged to drive over to have tea with friend of hers afternoon in consequence hugh refreshed ourselves at club house after game be already dusk when for third day in succession passed homewards by whitewashed cottage to night have sense of being subtly occupied stood mournfully desolate a be way of untenanted house light semblance of such gleamed from window hugh to whom have told odd impression have received there gave reception a flippant a have accorded to memory of night be still being humorous about when came to door of house psychic disturbance old boy said like cold in head hullo door locked rang rapped from inside came noise of turned key withdrawn bolt whats door locked for asked servant who opened man shifted from one foot to other bell rang hour ago sir said when came to answer there be man standing outside well asked hugh didnt like look of sir said asked business didnt say anything then must have gone pretty smartly away for never saw go where did seem to go asked hugh glancing at cant rightly say sir didnt seem to go at something seemed to brush by thatll do said hugh rather sharply margaret have not come in from visit when soon after crunch of motor wheel be heard hugh reiterated wish that nothing must be said to about impression now apparently third person shared with came in with flush of excitement on face never laugh at planchette again said ive heard most extraordinary story from maud ashfield horrible so frightfully interesting out with said hugh well there be gardener here said used to live at little cottage by foot bridge when family be up in london wife used to be caretaker live here hughs glance mine met then turned away knew a certainly a if be in mind that thought be identical with own married wife much younger than continued margaret gradually became frightfully jealous of one day in fit of passion strangled with own hand little while after someone came to cottage found sobbing over trying to restore went for police before came have cut own throat isnt horrible surely rather curious that planchette said gardener be gardener want to come in cant find here see knew nothing about will do planchette again to night oh dear post go in hour have whole budget to send respect planchette for future hughie talked situation out when have gone hugh unwillingly convinced yet unwilling to admit that something more than coincidence lay behind planchette nonsense still insisted that margaret must be told nothing of what have heard seen in house last night of strange visitor who again evening so must conclude have made entry shell be frightened said shell begin imagining thing a for planchette a likely a not will hing scribble make loop whats that yes come in there have come from somewhere in room one sharp peremptory rap did not think came from door hugh when response replied to word of admittance jumped up opened took few step into hall outside returned didnt hear asked certainly no one there not soul hugh came back to fireplace rather irritably threw cigarette have just lit into fender be rather nasty jar observed if ask whether feel comfortable can tell never felt le comfortable in life im frightened if want to know believe be too hadnt smallest intention of denying went on weve got to keep hand on ourselves said there nothing so infectious a fear margaret mustnt catch from there something more than fear know something have got into house be up against never believed in such thing before let face for minute what be anyhow if want to know what think be said believe to be spirit of man who strangled wife then cut throat dont see how can hurt be afraid of own fear really be up against said hugh what will do good lord if only knew what must do shouldnt mind not knowing well time to dress margaret be in highest spirit at dinner knowing nothing of manifestation of presence have taken place in last twenty four hour thought absorbingly interesting that planchette must have guessed so ran phrase about gardener from topic flitted to equally interesting form of patience for three friend have showed promising to initiate into after dinner did not knowing that above thing wanted to keep planchette at distance be delighted with success of game suddenly observed that evening be burning rapidly away swept card together at conclusion of hand now just hour of planchette said oh maynt play one more hand asked hugh best game ive seen for year planchette will be dismally slow after darling if gardener will only communicate again wont be slow said be such drivel said hugh how rude be read book then margaret have already got out machine sheet of paper when hugh rose please dont do to night margaret said why neednt attend well ask not to anyhow said margaret looked at closely hughie youve got something on mind said out with believe youre nervous think there be something queer about what be must see hugh hesitating a to whether to tell not gathered that chose chance of planchette inanely scribbling go on then said margaret hesitated clearly did not want to vex hugh insistence must have seemed to most unreasonable well just ten minute said promise not to think of gardener have hardly laid hand on board when head fell forward machine began moving be sitting close to a rolled steadily along paper writing became visible have come in ran still cant find be hiding will search room where be what else be written still concealed underneath planchette did not know for at moment current of icy air swept round room at door time unmistakably came loud peremptory knock hugh sprang to foot margaret wake up said something be coming door opened there moved in figure of man stood just within door head bent forward turned from side to side peering must seem with eye staring infinitely sad into corner of room margaret margaret cried hugh again margarets eye be open too be fixed on dreadful visitor be quiet hughie said below breath rising a spoke ghost be now looking directly at once lip above thick rust coloured beard moved sound came forth mouth only moved slavered raised head horror upon horror saw that one side of neck be laid open in red glistening gash for how long pause continued when three stood stiff frozen in deadly inhibition to move speak have idea suppose that at utmost be dozen second then spectre turned went out a have come heard step pas along parqueted floor there be sound of bolt withdrawn from front door with crash shook house slammed to over said margaret god have mercy on now reader may put precisely what construction plea on visitation from dead need not indeed consider to have be visitation from dead at say that there have be impressed on scene where murder suicide happened sort of emotional record in certain circumstance must translate into image visible invisible wave of ether what not may conceivably retain impress of such scene may be held so to speak in solution ready to be precipitated may hold that spirit of dead man indeed made manifest revisiting in sort of spiritual penance remorse place where crime be committed naturally materialist will entertain such explanation for instant then there be one so obstinately unreasonable a materialist beyond doubt dreadful deed be done there margarets last utterance be not inapplicable mr tillys sance mr tillys sance mr tilly have only briefest moment for reflection when a slipped fell on greasy wood pavement at hyde park corner be crossing at smart trot saw huge traction engine with grooved ponderous wheel towering high above oh dear oh dear said petulantly will certainly crush quite flat shant be able to be at mr cumberbatchs sance most provoking ow word be hardly out of mouth when first half of horrid anticipation be thoroughly fulfilled heavy wheel passed over from head to foot flattened completely out then driver too late reversed engine passed over again finally lost head whistled loudly stopped policeman on duty at corner turned quite faint at sight of catastrophe presently recovered sufficiently to hold up traffic ran to see what on earth must be done be so much up with mr tilly that only thing possible be to get hysterical engine driver to move clear then ambulance from hospital be sent for mr tillys remains detached with great difficulty from road so firmly have be pressed into be reverently carried away into mortuary mr tilly during have experienced one moment excruciating pain resembling severest neuralgia a head be ground beneath wheel almost before realised pain be past found still rather dazed floating standing did not know in middle of road there have be no break in consciousness perfectly recollected slipping wondered how have managed to save saw arrested traffic policeman with white wan face making suggestion to gibbering engine driver received very puzzling impression that traction engine be mixed up with have sensation of red hot coal boiling water rivet around yet feeling of scalding burning confinement be on contrary extremely comfortable have most pleasant consciousness of buoyancy freedom then engine puffed wheel went round immediately to immense surprise perceived own crushed remains flat a biscuit lying on roadway identified for certain by clothes have put on for first time that morning one patent leather boot have escaped demolition what on earth have happened said here be yet poor pressed flower of arm leg be rather also how terribly upset driver look why do believe that ive be run over did hurt for moment now come to think of good man where be shoving to dont see addressed two question to policeman who appeared to walk right through man took notice calmly came out on other side be quite evident that did not see apprehend in way mr tilly be still feeling rather at sea amid unusual occurrence there began to steal into mind glimpse of fact be so obvious to crowd formed interested respectful ring round body men stood with bared head woman screamed looked away looked back again really believe im dead said thats only hypothesis will cover fact must feel more certain of before do anything ah here come with ambulance to look at must be terribly hurt yet dont feel hurt must feel hurt surely if be hurt must be dead certainly seemed only thing for to be be far from realising yet lane have be made through crowd for stretcher bearer found wincing when began to detach from road oh do take care said thats sciatic nerve protruding there surely isnt ow didnt hurt after new clothes too put on to day for first time what bad luck now youre holding leg upside down of course money come out of trouser pocket there ticket for sance must have may use after tweaked out of finger of man who have picked up laughed to see expression of amazement on face a card suddenly vanished that gave something fresh to think about pondered for moment over touch of association set up by have thought be clear that moment came into connection with card became invisible im invisible myself of course to grosser sense everything hold becomes invisible most interesting that account for sudden appearance of small object at sance spirit have be holding a long a hold be invisible then let go there flower spirit photograph on table account too for sudden disappearance of such object spirit have taken though scoffer say that medium have secreted about person be true that when searched sometimes appears to have done so after may be joke on part of spirit now what be to do with let see there clock just half past ten have happened in few minute for be quarter past when left house half past ten now what doe mean exactly used to know what meant now seems nonsense ten what hour be whats hour be very puzzling felt that used to know what hour minute meant perception of naturally enough have ceased with emergence from time space into eternity conception of time be like memory refusing to record on consciousness lie perdu in dark corner of brain laughing at effort of owner to ferret out while still interrogated mind over lapsed perception found that space a well a time have similarly grown obsolete for for caught sight of friend miss ida soulsby whom knew be to be present at sance for be bound hurrying with bird like step down pavement opposite forgetting for moment that be disembodied spirit made effort of will in past human existence must have set leg in pursuit of found that effort of will alone be enough to place at side dear miss soulsby said be on way to mr cumberbatchs house when be knocked down killed be far from unpleasant moment headache so far natural volubility have carried before recollected that be invisible inaudible to still closed in by muddy vesture of decay stopped short though be clear that what said be inaudible to miss soulsbys rather large intelligent looking ear seemed that consciousness of presence be conveyed to finer sense for looked suddenly startled flush rose to face heard murmur very odd wonder why received so vivid impression of dear teddy gave mr tilly pleasant shock have long admired lady here be alluding to in supposed privacy a dear teddy be followed by momentary regret that have be killed must have liked to have be possessed of information before have pursued primrose path of dalliance down seemed to lead intention of course must a always have be strictly honourable path of dalliance must have conducted if consented to altar where primrose must have be exchanged for orange blossom regret be quite short lived though altar seemed inaccessible primrose path might still be open for many of spiritualistic circle in lived be on most affectionate term with spiritual guide friend who like have passed over from human point of view innocent even elevating flirtation have always seemed to rather bloodless now looking on from far side saw how charming be for gave sense of still having place identity in world have just quitted pressed miss ida hand rather put into spiritual condition of so doing must vaguely feel that have hint of warmth solidity about be gratifying for showed that though have passed out of material plane must still be in touch with still more gratifying be to observe that pleased secret smile overspread miss ida fine feature a gave token of presence perhaps only smiled at own thought in case be who have inspired encouraged by indulged in slightly more intimate token of affection permitted respectful salute saw that have gone too far for said to herself hush hush quickened pace a if to leave amorous thought behind felt that be beginning to adjust to new condition in must now live at rate be getting sort of inkling a to what be time existed more for yet did space since wish to be at miss ida side have instantly transported there with view to testing further wished back in flat a swiftly a change of scene in cinematograph show found there perceived that news of death must have reached servant for cook parlour maid with excited face be talking over event poor little gentleman said cook seems shame doe never hurt fly to think of one of great engine laying out flat hope theyll take to cemetery from hospital never must bear corpse in house great strapping parlour maid tossed head well im not sure that doesnt serve right observed always messing about with spirit be knocking concertina be awful sometimes when ive be laying out supper in dining room now perhaps hell come visit rest of loony im sorry same le troublesome little gentleman never stepped always pleasant too wage paid to day regretful comment encomium be something of shock to mr tilly have imagined that excellent servant regarded with respectful affection a befitted sort of demigod rle of poor little gentleman be not at to mind revelation of true estimate of although what thought of must no longer have smallest significance irritated profoundly never heard such impertinence said so thought quite out loud still intensely earth bound be astonished to see that have perception whatever of presence raised voice replete with extreme irony addressed cook may reserve criticism on character for saucepan said will doubt appreciate a regard arrangement for funeral have already provided for in will propose to consult convenience at present lor said mr inglis declare can almost hear voice poor little fellow husky be a if must do better by clearing throat suppose id best be making black bow to cap lawyer what not will be here presently mr tilly have sympathy with suggestion be immensely conscious of being quite alive idea of servant behaving a if be dead especially after way in have spoken about be very vexing wanted to give striking evidence of presence activity banged hand angrily on dining room table from breakfast equipage have not yet be cleared three tremendous blow gave be rejoiced to see that parlour maid looked startled mr ingliss face remained perfectly placid why if didnt hear sort of rapping sound said miss talton where did come from nonsense youve jump dear said mr inglis picking up remaining rasher of bacon on fork putting into capacious mouth mr tilly be delighted at making impression at on of impercipient female talton called at top of voice why whats said talton almost hear voice do say mr inglis declare did hear voice then pack o nonsense dear said mr inglis placidly thats prime bit of bacon there good cut of left why youre of tremble imagination suddenly struck mr tilly that might be employing much better than with such extreme exertion managing to convey so slight hint of presence to parlour maid that sance at house of medium mr cumberbatch must afford much easier opportunity of getting through to earth plane again gave couple more thump to table wishing at mr cumberbatchs nearly mile away scarcely heard faint scream of talton at sound of blow before found in west norfolk street knew house well went straight to drawing room be scene of sances have so often so eagerly attended mr cumberbatch who have long spoon shaped face have already pulled down blind leaving room in total darkness except for glimmer of night light under shade of ruby glass stood on chimney piece in front of coloured photograph of cardinal newman round table be seated miss ida soulsby mr mr meriott who paid guinea at least twice week in order to consult spiritual guide abibel received mysterious advice about indigestion investment sir john plaice who be much interested in learning detail of previous incarnation a chaldean priest completed circle guide who revealed to sacerdotal career be playfully called mespot naturally many other spirit visited for miss soulsby have le than three guide in spiritual household sapphire semiramis sweet william while napoleon plato be not infrequent guest cardinal newman too be great favourite encouraged presence by singing in unison of lead kindly light must hardly ever resist that mr tilly observed with pleasure that there be vacant seat by table doubt have be placed there for a entered mr cumberbatch peered at watch eleven oclock already said mr tilly be not here yet wonder what can have kept what will do dear friend abibel get very impatient sometimes if keep waiting mr mr meriott be getting impatient too for terribly wanted to ask about mexican oil have very vexing heartburn mespot doesnt like waiting said sir john jealous for prestige of protector not to mention sweet william miss soulsby gave little silvery laugh oh sweet williams so good kind said besides have feeling quite psychic feeling mr cumberbatch that mr tilly be very close so be said mr tilly indeed a walked here continued miss soulsby felt that mr tilly be somewhere quite close to dear whats that mr tilly be so delighted at being sensed that must not resist giving tremendous rap on table in sort of pleased applause mr cumberbatch heard too im sure thats abibel come to tell that be ready said know abibels knock little patience abibel let give mr tilly three minute more then begin perhaps if put up blind abibel will understand havent begun be done miss soulsby glided to window in order to make known mr tillys approach for always came along opposite pavement crossed over by little island in river of traffic there be evidently lately published news for reader of early edition be busy caught sight of one of advertisement board bearing in large letter announcement of terrible accident at hyde park corner drew in breath with hissing sound turned away unwilling to have psychic tranquillity upset by intrusion of painful incident mr tilly who have followed to window saw what have seen must hardly restrain spiritual whoop of exultation why about said such large letter too very gratifying subsequent edition will doubt contain name gave loud rap to call attention to mr cumberbatch sitting down in antique chair have once belonged to madame blavatsky again heard well if isnt abibel again said be quiet naughty perhaps have better begin recited usual invocation to guide angel leaned back in chair presently began to twitch mutter shortly afterwards with several loud snort relapsed into cataleptic immobility there lay stiff a poker port of call so to speak for voyaging intelligence with pleased anticipation mr tilly awaited coming how gratifying if napoleon with whom have so often talked recognised said pleased to see mr tilly perceive have joined room be dark except for ruby shaded lamp in front of cardinal newman to mr tillys emancipated perception withdrawal of mere material light made difference idly wondered why be generally supposed that disembodied spirit like produced most powerful effect in dark must not imagine reason for puzzled still more there be not to spiritual perception sign of colleague of for so might now call who usually attended mr cumberbatchs sances in such gratifying number though have be moaning muttering long time now mr tilly be in way conscious of presence of abibel sweet william sapphire napoleon ought to be here by now said to while still wondered at absence saw to amazed disgust that medium hand now covered with black glove thus invisible to ordinary human vision in darkness be groping about table clearly searching for megaphone trumpet lay there found that must read mind with same ease though far le satisfaction a have read miss ida hour ago knew that be intending to apply trumpet to own mouth pretend to be abibel semiramis somebody whereas affirmed that never touched trumpet much shocked at snatched up trumpet observed that be not in trance at for opened sharp black eye always reminded of button covered with american cloth gave great gasp why mr tilly said on spiritual plane too rest of circle be now singing lead kindly light in order to encourage cardinal newman conversation be conducted under cover of hoarse crooning voice mr tilly have feeling that though mr cumberbatch saw heard a clearly a saw be quite imperceptible to others yes ive be killed said want to get into touch with material world thats why came here want to get into touch with other spirit too surely abibel mespot ought to be here by time received answer eye fell before like of detected charlatan terrible suspicion invaded mind what be fraud mr cumberbatch asked oh for shame think of guinea have paid will have back said mr cumberbatch dont tell of began to whimper remembered that often made that sort of sniffling noise when abibel be taking possession of usually mean that abibel be coming said with withering sarcasm come along abibel be waiting give trumpet whispered miserable medium oh please give trumpet will hing of kind said mr tilly indignantly must sooner use gave sob of relief oh do mr tilly said what wonderful idea will be most interesting to everybody to hear talk just after youve be killed before know must be making of im not fraud at least not altogether do have spiritual perception sometimes spirit do communicate through when wont come through dreadful temptation to poor woman to to supplement by human agency how must be seeing hearing now be able to talk to so pleasantly im sure if hadnt super normal power youve be killed so assure yet can see hear quite plainly where did happen may ask if not painful subject hyde park corner hour ago said mr tilly only hurt for moment thanks about other suggestion while third verse of lead kindly light be going on mr tilly applied mind to difficult situation be quite true that if mr cumberbatch have power of communication with unseen must not possibly have seen evidently have have heard too for conversation have certainly be conducted on spirit plane with perfect lucidity naturally now that be genuine spirit did not want to be mixed up in fraudulent mediumship for felt that thing must seriously compromise on other side where probably be widely known that mr cumberbatch be person to be avoided on other hand having so soon found medium through whom must communicate with friend be hard to take high moral view say that must have nothing to do with dont know if trust said shouldnt have moment peace if thought that must be sending sort of bogus message from to circle wasnt responsible for at youve done with abibel mespot how can know when dont choose to communicate through wont make up sort of piffle on own account positively squirmed in chair oh ill turn over new leaf said will leave sort of thing behind be medium look at arent more real to than of others dont belong to plane in way that none of others do may be occasionally fraudulent can no more get napoleon here than can fly im genuine a well oh mr tilly be indulgent to poor human creature isnt so long since be one of mention of napoleon with information that mr cumberbatch have never be controlled by great creature wounded mr tilly again often in darkened room have held long colloquy with napoleon have given most interesting detail of life on st helena so mr tilly have found be often borne out by lord roseberys pleasant volume last phase now whole thing wore more sinister aspect suspicion a solid a certainty bumped against mind confess said where did get napoleon talk from told have never read lord roseberys book allowed to look through library to see that wasnt there be honest for once mr cumberbatch suppressed sob will said book be there time put into old cover called elegant extract im not wholly fraud be talking together spirit mortal female cant hear talk only look at youll see can talk to through if youll only be so kind dont often get in touch with genuine spirit like mr tilly glanced at other sitter then back to medium who to keep others interested be making weird gurgling noise like undervitalised siphon certainly be far clearer to than be others argument that be able to see hear have great weight then new curious perception came to mind seemed spread out before like pool of slightly muddy water figured a standing on header board above perfectly able if chose to immerse in objection to so doing be muddiness materiality reason for so doing be that felt that then must be able to be heard by others possibly to be seen by certainly to come into touch with a be loudest bang on table be only faintly perceptible im beginning to understand said oh mr tilly just jump in like kind good spirit said make own test condition put hand over mouth to make sure that im not speaking keep hold of trumpet youll promise not to cheat more asked never made up mind right then said so to speak dived into mind experienced oddest sensation be like passing out of fine sunny air into stuffiest of unventilated room space time closed over again head swam eye be heavy then with trumpet in one hand laid other firmly over mouth looking round saw that room seemed almost completely dark that outline of figure sitting round table have vastly gained in solidity here be said briskly miss soulsby gave startled exclamation thats mr tillys voice whispered why of course be said mr tilly ive just passed over at hyde park corner under traction engine felt dead weight of medium mind conventional conception mild unreal piety pressing in on from side stifling confusing said have to pas through muddy water there wonderful feeling of joy lightness said cant tell of sunshine happiness be very busy active helping others such pleasure dear friend to be able to get into touch with again death be not death be gate of life broke off suddenly oh cant stand said to medium make talk such twaddle do get stupid mind out of way cant do anything in wont interfere with so much can give spirit light round room suggested mr cumberbatch in sleepy voice have come through beautifully mr tilly too dear of youre sure havent arranged phosphorescent patch already asked mr tilly suspiciously yes there be one two near chimney piece said mr cumberbatch none anywhere else dear mr tilly swear there be not just give nice star with long ray on ceiling mr tilly be most good natured of men always willing to help unattractive female in distress whispering to will require phosphorescent patch to be given into hand after sance proceeded by mere effort of imagination to light beautiful big star with red violet ray on ceiling of course be not nearly a brilliant a own conception of for light have to pas through opacity of medium mind be still most striking object elicited gasp of applause from company to enhance effect of intoned few very pretty line about star by adelaide anne procter whose poem have always seemed to to emanate from topmost peak of parnassus oh thank mr tilly whispered medium be lovely must photograph of be permitted on future occasion if must be so kind a to reproduce again oh dont know said mr tilly irritably want to get out im very hot uncomfortable so cheap cheap ejaculated mr cumberbatch why there not medium in london whose future wouldnt be made by real genuine star like say twice week wasnt run over in order might make fortune of medium said mr tilly want to go rather degrading want to see something of new world dont know what like yet oh mr tilly said told lovely thing about how busy happy be didnt be who said that at least be who put into head even a wished found emerging from dull water of mr cumberbatchs mind there whole new world waiting for said must go see ill come back tell for must be full of marvellous revelation suddenly felt hopelessness of there be that thick fluid of materiality to pierce a dripped off again began to see that nothing of fine rare quality of life have just begun to experience must penetrate opacity be why perhaps that thus came across from spirit world be so stupid so banal of whom now be one must tap on furniture must light star must abound with commonplace must read a in book mind of medium sitter nothing more have to pas into region of gross perception in order to be seen of blind eye be heard of deaf ear mr cumberbatch stirred power be failing said in deep voice mr tilly felt be meant to imitate own must leave now dear friend felt much exasperated power isnt failing shouted wasnt who said that have emerged too far perceived that nobody except medium heard oh dont be vexed mr tilly said thats only formula youre leaving very soon not time for just one materialisation be more convincing than anything to most inquirer not one said dont understand how stifling be even to speak through make star ill come back a soon a find there anything new can get through to whats use of repeating stale stuff about being busy happy theyve be told that often enough already besides have got to see if true good bye dont cheat more dropped card of admittance to sance on table heard murmur of excitement a floated off news of wonderful star presence of mr tilly at sance within hour of death at time be unknown to of sitter spread swiftly through spiritualistic circle psychical research society sent investigator to take independent evidence from present be inclined to attribute occurrence to subtle mixture of thought transference unconscious visual impression when heard that miss soulsby have few minute previously seen news board in street outside recording accident at hyde park corner explanation be rather elaborate for postulated that miss soulsby thinking of mr tillys non arrival have combined that with accident at hyde park corner have probably though unconsciously seen name of victim on news board have transferred whole by telepathy to mind of medium a for star on ceiling though must not account for certainly found remains of phosphorescent paint on panel of wall above chimney piece came to conclusion that star have be produced by similar contrivance so rejected whole thing be pity since for once phenomenon be absolutely genuine miss soulsby continued to be constant attendant at mr cumberbatchs sance never experienced presence of mr tilly again on that reader may put interpretation plea look to somewhat a if have found something else to do mr amworth mr amworth village of maxley where last summer autumn strange event took place lie on heathery pine clad upland of sussex in england must not find sweeter saner situation must wind blow from south come laden with spice of sea to east high down protect from inclemency of march from west north breeze reach travel over mile of aromatic forest village be

sunday night horde of scorcher have passed settle down again to five day of cheerful leisurely seclusion railway strike agitate country so much leave undisturbed because most of inhabitant of maxley never leave at be fortunate possessor of one of small georgian house consider le fortunate in having so interesting stimulating neighbour a francis urcombe who most confirmed of maxleyites have not slept away from house stand just opposite to mine in village street for nearly two year at date though still in middle life resigned physiological professorship at cambridge university devoted to study of occult curious phenomenon seem equally to concern physical psychical side of human nature indeed retirement be not unconnected with passion for strange uncharted place lie on confines border of science existence of be so stoutly denied by more materialistic mind for advocated that medical student must be obliged to pas sort of examination in mesmerism that one of tripos paper must be designed to test knowledge in such subject a appearance at time of death haunted house vampirism automatic writing possession of course wouldnt listen to ran account of matter for there be nothing

felt must be of more use by setting out without compass knapsack into mist than by sitting in cage like canary chirping about what be known besides teaching be very bad for man who know only to be learner only need to be self conceited as to teach here then in francis urcombe be delightful neighbour to one who like have uneasy burning curiosity about what called misty perilous place last spring have further most welcome addition to pleasant little community in person of mr amworth widow of indian civil servant husband have be judge in north west province after death at peshawar came back to

sociality than have ever known most of be bachelor spinster elderly folk not much inclined to exert in expense effort of hospitality hitherto gaiety of small tea party with bridge afterwards golosh when be wet to trip home in again for solitary dinner be about climax of festivity mr amworth showed more gregarious way set example of luncheon party little dinner began to follow on other night when such hospitality be on foot lone man like found pleasant to know that call on telephone to mr amworths house not hundred yard off inquiry a to whether might come over after dinner for game of piquet before bed time must probably evoke response of welcome there must be with comrade like eagerness for companionship there be glass of port cup of coffee cigarette game of piquet played piano too in free exuberant manner have charming voice sang to own accompaniment a day grew long light lingered late played game in garden in course of few month have turned from being nursery for slug snail into glowing patch of luxuriant blossoming be always cheery jolly be interested in everything in music in gardening in game of sort be competent performer everybody with one exception liked everybody felt to bring with tonic of sunny day that one exception be francis urcombe though confessed did not like acknowledged that be vastly interested in always seemed strange to for pleasant jovial a be must see nothing in must call forth conjecture intrigued surmise so healthy unmysterious figure did present of genuineness of urcombes interest there must be doubt one must see watching scrutinising in matter of age frankly volunteered information that be forty five briskness activity unravaged skin coal black hair made difficult to believe that be not adopting unusual device adding ten year on to age instead of subtracting often also a quite unsentimental friendship ripened mr amworth must ring up propose advent if be busy writing be to give so definitely bargained frank negative in answer must hear jolly laugh wish for successful evening of work sometimes before proposal arrived urcombe must already have stepped across from house opposite for smoke chat hearing who intending visitor be always urged to beg to come must play piquet said must look on if did not object learn something of game doubt whether paid much attention to for nothing must be clearer than under penthouse of forehead thick eyebrow attention be fixed not on card on one of player seemed to enjoy hour spent thus often until one particular evening in july must watch with air of man who have deep problem in front of enthusiastically keen about game seemed not to notice scrutiny then came that evening when a see in light of subsequent event began first twitching of veil hid secret horror from eye did not know then though noticed that thereafter if rang up to propose coming round always asked not only if be at leisure whether mr urcombe be with if so said must not spoil chat of two old bachelor laughingly wished good night urcombe on occasion have be with for half hour before mr amworths appearance have be talking to about medival belief concerning vampirism one of borderland subject declared have not be sufficiently studied before have be consigned by medical profession to dust heap of exploded superstition there sat grim eager tracing with pellucid clearness have made in cambridge day so admirable lecturer history of mysterious visitation in there be same general feature one of ghoulish spirit took up abode in living man woman conferring supernatural power of bat like flight glutting with nocturnal blood feast when host died continued to dwell in corpse remained undecayed by day rested by night left grave went on awful errand european country in middle age seemed to have escaped earlier yet parallel be to be found in roman greek in jewish history large order to set evidence aside a being moonshine said hundred of totally independent witness in many age have testified to occurrence of phenomenon there explanation known to cover fact if feel inclined to say why then if be fact do not come across now there be two answer can make one be that there be disease known in middle age such a black death be certainly existent then have become extinct since for reason assert that such disease never existed just a black death visited england decimated population of norfolk so here in very district about three hundred year ago there be certainly outbreak of vampirism maxley be centre of second answer be even more convincing for tell that vampirism be by mean extinct now outbreak of certainly occurred in india year two ago at moment heard knocker plied in cheerful peremptory manner in mr amworth be accustomed to announce arrival went to door to open come in at once said save from having blood curdled mr urcombe have be trying to alarm instantly vital voluminous presence seemed to fill room ah how lovely said delight in having blood curdled go on with ghost story mr urcombe adore ghost story saw that a habit be be intently observing wasnt ghost story exactly said be only telling host how vampirism be not extinct yet be saying that there be outbreak of in india only few year ago there be more than perceptible pause saw that if urcombe be observing on side be observing with fixed eye parted mouth then jolly laugh invaded that rather tense silence oh what shame said youre not going to curdle blood at where did pick up such tale mr urcombe have lived for year in india never heard rumour of such thing story teller in bazaar must have invented be famous at must see that urcombe be on point of saying something further checked ah very likely that be said something have disturbed usual peaceful sociability night something have damped mr amworths usual high spirit have gusto for piquet left after couple of game urcombe have be silent too indeed hardly spoke again till departed be unfortunate said for outbreak of of very mysterious disease let call took place at peshawar where husband be well asked be one of victim of said naturally have quite forgotten that when spoke summer be unreasonably hot rainless maxley suffered much from drought also from plague of big black night flying gnat bite of be very irritating virulent came sailing in of evening settling on one skin so quietly that one perceived nothing till sharp stab announced that one have be bitten did not bite hand face chose always neck throat for feeding ground most of a poison spread assumed temporary goitre then about middle of august appeared first of mysterious case of

dr ross in street one afternoon about time in answer to inquiry about patient said that be afraid boy be dying case confessed completely puzzled obscure form of pernicious anmia be must suggest wondered whether mr urcombe must consent to see boy on chance of being able to throw new light on case since urcombe be dining with night proposed to dr ross to join must not do said must look in later when came urcombe at once consented to put skill at others disposal together went off at once being thus shorn of sociable evening telephoned to mr amworth to know if might inflict on for hour answer be welcoming affirmative between piquet music hour lengthened into two spoke of boy who be lying so desperately mysteriously ill told that have often be to see taking nourishing delicate food

magazine thousand thanks will faithfully return good night garden keep window open wont have anmia always sleep with window open said went straight up to bedroom of one of window look out over street a undressed thought heard voice talking outside not far away paid particular attention put out light falling asleep plunged into depth of most horrible dream distortedly suggested doubt by last word with mr amworth dreamed that woke found that bedroom window be shut half suffocating dreamed that sprang out of bed went across to open blind over first be drawn down pulling up saw with indescribable horror of incipient nightmare mr amworths face suspended close to pane in darkness outside nodding smiling at pulling down blind again to keep terror out rushed to second window on other side of room there again be mr amworths face then panic came upon in full blast here be suffocating in airless room whichever window opened mr amworths face must float in like noiseless black gnat bit before one be aware nightmare rose to screaming point with strangled yell awoke to find room cool quiet with window open blind up half moon high in course casting oblong of tranquil light on floor even when be awake horror persisted lay tossing turning must have slept long before nightmare seized for now be nearly day soon in east drowsy eyelid of morning began to lift be scarcely downstairs next morning for after dawn slept late when urcombe rang up to know if might see immediately came in grim preoccupied noticed that be pulling on pipe be not even filled want help said so must tell first of what happened last night went round with little doctor to see patient found just alive scarcely more instantly diagnosed in own mind what anmia unaccountable by other explanation meant boy be prey of vampire put empty pipe on breakfast table by have just sat down folded arm looking at steadily from under overhanging brow now about last night said insisted that must be moved from father cottage into house a be carrying on stretcher whom must meet mr amworth expressed shocked surprise that be moving now why do think did that with start of horror a remembered dream night before felt idea come into mind so preposterous unthinkable instantly turned out again havent smallest idea said then listen while tell about what happened later put out light in room where boy lay watched one window be little open for have forgotten to close about midnight heard something outside trying apparently to push farther open guessed who be yes be full twenty foot from ground peeped round corner of blind just outside be face of mr amworth hand be on frame of window very softly crept close then banged window down think just caught tip of one of finger impossible cried how must be floating in air like what have come for dont tell such once more with closer grip remembrance of nightmare seized be telling what saw said night long until be nearly day be fluttering outside like terrible bat trying to gain admittance now put together various thing have told began checking off on finger number one said there be outbreak of disease similar to boy be suffering from at peshawar husband died of number

there three met noticed saw that urcombe noticed too that one finger of left hand be bandaged good morning to said hear patient be doing well mr urcombe have come to bring bowl of jelly to sit with for hour be great friend be overjoyed at recovery urcombe paused moment a if making up mind then shot out pointing finger at forbid that said will not sit with see know reason a well a do have never seen so horrible change pas over human face a now blanched hers to colour of grey mist put up hand a if to shield from that pointing finger drew sign of cross in air shrank back cowering on to road

quivering twitching be still be buried three day afterwards in cemetery outside maxley in accordance with wish have told that have devised about interment shock sudden awful death have caused to little community began by degree to pas off to two people only urcombe horror of be mitigated from first by nature of relief that death brought naturally enough kept own counsel hint of what greater horror have be thus averted be ever let slip oddly enough so seemed to be still not satisfied about something in connection with must give answer to question on subject then a day of tranquil mellow september october followed began to drop away like leaf of yellowing tree uneasiness relaxed before entry of november seeming tranquillity broke into hurricane have be dining one night at far end of village about eleven oclock be walking home again moon be of unusual brilliance rendering that shone on a distinct a in etching have just come opposite house mr amworth have occupied where there be board up telling that be to let when heard click of front gate next moment saw with sudden chill quaking of very spirit that stood there profile vividly illuminated be turned to must not be mistaken in identification of appeared not to see indeed shadow of yew hedge in front of garden enveloped in blackness went swiftly across road entered gate of house directly opposite there lost sight of completely breath be coming in short pant a if have be running now indeed ran with fearful backward glance along hundred yard separated from house urcombes be to that flying step took next minute be within what have come to tell asked will guess cant guess said guess have come back have seen tell about gave story thats major pearsalls house said come back with there at once what can do asked ive idea thats what have got to find out minute later be opposite house when have passed before be dark now light gleamed from couple of window upstairs even a faced front door opened next moment major pearsall emerged from gate saw stopped im on way to dr ross said quickly wife have be taken suddenly ill have be in bed hour when came upstairs found white a ghost utterly exhausted have be to sleep seemed will excuse one moment major said urcombe be there mark on throat how did guess said there be one of beastly gnat must have bitten twice there be streaming with blood there someone with asked urcombe yes roused maid went off urcombe turned to know now what have to do said change clothes ill join at house what be asked ill tell on way be going to cemetery carried pick shovel screwdriver when rejoined wore round shoulder long coil of rope a walked gave outline of ghastly hour that lay before have to tell said will seem to now too fantastic for credence before dawn will see whether outstrips reality by most fortunate happening saw spectre astral body choose to call of mr amworth going on grisly business therefore beyond doubt vampire spirit abode in during life animates again in death be not exceptional indeed week since death have be expecting if be right will find body undecayed untouched by corruption have be dead nearly two month said if have be dead two year must still be so if vampire have possession of so remember see done will be done not to who in natural course must now be feeding grass above grave to spirit of untold evil malignancy give phantom life to body what will see done said will tell know now at moment vampire clad in mortal semblance be out dining out must get back before dawn will pas into material form lie in grave must wait for then with help will dig up body if be right will look on a be in life with full vigour of dreadful nutriment have received pulsing in vein then when dawn have come vampire can not leave lair of body will strike with pointed to pick through heart who come to life again only with animation fiend give hellish partner will be dead indeed then must bury again delivered at last have come to cemetery in brightness of moonshine there be difficulty in identifying grave lay twenty yard from small chapel in porch of obscured by shadow concealed from there have clear open sight of grave now must wait till infernal visitor returned home night be warm windless yet even if freezing wind have be raging think must have felt nothing of so intense be preoccupation a to what night dawn must bring there be bell in turret of chapel struck quarter of hour amazed to find how swiftly chime succeeded one moon have long set twilight of star shone in clear sky when five oclock of morning sounded from turret few minute more passed then felt urcombes hand softly nudging looking out in direction of pointing finger saw that form of woman tall large in build be approaching from right noiselessly with motion more of gliding floating than walking moved across cemetery to grave be centre of observation moved round a if to be certain of identity for moment stood directly facing in greyness to now eye have grown accustomed must easily see face recognise feature drew hand across mouth a if wiping broke into chuckle of such laughter a made hair stir on head then leaped on to grave holding hand high above head inch by inch disappeared into earth urcombes hand be laid on arm in injunction to keep still now removed come said with pick shovel rope went to grave earth be light sandy soon after six struck have delved down to coffin lid with pick loosened earth round adjusting rope through handle by have be lowered tried to raise be long laborious business light have begun to herald day in east before have out lying by side of grave with screwdriver loosed fastening of lid slid aside standing there looked on face of mr amworth eye once closed in death be open cheek be flushed with colour red full lipped mouth seemed to smile one blow be over said need not look even a spoke took up pick again laying point of on left breast measured distance though knew what be coming must not look away grasped pick in hand raised inch two for taking of aim then with full force brought down on breast fountain of blood though have be dead so long spouted high in air falling with thud of heavy splash over shroud simultaneously from red lip came one long appalling cry swelling up like hooting siren dying away again with instantaneous a lightning flash came touch of corruption on face colour of faded to ash plump cheek fell in mouth dropped thank god thats over said without pause slipped coffin lid back into place day be coming fast now working like men possessed lowered coffin into place again shovelled earth over bird be busy with earliest piping a went back to maxley in tube in tube convention said anthony carling cheerfully not very convincing one time indeed there such thing a time really have actual existence time be nothing more than infinitesimal point in eternity just a space be infinitesimal point in infinity at most time be sort of tunnel through be accustomed to believe that be travelling there roar in ear darkness in eye make seem real to before came into tunnel existed for ever in infinite sunlight after have got through will exist in infinite sunlight again so why must bother about confusion noise darkness only encompass for moment for firm rooted believer in such immeasurable idea a punctuated with brisk application of poker to brave sparkle glow of fire anthony have very pleasant appreciation of measurable finite nobody with whom have acquaintance have so keen zest for life enjoyment a have given evening admirable dinner have passed round port beyond praise have illuminated jolly hour with light of infectious optimism now small company have melted away be left with over fire in study outside tattoo of wind driven sleet be audible on window pane over scoring now again flap of flame on open hearth thought of chilly blast snow covered pavement in brompton square across to skidding taxicab last of other guest have scurried made position resident here till to morrow morning more delicately delightful above there be stimulating suggestive companion who whether talked of great abstraction be so intensely real practical to of very remarkable experience have encountered among convention of time space be equally fascinating to listener adore life said find most entrancing plaything delightful game a know very well only conceivable way to play game be to treat extremely seriously if say to yourself only game cease to take slightest interest in have to know that only game behave a if be one object of existence must like to go on for many year yet time one have to be living on true plane a well be eternity infinity if come to think of one thing human mind can not grasp be finite not infinite temporary not eternal that sound rather paradoxical said only because youve made habit of thinking about thing seem bounded limited look in face for minute try to imagine finite time space find cant go back million year multiply million of year by million find that cant conceive of beginning what happened before beginning beginning beginning before look at like find that only solution comprehensible to be existence of eternity something never began will never end same about space project to farthest star what come beyond emptiness go on through emptiness cant imagine being finite having end must need go on for ever thats only thing can understand there such thing a before after beginning end what comfort be must fidget to death if there wasnt huge soft cushion of eternity to lean one head against people say believe ive heard say that idea of eternity be so tiring feel that want to stop thats because be thinking of eternity in term of time mumbling in brain after after dont grasp idea that in eternity there isnt after more than there be before one eternity isnt quantity quality sometimes when anthony talk in manner seem to get glimpse of to mind be so transparently clear solidly real at other time not having brain readily envisages abstraction feel a though be pushing over precipice intellectual faculty grasp wildly at anything tangible comprehensible be case now hastily interrupted there be before after said few hour ago gave admirable dinner after yes after played bridge now be going to explain thing little more clearly to after will go to bed laughed will do exactly a like said shant be slave to time to night to morrow morning wont even mention hour for breakfast will have in eternity whenever awake a see be not midnight yet well slip bond of time talk quite infinitely will stop clock if will assist in getting rid of illusion then ill tell story to mind show how unreal so called reality be at rate how fallacious be sens a judge of what be real what be not something occult something spookish asked pricking up ear for anthony have strangest clairvoyance vision of thing unseen by normal eye suppose might call of occult said though there certain amount of rather grim reality mixed up in go on excellent mixture said threw fresh log on fire longish story said may stop a soon a youve have enough there will come point for claim consideration who cling to before after have ever occurred to how difficult be to say when incident take place say that man commits crime of violence can not with good deal of truth say that really commits that crime when definitely plan determines upon dwelling on with actual commission of think can reasonably argue be mere material sequel of resolve be guilty of when make that determination when therefore in term of before after doe crime truly take place there be also in story further point for consideration for seems certain that spirit of man after death of body be obliged to re enact such crime with view suppose may guess to remorse eventual redemption who have second sight have seen such re enactment perhaps may have done deed blindly in life then spirit re commits with spiritual eye open able to comprehend enormity so will view man original determination material commission of crime only a prelude to real commission of when with eye unsealed doe repents of that sound very obscure when speak in abstract think will see what mean if follow tale comfortable got everything want here go then leaned back in chair concentrating mind then spoke story that be about to tell said have beginning month ago when be away in switzerland reached conclusion so imagine last night at rate expect to experience more of well month ago be returning late on very wet night from dining out there be not taxi to be have hurried through pouring rain to tube station at piccadilly circus thought very lucky to catch last train in direction carriage into stepped be quite empty except for one other passenger who sat next door immediately opposite to have never to knowledge seen before found attention vividly fixed on a if somehow concerned be man of middle age in dress clothes face wore expression of intense thought a if in mind be pondering very significant matter hand be resting on knee clenched unclenched suddenly looked up stared in face saw there suspicion fear a if have surprised in secret deed at moment stopped at dover street conductor threw open door announced station added change here for hyde park corner gloucester road be right for since meant that train must stop at brompton road be destination be all right apparently too for companion for certainly did not get out after moment stop during one else got in went on saw must insist after door be closed train have started when looked again a rattled on saw that there be one there be quite alone in carriage now may think that have have one of swift momentary dream flash in out of mind in space of second did not believe be so for felt have experienced sort of premonition clairvoyant vision man semblance of whom astral body may choose to call have just seen must sometime sit in seat opposite to pondering planning why asked why must have be astral body of living man thought have seen why not ghost of dead one because of own sensation sight of spirit of someone dead have occurred to two three time in life have always be accompanied by physical shrinking fear by sensation of cold of loneliness believed at rate have seen phantom of living impression be confirmed might say proved next day for met man next night a will hear met phantom again will take in order be lunching then next day with neighbour mr stanley there be small party when arrived waited for final guest entered while be talking to friend presently at elbow heard mr stanley voice let introduce to sir henry payle said turned saw vi vi of night before be quite unmistakably a shook hand looked at thought with vague puzzled recognition havent met before mr carling said seem to recollect for moment forgot strange manner of disappearance from carriage thought that have be man whom have seen last night surely not so long ago said for sat opposite other in last tube train from piccadilly circus yesterday night still looked at frowning puzzled shook head can hardly be said only came up from country morning now interested profoundly for astral body be told abides in half conscious region of mind spirit have recollection of what have happened to can convey only very vaguely dimly to conscious mind lunch time must see eye again again directed to with same puzzled perplexed air a be taking departure came up to will recollect day said where met before hope may meet again be not stopped have gone from added log anthony have thrown on fire be burning bravely now high flickering flame lit up face now dont know whether believe in coincidence a chance thing said if do get rid of notion if cant at once call coincidence that very night again caught last train on tube going westward time so far from being solitary passenger there be considerable crowd waiting at dover street where entered just a noise of approaching train began to reverberate in tunnel caught sight of sir henry payle standing near opening from train must presently emerge apart from rest of crowd thought to myself how odd be must have seen phantom of at very hour last night man now began walking towards with idea of saying anyhow be in tube that meet to night then terrible awful thing happened just a train emerged from tunnel jumped down on to line in front of train swept along over up platform for moment be stricken with horror at sight remember covering eye against dreadful tragedy then perceived that though have taken place in full sight of who be waiting one seemed to have seen except driver looking out from window have not applied brake there be jolt from advancing train scream cry rest of passenger began boarding train with perfect nonchalance must have staggered for felt sick faint with what have seen kindly soul put arm round supported into train be doctor told asked if be in pain what ailed told what thought have seen assured that such accident have taken place be clear then to own mind have seen second act so to speak in psychical drama pondered next morning over problem a to what must do already have glanced at morning paper a knew must be case contained mention whatever of what have seen thing have certainly not happened knew in that must happen flimsy veil of time have be withdrawn from eye have seen into what must call future in term of time of course be future from point of view thing be just a much in past a be in future existed waited only for material fulfilment more thought about more saw must hing interrupted narrative did nothing exclaimed surely might have taken step in order to try to avert tragedy shook head what step precisely said be to go to sir henry tell once more have seen in tube in act of committing suicide look at like what have seen be pure illusion pure imagination in case have existence significance at be actual real essentially have happened take though not very logically somewhere between two say that idea of suicide for cause of knew nothing have occurred to must occur must not if be case be doing very dangerous thing by making such suggestion to might not fact of telling what have seen put idea into mind if be already there confirm strengthen ticklish matter to play with soul a browning say seems so inhuman not to interfere in way said not to make attempt what interference asked what attempt human instinct in still seemed to cry aloud at thought of doing nothing to avert tragedy seemed to be beating against something austere inexorable cudgel brain a must must not combat sense of what have said have answer for went on must recollect too said that believed then believe now that thing have happened cause of be have begun to work effect in material sphere be inevitable be what alluded to when at beginning of story asked to consider how difficult be to say when action took place still hold that particular action suicide of sir henry have not yet taken place because have not yet thrown under advancing train to that seems materialistic view hold that in endorsement of so to speak have taken place fancy sir henry for instance now free from material dusk know that exactly a spoke there swept through warm lit room current of ice cold air ruffling hair a passed making wood flame on hearth to dwindle flare looked round to see if door at back have opened nothing stirred there over closed window curtain be fully drawn a reached anthony sat up quickly in chair directed glance way that about room did feel that asked yes sudden draught said ice cold anything else asked other sensation paused before answered for at moment there occurred to anthony differentiation of effect produced on beholder by phantasm of living apparition of dead be latter accurately described sensation now certain physical shrinking fear feeling of desolation yet have seen nothing felt rather creepy said a spoke drew chair rather closer to fire sent swift confess somewhat apprehensive scrutiny round wall of brightly lit room noticed at same time that anthony be peering across to chimney piece on just below sconce holding two electric light stood clock at beginning of talk have offered to stop hand noticed pointed to twenty five minute to one saw nothing asked nothing whatever said why must what be there to see did dont think so said somehow answer got on nerve for queer feeling have accompanied that cold current of air have not left if anything have become more acute surely know whether saw anything not said one cant always be certain said say that dont think saw anything im not sure whether story be telling be quite concluded last night think there may be further incident if prefer will leave rest of a far a know unfinished till to morrow morning can go off to bed now complete calmness tranquillity reassured why must do asked again looked round on bright wall well think something entered room just now said may develop if dont like notion have better go of course there nothing to be alarmed at whatever be cant hurt be close on hour when on two successive night saw what have already told apparition usually occurs at same time why be so can not say certainly look a if spirit be earth bound be still subject to certain convention convention of time for instance think that personally will see something before long most likely wont youre not such sufferer a from delusion be frightened knew be also intensely interested perverse pride wriggled within at last word why so asked shouldnt see be to be seen dont want to go in least said want to hear rest of story where be then ah yes be wondering why didnt do something after saw train move up to platform said that there be nothing to be done if think over fancy will agree with couple of day passed on third morning saw in paper that there have come fulfilment to vision sir henry payle who have be waiting on platform of dover street station for last train to south kensington have thrown in front of a came into station train have be pulled up in couple of yard wheel have passed over chest crushing in instantly killing inquest be held there emerged at one of dark story on occasion like sometimes fall like midnight shadow across life that world perhaps have thought prosperous have long be on bad term with wife from whom have lived apart appeared that not long before have fallen desperately in love with woman night before suicide have appeared very late at wife house have long angry scene with in entreated to divorce threatening otherwise to make life hell to refused in ungovernable fit of passion attempted to strangle there be struggle noise of caused manservant to come up who succeeded in over mastering lady payle threatened to proceed against for assault with intention to murder with hanging over head next night a have already told committed suicide glanced at clock again saw that hand now pointed to ten minute to one fire be beginning to burn low room surely be growing strangely cold thats not quite said anthony again looking round be sure wouldnt prefer to hear to morrow mixture of shame pride curiosity again prevailed tell rest of at once said before speaking peered suddenly at point behind chair shading eye followed glance knew what meant by saying that sometimes one must not be sure whether one saw something not be that outlined shadow intervened between wall be difficult to focus did not know whether be near wall near chair seemed to clear away anyhow a looked more closely at see nothing asked anthony dont think so said think do said eye followed something be invisible to mine came to rest between chimney piece looking steadily there spoke again happened week ago said when be out in switzerland since then up till last night saw nothing further time be expecting something further felt that a far a be concerned be not over yet last night with intention of assisting communication to come through to from from beyond went into dover street tube station at few minute before one oclock hour at assault suicide have taken place platform when arrived on be absolutely empty appeared to be so presently just a began to hear roar of approaching train saw there be figure of man standing twenty yard from looking into tunnel have not come down with in lift moment before have not be there began moving towards then saw who be felt stir of wind icy cold coming towards a approached be not draught herald approach of train for came from opposite direction came close up to saw there be recognition in eye raised face towards saw lip move perhaps in increasing noise from tunnel heard nothing come from put out hand a if entreating to do something with cowardice from can not forgive from for knew by sign have told that be one from dead flesh quaked before drowning for moment pity desire to help if be possible certainly have something wanted of recoiled from by now train be emerging from tunnel next moment with dreadful gesture of despair threw in front of a finished speaking got up quickly from chair still looking fixedly in front of saw pupil dilate mouth worked be coming said be to be given chance of atoning for cowardice there be nothing to be afraid of must remember a spoke there came from panelling above chimney piece one loud shattering crack cold wind again circled about head found shrinking back in chair with hand held in front of a instinctively screened against something knew be there must not see sense told that there be presence in room other than mine anthony horror of be must not see vision however terrible must felt be more tolerable than clear certain knowledge close to be invisible thing yet what horror might not be disclosed of face of dead crushed chest must see a shuddered in cold wind be familiar wall of room anthony standing in front of stiff firm making a knew call on courage eye be focused on something quite close to semblance of smile quivered on mouth then spoke again yes know said want something of tell then what be there be absolute silence what be silence to ear must not have be so to for once twice nodded once said yes see will do with knowledge even a there be someone here whom must not see so there be speech going on must not hear terror of dead of unknown rose in with sense of powerlessness to move that accompanies nightmare must not stir must not speak must only strain ear for inaudible eye for unseen while cold wind from very valley of shadow of death streamed over be not that presence of death be terrible be that from tranquillity serene keeping there have be driven unquiet soul unable to rest in peace for ultimate awakening rous countless generation of who have passed away driven le from activity be theirs back into material world from must have be delivered never until gulf between living dead be thus bridged have seemed so immense so unnatural be possible that dead may have communication with living be not that exactly so terrified for such communication a know come voluntarily from here be something icy cold crime laden be chased back from peace must not pacify then most horrible of there came change in unseen condition anthony be silent now from looking straight fixedly in front of began to glance sideways to where sat back again with felt that unseen presence have turned attention from to now too gradually by awful degree began to see there came outline of shadow across chimney piece panel above took shape fashioned into outline of man within shape of shadow detail began to form saw wavering in air like something concealed by haze semblance of face stricken tragic burdened with weight of woe a human face have ever worn next shoulder outlined stain livid red spread out below suddenly vision leaped into clearness there stood chest crushed in drowned in red stain from broken rib like bone of wrecked ship protruded mournful terrible eye be fixed on be from so knew that bitter wind proceeded then quick a switching off of lamp spectre vanished bitter wind be still opposite to stood anthony in quiet bright lit room there be sense of unseen presence more be then alone with interrupted conversation still dangling between in warm air came round to a one come round after ansthetic swam into sight again unreal at first gradually assuming texture of actuality be talking to somebody not to said who be what be passed back of hand over forehead glistened in light soul in hell said now be hard ever to recall mere physical sensation when have passed if have be cold be warmed be difficult to remember what cold be like if have be hot have got cool be difficult to realise what oppression of heat really meant just so with passing of presence found unable to recapture sense of terror with few moment ago only have invaded inspired soul in hell said what be talking about moved about room for minute so then came sat on arm of chair dont know what saw said what felt there have never in life happened to anything more real than what last few minute have brought have talked to soul in hell of remorse be only possible hell knew from what happened last night that must perhaps establish communication through with world have quitted sought found be charged with mission to woman have never seen message from contrite can guess who be got up with sudden briskness let verify anyhow said gave street number ah there telephone book must be coincidence merely if found that at in chasemore street south kensington there lived lady payle turned over leaf of bulky volume yes thats right said rodericks story rodericks story power of persuasion at first seemed quite ineffectual must not induce friend roderick cardew to strike melancholy tent in chelsea leaving struck steal away like arab spend month of spring with at newly acquired house at tilling to observe spell of april wand making magic in country seemed to have brought out argument of be master have be very ill doctor recommended clearer air with a mild climate a must conveniently attain loved great stretch of drained marsh land lay spread like pool of verdure round little town have not seen new home made breach in function of hospitality really must not be expected to object to host who after be one of oldest friend besides to leave stone unturned a regained strength must begin to play golf again entailed a well remembered very mild exertion for to keep in proper position in such pursuit at last there be sign of yielding yes must like to see marsh big sky once more said rather sinister interpretation of word once more made sudden flashed signal of alarm in mind be utterly fanciful doubt have better be extinguished first once more asked what doe mean always say once more said greedy to ask for too much very fact that fenced so ingeniously deepened suspicion that wont do said tell roddie be silent moment didnt intend to said for there can be use in if insist a apparently mean to do may a well give in what think once more will very likely be most mustnt fuss about im not going to proper person fuss about death thats train be sure to catch always wait for have noticed that when one learns tidings of sort one feel almost immediately that one have known long time felt so now go on said well thats about there be ive have sentence of death passed upon will probably be carried out im delighted to say in french fashion in france know dont tell when be to be executed till few minute before be likely that will have even le than so doctor informs second two will be will get congratulate please thought over for moment yes heartily said want to know little more though well heart wrong quite unmendably so heart disease doesnt sound romantic in mid victorian romance hero heroine alone die of heart disease thats by way fact be may die at time without moment warning will give couple of gasp so told when insisted on knowing detail thatll be now perhaps understand why be unwilling to come stay with dont want to die in house think dreadfully bad manner to die in other people house long to see tilling again think will go to hotel hotel be fair game for management over charge who live there to compensate for who die there must be rude of to die in house might entail lot of bother for couldnt apologize dont mind dying in house said at least see what mean laughed do

have bedroom like want dreadfully to see house be adorable o roddie what bore be be impossible to speak to think differently knew well how trivial matter death be to friend be not sure that at heart did not agree with be quite at one too in have so often gossiped about death with cheerful conjecture interested surmise based on steady assurance that something of new delightful import be to follow since neither of happened to be of melancholy cast of mind can envisage annihilation have promised in case be first to embark on great adventure to do best to get through give irrefutable proof of continuance of existence just by way of endorsement of belief have given similar pledge for appeared to whatever condition of future might turn out to be must be impossible when lately translated there not to be still greatly concerned with what present world still held for in tie of love affection laughed now to remember how have once imagined begging to be excused for few minute directly after death saying to st peter may keep holiness waiting for minute before finally lock into heaven hell with beautiful key wont be minute do want so much to be ghost appear to friend of mine who be
