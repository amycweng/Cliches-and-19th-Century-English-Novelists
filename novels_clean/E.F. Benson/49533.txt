shouted so did now tell straight for will save trouble be who suggested that must get money from treasury economos who have be playing noisy demagogue morning be quite prepared to play again if advisable determined for present to talk soberly suggested said dryly be willing also to tell that struck a admirable notion did so said tombazes musingly then be more easily pleased than most men for idea of admirable seems to silliest thing have ever heard tell of a be older than man of experience be likely have run against many silly thing in world now man sit down be way of speaking man in island take offence at what say for know must not help what have hand to aye must be like to get nose pulled be of more immediate consequence now tell how many ship do mean to victual put into commission with admirable notion four to begin with said economos four to begin with say exclaimed tombazes in lamentable treble voice how many to end with with what will be paying crew man do think will find enough to keep in pipe tobacco with what be in treasury four to begin with save crew will average sixty men continued economos will make two hundred forty year treasury pay wage of two hundred fifty men deal with fact see come then let have fact cried tombazes surely will help be fact man will be wanting why must have fever ague in blood want bleeding man see in eye do think collect tax for whole year together suppose what there be in treasury will last month well say last month said tombazes what then will return here for more money much will find when have taken from island just men who pay bulk of tax be thinking that admirable notion be even sillier if look into than appeared on surface even look of on surface made think have be better for blood letting see father listen to said economos with sudden earnestness have heard what have happened surely have not must not speak thus do know kalamata have be taken by greek that beacon of liberty have flashed from one end of country to free people have stood in meadow round kalamata sung 'te deum ' for great wonderful victory be that not thing to make blood tingle in north germanos archbishop primate have raised revolt monk of megaspelaion be up in arm petrobey of maina have come forth like herd of hungry wolf tombazes ' eye flashed be fit that must tell have to say for mad scheme go on man go on tell know can judge better so economos suspected truth that primate be tinder to flame with certain acumen did not let see did at present tax with instead spoke of plan of revolutionist how that turk be flocking into tripolitza from when time came there must be escape how essential be to success of war that greece must be cut off from headquarters of ottoman force must not be done till coast be in hand of insurgent ship prevented fresh arm men being sent into country be part of greek port island spetzas have already joined in psara soon must standard of revolution be raised be hydra largest

mob of soldier sailor spare must leave hydriots house while camped on hillside must woman be spared because be loyal danger to greece be thus doubled turk must be holding eyrie from to swoop in midst of patriot indeed concluded economos returning from somewhat rhetorical language to colloquialism will have wasp ' nest in seat of trouser if please be too much for tombazes motioning back crowd who have begun to encroach again spoke low to other will surely burst unless speak said do not see how be with man be blinder than worm if see that if drop word of till give leave swear by lance of st george coffee pot made whole will kick till foot be sore be le like man than jelly fish that treasury notion of yours be absurd that stick to for reason gave give up ask for present mark listen to be traitor in camp for good cause can help if primate others be assured be not going to touch national treasury for safety think mean safety from turk opposition will be withdrawn must raise money way moreover want five time a much a there be in treasury what be use of four ship eh be what meant when said notion seemed to silliest thing have ever heard did not see that ah well god made blind men

playing a assured be only way of fighting for good cause for have openly joined revolutionist party confidence other primate felt in must be gone must be more eager to oppose nail to proposal what regarded a diplomatic victory with regard to national treasure gave position of extraordinary security among economos perhaps partly for own end spurious credit people must give of having successfully fought down opposition of primate be equally anxious to conceal tombazes part in affair at length sum adequate to meet immediate expense be raised crew be paid one month wage in advance with prospect of prize money won from turk people seized on national treasury tombazes ill suppressed delight at step be conveyed to primate in conclave put for moment within ace of exposure fresh intrigue began primate to make best of bad job appealed to sailor captain who have formerly be in employment offering fresh berth in own service for many of owned ship a island be now pledged to national cause too proposed to have finger in prize money economos on other hand failing to see how be just that who have opposed scheme must take share in now organized revolutionary committee in whose hand must be

most part trading brig of poorer class there be little booty to be divided among captor tenth day of cruise saw squadron off cape sunium at extreme south end of attica day before have run before strong south wind hoping to clear promontory before night get through dangerous strait to north of by daylight until evening heaven have be clear night came on cloudy starless calm fearing to pas strait in so uncertain light for be full of reef order have be given to lie to wait for day current of shifting sea rendered impossible to maintain position greater part of squadron be caught by racing flow of water run up northwest towards peiraeus drifted safely swiftly up gulf of remainder two weathered sunium lay for shelter under zea where remained till morning two finding dangerously near rocky south headland of sunium beat out to sea again before breeze dropped by morning lay far out to east of others day broke windless calm with oily sea big not broken coming in from south ship in gulf have to wait for land breeze to spring up off zea who have passed sunium lay to till others joined two to east hydriot ship out of shelter of land have moderate breeze from north for two hour after daybreak waited others out of reach of wind made sign about nine o'clock be aware of turkish ship coming from north sailing a supposed to island to peloponnesian port two greek ship be lying close together may be cable distance apart be immediately clear to that turk must be stopped for purpose of squadron be none other than admiral ship far away to west be impossible to signal even if possible ineffectual for nought miracle must have brought up land breeze at nine in morning so a in duty bound two brig like sea swallow put about hoisting greek flag went in pursuit of turk a neared be evident that day work be before sachturi captain of one of brig signalled to pinotzi ship of war pinotzi signalled back so be yanni sachturi captain son lusty laughing boy of about eighteen danced with delight a read signal to father heard order to clear for action port have be closed for heavy sea have be running during night in few minute gun be run out men at post poker heating in galley

went straight for must pas ordered that ship must laid two point nearer wind pinotzi followed lead in ten minute be clear that be rapidly overhauling in half hour be short mile off for moment turk seemed to hesitate then putting about went off on easterly tack here greek gained more speedily perceiving went off straight down wind again manoeuvre lost more ground sachturi be now broadside to other when turk opened fire aim be too low hall struck water two hundred yard from greek ship in spite of imposing appearance sachturi noticed that only five gun be fired ball from three of ricochetted off sea flew two of just beyond greek bow other clearing deck without touching sachturi gun replied apparently without effect changing course made easterly tack to pas behind for gun seemed to be forward pinotzi who have heavier ordnance ran up broadside turk exchanged volley two owing to heavy rolling of ship inexperience of greek gunner at least without doing receiving damage sachturi guess have be correct though why ship of war have put to sea only half armed did not pause to consider coming up within range let have starboard gun have thus to lie broadside on to sea made accurate aim difficult again putting head to sea ran on meaning to use two gun in bow at close quarter for hour more be battle of hawk raven two greek ship skimmed tacked about on light breeze sometimes getting in broadside a closed in sometimes passing behind stern where seemed to be unarmed twice sachturi sailed round giving broadside for broadside at last lucky shot cut main mast of turk in half bringing down to deck pile of wreckage canvas must see men hauling away to clear deck when shot from pinotzi brought down second mast leaving rolling helplessly with only mizzen standing sachturi have just rounded stern have given broadside when turk fired ball crashing through bulwark killed two sailor with yanni who be just taking order from father to close with throw on grappling iron sachturi did not move set teeth for moment looked at yanni be lying on back chest shot away staring up into sky face be untouched mouth seemed to smile be father only son sachturi loved a own soul in ten minute grappling iron be cast on to turk twice be thrown off third time two anchored in rope block of wrecked main mast though turk sought furiously to free in minute greek from sachturi ship be pouring over side since yanni have be killed have only said three word twice when grappling iron be thrown off ordered to be cast again once a boarded spare none have cried order be obeyed

be stroking dead lad hair chapter iii next fortnight cruising be well rewarded by prize took already symptom of dual control in fleet thus of control at have unhappily begun to make appearance primate be by mean disposed to forgive slight economos have put upon before long devised cunning unpatriotic scheme of paying in public money so to speak private debt to to certain extent immediate adoption of naval plan among sailor have be due to hope put forward to islander of winning large prize primate by making main issue of secondary desire among began to reinstate in power much of booty taken be to be divided on return of squadron to hydra economos at suggestion of tombazes proposed that one half of gain of cruise must be appropriated to prosecution of war be equitable patriotic suggestion coming a did from economos primate opposed nail equally too did fail to satisfy more greedy selfish of supporter who cared for nothing own aggrandizement economos proposal have be put forward one afternoon three day after return to hydra at sitting of revolutionary committee have be reorganized included primate tombazes alone of class supported economos matter be still in debate when rose for day afternoon have be hot windless hour before sundown southerly breeze began to stir before long word be brought by shepherd who have be grazing flock on hill above town that have seen ship under full sail off southwest making straight for hydra be known that turkish ship have escaped fate of consort at kalamata fleet though have kept lookout for have seen nothing of fate be to learn later tombazes hesitated what to do ship might be part of turkish squadron have be cruising off west coast of greece again might be single ship from kalamata in former case have better look to defence of harbor in latter might be possible to man couple of brig give chase determined however to wait little yet for other ship have be sighted a long a there be one must be time to give chase when declared more manifestly so going down to quay where must meet economos other commander mingled with crowd even in so short space ship have come incredibly nearer even a looked livelier gust shook out fold of flag at elbow one shouted capsina be capsina be capsina back again flag carried be blue on be cross of greece crescent anywhere on came black against crimson sky crumpling water beneath forefoot on quay crowd thickened thickened soon there came to across water cheer from ship at throat be opened shout after shout went up for moment jealousy quarrelling be forgotten primate mingled enthusiasm with rest feeling for example so memorably set by capsina pocket must be lighter by prize money have won even father nikolas perhaps sourest man god ever made found excitedly shaking hand with economos after passing southern point of harbor sophia hauled down mainsail three minute afterwards have swung round anchor chain be screaming out before have well come into harbor fifty boat be racing out to meet then one of own boat be let down saw that tall girlish figure preceded by michael followed by kanaris step in elder christos with son daughter in law grandchild be first on step when came ashore kissed affectionately asking first after one then other have be doing since went asked have only heard that certain ship from hydra have be stinging turk very shrewdly more for have not be idle two turkish ship lie on ooze of deep sea one more have taken to nauplia will do penance for having served turk in now fighting for ah father held out hand to tombazes admiral will call here be truant home again before evening be out though enthusiasm of people grew higher higher a capsina deed went from mouth to mouth primate cooled father nikolas from being positively genial passed through stage of subacidity became more superacid than one must have thought possible for so small man to be for appeared that tombazes have dined with that have wished to hand over at once le than eight hundred turkish pound for war fund tombazes have told at present there be war fund on very day proposal have be made for one must without doubt be vetoed on morrow at seemed that capsina stared at in undisguised amazement then said will see soon after boy from house came running into one of cafs on quay economos frequented said that capsina wished to see immediately economos seemed disposed to finish game of draught opponent no other than rejected christos who be getting worst of rose at once swept men back into box when capsina call for go remarked laconically when sends away go also elsewhere remarked economos who have heard of christos dismissal with parthian shot left caf in roar elder christos be also with capsina when economos entered rose be doing what be right said shaking hand be with so looked severely at uncle so will christos capsas be sit down there be wine for then turning to tombazes be quite out of question not to have war fund said on mainland half of be taken go to other half remember be divided among far more men in proportion to prize than have here good god man turned to christos how be possible that did not see tell be going to vote with primate how be war to be carried on thus be war affair of day two to last no longer than autumn vintage already tell national treasury be empty have finished war for if so indeed have not heard result how will pay men for next cruise how do number go on question there be four of here who will of course vote for fund tombazes appeared somewhat timorous capsina said be not fault know must remember that be not on committee capsina laughed be not matter need trouble said will see to to morrow meeting be public say well will be there mean to be on committee of course will be by virgin must be strange thing if head of clan have voice in affair so concern island be fit also that kanaris must be of committee for though be psarian yet serf on hydriot ship be likely that will give command of when cruise next even blind faith with tombazes regarded doings of capsina be disposed to question christos moved uneasily in chair be not little irregular asked that one of island must have voice in government of war too be little irregular said capsina only in matter of war do propose must have vote now father went on here be man one of thousand a know to be will fight two of ship knock into faggot for fire quicker than man must cut from tree be of psara be true serf hydra will have voice in matter of fleet to now belongs with admission of capsina kanaris into committee conclusion must not be so foregone so thought tombazes a first appeared to for admission pledged to vote for rest trusted capsina long after others have gone sophia sat where be lost in sort of eager contentment home coming enthusiastic pride affection of people stirred in chord have thought almost hoped be forever dumb wild splendid adventure of last week ardent championship of race fierce ever growing hatred of detestable master have of late made sum of conscious desire to night something of thrill of home be on more than once have looked half enviously at small ragged girl who stared at a passed who be most likely never to know anything of sweet sting of stirring action live inactive life with affection for ardor care of child for cause of nation michael lay at foot wondered vaguely if be better to be a be to sit at foot of master be able to call nothing one own only part of to think barren thought be never capsina habit mind went forward to meeting next day meeting be held always on quay table be set round sat four twenty member of committee people be allowed to stand round listen to official utterance after pleasant freshness of hearing father nikolas say bitter thing to tombazes tombazes reply with genial contempt giggle only have worn off be not usually very generally attended morning hour before appointed time end of quay where meeting be held began to fill chair bench be in requisition sachturi father miser of hydra by report richest man of place have given two piaster for seat in constituted epoch in history of finance by degree member of committee took place tombazes looked round with ill concealed dismay at absence of capsina called for silence silence be interrupted by clear voice michael michael said come boy be very late from end of quay came capsina attended by michael kanaris walked quickly up through crowd made way for right left stopping now then to speak to friend have not yet seen still round table silence continued father nikolas broke meeting have be summoned said bitterly be to suppose have be summoned for purpose tombazes have eye fixed on capsina be meeting adjourned asked father nikolas chairman smiled capsina by time have made way up to table looked round chair said two chair kanaris sit by please have chosen place between old christos sachturi two parted making room for chair kanaris sat down in obedience to gesture from remained standing have word to say began abruptly since clan of capsas have be in island head of clan have always have voice in national affair have be prevented from attending former meeting of particular assembly because be perhaps better employed in chasing capturing turkish ship a head of clan take seat here for moment there be dead silence father nikolas in answer must appear to hint from neighbor stood up matter be one on vote of committee be required said for a understand by original constitution possessed power of adding to number for sophia interrupted doe one here besides father nikolas said oppose election did not say began father nikolas father because made bold to interrupt remarked capsina with dangerous suavity then turning in place committee be told be elected by people of hydra there be candidate for election chairman will give name capsina be candidate for election said tombazes among primate there be faint show of opposition father nikolas passed whispered consultation to colleague after delay eight of amid derisive yell from people voted against election be thus carried by sixteen to eight there be greater bitterness in store for father capsina again rose shout died down have first said to make report to admiral of hydriot fleet to belong a to doings of crew sailed a know perhaps little independently what have done have done for island on second day of expedition sank turkish vessel be cruising for conscription in harbor at melos with on board perhaps be picked up know on eighth day captured cruiser off astra kanaris took into nauplia where will now enter service of greek fleet on twelfth day sank corvette off southern cape there be heavy sea running went to piece on rock have also taken certain amount of prize money disposition of will speak of later first there be matter kanaris be by birth psarian serf on ship be willing to continue to serve in hydriot squadron be right that must have voice in affair of expedition for tell plainly if man must sail ship between two wolf rock of hydra be that man have be taken into most intimate council of central revolutionary committee be not fit that must be without voice here also before long will be in command of sophia when new ship be building be ready father nikolas will now be good enough to tell reason for opposing candidate father nikolas started a if have be stung then recovering capsina have already stated said man did not catch name if reflect said capsina sternly think will remember that did father nikolas looked round with wild eye man continued be psarian be that not sufficient reason why must find place in hydriot assembly surely not father said capsina for if mistake not be by birth spetziot yet who on ground must seek to exclude from assembly case be not similar said nikolas thirty year ago father settled here while be yesterday that kanaris be waiting for remarked capsina absently sound came from chairman almost exactly a if somebody sitting in place have giggled then tried unsuccessfully to convert noise into cough father nikolas peered at with wrinkled puckered eye will continue said after pause in have eyed tombazes who sat shaking with inward laughter yet not venturing to meet eye for fear of explosion for ten year have sat in assembly of primate dissatisfaction with seat there must have be expressed thirty year ago year in fact before who be now expressing be born capsina smiled think said that one must think of expressing even perhaps well of expressing dissatisfaction replied must object to putting into mouth exact opposite of what really heard from word implied what have said retorted nikolas getting white angry such be not case said capsina if be must be le ready to find malignant meaning in word bear none here tombazes interfered father nikolas said be here to discus matter of national import see that be contributing to kanaris let remind be candidate for election kanaris time be sitting quietly between capsina sachturi listening without least evidence of discomposure to be being said smiled when nikolas suddenly blurted out name of be ignorant otherwise seemed like man who support hearing of twice told tale with extreme politeness be rather tall strongly built with great square shoulder dress be studiously neat well cared for hair falling after custom of day on to shoulder be neatly trimmed chin very smoothly shaven in hand held string of amber bead passed to fro like man seated at caf now however popular election of capsina have be with people be soon clear to that there be such unanimity about islander be conservative isolated folk viewed with jealousy resentment anything like interference on part of others in affair for adoring affection in held girl without doubt nikolas party must have won day quick a thought capsina determined to make use of people championship of herself to gain end be of quick tongue for next ten minute concentrated acidity of nikolas on provoking by hundred little stinging saying drawing attack off from debate on to herself at length turned on full already see effect of having woman in council said hour have passed instead of settling affair of moment debate be concerned with management of monastery rain water color of hair may be useful hope be in way do see how bear upon conduct of fleet be intolerable must be thus exposed in sight of to wanton insult of girl anger suddenly flashed out by virgin cried be not to be stood be ill day for clan let tell when headship passed into hand like will not submit to hydriot be where be husband to whom be betrothed tell care nothing for hydra for war for of only for own foolhardy headstrong will be father nikolas proposing must now marry christos capsas asked sophia be fine thing for primate to say be not since came to hydra that cousin christos chose wife for father nikolas face expressed incredible deal of hatred malice must be stopped said woman leave assembly remedy lie with father nikolas said capsina nikolas paused for moment mouth be dry with anger be not so long ago said that heard hydra proclaimed independent state subject to none show anything more farcical than free be then who be who force herself creature into assembly be to be slave of woman clan for part will be dictated to insulted by man woman clan of capsas who be clan of capsas be leagued together for own self seeking end be just what sophia be waiting for sprang to foot turning to people clan of capsas cried of clan in instant at clan cry there be scene of wildest confusion old christos jumped up anastasi overturned chair stood on other side of sophia michael raged furiously about in ecstasy of excitement from crowd stood round men sprang forward taking place in row behind capsina till rank stretched way down quay then capsina called clan of capsas be with great shout went up be with turned to father nikolas if other have quarrel with clan name said father nikolas looked round found blank face only have quarrel with clan said voice be pattern of ill grace then said sophia again propose kanaris a member of committee appeal to clan have exactly effect sophia intended divided committee up into for clan against that strong cheerful phalanx seemed to be terrorizing to waverer amid dead silence vote be given in counted tombazes announced that kanaris be elected by sixteen vote to nine business of war fund then came before sophia opened by handing over to tombazes eight hundred turkish pound that being half of prize of cruise economos who have be instructed by capsina laid before tombazes similar proportion of taking sachturi pinotzi followed lead amusement be then caused by anastasi capsas who have be unlucky in late cruise gravely presenting to tombazes sum of twenty five piaster for that have taken be small turkish rowing boat found drifting after sachturi capture of turkish ship have subsequently sold for fifty father nikolas be noticed did not join in laugh moment afterwards rose perhaps capsina chairman will explain what be meant by war fund said at present know of such fund capsina rose hear that yesterday there be debate on matter said that economos proposed that part of booty taken must be given to war fund now be true that nothing be said about before last cruise understand that money raised have be exhausted unless consider that war be over must wish to know how intend to equip ship for next cruise have hydra tired of war of ship have be lucky father nikolas believe took valuable prize be easy then for to defray expense of ship for next voyage with anastasi capsas how will be for indeed fifty piaster will not go far a wage of sixty men paused moment went on with growing earnestness let be sensible said look thing between eye a man look before strike not pretend there be obstacle in path have decided god be thanked to be free freedom can only be bought dearly at cost of life money by output of strength be not fighting to enrich only short sighted can fail to see short sighted make good counsellor can one tell how be to man ship for next cruise how get powder how make repair to ship on mainland be contributing one half of be taken to service of war must become to ask for fund from for indeed be sore pressed for money many of serve without pay reward have nikolas vidalis got for ten year work journeying scheming risking day a said right to serve country be not wise to count that more worth having than many piaster have heard what happened to second ship from kalamata put into nauplia on way to constantinople to bring back men arm two boy followed out into bay at nauplia ran caique into stern set fire to saved in small boat one be son of petrobey other be mitsos codones nephew of nikolas have never seen there be song about boy deed folk sing there be reward where must look for better be mercenary do serve country not own be freedom of country to be weighed against money must propose that after next cruise must anything of what give now be left over when men be paid ship fit for use again let that if will be divided only let there never be ship can not go to sea be ill equipped for want of money might have be ready have not taken for now if there be aught to say against let hear for vote for war fund to be made up of taking of ship capsina speech won day even few of primate went over to side leaving however more malignant minority at end of meeting money be collected capsina be fairly satisfied with morning work be two day after word be brought to hydra by vessel of chios germanos archbishop of patros have need of economos latter have friend relation in misolonghi a there be strong garrison of turk there seemed wiser to get sounding of place so said archbishop from man who must move about unsuspected therefore if work in hydra be over let come late afternoon have gone to see capsina in order to find out whether of vessel be by chance going to nauplia mainland port must put on way for work here be finished so think said only morning indeed met father nikolas who alone have be more detrimental to cause than even turk seemed most friendly to regretted be going capsina be combing out michael ruff after bath be not attending very closely at word left comb in michael hair looked up what be that said met father nikolas hour ago said economos thanked for have done here said that have hoped be stopping longer in fact think have quite withdrawn opposition now capsina have excellently sure reason for knowing that primate still harbored bitterest grudge against economos for having first proposed eventually carrying institution of war fund next question seemed at first strangely irrelevant do walk armed asked not in hydra drew comb out of michael ruff clapped hand servant came in at summons want to see kanaris said send for at once stood silent moment two until servant have left room then turned to economos really know what to say to remarked how to account for own feeling be borne in upon that be in danger nikolas friendly genial to be not in man be genial to none that must be genial to of men be impossible afterwards will tell why come what did say to asked to sup with evening said economos told that for aught knew might be gone before asked to sup with said capsina frowning god send understanding charity really broke off still frowning then after pause look said know much of father nikolas know that can have enemy more bitter took so tell valuable prize in last cruise be so think who have deprived of half of certainly be between who have done so now man have

put to sea again in last week of may cruising in archipelago eager for spring coming of ottoman ship took northeasterly course on th of june sighted single turkish man of war to north of chios put about before be in range to attack ran before to mainland anchoring in harbor of erissos beneath wall of turkish fort to attack there at close quarter meant exposure to fire from fort a well moreover harbor be nearly landlocked thoroughly unsuited to rapidity of manoeuvre by alone little hawk must dare attack raven of turkish fleet for except when sea breeze blew lay nigh windless tombazes must scarce leave to sail south plan of action be determined by appearance on morning of th of june of more ottoman ship from north man of war three frigate three sloop before noon news arrived from greek town called aivali farther up asiatic coast that garrison of turk have be suddenly increased in town here then be work sufficient single turk must not sail south fresh convoy of ship must be stopped help must be sent to aivali what increase of garrison might mean tombazes must not conjecture told off fifteen vessel to follow turkish ship while rest waited at erissos to destroy blockaded vessel at cost with speed then sail on to aivali meeting of captain be held on admiral ship be resolved to attempt destruction of turk by fire psarian in fleet be said to know use handling of fire ship one be prepared badly managed only result be that two of crew be first nearly roasted then completely drowned however on following day psarian volunteered to launch one be managed with more conspicuous success boat be loaded with brushwood brushwood sail be soaked in turpentine set off from fleet while be yet dark conveniently for purpose white mist lay over harbor air be windless have to be rowed swiftly silently up to anchorage of turk have approached to within cable length when be sighted from on board enemy captain of fire ship pappanikolo knowing that few moment more must see work done urged men on drove boat right into bow of turk contriving to entangle mast in bowsprit rope then bidding men jump into boat towed behind set fire to ship rowed rapidly off few musket only be fired at escaped unhurt not so victim in moment fire ship blazed from stem to stern pouring such vast cloud of smoke up from brushwood be not quite dry that be impossible for on board from fort to reach seat of flame many of sailor jumped overboard swam to land ship burned on till fire reached powder magazine exploded being done remainder of greek fleet weighed anchor went north again while rounding lesbos met ship have pursued rest of ottoman fleet returning too have shunned greek with south wind have escaped into dardanelles where greek have not ventured to follow most of pursuing vessel have be of primate capsina expressed scorn in forcible language aivali be wealthy commercial town in pashalik of brusa on coast of asia minor since outbreak of war several similar greek town have be plundered by irregular band of turk pasha seeing that revenue be largely derived from aivali for be home of many wealthy greek be personally very anxious to save thus troop a tombazes have be truly informed have be sent there be designed not for destruction preservation news of destruction of ship at erissos have raised excitement of turkish population at aivali desire for revenge to riot point already several greek have be murdered in street such be state of thing when tombazes fleet dropped anchor outside harbor night under cover of darkness came deputation to admiral unless helped state be foregone protector must doubt guarantee life at sacrifice of property a seemed certain if turkish population rose against for have heard that irregular band of soldier be marching on town luckier of must be murdered fairer le fortunate sold a slave appealed to tombazes to rescue take off on fleet guaranteed best effort to do be built on steep hill side running up from sea lower ground be occupied with wharf shipping house then higher up came manufacturing quarter consisting mainly of oil mill on crest of hill house of wealthier inhabitant be must be first prey to mob early next morning tombazes landed company of soldier to protect family who embarked troop of pasha who wished to prevent one leaving town replied by occupying row of shop near quay keeping up heavy musket fire on troop ship meantime news that greek fleet must take off inhabitant be over town stream of civilian have begun to pour down soldier returned fire of turk while be embarked in small boat taken out to ship odds be against for assailant be firing from shelter suddenly shout went up from fleet a sophia weighed anchor hoisting sail came close in shouldering crashing through line of fishing boat risking chance of grounding then turning broadside to town opened on house occupied by turk firing over head of soldier embarking population first broadside knocked one shop to piece in couple of minute turk most of regular troop be swarming out of house like ant when hill be disturbed flying to position le exposed to deadly close fire of sophia simultaneously greek of town fearing that occupation of house lower down by regular troop must cut off escape in turn occupied house in rear kept up fire on between sophia troop be fairly outclassed line of retreat for population be clear again engagement of regular troop with greek gave rabble of turkish population opportunity desired rushed to bazaar rifled shop spoiling destroying what did not take after leaving quarter gutted trampled made up hill to house of wealthiest merchant from greek be even now fleeing captured not only good woman child unless speedy move be made by troop be clear that bulk of population must escape fall into murderous hand of rabble unable under gun of sophia to make attempt to hold quay against greek set fire to various house in line with shore that barrier of flame might cut off lower town from upper meantime collected again at square lay to left of town with purpose of making formed attack on troop on beach greek soldier seeing a be now hopeless to try to save town from burning set fire to row of house at right angle to beach in order to cut off from line of embarkation between quay new position taken up by turkish troop in short time fire under ever freshening sea breeze took hold in earnest meantime boat load after boat load of sailor have put to land among first when gun of sophia be no longer needed being capsina kanaris with two dozen of crew went up town to help in protecting line of retreat fire being then only just begun passed oil mill reached wealthier quarter turkish population seeing be armed ran from in hour having satisfied that upper quarter of town be empty turned back again towards sea suddenly from quarter of mile in front of rose huge pillar of smoke fire with deep roaring sound a if wind of heaven have met together kanaris first saw what be quick quick said be oil mill caught there be whole row of below hurried on before have gone many yard saw at end of street down be to pas vast volume of flame break out sweeping across to opposite house in long tongue of fire from inside mill came crash next moment river of flaming oil flowed out down street to pas way be impossible turned back to make dtour to other side of town away from quarter where troop be assembled before ten minute have passed dozen more mill have taken fire when at length have passed extremity of line of fire came out on quay be to find beach empty boat no longer at shore torrent of flaming oil have poured down steep narrow street thence across quay over on to water where floated still blazing belt of fire thirty foot broad lined water along bay charred post on edge of harbor wall be hissing spluttering sending out now then little lilac colored bouquet of flame be somehow across burning canal that retreat lay capsina stood still moment then broke out into laugh will get through tighter place together kanaris said see oil have already ceased flowing can not stop here troop may be down again look there be only one way run good long breath dive if catch fire next moment water will put out up again when be past flame be not more than thirty foot meantime turkish troop hearing that one party at rate of greek be still in town thinking that retreat by beach be now cut off have stationed away to left beyond flame capsina waved hand to go way gentleman cried next moment have run dozen scorching choking yard across quay plunged into flame kanaris followed after others with shout turk seeing discharged musket at ineffectually moment later boat have put off from sophia a rose safe beyond flame be dragged on board dripping yet strangely exhilarated thrilled with adventure deck of sophia be packed with men woman child rescued from sacked burning town strange pathetic be story many did not know whether family have be saved not for in panic confusion of flight child perhaps have be carried off in boat from one ship parent in have come on board with nothing clothes be in others have dragged with bag of money valuable be in distraught amazement at suddenness of hour have left homeless sun be already sinking when capsina got back to ship glow of sunset paled before red lurid conflagration in town after dark when land breeze set in breath of be a if from open mouthed furnace air be thick with ash half consumed spark making eye throat grow raw tingling with smoke so weighing anchor sailed out to mouth of harbor mile away from burning town where heat be little assuaged air have breath of untainted coolness in by next day fire have died down smouldering of charred beam eddying white ash have taken place of blazing house impenetrable street once more town be searched for greek remained few be found in large number afternoon fleet turned south again to give homeless refuge on one other of revolted island many of able bodied at once enlisted in service of revolutionist others seemed apathetic stunned into listlessness few chiefly among older men woman must have slunk back again like cat preferring ruined wrecked home to new unfamiliar place throughout august september fleet made combined cruise ship assisted at blockade of monemvasia others made red in bloody shameful work at navarin then for time eye

to man to view slightingly one who take one own place even when be vacant only through personal promotion kanaris case however be little more complicated for capsina be to what have thought no woman must have be habit of mind be far too methodical to allow luxury of doing anything so unaccounted for a abandoning to there be certainly three thing in soul took distanced precedence of others ship be one destruction of turk capsina be third in more spiritual moment must have found hard to draw up reliable table of precedence for three certainly be in one of more spiritual moment just now for there

upon heart smile on beautiful mouth be wine to looked weighing courage with chance opened mouth to speak stopped again truly such perturbation in methodical kanaris touched portentous capsina have paused after question after moment repeated so why look farther for worse said again look farther said leaning forward across table twisting sense of question to own use look nearer rather look nearer

having done great deed mixed with none of conceit of imagination see acting greatly must chance come man woman must look in face a frank cheerful a eye of dog feel impulse of friendliness kanaris be not man who from habitual reserve must distrust friendly impulse when came so be that in hour be chatting together like child of ship fish wind wave hundred healthy thing made environment of life of of a evening wore on heard crew coming merrily back from nauplia sat talking late like friend who have met again three cabin be close together capsina after showing mitsos went to own sat there in dark too happy to think sleep heard michael nail tapping along wooden floor outside then with soft thump curled up outside door according to custom from mitsos cabin heard rattle of shoe soon after partition wall between creaked a curled up in berth against then there be silence still sat in darkness of cabin looking out from port hole towards quay of nauplia black beneath star seeing light from town cast in long unwavering reflection over calm water filled with rapturous uncontent be on deck next day while yet night be mixed with morning fresh a flower though having slept little before six gave order to hoist sail for fair wind be blowing must clear harbor without need of boat tow rope day be coming infinitely clear sweet overhead there still burned big star two got paler paler moment till seemed white unluminous like candle in sunshine by degree pale primrose strip of sky in east flushed with color before upvaulting of sun flush spread to zenith be answered by surface of bay before cleared point of palanede sunrise be on turned just a first ray struck ship saw mitsos just coming on to deck few yard away sun shining on face mitsos gladdening eye gave radiance to beauty that drew eye to in long gaze in pain rapture together looked at heart exulted in noble rendered slavery for moment spoke then with effort so have slept well little mitsos repent sudden bargain there be time yet to put ashore have slept night repent nothing capsina did not answer at once looked out to sea wetting finger held up into wind glanced at compass wind be due north said only light channel of spetzas through pas be east southeast distance must know give order little mitsos mitsos smiled scratched head eh know ship said look at then mitsos looked at line of vessel then at canvas be carrying first hoist jib halyard said can carry more sail than then oh capsina cried want to find ignorant however must say go right across to within mile of astra squaring sail ever so little then make channel in one run now god defend from having said very foolish thing think prayer be heard said capsina therefore be time to have breakfast called mitsos order come down said ship be running free fine will be hour yet before put on second tack ah here be michael know doe not that always seems to thing of good omen for indeed trust michael more than trust welcomed kanaris so never have better friend be kanaris not up yet know be only passenger now will have lie in bed well will breakfast same when have breakfasted sophia took mitsos tour of ship be brig of three hundred fifty ton very long for beam deep keeled on upper deck carried six nine inch gun two forward under forecastle two amidships two astern forward stern gun be mounted on carriage revolved nearly circle looked from very wide port so that stern gun must be trained on point due astern be used for broadside must fire forty five degree ahead bow gun in same way must fire straight ahead in direction up to forty five degree behind main deck be armed in similar manner with six gun placed not directly below upper deck gun ten yard horizontally from so that smoke from lower must not rise directly interfere with sighting of upper mitsos to capsina great delight saw commended arrangement be new to on main deck forward stern gun four inch not six inch must not fire right astern right ahead have wide broadside range below deck battery consisted of twelve gun six on side four gun in centre of side being of same weight a on upper deck in bow stern being four inch gun thus in carried twenty four gun sixteen six inch eight four inch be sight made mitsos lick lip with blood thirstiness must say be fortress said two chattered like child over new toy own kanaris who soon joined seemed to to be like elder who have outgrown enthusiasm yet even to toy seemed flawless turkish men of war cruiser alike be contemptibly inferior in point of speed men of war be armed with much heavier gun carried strength in broadside while capsina ship have two gun must shoot straight ahead astern six must fire on diagonal meantime ship be nearing astra wisdom foolishness of mitsos tactic must soon be patent while be still three mile off turned to capsina have made mistake said if go about at once will still make channel for indeed must go a arrow go capsina smiled with thrill of pleasure in ship won pound over yesterday said if kanaris will bet again will stand to win give order little mitsos kanaris looked incredulous kranidi be very fine place said take want to sail between spetzas land will bet asked capsina kanaris paused moment heard mitsos giving order in voice extraordinarily confident think will not bet said after there be sailing gear of ship to be gone through to mitsos used a be to big schooner sail square canvas seemed thought unwieldable foresail jib halyard have taken fancy at once be rein to horse said must go a will be according to will that will go said hour of golden day went by have made eight knot in first hour nine in second about ten in morning kranidi grain of sparkling salt in gray stretch of hill appeared small very distant at mitsos frowned again be wrong said might have put about mile sooner indeed how be to know be through channel of spetzas before noon presently after wind dropped altogether for couple of hour lay becalmed on windless sea swept slowly northward by current running up coast capsina chafed at delay for though must have waited two day three at nauplia a have said for mitsos loss of few hour now seemed wholly disproportionate for be very eager to get off again on fresh cruise kanaris remembered morning have spent with nikolas on gulf of corinth said to capsina be with nikolas vidalis in just position a said what seemed to very wise thing capsina ' be never in hurry say 'when be going a fast a can ' ah be man said capsina when did ever know woman who thought that why be only when be going a fast a can that be in hurry if be not going quickest be not in hurry mitsos be lying on deck with cap pushed over eye back against mast be not what uncle nikolas meant remarked capsina laughed wisest little mitsos explain to then meant meant oh surely see what meant said mitsos feeling too sleepy to express well anyhow nephew be not in hurry said sophia looking at lazy length nephew be completely comfortable said mitsos be very good to be on ship bone be sweet to sophia felt trifle irritated with have be extraordinarily pleasant to to see make so readily at home evening before just now felt little ill used at entire contentment with brig must have preferred little feeling of sort to amount of pure content moment afterwards looked up quickly there be breeze coming got up yes there come said pointing southward will have to square sail till get round again will give order capsina please then when joined again how did know breeze be coming little mitsos know perhaps smelt really now ask find ca tell be curious said capsina have heard there be men who must do put down to folk tale michael think know sometimes now look at notice nostril grow big small like dog be a god made said mitsos piously capsina laughed oh inimitable boy cried come let look round ship again yes be good to be at sea be not here come breeze indeed there did see shake a if woke up suddenly beautiful shining ship ours see how quickly gather way will be at hydra by five if hold of course will live with there till start expect will be on ship more than off might well have smelt breeze mitsos for surely smell very good there be more to come be more mistaken be still hour before sunset when cast anchor in harbor of hydra for wind have got up promised stormy night clan welcomed capsina new importation with fervor when heard who be certain of primate wondered whether must demand seat in assembly in truth capsina have other thing to think of for hydriot fleet be not going to cruise again till spring while be going to make speed to be off with kanaris on sophia mitsos on revenge for so have new ship be named in thing there be much food for many thought chapter v revenge sophia be ready for sea by early in february even clan who be accustomed to habitual fever of capsina energy found wondering whether be woman whirlwind job be too big for detail too small must be superintending storage of powder in sophia one moment next must be half way across to anchorage of revenge to see whether have planed away edge of cabin door must not shut properly have sent from wicker maker cage for fowl there seemed indeed to be only one person on island for population be just tool in hand of capsina machine for lifting weight stowing shot reduced foreman to mere wreck for unfortunate man have to stay up three consecutive night doing capsina business be roundly abused when found asleep after dinner fourth day kanaris fared little better mitsos alone seemed capable of dealing with girl must find sitting at caf after dinner smoking pipe playing draught when asked whether have done seen to that must say have worked ten hour to day capsina have not smoked ten minute smoke smoke cried capsina smoking drinking be that men be fit for mitsos with face conspicuously grave raised voice called for pipe glass of wine for capsina awed silence fell for moment on round for seemed little short of blasphemy capsina only glanced at mitsos demure face burst out laughing be off again kanaris mitsos lodged in house until last evening when be ready there be positively nothing left for to do be never there except occasionally for supper for sleep even on last evening of a soon a supper be over started up be ready said why not sail to night what be use of wasting time here mitsos who have not finished slowly laid down mouthful be raising to lip oh capsina said be known to that for part will not go till to morrow yes be mutiny be not very well put in iron for sake of saint in heaven let finish supper capsina looked at moment little mitsos said be gross feeder with sat down again filled glass own to little mitsos good digestion cried clinked glass with mitsos smiled drank to own digestion there be yet toast said be to tranquil capsina hurrah be going south round cape then north again up west coast of greece to cruise in corinthian gulf for there a knew be turkish vessel sailed from village to village along coast massacring burning destroying greek maritime population event of last summer autumn have made clear even to indolently minded enemy that if once greece got command of sea war must be over for on land cause of revolution daily gained fresh recruit if once port harbor be in hand of insurgent must no longer be possible to send in fresh men arm except by long dangerous march through disaffected mountain of north greece there a turk have found to cost be impossible to bring on pitched engagement for true to policy of petrobey villager pursued most harassing baffling policy of guerilla warfare invader must burn village already empty before approach next day a marched suddenly bare rocky hill side must blaze large bowlder must stream down ravine upset commissariat mule during livelong night dropping shot must be kept up sentry firing back at uncertain aim of momentary flash of musket must be bowled over from other direction a long a sea remained in hand of turk have little to fear regiment after regiment must be poured into country end must be sure with object several turkish vessel be cruising among clustering village on gulf burning ship depopulating men of sea be ill day for when news of doings came to hydra have be arranged that fifteen brig must follow capsina in spring part must close mouth of gulf while others joined tombazes have in vain urged to wait for turkish fleet must be sent out from constantinople till spring greek must have start of leaving hydra sane man must think of cruising in winter remonstrance be useless for capsina only said then suppose kanaris mitsos be mad be sore affliction father besides must not have stop turkish ship know be in gulf for more than week after started be butt of violent contrary wind capsina be impatient of delay no longer indeed on surface be tranquil capsina to whom mitsos have drunk at rate have cause to know of unrest that stormed below tranquillity have set out from hydra about eleven of morning almost immediately after leaving harbor have taken somewhat different course to sophia made wider tack to port while revenge sailed closer to wind after have turned southern end of island there be open sea with main land lying like cloud to west sophia mitsos left bridge just a went down looked round kanaris be far away to offing hydra be sinking down to north there be only sea mitsos with uncontrollable impulse held out hand to at last cried before pause be perceptible at last be off loved fierce wind heavy sea kept back be fierce intimate joy to to wake at night know mitsos be there to wake in morning for day of comradeship be in already main fibre of life huge gray sea from south hissed surged by with dazzling hungry head of lashed foam now again falling solid on bow with shower of spray streaming off through scupper back into sea wind shrilled screamed through rigging buffeted ship staggered stood straight again then plunged head foremost with liquid cluck crunch into next water valley bowsprit dipped in sea then raised scornfully with whiff of spray twenty foot above crest of wave wave beat squall whistled aloft flash of raking sunlight fled frightened across deck be for two of stood side by side wrapped in tarpaulin watched beautiful labor of ship sat in swaying rolling cabin be like game to pluck at food a bowed coquetted away from hand like game too scramble rush across deck laid precipitously towards sea rushing by house roof climb up a rose staggering to next billow watching michael a toiled slipped after sometimes sliding gravely down on haunch sometimes doing tread mill work up wet incline for one of at least game be one at stake be serious must amuse with most childish sport watching to see who must stand longest on one foot when ship be pushing shouldering way along through cross sea one finding pleasure in such thing because be just boy with double portion of animal spirit other because anything be shared with be passionately well worth doing often often mitsos wondered that be same girl who have driven hydriots to death doing more than of indefatigable that be mitsos who have brought hot death to turkish ship in harbor at nauplia for three day southwest wind blew gale sky be one driven rack of scudding rain cloud sometimes squall must sweep across sea torrent hissing audibly into water more loudly than scream of wind a approached windward sea must become seething caldron broken wave top be scarce distinguishable from churning of rain be furious foam then squall must charge slanting across deck pas perhaps for hour wind must seem to moderate again humming of rigging must change to moan moan to shriek so night must sail scarce making way tacking wide out to sea return again having won dozen mile in dozen hour time sophia kept wider more seaward course now then getting close to at end of starboard tack then standing out again on fourth morning woke to sky washed clean by rain of incredibly soft blue gray angry wave became merry company of live being sparred in jovial play with ship wind be still fresh have veered round to north mid day saw two ship close together rattling along close hauled in channel between cerigo cape malea to south island lay green gray fringed with white to north promontory after promontory grayer bluer than last melted into bay of gythium be morning on in whose vein joy of life be flowing be conscious from toe to finger tip from finger tip to end of hair of indubitable goodness of life smallest thing be jest to largest jest also michael in particular caused many mouthful of laughter for dinner be thrown out of bowl by sudden lurch of ship ran after various bone a rolled away growling ill pleased till too be laid on back picked up with air of not being hungry having fallen down on purpose perception of willowness of seeming combined with half swallowed piece of orange reduced mitsos to choking condition capsina thumped on back thank yes be altogether recovered say oh capsina have very strong arm little mitsos be for good said capsina thought sententiously setting white teeth in peel of orange suppose so thing be good for one have noticed make one little sore what do know about thing be good for asked that only that make one sore for indeed think that thing be good for one be good for one understand added hopefully perfectly said capsina laughed again causelessly evening brought calmer weather to somewhat calmer spirit night after supper talked quite soberly oh be strange world said capsina to think that week ago have never set eye on now well there be one in world know better have taken a found have asked question of father mother here be oh be strange world said again now there be perhaps subject in world to mitsos have dedicated le thought than strangeness of world so waited in silence be not so went on sophia what must have be le likely than chance put boat in to nauplia night on one tack for indeed if have taken two tack so have lost pound to kanaris must not have stopped there then must at hour have be catching little fish in bay said mitsos be only worth doing when there be nothing forward yet like bay added thinking of suleima for have have many good hour there see there be taygetus snow must say be bride added with altogether unusual employment of metaphor got up leaned over bulwark looking out to north where top of taygetus appeared above bank of low lying cloud bright in evening sunshine sea have gone down considerably in last hour moved with steady swing over wave no longer torn broken in lessening wind have be able to put on sail ship with tower of fresh snowy canvas seemed like great white seabird now skimming now dipping in wave from where sat sophia must see sky reddening to sunset under arched foot of main sail when bow rose to wave taygetus must appear a in frame between ship sail mitsos be leaning on side in front of main mast bareheaded blown by wind face turned seaward so that saw only strong clear line of brow cheek sight of listless contented unconscious of filled girl with sudden spasm of anger envy last week have so welded into essential of life seemed more to than sound of wind have buffeted hiss of spent wave have struck yesterday have be mad so thought to have so let go abandoning like to childish pleasure of hour seemed one moment incredible that have not guessed that child play be something far different to at next impossible that must have seemed to boy to be anything else have played laughed chattered together to play have be play laughter chattering mirth only yet counted cost regretted nothing waited with eager patience for fierce deed in hand must be joined therein surely draw closer to other affection delighted comradeship of boy be hers hers too so promised must be keener inevitable need for when did man work together that evening passed round cape malea keeping close in to land mitsos a turned northward watched with pleasure of recognition near passing of coast where yanni have made journey with message for mill sophia listened eagerly to story making mitsos tell over again of fight in mill sat silent awhile after have finished that explains said at length for last day have be just child suspect that when there be work forward be made man there will soon be work forward for little mitsos added to herself two day after be nearing patras entrance to corinthian gulf being no longer in open empty sea be necessary to use circumspection in advance lay to eight mile outside patras kanaris came on board to consult fortress of patras be in hand of turk must give very wide berth so kanaris suggested pas lepanto turkish fortress in narrow of gulf at night be there greater risk awaited lepanto be heavily armed place gulf be le than three mile broad shoal water lay broad on side away from fortress channel close below wall further be ludicrously improbable that sophia revenge must be allowed passing unchallenged for indeed resemblance of to peaceful trading brig be of smallest sophia with support of mitsos demurred be better to seek weed in growing cornfield than to go into gulf without guidance a to position turkish cruiser be in beyond doubt germanos other of revolutionist at patras must give information for indeed said capsina with asperity have not come pleasure sail in little rowboat with concertina to sing to do mean to put in to patras asked kanaris say to turk who hold fort where be germanos for wish to know where turkish cruiser be ' will not guess business when see ship will not do said capsina will put out great notice in greek turkish that may read saying be capsina carry four twenty gun oh speak said turning to mitsos sit a round eyed a owl at noonday mitsos grinned never mind compliment said give time capsina for be way to think slow if know that be at patras continued kanaris word will go to lepanto will see nought of gulf bottom of so will little mitsos be among little fish again said capsina devil take little fish said mitsos why will not let be to think slow tell very wise thing in end will go think by went forward how can be so imprudent capsina said kanaris yes be at order completely need not remind of where go go have ever told to say mind be quite right said capsina will wait to hear what slow thinker say in ten minute so mitsos returned still owl like so said capsina with blush of intelligence on face be thinking will have to be peasant lad again with mule basket of orange for take that kanaris be in right capsina orange will help very much remarked capsina owl still sat in mitsos eye for thus continued even a in day of mill fight will go into patras find germanos speak with how be to get to patras asked kanaris have in mind that there be place called limnaki three mile side patras foulest spot god ever made being one pestilent marsh now thought be that brig must sail close in there while other waited about on alert that will be afternoon before be dark can be with germanos then will tell where turk be in gulf before morning will be at limnaki again so far be with capsina then let do a kanaris say pas gun of lepanto at night hoot hoot so owl speaks said sophia think owl be right know germanos do not little mitsos surely be at tripoli be so arranged kanaris returned to ship while revenge put about in hour time have got close in to shore opposite limnaki be starved little village feverish unhealthy chance of turk being there be too small to reckon with mitsos got into peasant dress a time be short omitted orange mule after being landed quietly set off hour before sunset over hill towards patras barefooted with colored handkerchief for cap passed without remark through gate of town mingled with loiterer in market place citadel of patras be still in hand of turk turkish garrison there greek revolutionist who held monastery hill lived in state of semi siege while meantime rest of greek turk in town continued to pursue usual trade finishing up six day out of seven with little mutual massacring in street mitsos object be to get to greek camp without involving in street row monastery be quarter of hour walk from square reached outpost of greek line in safety demanded to be taken at once to germanos gave name stated that be on business of capsina germanos received immediately with kindness courtesy though little mitsos remembering affair at tripoli be a stiff a soul of ramrod to germanos credit be said manner suffered abatement of geniality when have heard mitsos out spoke there be nine turkish vessel in gulf said three be coming along north coast left lepanto only two day ago attacked village called sergule yesterday must think must move on again to day to morrow three more be at corinth two day ago have just heard be going northward other three be somewhere along south coast know where how be going to get in little mitsos be going to sail in said mitsos curtly germanos looked at moment in silence then be not very courteously said little mitsos answered yes know think have passed pass forgiveness yet nikolas forgave did not do not know be sorry ashamed did not say so publicly be not very easy to do wish to interfere if desire to know more can tell be welcome to knowledge if will counsel if not can only regret that can be of more service to wish god speed that with heart mitsos stood moment with eye downcast then with wonderful sweet frankness of manner spoke be right father said be better than sulky child ask forgiveness have very freely nephew of nikolas for indeed nikolas forgave even said proud man mitsos face dimpled with smile genial sorry so that be good said well father here be still outside gulf want if can to pas in to night so that in lepanto will not see germanos thought moment can help said be pleasure to soul to do so see difficulty can depend on getting past lepanto with land breeze in evening blow off hill out of lepanto little up gulf now land breeze drop by hour after sunset so by then therefore must be past lepanto be to say must pas patras in broad day will be seen from citadel man on horse will reach strait before be there word will go across to fortress be now after sunset be hopeless to attempt to night to morrow can help promise give that to morrow afternoon make sortie hold two city gate on east so that man pass out thus word can not be sent to lepanto for believe if be seen a must be seen passing here strait will be guarded will never get in little mitsos what scheme be capsina for how will pas out again for when once know be there strait will be guarded have ship at lepanto in month fleet leaf hydra said mitsos till then have plenty of work in gulf be wise thought kind one of yours father germanos got up walked about be much moved if be spirit of people said will be no long time before not turk be left in greece people be not all a capsina father said mitsos be splendid splendid cried germanos whenever did man hear of so noble risk to shut up in trap for six week fighting like wild beast at bay indeed there be cause five village already have be exterminated be more on land can not touch ship none know where will come next be out of possibility to garrison village of gulf god be praised for giving such girl indeed there be none like said mitsos be borne in upon that be waiting off limnaki doe not like waiting will have seen safely out of town said germanos for indeed can not spare little one how be wife baby one be a dear a other said mitsos be very dear mitsos be escorted out of town set on way by dozen men to defend from street brawl before midnight be down again on shore at limnaki where found boat waiting to take off capsina have come ashore be pacing up down like hungry animal mitsos told how have sped entirely approved primate scheme ship be got under way went north again with fitful varying breeze to join kanaris next morning lay eight mile out to sea waiting until time came for to move up gulf west wind be blowing now one now other beat little out to sea in order to keep distance from land on capsina ship atmosphere of nerve be about for men knew what be to attempt waiting be cold matter for heart mitsos alone possessed in content serenity smoked vast deal of tobacco michael have caught prevailing epidemic followed capsina about on swift aimless excursion fore aft with trouble in eye at capsina came sat down by mitsos who have chosen snug berth under lee of forecastle where be sheltered from wind warmed by winter sun have ever bathed on cold day asked on many said mitsos why be there not moment before one jump in asked girl set off again to look to ammunition for thirtieth time that morning mitsos smoked on soon returned having forgotten that for have gone be arranging be trouble to said have not gone to see germanos take precaution must have be a calm a calm a for indeed know nothing calmer devil take that silly scheme of yours mitsos to know that be taking measure for safety have to wait till measure be taken oh beat cried there be other thing mitsos eye roamed over sky for inspiration noticed sun be time for dinner said in fact be already late stomach howl to singing west wind have be blowing day promised to usurp air of land breeze not to run risk about four o'clock capsina signalled to kanaris hoisted sail went eastward wind be still holding made good sailing hour before sunset be off patras be not more than mile out to sea be possible in clear air to make out that something unusual be going on fort seemed deserted must see line of men moving slow busy like ant lining western wall now then spit of smoke must come from citadel followed after interval by drowsy sound of report once twice long line of white vapor curled along city wall rattle of musket fire confirmed be clear that germanos be a good a word sun have already set hour when neared lepanto reflected brightness still lingered on water a approached have light of town to guide capsina put on sail strength of wind have risen almost to violence mitsos standing with capsina on poop more than once feared for mast to hear crack of mainsail once suggested taking reef in capsina paid attention afternoon girl have be strange silent a if struggling with secret anxiety mitsos seeing gave account of refrained from asking kanaris order be simply to follow when have passed fort still capsina spoke moved from place mitsos again addressed with timidity for face be iron flint be safe past said where do interrupted vehemently get below said night sail ship mitsos wondered obeyed sat up awhile in cabin ship still holding course a must tell from rapid swishing of water about nine went to bed later sound of anchor chain woke for moment waited awake though laden with sleep for minute two in case be wanted then there came unmistakable splash of boat lowered into water sound of oar at that got up threw on coat went on deck be starlight very cold several sailor be standing about asked one of who took duty of first mate where be dimitri pointed to faint glow along shore be be elatina said what be elatina village turk have burned capsina be being rowed there said a got into boat saw be cry cry capsina yes be village mother come from said dimitri who be hydriot mitsos hesitated moment reasoning that a capsina have said nothing of to be thing outside own affair went back to bed again woke again in aqueous uncertain light of dawn in dimness made way on deck water be mirror sky hard clear a precious stone capsina be not returned to ship have be gone ashore night none on board knew anything of boat have disembarked in have be back once during night to take more men supposed be trying to save whom turk have left for dead kanaris ship be lying close after taking coffee mitsos rowed across to consult with advised going ashore though mitsos hesitated at first for if capsina have wanted must have sent for went together long line of house along harbor be still smouldering though for most part have be skeleton of dwelling place built only of wood heap of charred blackened beam sometimes breath of moving air came down from mountain behind fanned burned heap into sullen glare of glowing charcoal blowing off layer of white ash showed that fire still lived beneath row of mimosa tree fronted house leaf singed wilted with heat a two landed on quay dawn breeze awoke blew straight down to across burned town hot stifling gave to mitsos sudden pang of intimate horror with smell of burning wood be mingled smell a of roasting meat here there from heap of charred ruin protruded blackened leg arm figure of man woman lay free from fallen timber with hair consumed to root hole burned in clothes cry horror offence to purity sweetness of morning once on way up street of death mitsos turned to kanaris with ashen lip think can not go on whispered after moment two mastered followed other ghastly hideousness of sight now that blood danced with fever of war be heart shadowed by anxiety fiercer than indiscriminate death touched nerve shamble at tripoli have left unthrilled here there from water of harbor mast of sunken vessel pricked surface slope of beach be strewn with wreckage not of ship alone by degree mitsos cold horror grew hot with fiery lust for vengeance steeling to look feed on sight before long looked needed steeling color returned to lip inflamed face eye be lit from within with thought of what must swiftly follow for beyond doubt be work of three ship have sailed from lepanto only few day before indeed must have be gone not yet full day curious pitiful be to see dog still guarding pile of burned beam instinct told be home have returned no doubt when fierceness of fire be over now lay in front of consumed house growling at kanaris mitsos a passed if came close springing up with bared teeth ready to attack at one house great gaunt dog rose a approached stood with hackle up snarling poor brute stood on three leg for fourth be broken hung down limply seeing that sudden poignancy of compassion at faithfulness in suffering stung mitsos to quick drawing pistol put beast out of pain a yet there have be seen sign of capsina party noise of shot reached next moment two of sailor came at run round corner small distance up street waited on seeing who new comer be kanaris mitsos came up with where be asked mitsos at house of mother clearing what be fallen to see if there be left alive mitsos kanaris followed passing through two short street of ghastly wreckage found at house be larger than most built of stone so that while wall still stood inside be one piled mass of burned beam fitting of floor staircase a came near four sailor emerged out of door with charred burden of what have be man covered with cloth where face have be laid with others like little distance off capsina have kept with half dozen of men with whom be clearing beam dbris having sent remainder off to other house be hacking furiously at beam too heavy to drag away except in piece when mitsos entered dress hand face be blackened with work one hand be bleeding round wrist be wrapped bandage of linen seeing mitsos stopped for moment wiped sweat from forehead tear sign that have be weeping be in eye only savage relentless fury so have come looked up ah be day already quenched oil lamp be burning by be going to send for more men when day broke for be good coming at night only stayed because must not go away send for more men from ship little mitsos kanaris from yours for must make speed leaving only few there few on shore who will send word if turk be seen let on board be in readiness to sail at moment ah went on with sudden lifting of hand indescribably piteous must have come straight through lepanto chanced everything then perhaps might have saved place clasped hand together then threw apart be house from father took bride ah ah took up axe fell to hewing at beam again like thing possessed be time to waste word a soon a fresh contingent came with ax others with ship cutlass capstan bar anything must help clear wreckage mitsos kanaris went off began searching house for who might still be alive found that massacre have taken place be done with thoroughness before burning began devil work have be carried out coolly systematically at end of street leading up out of village towards mountain there have evidently be sort of combined stand made by villager for there corps lay thick higher up on path lay others who have run for life only to be shot down by infernal marksman a climbed steep hill side hour search be rewarded by mitsos finding one man who still breathed who died not hour after farther on in front room of house discovered woman lying dead while on breast lay baby alive seemingly unhurt who pulled at mother dress cry for food then turned searched house opposite on other side of street found nothing that lived so came back to church stood with door open being built of stone throughout turk have not attempted to fire to make search thorough though not expecting to find one there entered then stopped with quick drawn gasp pillage have be done there place be orderly quiet row of little silver lamp untouched lighted hung across church above low altar screen big brass candlestick stood on left filled with great festa taper still burning only from great wooden crucifix stood above altar carved christ have be removed in place fastened hand foot by nail bound there by rope be figure of young man naked mitsos paused only for moment crossed without speech beckoned to others door of altar screen be locked putting weight to burst open then with three others mounted onto altar lifting cross from place laid on floor figure on lay quite still there be other mark of violence on than rent in hand foot made by nail even a mitsos wrapped piece torn from shirt round one of to get firmer hold lad stirred head opened eye fetch kanaris said mitsos to one of men have skill in thing one by one nail be loosened limb freed carried lad down church out into fresh air where propped up against door blood have clotted thickly round wound though withdrawal of nail have caused to break out afresh mitsos managed to stay flow by bandaging arm leg tightly where joined body a nikolas have taught to do lad have fainted again one of sailor rough hydriot fellow down whose cheek tear be running though knew not have spirit with poured draught down young man throat in little while moved one arm feebly have found clothes laid by altar mitsos tenderly like woman wrapped round a well a must without jarring then lifting gently off stone where have set down laid across knee supporting head on shoulder before long kanaris came washed bound up wound a life began to run more freely hope of saving increased arranged litter with leaf branch strewn on unhinged door have carried down to ship when be gone mitsos went back into church putting carved image back onto cross set again in place above altar then for that have committed sacrilege in standing there knelt down before left church oh most pitiful said if have sinned thou wilt forgive when got outside again rest of men have gone back to work paused on church step moment blind with pity hate lust for vengeance with heart swelling with horror unspeakable wound of living image of crucified must not cry to deaf ear very sacrilege have be done seemed to consecrate passion for revenge to lift human hate pity into motive of crusade for wrong done to christ blasphemously in hideous mockery incarnate devil have turned inhuman cruelty into two edged thing cutting at god man alike with capsina feeding hate in ruin of mother home mitsos feeding hate at house of god be likely that ship have not be named amiss work be over hour two before sunset capsina have found in mother house nothing dead elsewhere two woman who be still alive died before noon kanaris have found none so that from what have be flourishing village two day ago there be left only young man with whom have preferred to commit outrageous blasphemy leaving body to lingering death rather than to kill baby untouched by unwitting oversight only few body of turk have be found thing have be massacre not fight a capsina mitsos be going down to ship again in silence saw turn aside to where dead turk be lying under tree stamped on face of dead thing without word followed by mitsos stepped into boat be waiting for sooner have got on board than capsina gave order to start before have gone dozen mile breeze failed for night be close upon lay to waiting for day fearing that if breeze sprang up in night might by taking advantage of overshoot for whom be looking lad turk have crucified be on kanaris ship where must receive better doctoring than mitsos capsina have skill to give baby be on revenge have not tasted food since morning capsina not since night before ate ravenously in silence once only during meal did capsina speak when have hung who did thing said may be able to weep for own dead when have eaten be still sitting speechless opposite other little wailing cry came from cabin next capsina rose left room presently after brought baby in rocking in arm before long child ceased cry slept mitsos looking up saw girl weeping silently with great sob seemed to tear at that got up went on deck thinking that must be better to leave alone with baby awoke before dawn next morning to haunting sense of horror excitement to by degree awakening memory gave form only throwing on coat went up thick white mist hung over bay higher than where stood on deck seemed to be not very thick strangely luminous so climbed up rigging of mainmast a far a cross tree looked out sky be cloudless house of star in west moon be pale large be not more than mile from rocky headland peered out darkly into white mist farther down perhaps mile away pointed black finger into water between two line of coast be lost mitsos rightly supposed that be opposite bay then suddenly with catch of heart eye fell on couple of mast rose pricking mist scarcely mile distant looking more closely saw mast of two other ship one to right other to left little farther off with fierce excitement climbed down went to capsina cabin in moment so quickly that must not have be asleep undressed came out to with finger on lip hush whispered baby be asleep what be mitsos three ship be lying not far from said make doubt be turk can see mast from cross tree on deck there be white mist where be between land be mile off on entrance of bay be there wind not breath when day wake wind will wake with mist will lift sun will be up must think in hour there be smell of morning already in air capsina paused moment thinking intently went out on deck praise be to god of vengeance said oh mitsos pray that revenge may be complete see be what will do a soon a wind come sail round into bay kanaris attack on side send across to kanaris at once saint in heaven how be to find in mist go aloft again lad see if can spy mast can not be far for when lay to last night be close by look out to see if there be sign of wind coming mitsos returned speedily be not quarter of mile from to seaward said be already lighter see where be farther cape be just side galaxidi oh capsina there be great black cloud coming up from west wind may be here before sun in few minute revenge be alive though silent soft footed making ready a cat make ready for spring boat have put off for kanaris ship with mitsos in who be to explain what tactic be to be that must be certain of be to take revenge in between land turk for must get breeze first while kanaris waited outside to stop if must not engage tried to escape across gulf if stood ground be to close in on mitsos be back again in le than twenty minute already jib halyard upper lower yard have be set in case wind came down on a so often happened in narrow sea in squall men be at post cutlass musket be laid out in depot on deck if came to hand to hand fight capsina be on bridge dimitri who be kind of first mate being directly under mitsos capsina be standing with even a mitsos joined there came through still thick mist shiver of sigh jib flapped once again then from down gulf without further warning squall be upon in moment mist be rent torn to thousand eddying fragment revenge heeled slowly over to wind began to make way for short minute sea land be a clear a in picture saw turkish ship lying mile off to northeast at mouth of bay next moment rain fell like sheet that glimpse have be enough there be room to spare to pas between nearer headland ship capsina pointed without speaking dimitri roared order to men at tiller revenge trembled struggled like thing alive once tiller broke from two men who held sheered off straight into wind again next moment have fastened down tacked off northeast for minute rain ceased a suddenly a have begun ship threshed on through ruffled water gathering speed men be ready at gun order have be not to fire till be broadside already must see stir bustle on nearest turk sailor be putting up jib a if to run out to sea then seemed sighted revenge bearing down on hesitated moment presently after mitsos saw two three port being opened be too late by time revenge be broadside three battery poured deluge of shot into slipped past like swan fired again a crossed bow leaving three turk a capsina have intended between kanaris once in bay face of squall reached not so violently for be under shelter of promontory close to have passed capsina ran on half mile before putting about of turkish ship must see that middle one lying too close to one on leeward of have in trying to put out to sea fouled other kanaris observing hauled up halyard beat up little way against wind then turning fired broadside into meantime ship first attacked whose foremast have be shot in two by capsina broadside have cut away wreck be making for open sea seeing revenge be put about making wide tack to eastward passed near two have fouled other got in two round with only reply of one kanaris whose business be to stop of getting away instantly put about to head escaping ship other slipped by two beat out to sea together capsina saw will overhaul in two mile said to mitsos now to work again face be grimmer than death hell other two ship be now free saw at once that one have received fire of revenge kanaris be already doomed from minute to minute a overhauled be visibly settling down with cant to leeward there be doubt that have be struck by one other below water line indeed a neared must see pump vomiting water down side still carried sail for seemed to hope to get near land before foundered sail dragged farther over until from deck of revenge now three hundred yard distant must see line of bulwark with strip of deck in between then saw begin to lower boat at that capsina gave word to fire mitsos thinking on deed of day before felt heart laugh within at range heavy gun of brig be sentence of destruction whole broadside went home sweeping deck tearing fresh hole in side already list be so great that must no longer reply a neared capsina again gave command to fire then be seen disgraceful thing for second ship still untouched put about leaving companion wreck at mercy of revenge indeed there be little to be saved capsina seeing tactic of other not wishing to waste shot now work be done put down helm passing by bow of disabled ship went in pursuit other carried two stern gun opened fire ball hummed by harmlessly one missing altogether other just carrying off few splinter from starboard bulwark in answer revenge sheered off moment into wind be still shifting to north replied with three starboard gun of upper deck one shot went wide of two others bow gun made raking gash in stern of chase that amidships fired little after took rudder smashing rudder post below juncture with tiller leaving simply in hand of wind in moment swung round from course pointed straight across bow of revenge on instant capsina saw chance for in second two must cross close let go helm shrieked get ready to fire starboard gun tiller banged against side revenge swung round into wind while moment two ship got closer to other at distance of not more than hundred yard be broadside to broadside then fire cried for moment saw heard anything through wreath of own smoke then a wind dispersed saw great ship wreck on water heeled over till yard arm dipped sail trailed in water deck must see be covered with men holding on a if to prolong bitterness of death to whatever must catch climbed up mast others clung to bulwark jumped overboard capsina scanned with hungry eye a if unwilling to leave feast gave order to shorten sail in slackening speed ran to stern of revenge to look last on drowning men then turned to mitsos may leave think said be more than mile from land kanaris charge be out of sight revenge put about to ship have left before be sinking fast saw that crew have manned half dozen boat be rowing to land capsina called dimitri sink said hindermost boat be not more than two hundred yard ahead capsina delayed fire then a got within fifty yard of walked slowly calmly to side of ship spoke in turkish be more merciful than who crucify cried then fire other boat seeing what have happened resolving if possible to sell life more dearly got ready musket capsina saw while be out of musket range bow gun for rest said be good target practice five out of six boat have be sunk be already preparing to fire on sixth when sudden pity came over mitsos look said there be woman in boat capsina shaded eye for moment against glare of water turkish woman only said woman cried mitsos with who know what memory of one who have lived in turkish house there be woman in elatina said capsina fire then turning to mitsos be woman too said suddenly voice failed a looked at mitsos little mitsos looked at biting lip to check trembling of mouth even so said turned away first squall have blown over hour of checkered sunshine succeeded in west again cloud be coming up in wind tormented ribbon have only just cleared bay when second hurricane be on for three quarter of hour wind have be slowly shifting into north wreckage of ship have sunk at mouth of bay have drifted little out to sea cut between drift wood mast here there man still afloat where kanaris third ship be have certain idea be impossible for clumsy turkish ship to tack against violent wind without having mast crack above head one a knew be without foremast must have sailed nearly down wind second squall be even more violent than first revenge scudded out to sea with only jib halyard flying a got farther from funnel of land down wind came force of decreased little hoisted upper yard on mainmast for hour more raced across choppy following sea obscured by driving squall of rain before sighted time capsina have hardly spoken mitsos standing by be a silent a came in sight of two ship running before wind stamped on bridge hoist foresail cried mitsos looked up ship knew be carrying a much sail a must will lose mast said capsina turned on furiously let lose then cried will go none faster said more sail will only stop ship be what say remarked say pull ship over make bow dip what do advise little mitsos by mean hoist foresail even if ship can carry will go slower said be order yes then suddenly turned to judge said for indeed be not when be over if god will will be again oh lad cried have water milk in vein do forget what saw yesterday mitsos looked at moment caught something of burning hate in eye forget said woman oh think of too be woman said sophia then after pause ah look be not ship worthy of name see how gain on oh mitsos go below if will take part in must do what must do surely god be with do forget what saw in church do forget house of mother again rain came on cold scourge of water in lashing fury of downpour ship be again lost for while then there followed raking gleam of sunshine struck gray of sea turning to one superb blue already must see figure of men on ship kanaris be on port side trying evidently to head turk if came on to give broadside if declined to drive back sea be rising minute three ship rolled scupper under be evidently out of question for in sea at distance be apart to fire at turk have made good start against kanaris though sophia be overhauling be clear that be tub a be running before wind be more question of ship must carry most sail than of seacraft for mile more ran on two pursuing ship gradually gaining on enemy not very rapidly be evident that be making for port on southern side of gulf perhaps where expected second trio of turkish ship be capsina wished to prevent turk saw that be gaining on knowing that opposite coast must be at least nine mile off hoisted mainsail capsina started in amazement a saw great canvas go up mast bent like whip for moment stood strain scudded off be desperate said to mitsos can not stand in ten minute will be ours capsina be right only temporary lull must have let get sail up before many minute squall came down on again mainmast bent then with crash must hear from ship broke great heap of canvas encumbered deck two point to starboard said capsina get ready to fire port gun more rapidly than ever distance diminished revenge creeping up on starboard side sophia holding course to port until at length doomed ship be nearly between on moment capsina gave word to fire broadside crashed into turk moment after kanaris fired turk replied with broadside to capsina did not wait to reply again sailed past then put helm hard to port risking mast sail so that ship swung round with broadside to turk bow five hundred yard off kanaris who kept distance fired again section by section slowly with deliberate aim capsina volleyed at bow steady shooting be impossible on sea of shot saw went home one hitting bowsprit several others crashing through bulwark raking ship lengthways fire answered broadside replied twice thrice to kanaris doing damage turk be now practically log on water capsina knowing there be time to spare made wide tack off into northeast returning on opposite tack again closed up with turk from behind putting broadside into stern at there be only silence from turk capsina closed in again on starboard quarter signalling kanaris to do same on port side a approached saw that deck be strewn with dead company of men be marwilled forward with musket who separated into two company manned bulwark on side waiting for ship to come to closer range capsina laughed scornfully must not waste life of man on ship over dog said train bow gun on sink ship kill men only wind be abating sea falling in quarter of hour of eighty hundred men who have be left must only see sixteen twenty continued firing musket coolly without hurry at approaching ship couple of men on revenge be wounded one killed must not have thought turk be so brave said capsina be ready with grappling iron port helm be quick when get in fifty men with musket man port side keep up fire keep under shelter of bulwark of revenge slid up to turk starboard quarter a got within hundred yard capsina gave order to furl sail a distance lessened iron be thrown rope be pulled home two ship brought up side by side dozen turk so be still gathered in bow a crew of revenge swarmed deck laid down musket stood with arm folded one of in officer uniform be sitting in chair smoking got up with air of indolent fatigue still holding mouth piece of pipe surrender said in greek where be captain men made way for capsina walked up deck between line be captain said man raised eyebrow indeed laughed softly to be too handsome for trade said be better looking than of harem there be several greek among well surrender for word said capsina hang otherwise perhaps must have done honor to shoot man blanched little teeth showed in sort of snarl understand said surrender understand replied hang for mother be of elatina came step nearer if be not that hold cross sacred thing said must crucify very tenderly that might live long oh man burst out with great gust of fury be what did in elatina have made demon of curse for there take two of hang from mizzen yard speak to cried to captain will smite on mouth be woman be dealing with not thing from harem in moment two men have bound leg pinioned arm with help of two more carried like sack up rigging set on yard then made fast one end of rope to mast noosed other round neck while capsina stood on deck unflinching image of vengeance at sign from pushed off into empty air mitsos gave one short gasp for though must have killed man laughing singing a drove knife home in fight blood revolted at coldness of turned to capsina say be woman cried be that woman deed pointed to dangling burden insulted said capsina repay insult a for rest shoot turned on heel with back to mitsos must not see that lip be trembling be not at hanging shooting that trembled have sworn must avenge death of in elatina for to be not prisoner of war murderer of woman that did without flinching be word recalled to herself thinking inwardly of child play on ship with wondered if be possible that stone seemed to be heart must ever be moved again to tear laughter that mitsos must smile again jest with so cold cruel girl at thought turned to piteously oh mitsos be not indeed be not cried passionately take a be now out of remembrance for pity sake think of only a be before will be same again will be same ah understand chapter vi prize be divided equally between two ship a have be agreed that taken on cruise by whichever ship captured must be shared in common after one half have be appropriated to fund for war out of wage of crew be paid evidently spoil from elatina have be carried on ship for found many embroidered greek dress several vestment presumably from desecrated church considerable sum of money packed in hamper revenge have hardly suffered at in encounter hole have be stove high in bow of sophia five yard of bulwark have be knocked into match wood round house be sieve have also lost eight men killed from ship thirty wounded under circumstance be best to put in at galaxidi for repair a crew must not now be sufficient for handling of ship in case of further engagement for raising of few recruit kanaris have graze on wrist from musket shot a be getting to close quarter hour have be sweet to cold gray eye be a of wild beast hungry for more capsina examined gear sailing of prize with scornful wonder good hole for rat to die in be comment there be dozen serviceable gun quantity of ammunition latter of divided between two brig must have liked to remove gun also for apart from use felt must be pleasant bitter thing to make turn traitor to former owner there be tackling apparatus fit for such weight have to be left a have notion of letting again fall into hand of turk set fire to ship before leaving saw drift away southeastward sign of fire with crew of death captain still dangling from foremast swinging out from right to left beyond bulwark a ship rolled there be gun loose in deck battery must hear crashing charging from side to side a unruddered vessel dipped staggered to wave with flame ever mounting higher then squall of impenetrable rain swept across sea saw no more capsina have intended to escort kanaris a far a galaxidi on chance of other turkish ship being about when came near saw that coast be clear turned off into bay where have fought that morning to see if there be anything left of of other two ship worth picking up found that have sunk one in deep water other in not more than fifteen fathom through singular clear water must see lying on side black dead while quick fish played poised above round sight have curious fascination for girl after putting about lay to for hour under shelter of land while rowed out again to spot leaned over side of boat feeding ravenously on sight angry if flaw of wind disturbed clearness of to mitsos though heart must be savage poor ship seemed pitiful thing wondered at fierceness of girl reached galaxidi before evening land breeze fell capsina who have cousin there went ashore with baby intending to leave there for indeed on brig have little time fit temper for child must have be still lying at mother breast heard from friend of young mother who must perhaps take charge of for own child baby of three day old have suddenly died capsina took there nursing with singular tenderness jealous of hand touched see said to mother have brought to care for be told that own baby have died seems like gift of god to doe not yet be gift added suddenly child be to be mine will pay well young woman more indeed than girl came forward from where have be sitting looked at baby for moment with dull lustreless eye then suddenly mother love widowed of young leaped into face ah give to cried quickly give moment afterwards baby be at breast capsina stared for little space in wonder amazement then face softened sat down by girl what be name asked catherine vlastos voice caught in throat constantine vlastos husband be dead little one be dead again capsina waited without word tell said at length what be feel how be that want child be nothing to nothing girl laughed from pure happiness be nothing le than life will take for take for then a baby stirred laid fat little objectless hand on breast be capsina said great lady tell have taken three turkish ship oh be fine thing must not change place with sophia rose from seat walked up down room loved husband said at length be that why loved baby why love baby know how must know sophia stopped in walk love baby too said know not how why perhaps only because be so little helpless for indeed like child want to leave here yet must suppose will promise to keep very safe for call sophia be name indeed have wise little face must go perhaps will call here again in few week let kiss so leave money with will arrange for to be supplied with more turned to door before be well out of house came back again looked at baby once more yes be very curious said must care for at all well good bye mitsos meantime have gone across to kanaris ship where be busy with repair squall have blown out sky sea be sheet of star star reflected work be to go on night have to pick way carefully between plank hurrying workman doing job by light of resin flare resin flare brought fishing into mind fishing dear night on bay moonlight wooing winning of suleima how strange that suleima must be of same sex a fine magnificent capsina suleima with bravery heroism at fall of tripoli woman to backbone capsina admirable lovable a be more capable of being loved by than must have be tigress yet have sobbed over little cry child be more difficult still to understand mitsos being unlearned in unprofitable art of analysis frowned over problem thought not at that be of complicated nature then felt that be key to whole situation said to that be very hard to understand found kanaris dressing wound of lad who have be crucified healing wholesome blood ran in vein for though have be dressed roughly only with oil bandage showed sign of fester poisoning lad be still weak suffering when saw mitsos coming in at cabin door face flushed sat up in bed with livelier movement than have yet shown looked up at with eye of dog must rise if must said kiss hand foot for indeed owe what can never repay mitsos smiled then will not talk of said sat down by bed how go why look alive again now in few day if will will be going turk shooting with rest of ah devil devil cried a saw cruel wound in hand before god lad have done something already to revenge blasphemed will do more how do call boy be sitting with teeth tight clinched to prevent cry out at painful dressing of wound at looked up suddenly seeming to forget hurt christos be name said be why crucified oh mitsos do know what said looked at know how turk can look when play with flesh blood when told name one said 'then will see if can die patiently a god of yours did ' lad laughed suddenly eye blazed though wince said must cry like woman at little pain yet before god must have laughed then when nailed to cross set up above altar can not tell what strange joy be in heart be not curious infidel men crucified because name be christos surely must have have better reason kanaris have finished dressing of wound boy thanked went on so did not struggle cry at indeed did not want to then soon after be not long think hanging a did blood seemed to sing grow heavy in ear head dropped once twice raised to take breath before long grew unconscious supposing at end be dying glorying in for knew that greek must come again find there thought must be found thus with head drooped like wooden christ be sweet to came came lad broke off smiling at two mitsos throat seemed to small burning choked in trying to speak so for answer rose kissed boy on forehead be silent till again have possession of voice christos said involuntarily with curious confusion of thought crossed christos be even a say for seems to that somehow be great honor did to though to only blasphemous cruelty mitsos paused moment dimly understood superstitious belief of upbringing people surged into mind half pagan teaching suspected spirit in wind saw god fairy in forest strangely blended with child like faith have never conceived possible to doubt truth of creed combined to turn boy into something more than human to endow with attribute of type knelt down by bed strangely moved be said who must kiss hand for have not suffered died almost on cross where wicked men nailed for being called by name mitsos be trembling with mysterious excitement word be so unlike anything that kanaris have suspected must come from that latter be startled own emotion have be far more deeply stirred than liked must have confessed to see mitsos possessed by same hysterical affection frightened laid hand on shoulder get up little mitsos said know what be saying see capsina have gone on shore will have supper with will have together here a have finished doctoring feel can eat to night said turning to boy christos smiled surely mitsos must feed looked with comic contempt at bandaged hand be good said kanaris clapping hand told cabin boy to bring in supper for three mitsos serene sense soon came back to wondered half shamedly at thought of previous excursion into kingdom of hysteric have made after fight at mill certainly christos be human enough at supper put victual into mouth in vain attempt to ply with wine simultaneously brought to verge of choking mitsos found capsina waiting up for on revenge when got back be sitting idle thing unusual looked a if have be cry smiled at though rather tremulously a entered pointed to seat mitsos amazed horror at hanging be struck from mind oh capsina said know how sorry feel for surely be more than just to on turkish ship indeed be time for gentleness have be thinking of that be in capsina nodded of oddly enough of baby have left here how be lad crucified have seen yes then in whisper be not strange said name be christos oh mitsos be that why did thus to yes said must see if must die a patiently capsina flushed eye be fire then may christ never forgive if revenge thing by blood blood blood here by vow laid hand on little shrine at end of cabin that if ever stay hand spare one of accursed enemy of that day will be last day of life for indeed will not be worthy to live breathe pure air of making so swear may all saint of heaven may blessed christ thrice holy mother of christ help to keep vow knelt moment before shrine crossing then turned to mitsos will take lad with if will come said for think that blessing of god can not fail to rest on ship carry will go see in morning now little mitsos let go to bed for have not be very quiet day for for must sleep like child tired with play good night lad thank god day for meeting of ours held hand in hers for moment with gentle pressure looking at with great shining eye smiling mouth good night said oh capsina bless god for meeting too a far a there be strength in will help to keep vow be even so be enemy of christ have graciously made to for yet yet hang man again for somehow seems to poor manner to add insult to death to insult be what turk do sophia looked at silent then laughed passing hand wearily over eye a be of mainats of clan of capsas think must have fine manner oh little mitsos be boy of very oddest thought well be a say be angry when did indeed have time for anger for sword doe not feel angry when strike only strike strike true so chapter vii from moment of entering gulf of corinth one precaution be of primary necessity to success of capsina expedition be that word of coming of ship must go about between various turkish ship in gulf good fortune have determined that nine ship knew be there be separated into group of three felt confident that two must tackle three supposing word went about remaining six mobilized position must be serious enough to steady even two brig full of tiger be practically certain that turkish garrison of lepanto have before received news from patras of entrance into gulf if so only most dire stress of circumstance must drive capsina to attempt to pas again except at night for channel be altogether commanded by heavy gun of fortress preferred windy water of gulf with room to turn manoeuvre to tight rope of way hitherto have gone well for of three ship have encountered neither man woman child must do aught else than toss with ooze tangle of gulf tell tale to fish further point in favor be that only very few village on shore have turkish garrison so that combined movement to drive into corner must be difficult of execution safety chiefly lay in expeditious action danger in escape of turkish ship might manage after being attacked by to join others now capsina recklessness be of more judicious kind rather may be said that be prudent except when occasion demanded free disregard of possible consequence be clearly poor economy to save little time go to sea with ship not thoroughly up to mark waited with rebellious patience until sophia be altogether fit for action again folk of galaxidi regarded more in light of splendid incarnation of spirit of insurrection than woman to a to mitsos christos be almost sacred thing men woman came in shoal on to revenge where capsina have caused to be moved when be enough recovered looked with kind of religious awe at lad whom infidel have crucified great pride boy took in what have be done to be inspiring to see capsina impatience found bridle in directing superintending with mitsos kanaris establishment of fort at galaxidi must command harbor galaxidi boasted one of few well sheltered harbor on gulf must for certain be reached by well handled boat in stormy weather for while harbor at aegion faced nearly north be impossible to make in northwesterly gale harbor at corinth have so narrow entrance with heavy cross sea ship be a like a not to be shouldered on to breakwater at harbor faced south have wide entrance protected from violent westerly wind by long headland on other side of lay elatina otherwise shore for several mile be rocky inhospitable enemy ship a capsina saw must take galaxidi unless first have possession of harbor be on end of promontory commanded that caused defence to be begun heretofore whole of coast district have taken part in work of revolution bloody scheme of turk be to wipe out fishing village one by one so a to secure against possibility of such movement in future such have be fate of elatina for fate doubt have galaxidi be devilishly designed when two greek brig overtook spoke with designer thereof on second day of stay there when even capsina have be forced to be prepared to stop at least week mitsos prowled about quay harbor like whelp on sure trace of blood how rightly future be to prove be death trap little mitsos said girl see be plan let put up big shed on quay for world like turkish custom house with turkish flag over if will frown mitsos seem to think that be mission to render turkish nation immortal flag to give confidence a be saying will be custom house rather custom house where due be rather heavy of sort thus supposing by devil luck either of two company of ship escape from can at least do best to head towards galaxidi where will see own flag flying put in mitsos eh be partner with tigress with ba lamb seems went on girl with glance at fine grown ba lamb thus will sail in unsuspecting fiend in hell be in if ever sail out concluded with sudden flare there be more to than said mitsos be in gulf for month more than month maybe be well to have place for breathing in be sure that can not get out of gulf until coming of fleet so think well with fort here in hand of greek will not need to capsina stood silent moment surveying harbor with head little on one side be by mean rotten egg be trying to hatch said at length mayor who be cousin will dine with to day there will be much talking go back to ship lad smoke pipe be what want be so stupid morning then asked mitsos there be mellowness in tobacco said sententiously quoting greek proverb be not stupid have other business in have share what be who will have made little mitsos confessor said drolling with well father be going to see baby blessing of saint be on work daughter said mitsos with prelatical solemnity be never away from baby capsina be to be superseded flushed little not from affection said with secret truth only in matter of advice claim right to consult turned walked briskly away from quay mayor elia melissinos be little withered man with face color of ripe crab apple eye bright black like bird peeped out from great fringe of eyebrow seemed very hearth home of infernal shrewdness be first cousin of capsina mother thought nothing of connection with clan remarking with much truth that same god made also vermin tortoise upon mountain a have grave theological doubt a to whether be god devil who have made turk be suitable ally ate dinner peeking peering at food swallowing gulpingly like pill with backward toss of head occasionally glancing at mitsos who fed christos alternately asking sharp little question when have finished went on deck elia sucked at pipe like grave little baby while capsina made exposition see cousin said mitsos have examined quay think that be easily defensible hard to take there be already big shed on there will have to build one on promontory opposite between will command harbor like two edged sword will be putting gun on shed maybe asked elia briskly there must not be much advantage to in building shed leaving totally empty remarked mitsos yes dear cousin said elia where be gun to come from for never yet authentically heard that grew on mountain side musket have plenty of be thinking that before turkish ship get within musket shot shed will be spillikin match wood if come on to rain musket will get rusty indeed know that there will be other result worth mentioning can have two four inch gun from revenge two from sophia said capsina for be little overarmed if anything what say mitsos mitsos scratched head say that wish there be not so many good gun lying at bottom of gulf of corinth said where do lie asked elia capsina sprang up indeed little mitsos have wooden head though think slower than snail walk cousin one ship gun lie in fifteen fathom water not mile from land in bay westward from point of galaxidi must lead there blindfolded can raise think can try said elia if brig be over armed be not overarmed cried girl wish have more gun elia bowed with precise little smile on lip mistake be mine said be wrong when thought heard say so please continue cousin for expense will provide out of money have put aside for war fund continued capsina how much have little mitsos oh be there nothing know in case there be enough then want men be there plenty here who be ready to take up arm be ready to stand on head cousin if bid said elia good now about attempt to raise of gun plunged into detail of raft gear diver tackling leaving be to be feared listener in state of bewildered confidence in power to draw moon to earth if so wished confused a to method purposed to adopt in such way capsina drew curb on impatience to be gone again derived certain satisfaction in curtailing hour of mitsos tobacco smoking six gun after infinity of trouble swamping of two raft be raised towed to galaxidi corn mill be put to grind powder black flour of death shed be run up opposite quay load of earth sand to be packed in corn sack be stored a protection for fort quantity indicated a mitsos pointed out outrageously impossible harvest a capsina retorted turkish ship coming to raid town usually pause to consider whether preceding summer have be weather suitable for crop capsina having put preparation in train intrusting complete execution to elia stayed not hour after sophia be again fit for sea for hour wasted hour risk to perhaps defenseless village eight day after arrival put to sea again eastward touring round gulf leaving galaxidi humming like hive of bee for several day made little way wind being contrary calm hour be first hour of cruise lived over again with help of two crutch christos be soon able to limp about deck a boyish spirit reasserted became pre eminently human showing only dog like affection for mitsos who fussed over insistently thing pleased enraged capsina time be jealous of lad for rest found suitable enough that little mitsos must have rescued that rescued must agree with in lovableness when deck be wet christos crutch showed greater aptitude for slipping than supporting mitsos must take carry across to sheltered place where three must sit by hour talking laughing together on one such evening following day of fretful biting rain sky have cleared towards sunset be tacking out to sea for mile two under northeasterly wind to anchor a soon a land breeze dropped at end of second tack making if possible dark wooded promontory lay due east capsina always kept a near a possible to shore so a not to run least risk of missing turkish ship a knew be going from village to village watch be kept for enemy ship capsina offering prize to sailor who first sighted mitsos have come slipping sliding across deck with christos in arm sudden roll of ship have come near upsetting so hereafter said mitsos will shift for christos for put on weight of sack of corn day did hurt did not in way be sure capsina burst out laughing oh little mitsos must compare to hen hen with one chicken other christos mitsos sat down filled pipe christos well know one who clucked considerably over baby said like taking care of people there be pipe lad open mouth capsina laughed again chuck chuck chuck said well let have two chicken then cried mitsos what can do for capsina can be very good comrade surely hope so let fuss for christos be getting well must take care of somebody well can tell if be time to put about eh did bargain must have to get up said mitsos raising foot by foot looking out well yes will make promontory on next tack then can lie to nothing be seen of devil dimitri dimitri shrugged shoulder well will put about 'd best move christos when go on other tack will get wet there be of consequence whether get wet remarked sophia well come along then said mitsos will carry across first sophia hesitated help up then said laughed mitsos bent down gathered up staggered across deck with half laughing half puzzled eh god made big woman said why christos be weight steady now capsina slipped from arm oh christos be always christos cried there go fetch little mitsos be trying to walk will get fall mitsos stared moment obeyed capsina finished journey across deck alone stood looking out over sea for moment with flushed face hammer for heart thrill of tremulous exultation shook unreasonably sweet found thing have be nothing have taken up a must take child up to help over brook for moment have lain in arm with face bent laughing into hers very fact that have meant no more than shadow of nothingness to gave sense of secret pleasure to be enjoyed alone have felt sinew of arm harden strain a lifted own arm have cast for greater security round neck have felt on wrist short hair above collar for since have come to sea have cut close saying that salt spray made sticky at physical contact last shred of unwilling reserve went from be wholly abandonedly in few moment mitsos returned with christos long leg dangling from arm for hour more sat together beneath lee bulwark while ship started on last tack sun be already crimson ball on sea mountain on north of gulf be obscured in haze of luminous gold seemed to penetrate making glow from hither zigzag line of fire be scribbled across from horizon to ship from sheet of spent foam flung over weather side a brig shouldered way along through great humping sea spray turned for moment to rosy mist before fell with hiss white broken on weather deck with crash poise bow met resounding wave then plunged like petrel down sheer decline of next water valley black promontory be already opposite with fringe of foam rose fell like opening shutting of window over jamb of bulwark land breeze be steady not boisterous hummed like great sleepy top in rigging mitsos sat on deck with back to coil of rope facing other two face turned rosy brown by sunset capsina looking at knew blissful uncontent of love sunset sea died to pearly gray one by one star pierced velvet softness of sky until whole wheeling host have lit watch fire presently after brig passed promontory white sail drooped be furled whole world waited silent asleep for thing of morrow be now nearing easternmost end of gulf about twelve of next day must see dimly rising high in upper ridge of cithaeron house of roe deer so said christos sea haze rose concealing lower slope top be domed pinnacled in snow clear curiously near coast be well known to christos for father have be man of sea trading along shore vilia so told be chief village at gulf end immediate shore be without settlement except for few cottage clustered round certain old ruin wall high tower so said big enough for garrison of mitsos men thus ear be pulled porto germano be name of place because man of outlandish language so seemed of guttural voice have made great map of place there be only wall tower said christos yet spent much time labor over gave money to who held machine tape for writing many figure in book talking to in throat mitsos lad be sitting aft a christos delivered information in half treble staccato voice with air of sceptical innocence shyly a to demigod capsina have left gone forward returned soon to with quicker step heightened color mitsos said come forward come christos for be sharp eyed little mitsos signal to kanaris that join be there be there began mitsos oh little mitsos cried girl there will be blood in sunset if god be good go signal lad come forward christos seems have won own prize be six mile off eastern shore of gulf running before favorable wind after mitsos have signalled to sophia be between north coast on port tack have seen put about on starboard tack in answer went forward to join capsina christos right ahead close in to land must see mast of three ship hull be down moment be critical for ship be evidently at anchor a sail be spread be close in shore thus minute perhaps be murder rapine to greek village be possible that have only just come that capsina be in time to save village again be possible that infernal work be even now going on even that be over capsina stood in thought for moment only be said to mitsos be certain that vilia be village be making for vilia be how far inland christos two hour steep way through pine wood thank god for pine wood look mitsos will have meant to leave ship at anchor while raided vilia beyond shadow of doubt will have left part of crew on board who will of course give alarm if greek ship be seen approaching have to get between ship men have sent up to vilia there be village on mountain side except vilia christos none how be to do asked mitsos moment see will send after men there be time to lose said capsina quietly hoist turkish flag looked at mitsos a if questioningly mitsos met gaze yes said be one of thing like be unreasonable there be other way of getting in thing be right to save vilia must turn moslem if so must kill more of oh capsina quite agree with will even hoist how come have one because be one who look beyond to morrow said much relieved made in hydra signal be made to kanaris few moment afterwards saw turkish flag run up on sophia wind still held revenge took reef in to let sophia join by time hull of turk have risen above horizon line of water two be sailing close together approached quickly under steady singing west wind before two o'clock must already see thin line of cutting ripple breaking on shingle yet from turkish ship came sign lay at anchor furlong from shore must seem deserted capsina order be to be ready to fire on word if possible to pas turkish ship without firing shot cast anchor between shore object be if men have landed to take vilia to cut off from ship if possible must capture at present there be mean of telling in what state thing be only deserted appearance of turkish ship argued probability of raid having set forth capsina if probability must prove true have given order signalling to kanaris to leave one third of men on ship land with rest in pursuit of turk for if a be now certain since brig have be allowed to approach so close have suspicion that armed ship of greek be in gulf must have attacked vilia with available men leaving handful only on ship a came alongside with sail already furled moving only by impetus ready to swing round cast anchor turk strolled across deck of ship nearest to revenge leaning carelessly on bulwark shouted in turkish for answer have only hiss of lapping water sight of mitsos unfezzed head for capsina have told rest to keep out of sight a appearance of woman on bridge must have seemed odd to even indolently minded folk have left mitsos alone there while crouched in concealment behind bulwark at suspicion seemed to awake popped head down be seen no more moment afterwards just a anchor of revenge splashed plunging into sea two shot be fired in rapid succession from turk bow gun be pointing out to sea evidently aimed at sophia revenge at that capsina jumped up be signal cried there be time to lose down with devil flag up with cross great cheer went up from men a blue white ensign be hauled up mast for like mitsos put hoisting of crescent among thing did not like in three minute first boatload be on way to shore along beach be drawn up boat in turk have landed guarded only by few men who a greek drew near shore fled incontinently into olive grove grew down to within fifty yard of sea climbed to foot of pine forest of upper hill let run said mitsos for must ever run faster than turk vaulted clean lithe over boat side pulled in through willow water to shore eh capsina added wo do to let boat stop there else men will be embarking to ship again when chase sail off with prize dimitri see that a soon a have gone boat be taken away from shore tied up to revenge sophia so will be said dimitri then oh most beloved little mitsos can not come with asked for must dearly like to hunt turbaned pig through forest mitsos shook head be capsina order said must not leave ship without good garrison eye twinkled when be after fat brute who trip in brushwood call on prophet who will be very slow to help will think of dimitri meantime have hand full board turkish ship one by one with three quarter of men from sophia revenge together for have boat can not reach make ready supper for doubt will get dinner to day except only food for joy will not have left more than dozen men on ship half dozen asked dimitri completing question with look yes must be so said mitsos now off with second boatload third came racing to land using for greater expedition deserted turkish boat to disembark men in le than hour whole contingent four hundred fifty be ranged ready to start mitsos have in vain endeavored to persuade capsina not to come with must have run fit to make man burst said up hill at end god knew what rough tumble fighting girl breeched like man carrying musket pistol scornfully refused to be left behind indeed seemed fit for work mitsos looked at with candid admiration a trotted briskly along up slope from beach by side be like being with yanni again said when lad found leg too short for pace why must lean on so drew capsina arm within own bade give of weight capsina flushed panting little did a told mitsos have be intrusted with ordering of raid of raider called halt a got to edge of pine wood repeated instruction men be to form long open file on side of path leading up hill so must turk have turned scattered through wood on signal of recall might not slip past fifty men be to stop there on patrol at edge of wood so a to intercept who might have passed advanced body who if marched through pine wood extended to within mile of vilia without encountering enemy be to form again on open ground too said mitsos in conclusion with voice of most joyful conviction turk be certainly work of devil therefore be entirely business to hate to kill be last raid of men god have willed so have made short of leg more easily overtaken short of arm easier to deal with at close quarter therefore raised voice open out right left a gave order men with mouth full of laughter at little mitsos homily opened out pine wood through hoped to hunt turbaned pig grew thick tall above ground be muffled with fallen needle here there in space where pine grew thinner sprouted tangle of scrub brushwood for most part ground be bare of undergrowth track cobbled turkish road wound round contour of hill thus in wood on side have to march more slowly allowing for deviousness of path morning be a if borrowed from day in lap of spring mid day sun shone with cheerfulness of april peeping like galaxy of warm rayed star through cluster of needle on pine west wind fresh vigorous from sea gave briskness to going of blood glimpse of snow of cithaeron far high in front carried foot on after eye steepness of ascent melted fast under vigorous foot a line went forward up mountain side sea like friend rose with a if to watch guard foster child till ravine cut crossway through mountain hid cheerful presence from eye though crispness lingered in limb here tree grew somewhat thicker spring have flushed hill side with more stubborn growth of low creeping thing owing to winding of road who marched on side be hanging on footstep to allow follower of path to keep up with when capsina beckoned to mitsos who be forcing way through belt of young poplar grew in open paused seeing what have seen crawled into cover of pine passed word down to halt that on path must leave for shelter of bush slope of ravine opposite be thickly covered with tree high upon three hundred foot above mile away be little group of glittering point winking flashing among tree like dance of sun on water moving down towards now then a if sun have disappeared behind cloud must be hidden from sight by thickness in pine to burst out again in fleet of bright moving spot where ground be clearer advancing line of greek have halted on path have made concealment of under tree for bright speck opposite mountain side seemed tenanted only by whispering pine only watched by few high circling capsina be standing by mitsos lad eye blazed with light be not fury of hate burned ruin of elatina have kindled veiled by softening of pity for man hung at own yard arm clear sparkling madness of joy of fighting hungry animal joy of scenting desired prey oh whispered oh again with looked up saw circling hawk will be nearer before night said fat with picking be all a clear a sea water capsina easier than smoking wait here exactly where be closing up little very still till turk strike bottom of ravine below then volley perhaps two for will break scatter then man to feed own knife pistol if please will give order think vilia be safe asked capsina oh woman how can tell safe not there be nothing to do what be doing only know that devil be not in vilia now be coming to deal with first be order surely mitsos passed word right left sat down taking notice of girl drawing finger along edge of long knife once twice drove point tenderly lovingly into bark of tree for most part sat smiling to purring must say like great cat suddenly turned to capsina get back to ship said be work for woman that have on hand must not have woman see capsina laughed softly in truth little mitsos know not much about woman who told that woman have soft heart fear blood man doubt for be not so will not be fit for said mitsos again will not go back certainly will not mitsos sat still moment frowning be true that know much about then be not like woman think asked girl with sudden anguish at heart yet must there be more woman like said mitsos so be then look be getting closer meantime greek line have closed up mitsos stole away in cover of tree to give order signal for firing be to be one musket shot from greek line given by if turk stood ground firing be to continue if broke man be to be own general business be to kill turk be good marksman be slow of foot wood be thick knife be gift of god greek must collect again mitsos smiled like angel militant when work be done in place now occupied then came space of quivering delay when men must have found in heart to shriek aloud with straining tension pulling like pincer at flesh while be compelled to stand still watch in silence little glittering patch dancing shining down mountain side mitsos for own part be conscious of thought agonized desire for tobacco to kanaris fact that have left three if not four piastre lying loose on cabin table be source of immeasurable regret stray lock of capsina hair have escaped from cap blew now again against cheek be annoyance of nightmare intensity watched growing glittering patch in ten minute be nearly opposite on hill side in front quarter of mile away must see that men be hurrying along half running half marching unencumbered by booty captive at mitsos drew sigh of relief for knew that have not reached vilia when signal of recall turned back then took musket up from ground where have laid holding ready with finger on trigger looked round at capsina be nearly over whispered indeed be in hurry to day smiled in answer slowly now with perfect steadiness though five minute before hand have be like ague stricken thing raised musket to shoulder picking out one of foremost men who be coming down path opposite kept balanced on sight of gun for with thriftiness of race saw reason why signal to others must not be in of little use a man stepped on to little arched bridge crossed stream below fired man spun round fell volley from right left indorsed shot shook powder out of flask into hand be good omen said oh capsina be most exceedingly happy turk have halted for moment few fired wildly into tree bullet struck ground at mitsos foot burying in pine needle lad ripped up ground with knife put bullet be going to ram home on top of charge into wallet again to be returned said fired there be joy in heart second rather straggling volley came from almost invisible greek at that turk stood no longer broke in direction following stream in course to valley charging up hill where greek be posted in order to get back to ship rushing up hill side again in direction of vilia will go little mitsos said capsina a if must ask to take turn about deck be standing not far from path mitsos for answer pushed capsina behind tree fire at coming up path said for sake of virgin remember that be in brushwood not far in front jumped over low growing bush about fifty turk have kept together be coming up path towards at double two dozen greek have already begun running down path after others there be few moment tussle fighting two three falling on side turk struggled through hurried on mitsos capsina few others fired coolly steadily at from cover soon passed be lost in wood behind mitsos threw musket down knife pistol for said come patrol outside will talk to for first few minute odds be largely against greek for many of turk despairing of escape have hidden in clump of brushwood a greek came on spurted bristled with fire number be wounded few only killed when once got ambushed turk out of nearer hiding place on move again odds be vastly other way tree be so thick that a mitsos have seen musket be of little use be hand to hand fighting pistol at close quarter pistol however required reloading time be precious for main object be to prevent turk from reforming gaining open ground where must make organized resistance knife be always ready to hand needed charging arm thrust in little while only occasional shot be heard hurrying step slipping on muffled floor of pine needle short drawn gasp of striker groan of struck now then couple of figure with perhaps two more in pursuit must hurry across piece of open ground for man on slope opposite must have seen only hill side green peaceful heard whispering of tree above head what must take to be sound of wild boar routing tramping in undergrowth have suspected nothing of dance of death raging under aromatic pine must perhaps have noticed that hawk be wheeling in large number very silently without usual shrill pipe above tree must have said truly to that there be carrion somewhere below mitsos capsina have kept close together kanaris cool business like a ever have lost almost at once among tree for have turned aside moment to investigate musket barrel pointed out of clump of oleander by stream have be rewarded for curiosity by having hair singed by fire passed close to temple mitsos have paused moment laughed a saw kanaris draw back step two jump with knife raised into middle of clump shouted good luck to turned in time to see capsina fly like furious wild cat holding pistol by barrel in one hand long knife in other at man who be crossing between two tree just in front saw turk lip curl in sort of snarl put hand to belt moment too late for next capsina knife have flickered down from arm length to throat butt of pistol caught on temple fell sprawling at foot have to put one foot on chest a purchase to pull knife out again yet be woman muttered mitsos to wheeling round ah must cried turk rushing at capsina who be still tugging at knife got be weapon between shoulder blade girl turned thanks said owe one pull knife out for little mitsos pull oh how slow be even in so short time tide have completely turned turk be a game driven from one cover to greek who have gone off in pursuit of who have fled down bed of stream be returning for more of be left to be slain fight be centring round copse of low growing tree more in open higher up hill majority of turk who be not yet slain have taken refuge here already place have proved expensive to greek for more than twenty lay dead round brushwood be so thick that be impossible to see more than yard two while man be forcing way in after turk in front of shot must come from right left from closer at hand knife must lick out like snake tongue while turned to new enemy pursued became pursuer such be state of thing when mitsos capsina came up latter have received nasty cut across left arm mitsos have tied up roughly for being unable to persuade to stop quiet out of harm way while work be finished refused laughing wildly for drunkenness of blood be on two went forward together paused moment fifty yard from edge of copse from ground above now then turk must make dash for cover sometimes getting through greek who be fighting on outskirt sometimes knifing one on way more often falling once from behind man ran swiftly by cutting at mitsos a passed disappeared with bound into tree capsina looked round at dead who be lying about face grew set hard what fool work be cried be in open in shelter smoke out caught up handful of dry fern firing blank charge into obtained smouldering spark two blew into flame dozen others standing near did same fixing burning stuff on knife rushed forward to very edge of ambush while from without dozen musket cracked twig above rammed into heart of thick tangled growth other fire be lighted along west side of copse dried raffle of last year leaf caught quickly wind took flame inward greener growth of spring cast out volume of stinging smoke when place be well alight drew off men stationing round other three side advancing a flame advanced for escape through choking smoke fire be impossible then at first by one two turk came out like rabbit from burrow bursting wildly out occasionally passing line of greek standing a if bewildered trying to steal away unobserved others running few step out then turning back again hour later whole copse be charred ash cinder remained only to search for dead wounded of greek dead whom accounted happy buried there on smiling hill side so that preying beast of mountain carrion feeding bird might not touch only next spring grass flower must grow more vivid on resting place wounded carried back tenderly to ship how thick turk lay there hawk eagle know chapter viii fourth day after saw two brig returned in peace to galaxidi again expenditure of time have cost capsina much misgiving impatience for to reasonably minded there be undeniable necessity for crew of ship have lost somewhat heavily in battle at porto germano even girl herself be bound to admit that wanted more men again have on hand three empty turkish vessel fully equipped for war must not leave behind lest must again fall into hand of enemy must have be glaring inconceivable waste to destroy for there be on board large quantity of ammunition shot three four hundred musket in eighteen gun though capsina grumbled that powder be damp gun must burst if used even offered to stand forty pace in front of of in turn while mitsos fired at remark be rightly felt to be merely rhetorical to express extreme impatience at enforced delay nothing further so mitsos be put in command of one turkish ship dimitri of kanaris first officer of third christos chiefly because rashly expressed wish to be transferred with mitsos be retained by capsina on board revenge stepped ashore at galaxidi looking battered god made tiger tigress also be only comment to mitsos when latter asked how have fared capsina be already vanished on hurricane errand by time mitsos have brought ship to anchor christos being left without order occupation took refuge in caf where sat awhile smoking playing draught for outside day be nought gray deluge of driven rain to at critical moment in game entered capsina word adequate for occasion failed mitsos seeing that eye betokened imminent chaos took rapid mental note of position of remaining piece on board then said hurriedly to christos be move remember when get straight again stood up christos shrunk into corner mitsos codones believe remarked capsina with terrifying stress on last word burning coldness of tone believe so too said mitsos genially whom engaged to play draught in low cafs said capsina with wild glance to waste time oh be too much draughtsman described parabola into inaccessible place god in heaven be not too much cried girl have to go hunting through village of greece up down lord know where to find playing draught with pigeon livered boy revenge be pulling at hawser while mitsos play draught greek be being murdered along coast mitsos play draught interminable grin spread over mitsos face capsina doubt not go to see strange baby while greek be murdered along coast revenge strain at hawser capsina spends time in abusing own first officer said oh capsina where be there choice between be so hasty see will have to pick up draught for finish game will will a very well know start till to morrow be move christos piece be so eh there be be up sleeve capsina capsina glared at christos moment a if be careful mother who have discovered luring child of hers into low haunt directed torrent of grievance against never did see such lad said if be of clan must set to loom distaff like woman must sit look at sea by hour mitsos must throw bread to gull gull indeed mitsos fairly laughed out oh capsina cried sit down watch play there be nothing can do know well new men have volunteered kanaris have choosing of settled that revenge can not start before morning then how doe assist war to stamp up down through village of greece a say call christos bird name there be cornered knew must happen pigeon livered win move pigeon mitsos shook back hair from eye looked inquiringly at capsina doe not seem to most excellent sound sense said capsina stood little longer undecided corner of mouth wavered mitsos seeing advantage clapped hand coffee for capsina cried to shopman be not so capsina fetched chair now watch finish then christos will play will take side thus stand fall together may ever be so with christos be devil of cunning fellow for be known to be pretty good see what there be left of oh fool of little mitsos said girl looked at shade longer than friend must have done sat down there came caique in from corinth afternoon said with news of other three ship with news too from overland from nauplia mitsos paused with finger on piece what be news asked three turkish ship tried to put in there must not make harbor mean news from nauplia capsina looked up raising eyebrow be at home so dear yet have be with month now mitsos except only that want to say good bye to at home before starting know not if have father mother be bad manner said with nose in air to ask for what one be not given what be news repeated mitsos good news only town be blockaded by land sea so that turk can go out in greek woman child with men who serve there be few such left town night before blockade began have encamped on mound of tiryns in spring turk will send fresh army south in time hope to raise siege praise virgin said mitsos nauplia will be starved out before move king go a straight a homing honey bee into mouth of pigeon livered there be other way oh majesty capsina laughed surely there have never be lad yet so single of purpose said to there be nothing in world little wooden king even so if only news from nauplia be good said mitsos smiling half to if little turk will be kind sail northward to yet still tell said girl will throw manner away ask have mother mitsos father either stopped remembering what suleima have said to other a walked beneath star down to boat then who be who be so dear asked with sudden uprising of anxiety waited for answer be suleima said little wife adorable so call littlest one capsina stared moment in silence so said at length never told that little mitsos why have so greatly made stranger of rose from where sat with flame in eye be quenched be appealing only a of chidden dog indeed capsina again indeed said girl turned quickly from went out of place leaving coffee untouched into dark rain ruled night walked up quay down again hardly conscious of driving rain on right water below harbor wall hissed whispered to like angry snake under slanting deluge sophia revenge lay side by side two hundred yard out from nearer in must hear rattle of crane be unloading turkish ship have captured great oil flare under awning flickered flapped in eddying draught wind kept shifting chopping about now then dripping from off house must be blown outward in wisp of chilly water across again spray from peevish ripple in harbor must be cut off thrown like sheet over quay in storm of soul heeded not that chill windy rain played minor part in wild bitter symphony of thought at first seemed incredible thing to ever since have seen mitsos come up out of sunset from boat conviction have be unchanged that be one from sea sun who be made to fulfil life a if to put seal on certainty very night have joined on ship have tossed together to anger of gean together have played like child on holiday have be together a one comrade with comrade in work to have dedicated comrade to comrade be exactly be view of to comradeship be life yanni cousin of whom have often spoken kanaris lad christos be to mitsos a be perhaps little le than for be woman oh be impossible god must not be so unkind who spent day risked oh how willingly fighting against enemy be wage who be suleima turkish name by sound moon faced pasty girl doubt fat fond of sweet thing cat by fire what must be to mitsos littlest one mitsos son at thought impotent incontinent jealousy hatred possessed soul mitsos be not hers pledged sealed walked faster michael who have accompanied without murmur since such be duty of dog stood moment under protecting eaves of house with head on one side looking at in reproachful protest for even shaggy coat be penetrated by whipping rain still walked on shook disgustedly from head to tail went after opposite caf again hung on step looking in through rain slanted window pane mitsos be bent over little wooden king absorbed sheltered while be outside rain drenched with anguish for heart ah what humiliation why must not have lived like other woman of class have married christos cousin long ago have settled down to clucking purring life have looked beyond making of jam weaving of cloth marriage among domestic duty have thought finest girl god have made one who must treat with us normal function of sex one who have need of man except to serve one who thought of woman a lower most intensely foolish animal whose only dream be to marry not exacting man settle down to ever dwindling existence of narrowing horizon yet where be fine thought now have sailed own ship be true sent certain number of devil brood to account what did profit in present palpable anguish pain humiliation be le for that clucking woman despised be wiser than at rate have known what be fit for alone of have made great irrevocable mistake capsina be brought down to dust mitsos played draught with little wooden king flesh blood more intimate self that childish need for love even most heroically moulded know cried out within then pride to dominant passion came to rescue at rate none knew none must ever know for thus humiliation must be at least secret must behave to mitsos just exactly a before not one tittle of companionship not iota of frank show of affection for must be abated after there be revenge with human love longing of woman for one man came like great flood over little sand pebble of pride jealousy anger cried out involuntarily a if with sudden pang of pain bringing michael to side have reached end of quay on one side of road be little workman hut erected for building of capsina custom house entering sat down on heap of shingle have be shot down there for making of rough cast wall of building michael cold dripping too well bred to shake when near mistress stood shivering by with puzzled amazement in eye at unusual behavior of pillar of world girl drew towards buried face in shaggy dripping ruff oh michael michael sobbed be not one to come from sea sea sun be not to be brig be not heaven to fly open for indeed be not so one came from sea sun be not be wrong be utterly wrong now world hold other rain have ceased from outside came only sullen drumming of wave breaking on shingle beyond harbor followed rhythmically by scream of pebbly beach dragged down by backwash slow steady drip from sodden eaves suddenly noise became overscored with rise fall of voice capsina drew michael closer to hushed growling so indeed must not mind christos said mitsos voice for there be none like eye grow brighter for excitement when to tell truth heart have be lump of cold lead be honor to that be with that trust even like be more than did for of in hydra eh will be rough to morrow look at wave suppose have gone back to ship expect so said christos let go too mitsos wait minute there be nothing like sea at night unless be capsina be strong be ready to knock down if come too near yet will take safely well if only make how will say make of fire ship did ever tell about night of fire ship of course did not for never told uncle nikolas be likely to except to one only yes so be admire more than admire rest of world rolled into one always so think must do bidding might chide must crawl back to again must even bring suleima too on knee if so pleased capsina must know suleima feel doe not know until know suleima well come let get back think good news from nauplia must have made drunk surely be anxious knew not did ever tell how capsina oh be of finer mould than others voice be caught drowned in riot of sea obedience admiration liking be must have given at moment for at moment devil friend be lord master of soul for one flash of human longing desire of flesh blood felt by for matter in what form came moment heightened color sudden leap of enchanted blood involuntary step towards hand out stretched eye that longed must have given for let hate afterwards be a indifferent a sphinx to have once called out that must call out yet never tarries when own call come must be sufficient for that must for one second forget suleima remembering that must be unfaithful to suleima before accuser must pronounce word turn faithful again must be enough evil thought suddenly shot up like aloe loftily flowering clutched michael till dog whimpered drove not thought away picked bright evil flower pressing to bosom tended a shepherd tends sheep like sheep flocked into soul on instant familiar abiding place if suleima must die better even if must not die live bitterly for doubt too loved must come to how well must picture in what manner great awkward burning beyond compare saying little letting be seen not content with picture went on to put specious despicable word into mouth suleima must say must soon get over for be simply one of sea suleima hated sea must live with mitsos friend man friend be always kind to woman who have wearied be not fault either have wearied have wearied of besides loved even a imagined saying such sweet terrible thing heart rose against better self spat out like evil taste false image have conjured up of sullen windless rain began again outside fell hissing spitting like molten lead into harbor water yet somehow to be baptism washing of soul rose with quick step firm went back to opposite revenge blew whistle for boat strangely sweet bitter be to hear mitsos voice shouting order to see beneath flare bareheaded to rain clamber quickly down ship side into boat row with strength of great limb to come fetch alone almost before sun be up next morning prepared to put to sea rain have again fallen heavily during night ceased before daybreak mitsos stumbling sleepily on deck be soon awakened by chilly breeze from mountain must take out of harbor deck be dripping inclement to bare foot breath trailed away in cloud like smoke in cold air land sea sky be shade of one neutral gray more le intense strangely sombre top of hill to west be pale pearly reflecting more illuminated cloud eastward deepened gradually without admixture of other color into lower spur ridge behind village sea have grown calm again during night be mirror of low hanging cloud overhead to south faded so gradually with so regular tone into sky that horizon line eluded eye even ripple broke against wall of quay seemed in misty air to be woolly in texture a if drawn from ooze of bottomless sea to have lost sparkle of foam early a be capsina have come on deck before before have stood more than few second on bridge joined nodded greeting in silence waited side by side mitsos occasionally shouting order while ship cleared harbor mouth then mitsos yawned stretched rubbed eye be proper hour said be night morning even a jelly fish be plant animal oh capsina be extraordinarily cold turned looked at something arrested gaze have slept little added touch of pallor only lent more potent brilliance to black eye courage of resolution newly taken be there animation effort to be gave have twisted brilliantly colored shawl round head hair just loosely coiled showed in two broad band over forehead be wet sparkling with fine drop of condensed mist surrounded on side by endless gray of enormous morning seemed to more vivid than ever beauty for be man with eye blood rose smote then throwing back head laughed for very pleasure not from lip only from head to heel whole man laughed be splendid said indeed there be none like looked up at quickly be leap of blood sudden step nearer have told must be sufficient for again more quickly than upward sweep of eyelid indorsed that thought even before looked heart told that be not thus spoke of suleima thus must speak to admiration in voice involuntary tribute so merrily paid appreciation gave that have to give one thing only did not make up little more be so much for be not so thought one who must make pretty speech play at love making with one woman while thought of indeed must not have accepted travesty of heart deed let come to once be only with glance handshake involuntary inevitable be different matter answered without pause speaking from heart while thought spoke from lip only indeed little mitsos said be very sleepy surely be half awake be dreaming of suleima mitsos laughed surely suleima must not know if spoke to like that said what then do say to suleima oh nothing hundred thing sort of foolishness for morning will hing stare at baby by hour just say at end that will be tall lout like for answer say will be like to mother other morning will be shirt mending do

surprise found girl extraordinarily sympathetic a if much pleased interested in being told of be beyond measure astonishing thing to for heretofore intercourse with have be either of adventure past to come have a at first be no more than two child at play matter touching heart have be so remote from talk on board mitsos have never thought of a human woman one to whom thing must rather must be of concern to bitter cost have seen merely a great strong silly boy boyish altogether though to magnet for heart of more intimate lore of man woman so have planned be to learn together surprise to of finding that be clearly willing to hear talk thus be perhaps hardly le strong than shock to of finding that have known too well what have thought must learn together thus with strange flush of pleasure to boy new bond between told of ride from tripoli finding of suleima at home only of anguish of night of fire ship spoke not at there be intimacy one only close enough for so to admiration

off shore with canvas flapping idly mitsos whistled vine digger song to stir heaven wind came not for whistling day continued gray unseasonably cold from time to time little sprinkle of mingled sleet rain pattered on chilled deck mitsos stamped up down bridge cursing delay of dead wind for a soon a have settled remaining three vessel work in gulf must be over have hundred scheme whereby might pas gun of lepanto be off have already be six week on trail now a knew so well warmer march wind blink of spring sunshine must be beginning to open flower of plain of nauplia for flower be great

afternoon have spent in glow of grumbling content at womanish fad in digging up root on hill side evening by evening have come back again grimed with soil washed with winter rain with great hunger in stomach while suleima turned over spoil of afternoon always saying that there be not yet near enough once out of gulf must go home again if only for week two for capsina a have told be meaning to join greek fleet on spring cruise till started on that even confessed there be further work to hand towards evening sleet have be continuous afternoon grew intermittent between shower air be hard clear a before great storm fitful blast of more icy wind scoured across from north mitsos feeling sea weed barometer hung in cabin found moist slimy supper be ready on moment capsina came down flushed with stinging air more rain said mitsos wish devil might take to cook grilling soul of turk have sent sea weed be a if have dipped in oil jar capsina felt have trick of smelling wind mitsos said can smell wind have smelled strong wind day have not come for smelling said mitsos sulkily a if to exculpate deceptiveness of weather almost before have sat down rigging began to sing before mitsos have time to get on deck song be scream capsina followed looked rapidly round still north said may saint tell what to do look there pointed over hill above galaxidi sun have not quite set smudge of dirty light still smouldered in west to north sky lowered blackly tattered sheet of cloud be spreading ripping into streamer a spread over heaven even a spoke snake tongue of angry lightning licked out of centre of followed at short interval by drowsy peal of thunder must beat out to sea continued god know what be coming wind may chop round heaven save if be within two mile of shore capsina felt suddenly exhilarated prospect of great storm must take wit to fight braced against secret trouble here be more immediate employment for thought out to sea then while may cried mitsos be fine thing to be in hand of god saint what if turk slip by there will be rock big wave for turk said mitsos laconically hoist jib staysail can not stand more than where be kanaris sophia kanaris be a wise a will get sea room for said capsina there be done come back to supper little mitsos mitsos looked round again think not yet said go down will stop here till there be spoonful two more water between land be with said girl began pacing up down deck together night fell like stroke of black wing feathered with storm cloud a sponge with one wet sweep will wipe out writing from slate so black cloud in water sucked light from sky wind screamed ever higher more madly once again angry fire licked out be gone thunder clapped more immediate applause with be centre of infinite blackness land sea sky be swallowed up confounded in one terrific tumult of unseen uproar fast a brig scudded before storm wave seemed ever to be going faster a if to reach terrible rendezvous where must wait for in mitsos mind present fear be that wind must veer a so often happens on inland sea before be sufficiently far from land must be forcing back on to lee shore then knew there must be before night work of battling with wind yelled in exultation a took back of losing ground inevitably of desperately fighting inch until storm blew out hour passed be still running out to sea when suddenly wind shifted westward ship for moment trembled shook a if have struck rock two men at tiller knew work in moment have struggling tiller jammed down revenge checked like horse again slowly made way on starboard tack at sight of obedience of ship more like intelligent beast than thing of wood great thrill of pleasure struck capsina well done cried well done dear ship then sky above burst in blaze of violet light mitsos in flash though half blinded saw two thing one ship two mile distant a far a must judge in glance straight before bow on troubled streaky sea other great gray column rising like ghost from wave not more than four hundred yard away be more dangerous knew capsina too have seen called out to saint in heaven what be what be cried not ship other be spirit of from elatina mitsos be no longer there have seen that great gray column known for water spout without moment pause have rushed forward told to load six pounder in starboard bow ammunition be stored forward though seemed to that waited through suspense of lifetime in few second gun be loaded waited again fuse in hand darkness be intense from blackness came only hoarse scream of wind threat buffet of sea soon saw against blackness glimmering column of gray must hear above riot of storm drip a from thousand house roof came on in slightly slanting direction waiting till began to cut across muzzle of gun fired with crash of many water gray column vanished capsina have followed forward a smoke cleared away saw eye dancing slapped brazen side of gun there will be more work for to night cried well mitsos gone be gray ghost ship remains mitsos sat still moment strain responsibility of aim left unnerved almost instantly recovered will give chase to night said incredulously why not because god be blowing great gale there be light who know where will drive to again violent sheet of flame blazed from cloud overhead capsina laughed light be that light when cloud be bursting to give saw quite plainly then oh lad what be wind for except to sail on must chase turk in calm there again now whether be from mere infection of excitement possessed capsina whether nerve be strung by electricity in air to shrill pitch when man will do dare anything in case something of irresponsible recklessness of girl be on mitsos seemed to fine piece of play something between dream drunkard idea to go hunting of turk in wild storm flash of lightning repeated again repeated with redoubled quickness kept showing ship since first sighted have furled sail lay rolling on water simply weathering storm revenge be carrying jib staysail while turk drifted eastward be rapidly diminishing distance between mitsos rubbed hand exultantly will be a safe a hare in gin said when once get between land for power on earth will let sail out in teeth of wind capsina where be sophia where be other two turk signal sophia said girl kanaris will be on watch if be near enough to hear signal will soon know what be about two stern gun on upper battery accordingly be fired in quick succession being signal agreed on with kanaris before long saw answering flash of two gun on starboard five second afterwards heard report have beaten out farther to sea said mitsos for indeed be more prudent than be well be alone in piece turk say be afraid of ghost by night so for matter be will see phantom ship will speak with revenge be still going south at about right angle to wind a coast trended eastward be moment getting more sea room turk a knew be drifting due east for five minute so after word to run out gun be given lightning broke black streaming vault waited in thick tense silence for flash while above cloud remained pitchy unilluminated once again to south there came flash distant flickering like winking of eye showing that storm be coming up from quarter mitsos stamped with angry impatience be what feared said wind will shift farther south will have to look to ourselves holy virgin send flash of lightning west wind for hour more capsina be standing together on bridge mitsos bareheaded tangle haired to streaming rain with brilliantly colored shawl wrapped round head once shifted position putting forward hand on rail to steady laid on top of hers must feel blood pulsing furiously through artery in finger stood perfectly still not withdrawing hand indeed seemed unconscious that be there at last what have be waiting for came furious angry scribble leaped from west to east over head peering out into darkness saw turk to leeward of four hundred yard distant at mitsos grasped girl hand till must have cried out with pain there be cried have have let go helm be ready to furl sail on instant oh capsina hour be worth living tumult in girl mind did not allow to speak moment be too crowded even for thought must only strain eye in darkness to where have seen turk felt not mistress of herself mitsos a knew be nigh out of mind who must say what next hour might bring death shipwreck victory lightning love madness chased other through brain meantime ship left to spun round like top into wind under hurricane followed dipped fled like bird born bred to tempest after other after few headlong second mitsos cried order to furl sail canvas came dripping streaming onto deck men be at gun with order to fire moment lightning showed ship a spark leaped through cloud again forward gun on port side of revenge from three deck added bellowing to succeeding thunder anything approaching to accurate shooting be out of question have two second for flash be vivid far leaping for sighting simply fired into heart of loud chaotic darkness mitsos saw capsina standing not far from after first round behind fore port gun on main deck took step across reeling ship to side oh capsina assuredly be madder than king saul said yet find glorious somehow glorious girl voice be trembling with passion excitement be living week to minute ah cried a flash flickered overhead again again wind fell little violence frequency of lightning doubled redoubled gun answered thunder no longer broke with boom on distant cloud cliff with crash intolerably sharp simultaneous with light cross current in sea have swung bow of revenge more southward mitsos sent christos flying aft to tell stern gun on port side to be ready to fire from enemy in reply to two first discharge have come no response at third be answered couple of oversighted ball went whirring overhead through rigging like covey of grouse then came two flash of lightning in rapid succession by second must see hole crash open in side of turk from ball have fired by light of first there be not time near to load gun twice yet capsina in frenzy of excitement cuffed one of gunner over head calling slow lout man only laughed in reply capsina laughed back in answer again again heaven opened time ball from turk came in through port hole of one of gun breaking muzzle into splinter ricochetting off on to man to whom capsina have just spoken be shot almost in half mouth still smiled showing white teeth ball have killed whistled on striking stanchion on starboard side plopped out again overboard mitsos with great laugh threw cap after then came end ship be at close range ball from revenge delivered from port gun struck turk just on water line opening raking tear in side when next must see be already listing to starboard with rattle of thunder mingled hundred of human voice giddy complete drunkenness of blood be on men laughed shouted went back to supper drank health of dead portion in hell mitsos forgetting in frenzy fury of culminated excitement opened arm flung round capsina kissed a must have kissed yanni at moment cried thank god shipful will feed fish of gulf mitsos oh little mitsos cried girl kissed on cheek on lip next moment have started asunder knowing what have done capsina burning with exulting shame turned from without word went to cabin chapter ix during four month of mitsos absence progress of war in peloponnese have be checked by thousand petty ill timed jealousy on part of chief primate more than ever be becoming work of people have be agreed in preceding autumn that peloponnesian senate instituted at tripoli must be dissolved at fall of fortress took place in october that national assembly now that war be business in whole nation north south alike have taken up arm must direct supreme conduct of affair suited very ill with greed selfish ambition of many of military leader primate place in peloponnesian senate be assured having voice in transaction for most part singular unanimity of purpose object being to get a much plunder a possible be not at desire to be superseded in power by deputy chosen from whole of greece until national assembly be formed power be vested in with swift insight cunning to use uglier word rather than creditable passed resolution that deputy to national assembly must be elected by now prince demetrius hypsilantes though weak indecisive altogether incapable of initiative action have at rate in peloponnesian senate power honest upright man will always hold in assembly where ruling motive be personal greed curiously infirm mind clutched like child with bright toy rather at show of power than at power now that development of war with demand for more representative assembly threatened to deprive of that threw in lot with primate captain of morea preferring to retain presidency of peloponnesian senate to be roi mort rather than take subordinate part in national assembly for seemed certain that prince mavrogordatos who have be appointed governor general in northwest greece must be elected president of greece for more than one reason in first place have not a yet shown too patently unfit for office while hypsilantes have in second place peloponnesian senate be far too heavily faction ridden to co elect out of own body except on barest majority against other candidate singly in third unanimously preferred to have a president man who be understood must go back to command in north greece leaving to own control be just equivalent to control at national assembly met at epidaurus in january shouted hoarse over many high sounding declaration loud empty a drum conferred title honor devised banner legislative measure highly colored presented kolocotrones old chieftain leader of enormous disorganized band of brave badly armed men with brass helmet title of commander in chief in morea congratulated on having put thing on firm orderly basis furthermore resolved to take fortress of nauplia without loss of time with effect that in may siege be still going on without prospect of calculable termination mavrogordatos elected president of greece confirmed in command of northwest province went back to duty engaged on series of futile manoeuvre a have acquaintance of kind with military matter ended in disastrous defeat at petta hypsilantes chose new aide de camp in place of mitsos who have departed without leave to gulf of corinth with capsina kolocotrones put on brass helmet went on small marauding expedition returning now then to nauplia to see how siege have got on a man watch pot over slow fire such be main result of great council of epidaurus thus passed day from january to may till may greek fleet be idle though dozen ship at double pay blockaded nauplia by sea in order to prevent relief by turkish fleet one very well knew be still at constantinople on land lower town be in hand of insurgent who however made attempt to take fortress waited for nature in shape of starvation to act unaided petrobey disgusted at appointment of kolocotrones a commander in chief retired with growling mainats into own country to wait till a hoped voice of people must recall if not until one must be appointed commander in chief whom must with honor serve under for kolocotrones so openly said have brought dishonor on greece by disgraceful trafficking with besieged in tripoli be more than brigand chief weighing honor of nation against piaster finding piaster worthier suleima be busy to fro in veranda garden of house one may afternoon hand full a behooved good housewife with woman part littlest one now seven month old be tucked away in cot for mid day sleep under angle of shadow cast by corner of veranda now then suleima must pause in work let eye rest on moment child slept soundly one creased little hand lay on wicker side of cradle pink little nose pointed absurdly to roof be altogether quite adorable said suleima to herself pausing to look with smile of utter happiness went back to work other corner of veranda be covered with wooden tray over of be stretched confining sheet of gauze in tray be spread fresh shoot of mulberry leaf on reposed hundred of silk worm moth of fairer fatter sex busy laying egg a in duty bound must be conceded fulfilling duty with utmost profuseness male smaller rather duller in color fluttered about against gauze walked drone like across leaf taking rude short cut over wife when happened to find estimable woman in way outside gauze on floor of veranda lay tray full of shoot of mulberry leaf eaten bare by brood of young caterpillar already hatched still covered with egg looked like rash of minute gray spot suleima be behindhand with work for egg must have be transferred to mulberry tree before hatched moved quickly backward forward from row of young tree in garden spring have clothed in new gown of green carrying egg laden twig in hand either tied to living shoot where foliage be thicker sudden gust of wind must blow away merely put in middle of growing leaf round tree below lowest output of branch be painted band of lime to prevent caterpillar straying sang gently to herself out of happy heart a moved on errand stopping now then on step from veranda looking out over shining shield of bay towards nauplia with eye eager for ruffling land breeze must bring ship waited for climbing up wave after wave against a man climb ladder rung by rung outside in garden air be still windless tree stood with leaf drooping motionless a if in sleep only near fountain alder whose finer fibre perceived moving air where others let pas unnoticed whispered secretly to spring have be late in coming in day so seemed sun grew warm sluice of mellow air be flung open to flood land from hour to hour anemone little orchid have multiplied by vast system of progression along hill side a star grow populous in heaven at fall of night already suleima red anemone sheltered from north wind by house more forward than fed by thinner soil of moorland be over one blossom only still held full blown petal to suleima seemed thing of good omen that there must be just one left for mitsos on return for morning revenge recognizable by area of canvas vaster than of other ship raking line of bow flying greek flag have be sighted out in gulf from village of tolo heading for nauplia to sea breeze have succeeded dead calm be yet three mile out mirrored in sea a still a ship in picture till land breeze must awake father andra have set off for nauplia after mid day dinner to welcome mitsos home to catch glimpse of capsina afternoon revenge lay dozing on unwrinkled sea there be not breeze enough even to make sail shiver flap must have said wind be dead to capsina mitsos be strange to lie idle thus without even occupation of considering plan for morrow girl at time half hoped that wind must soon come must bring to nauplia part from mitsos half felt that interminable procession of day must be only hour after impossible hour without memory of moment when forgetting suleima indeed yet not remembering except a in hour of victory comrade heart go out to comrade have taken into arm be like devouring thirst made dry soul be too just to blame for fierce exultation of night of battle thunder have be prompted at such time man must kiss man so in other way have kissed have overlooked fact that be woman have be ignorant be woman who loved have returned to minute afterwards to find shy ashamed awkward knew a well a if thought be own what be in lad mind wanted to apologize thinking that might have offended yet hesitated lest might solidify matter for offence perhaps even feared that imagined be thinking so light of a to treat to little love making now capsina felt sure of ancestry so to speak of embrace be not offended knew be not making love to with delicate simpleness almost too straightforward to call tact have entered into conversation with so quickly naturally that be at ease again justice of god difficulty unfairness of that wild fierce joy filled mitsos at sinking of turkish ship be paid for not alone by drowning cry by also heavily have succeeded too well so told in assumption of perfectly natural manner have mitsos sudden action be dictated not by excitement of moment by spasm of heat of man for woman have shown too disregardent have taken too lightly have treated so must have thought a boy who have be merely rude to whose rudeness have overlooked laughed out at thought mitsos raised eyebrow asked what matter for amusement be be alone for christos have be left with cousin at patras now more than week ago have passed gun of lepanto by night after hanging about ready to fight ship if attacked out of range of fort gun for nearly week one evening after sea breeze have failed sudden wind have got up after midnight in obedience to greek proverb say on first of spring wind alone be contrary have sailed out passing close under gun of fort reaching patras before daybreak certainly wind have be divinely punctual for very next day sense said that winter be over march april have be cold rainy smiling sometimes through tear for most part scolding month full of peevish weeping then with early day of may change came primavera scattered flower broadcast over land land breeze be sweet with promise of budding woodland thing bee more than once when be farther than mile from land have flown busy drunken across deck superstitious sailor have told capsina surely very good thing be on way to to day have dined on deck after dinner mitsos in ferment of restlessness at sight of home have gone more than once to side of ship sniffing to find if must smell wind wind yet tarried now have stretched lazy length along deck head supported by coil of rope smoked narghile a talked have just received share of prize money more than hundred pound large sum be weighing on mind when capsina laugh broke in upon meditation roused talking of prize money began be not doing said capsina then let do so now be thus want for be not for came must rather that gave to war fund capsina turned little away played with end of rope lying near then why be came asked unable not to give mitsos opportunity heart knew must not take frowned why why repeated be there not reason enough be not reason justified smiled will make pretty speech to virgin defend said capsina with leaden calmness again shrinking from what have encouraged be absurd little mitsos be to go home to what be name to suleima empty handed have fairing for baby oh suleima want present said mean will be so happy when see that oh saint in heaven broke off then a mitsos stared at with quiet habitual wonder with regarded sudden outburst a common phenomenon think will be so pleased to see will have thought for aught else mitsos blew out great blue cloud of smoke before replied be thus said have suleima be away time what think must have cared what brought so long a brought think yes think be not different with oh men folk make mad cried little mitsos be just exactly like cousin christos may tell be compliment from lip must not understand mind be simply not able to appreciate how be that preferred sea brig michael to marrying 'what more can girl want say to 'than to have husband such a ' indeed think like christos that woman have other wish be woman not human thing because suleima be so fortunate girl a to have great fine mitsos for husband be there nothing else in world can desire capsina brought word out like hammer blow on anvil then went on hurriedly reverting to main topic about money said if wo take a prize money take a wage for indeed think be worth pay though lazy given to tobacco be not dissatisfied with not not a wage for mavromichales say have never accepted wage more fool take a present from doe that offend see doe for make moon crescent of mouth then give to suleima a present from offends still for though make mouth straight nose be in air before god little mitsos be queerest proudest lad have ever seen must have be of clan of capsas that might treat a treated cousin christos to whom be so like word be from own mouth capsina not from moon crescent a be pleased to call where put food capsina flushed ever so slightly ah talk nonsense said quickly do too being woman know be excuse for mitsos took pipe out of mouth made mock bow what capsina doe be good enough for to do said girl smiled back at heart beating little quicker than wont sat for moment silent watching a lounged lazily with down dropped eye stirring up live charcoal burned in bowl of narghile oh be queer people good god have made said be of clan of capsas of mainats never have mainats capsiots gone hunting together before why be made so mainat capsiot for indeed little mitsos be more like clan than christos think if have married christos must have be like others long before day counting egg hen have laid instead of turk have killed cooking supper talking like one of company of silly sparrow in bush why be that one thing happens to not why did meet suleima why voice be little raised tremulous stopped abruptly though silence half strangled seemed unable to exchange ordinary word with without letting sex obtrude if be never to be aught comrade to mitsos must be something at rate to make know how much more be to fierce full blooded nature accustomed to impose will on others to exercise control on if baffled in first respect might at least realize other be hurt day of life hurt at least must cry aloud mood passed in moment mitsos be full of thought of suleima whom must see that evening must think mad worse still must not care must cease even to be comrade to mitsos have not noticed raised voice abrupt breaking off be dimly suspicious that capsina be making metaphysical remark to politeness required answer frowned shook head hopelessly to there being subject of knew le sudden introduction of suleima into question made thing clearer suleima said why did meet oh capsina how must have be otherwise tell that for must not be without oh can not explain for god in wisdom made fool cried puffed away at pipe tobacco be always tobacco remarked capsina justly enough sat in silence while longer then girl got up from where be sitting strolled towards bow of ship pointed up gulf must see ruddy gray side of fortress hill palamede stood up five hundred foot above nauplia town lay out of view behind dark promontory ran rockily out sea be perfectly calm of translucent brilliance clear a precious stone soft a air above fifteen fathom below lay sandy bottom of gulf designed here there like map with brownish purple patch of sea weed between surface poised in water drifted innumerable jelly fish medus shaped like full blown balloon with strange slippery looking string rope trailing below be pink of transparent aqueous green rustily speckled like fritillary flower a in stupor of content drifted on with current of warm water settling into bay now then shoal of quick fish must cross turning wheeling together like flight of bird burnished side glittering in sun steeped water stopping suddenly emblazoned a if heraldically on green field school of gull be fishing behind dipping in out of water for chance fragment from ship mitsos lying at ease on deck with pipe in mouth cap pushed forward to shield eye from sun seemed to excel even jelly fish in content to girl appeared that alone of created thing be of uneasy heart that evening must reach nauplia news of coming must before now have gone about tingled at thought of welcome must get together not only for must shout go up for mitsos with thus sounding with more than double sweetness to ear when shouting acclamation be over must go back to ship mitsos must go to suleima hated girl whom have never seen mixed with hatred be overwhelming curiosity to see mitsos finished pipe got up thoughtfully foot by foot strolled towards where be standing leaning over bulwark be getting impatient for coming of tardy wind judged to be on first page of good manner that must keep impatience private also wanted to let girl know in what admired esteem affection held tongue be knot when sought for word day after day have run same fine risk heart have beat a one in glory of same adventure have laughed fought frolicked like two lad together welcoming came in path yet must not take arm let silence speak for even have never be more ready admirable of resource more ignorant of what fear be more apt suited to more lovable a comrade love have live fighting gift of own sex yet in be woman felt that be worthier of homage that be more unable to pay bare footed step be silent across deck came close to before knew of coming after spitting thoughtfully into water leaning with elbow awkwardness incarnated on bulwark next spoke oh capsina said how good time have have with will make promise if so be be one tenth a satisfied a be if ever again for now a know with siege of nauplia turk coming south duty be here if ever at future time have need of one who hate turk will act a lieutenant cabin boy will if please swim behind ship be fired out of gun will send for for indeed be bravest woman god ever made honor to serve once again a on night joined ship took of cap bent to kiss hand mitsos blurted out word shyly awkwardly in most unrhetorical fashion yet did not speak amiss for spoke from heart capsina stood facing holding hand in hers spoke with heart how near to bursting only knew make that promise said need not even thank for have done oh little mitsos from if must suggest sail ship to hell together fire on satan must help hoist mainsail for indeed be best of boy turned suddenly with quivering lip looked out to sea presently after just before sunset land breeze began to blow ran three mile tack towards far side of gulf from there helped by current sweep into bay made point short mile outside nauplia then standing out again ran short tack not long before dropping of wind cast anchor cable length from quay straight in front rose lower town on side of steep hill pierced with row of light a if hole have be knocked in dark higher up below turkish wall gleamed fire of greek who be besieging place supreme separate like cluster of star hung light at top of palamede news of coming have gone about for blockading ship cheered a passed length of quay be torch lantern hurrying to step where must land growing gathering till seemed one great bouquet of red flower reflected in long snake like line on water a soon a be at anchor capsina mitsos be rowed to shore a neared quay seen clearly in blaze of torch shouting broke out swelled till air seemed thick dense with capsina be first to step out folk crowded round like bee round queen stood still looking back held out hand to mitsos went up step same step up have come from sea sun hand in hand who have never seen knew name only having heard a in old chivalrous tale of wonderful maid who have chased turkish ship like flock of sheep crowded round to catch glimpse of heart be full to brimming with music of acclamation yet touch of mitsos hand be thing more intimate dearer to among first be father andra holding hand of now virgin be praised have come cried oh little mitsos be well surely there be not much amiss said again be well wait for impatiently content said child wait crowd broke way for to pas on surged after a walked in babel of welcome honor pressed forward to touch sophia hand other old friend crowded round mitsos pulling way that kissing almost cry over whisperer whispered gossip made comment eh what pair must have made said one must pull sultan from throne speaker spat on ground at accursed name little mitsos have grown even littler said see what pillar of man too be higher than shoulder be more than will ever be anastasi till god make anew most different look at face too wonder cousin in hydra be loth to lose still hand in hand two passed on to mariner church on quay where a in duty bound offered thanks alms to name patron for safe coming having finished prayer stood for moment silent at church door will not sail to morrow asked mitsos will come see home may not come for in boat in morning sophia hesitated moment no can not come said sail to hydra to morrow for too smiled at naturally too have home surely will be together again if will if report of turk moving south be not true will want by sea speedily kanaris lad turk will not be very pleased to see again so good bye little mitsos get home without word turned from went back to ship mitsos way lay eastward through lower town many tried to make stop awhile tell of big deed yes to morrow must cry oh dear folk let go have fairly to run from moon have risen familiar homeward road stretched like white ribbon in front of bay lay in shining sleep from marsh came ecstatic croaking of frog thought that have stayed so long in one marsh made mitsos smile from white poplar came song of love thrilled nightingale white owl hovered hooted passed now then breeze must blow softly across vineyard laden with warm odor of spring smell of growing thing went quickly for heart desire be spur to stayed not till came to garden gate ere yet have lifted latch suleima have knowledge of coming met love have for other brimmed very soul chapter x town of nauplia lie on north side of tortoise shaped promontory of land swimming splay fashion out into gulf upper part of surrounded by wall of venetian fortification be held by turk lower part including quay by insurgent greek behind town away from sea rose rock on be built fortress palamede sharp supreme jagged like flash of lightning also in turkish hand flight of steep break neck step blasted in many place out of solid rock lying in precipitous zigzag communicated by mean of well defended narrow passage battlemented loopholed with citadel of town proper south side of promontory needed little watching for man must find way down crag imminently threatened to topple over into sea on west water gate communicated with narrow strip of land giving into willow water of bay where anchorage be possible on north lower town be in hand of greek whose line of beleaguer stretched from western end of quay to base of palamede on east only outlet be small gate in passage leading between palamede citadel now nauplia be one of strongest in present state of affair quite most important fortress in peloponnese still in hand of turk communicated with main artery of war in country harbor be well sheltered defended by town must give admirable anchorage to fleet of europe sultan mahomed with quick statesmanlike sagacity have seen that effort must centre on retention in turkish hand with nauplia securely must at will continue to pour fresh troop into country there must be one end to war have greek acted with singleness of purpose most moderate promptitude after fall of tripolitza in previous october nauplia might have be taken without difficulty let slip opportunity instead distributed honor title banner token thing to make more patriotic dead turn in graf turk be in possession of well watered fortress have only to hold out till fleet relieved by sea army under command of serashier dramali have received order to march straight to nauplia at end of rhamazan drove off besieger april in plain be somewhat rainless may unseasonably hot though spring in fortress did not run dry yet torrid weather made felt in garrison of sun scorched palamede fleet a be known must set out in may dramali must leave zeituni where be encamped in first week of july by end of july therefore relief must be certain in greek line much cheerfulness nonchalant good humor prevailed during april turk have made two sortie be repulsed with little loss to besieger at heavy price to besieged latter now seemed inclined to wait for relief trusting to admirable fortification defended certain growing slackness on part of besieger rather than make attempt hypsilantes excellent field marshal when there be nothing to do treated chief with courtly condescension frequently entertained at dinner while kolocotrones with new brass helmet hearty raucous voice went hither thither often leaving camp for week at time on private raid swelled strutted already with anticipation of plentiful plunder for greek considered own ship a adequate to stop fleet sultan might send from constantinople thought impossible that garrison must hold out until coming of army mitsos truant aide de camp chiefly conspicuous hitherto by absence reported morning after return to prince hypsilantes who taking into consideration what capsina have done be pleased to accept lack of excuse poverty of invention with graciousness further gave furlough for week on granting of lad posted back to suleima silkworm that evening when child be gone to bed father andra have charged to see that nothing caught fire that changeling fairy vague phantom terror dreaded abhorred of suleima soul malignantly visited cradle of littlest two went off for old sake sake in boat mitsos with fishing spear resin to visit dark dear place of bay land breeze be steady moon already swung high among star from afar must see white wall that knew a passed suleima clung closer to mitsos how strange seems said to think be there year after year not knowing of old abdul eunuch oh pig of pit zuleika others now be where in hell said mitsos promptly with cheerfulness of unutterable welcome conviction yanni sent abdul there at tripoli oh fat man cheek be of red jelly must say forever wobbling pray may never be jelly man suleima laughed yet there be good thing even in abdul though not of intention age rather said for instance be very calm lazy let do a liked never troubled indeed think hardly spoke to six time yet have be there year longer who know for latterly used to look at with mole eye mitsos frowned speak of said sharply be in hell even for be enough for enough be not little tacked out to sea again after passing white wall for be going across to sandy bay where mitsos used to fish nauplia with fire of besieger besieged gleamed like low cluster of star at mouth of bay island with old venetian castle on stood up black blot against glittering company towards tripoli hill be clear black cut out with exquisite precision of southern night now then from town sudden roar soft muffled with travel over water must rise die away again for most part only whisper of severed water tap gurgle of wavelet crushed by bow broke silence then putting to land mitsos with spear light poked among rock for fish while suleima sat on warm dry sand watching seemed to that romance of wooing be not yet over to beleaguered garrison of nauplia scorching day dewless unrefreshing night went by in hot procession by middle of june though greek be not aware besieged knew that unless relief came within few day surrender be imminent remembering in what fashion greek have kept treaty of navarin have little confidence in observation of term of capitulation might make remembering too scene of traffic what germanos with bitter truth have called market of tripoli hoped that life might be spared perhaps until approach of army if stipulated that until capitulation be finally signed must be supplied with food by besieger though at famine price now ali governor of aryos being supreme in argolis be superior of selim commander in nauplia a there be possibility of conferring with ali through greek line proposed draft of treaty of capitulation have to be drawn out by be shrewd man busy cunning term proposed showed that have not failed to intimately acquaint with character of chief who besieged place accordingly one day in last week of june mitsos who have returned to duty a aide de camp came to hypsilantes saying that white flag be flying over northern gate that turkish commander wished to confer with head of greek army now at time kolocotrones be absent from nauplia with large band of irregular troop in absence since nothing have previously occurred during siege demanded strength in hand thought in head hypsilantes have always be given supremacy of courtesy in virtue of original mission from hetairia that business must have occurred while kolocotrones be away though without doubt if when latter came back found fault with what hypsilantes have done must revoke act be honey to prince who still clutched at show of power so calling together other chief member of national assembly intimated to what have happened in beautiful language mitsos be forthwith sent with flag of truce in hand to conduct selim to hypsilantes selim be brisk lively little person who conducted conversation must say more by series of birdlike intelligible chirrupings than by human talk more abstemious in ordinary life than countryman have suffered le from sparing ration have be on for last fortnight gate be opened a soon a mitsos approached selim came trotting out a pleased with flag of truce a child with new toy twittered away to mitsos a went back to hypsilantes quarter with utmost vivacity in rather imperfect greek be pleasant indeed said just to take walk down street again even if highness can come to term be sent back like hen into infernal cage though indeed be little fattening get there how old may be how long have be rebel to majesty looked up sharp quick in mitsos face like canary lad smiled at ever since beginning of war said indeed may have seen fine blaze cousin made not so far from here what ship be burned going out of harbor asked selim did that miwillah if meet again not under flag of truce there will be high blow a mitsos laughed outright be so merry said must reach up a far a big chest of yours send sword home what must be doing while asked mitsos whistling tune looking other way little man frowned maybe must have have poke at too be not denying hypsilantes other member of assembly then at nauplia be awaiting arrival consisted of two primate greedy mischievous men poniropoulos who have be turned out of camp at tripoli for intrigue with besieged whom affinity of interest have ingratiated with kolocotrones have like others collected together corp of savage undisciplined men who be too large factor in army to leave unrepresented in assembly in addition there be couple of other captain worse better than selim have known very well with whom be to deal proposal be greeted by eye gleamed with prospect of speedy ample gain here be offer how correctly calculated eye bore witness that turk must surrender fortress arm two third of movable property that greek must give safe conduct out of place further hire neutral vessel must convey to asia minor that greek must supply with provision till vessel be ready upon clause of capitulation must be put into effect that hostage must be given on side for fulfilment of treaty thus for time siege of nauplia be at end market of nauplia began selim made offer withdrew there be little need of for be scarce out of room when whisper nod of perfect comprehension went round chief being immediately recalled be told that proposal be accepted will see said hypsilantes with grand air arrangement for ship to convey away be put in hand at once meantime poniropoulos interrupted may have highness permission said with great hurry of politeness to supply citadel with bread certainly said hypsilantes not seeing man meaning be well to put too in hand at once selim be sharper leered at poniropoulos if canary can be said to leer with twinkle of perfect comprehension in eye doubt chirped very clearly loud bread be most expensive in nauplia poniropoulos scowled at for have meant that must be very expensive indeed so term be accepted hypsilantes parted in dignified manner from turk latter went back to citadel poniropoulos with hand itching for touch of gold took prompt characteristic measure went straight to nearest baker bought whole of bread have in stock staying only to haggle over few piaster in total not caring even to go back to quarter for own beast hired mule hurried up path with plying stick to citadel baker anastasi mitsos friend stood for moment wondering what be in wind when solution struck being man born with two eye wide open saw that there be large profit to be made here reason why belly a called poniropoulos must be monopolist therein running out conferred with other baker in town be unanimously merrily agreed that bread sold directly indirectly to belly must be at just three time price of bread sold to others that if did not satisfy why might make bread be damned to news spread rapidly must hardly have failed to spread for before hour be up camp presented dignified spectacle of various captain primate bargaining arguing over wine olive with shop folk literally racing other to citadel where sold produce at starvation rate laughing to that kolocotrones at rate be out of mitsos who be buying fish in market for be pointing out to shopman impropriety of selling stale fish to man with nose when primate caralambes came in to buy fish must find mitsos grinning evilly be fish must have bought said be not so fresh make present of will get five piaster for above for use of church kolocotrones returned after few day entirely approved of term hypsilantes be engaged in usual finicking dilatory manner upon hiring ship for embarkation of turk according to treaty kolocotrones told that need trouble more about that a must see to be thus that saw to three ship have be already engaged dismissed with certain compensation saying that must not be needed turned from hiring of ship to more immediate lucrative pursuit of selling provision to half starved ship must be hired afterwards then there be penny to be turned in matter of passage money longer traffic went on better be side pleased for turk day brought arrival of relief force nearer day captain reaped golden harvest there must be time so thought kolocotrones to see about getting ship when new army drew nearer in case treaty of capitulation held for turk when ship be ready be bound to deliver over fortress arm two third of movable property again captain licked lip meantime end of rhamazan have come kanaris who with capsina have joined greek fleet in eastern sea have paid turk visit must cause always to remember rhamazan greek fleet under admiral miaulis have encountered enemy off chios latter have retreated to gulf of smyrna there have engaged greek in desultory ineffectual cannonade for day two greek not venturing in under gun of fort protected fleet turk not caring to sail out give battle in eventually greek retreated to psara turk again anchored off chios six mile from entrance to gulf of smyrna last day of rhamazan gala preparation went forward on board ship for solemn celebration of bairam before night fell watcher be stationed on main top of fleet to look for first appearance of new moon be beginning of feast a sun went down line of bright colored lantern designed with light rigging of ship more conspicuous most bedecked being eighty gun ship of captain pasha kara ali who entertained for feast chief officer of fleet deck be house of syrian tent awning troop of dancing girl be in waiting to amuse guest a salute to end of rhamazan ten minute before sunset gun of fleet volleyed again again till air be thick with smoke of firing then a last echo died away for space there be silence while waited for word suddenly from mast head be cried moon moon of bairam jubilant cry wailing mournful to western ear be taken up by throat on board flag ship of kara ali waited standing at place at table till word be cried at reclined feast began now many have noticed none have thought noticeable that day there have lain close to entrance of gulf of smyrna a if unable to get in two small greek ship a soon a dusk fell movement be obscured changed course carried of cargo of brushwood soaked with turpentine sail be steeped with same kanaris straw in mouth for must not with safety smoke on fire ship commanded one albanian hydiot other wind held fair kanaris went straight for ship of kara ali favored by land breeze blowing freshly off coast towards bow of ship be pointing ran bowsprit straight through port a near bow a possible set light to ship with own hand jumped into boat be towed behind in moment flame leaped licking from stem to stern of caique driven by wind mounted like flicked whiplash up sail in at open port awning on quarter deck caught fire being dry from exposure to hot sun day burned like timber kanaris having exchanged straw for pipe rowed back to safe distance watched destruction of ship with habitual calm will burn nicely now said saw few boat launched into poured so hurried panic flight of men woman that be overloaded sank other escape there be none for flame driving inward with roaring a of bull in spring rendered impossible to reach seat of fire from overhead block be falling from rigging when boat began to arrive from other ship of fleet heat of flame fierce licking tongue shot out at rendered impossible to approach ship with on board excepting only few who jumped overboard be picked up perished kara ali a be putting off in small boat be struck on head by falling spar died before reached shore now sultan order have be curt have sent for kara ali before fleet set out removing jewelled mouth piece moment from lip said to nauplia kosreff succeeds if there be disaster have leave to go put mouth piece back into mouth again turned back on kara ali now kosreff be at patras having be in charge of western fleet autumn before captain of other vessel have little choice left be bound to nauplia there be admiral be clearly part to pick up admiral at patras then go back to nauplia there be always little uncertainty in acting under sultan mahomed a to what be right thing to do if man did wrong thing be not at uncertain what consequence must be one felt at inclined to take on responsibility of handling fleet when sultan have signified that kosreff be to do so next day fleet weighed anchor set off for patras leaving nauplia to take care of till return now serashier dramali commander of land army be in receipt of order just a peremptory be to wait at zeituni till end of rhamazan then a soon a horse according to immemorial custom have eaten green barley of fresh crop be to go straight to nauplia where must overwhelm defeat greek force besieging by land there too must meet sultan fleet must drive off greek ship throw provision into town such attack if delivered according to order said sultan with somewhat sinister stress on word if must not conceivably fail of success now executive government of greece be so busy mismanaging hundred unimportant affair that have left one thing needful quite undone landforce of dramali passed without opposition right through eastern greece reached on th of july isthmus of corinth here acro corinth be in hand of greek defended only by small guard for place be impregnable on side one well supplied with provision water commander named theodrides sooner saw long line of brilliant turkish cavalry beginning to deploy on plateau below fortress marked infantry mounting steep ascent to gate than sort of panic fear unjustified though knew indeed nothing of military matter seized gave order that turkish prisoner in town must be murdered led way out of fortress by almost impracticable path to east with gallant band made for mountain spreading news that turk be in number a sand fly in august then without blow acro corinth fell into dramali hand have long held valor of greek in unmerited contempt since started from zeituni seemed that contempt be not so ill deserved a marched through narrow gorge of locris doris not hand have be raised to stop on hill north of corinth guard have fled at approach here at corinth at sight of troop fortress nigh impregnable have be given up a if by tenant whose lease have expired to incomer fleet supposed must meet at nauplia without delay decided to push on with whole army there leaving only small garrison in corinth pointed contemptuously to murdered prisoner look said that be dog do have madness will be done by a have done indeed seemed that contempt be very well merited main road from corinth to nauplia through argo lie up long hill side passing at length into barren mountainous region set with gray bowlder only peopled with lizard thence gaining top of considerable ridge lie for space of five mile so in narrow downward ravine called dervenaki before emerges into plain of argo riotous water passed down road cross recrosses by hundred bridge sometimes lying close to torrent at others climbing hazardously up flank of ravine on hand hill side rise bowldersown steep too near precipitous to let large tree get grip of soil between gray stone grew only aromatic herb of mountain even hawk eagle looking from aloft for prey with eye must spy even mouse in crevice cut not swinging circle in sky above for living thing except quick lizard find food there three other road besides le direct crossed hill between corinth argo two to east westward one through dervenaki dramali marched rapidly found altogether unguarded scout who made cast to east west reported that other road be clear also at dramali contempt began to breed want of caution instead of occupying nemea aghionores village commanded two of other road leaving troop to keep pas communication with corinth open went straight on with whole army through hill on into plain of argo meantime at nauplia argo supreme government have continued to display imbecility usual with ali of argo have be allowed to enter fortress of nauplia though without provision arm have at once arrested greek secretary who be registering property of turk greek have taken no step to secure ship for embarkation of turk have consequently failed to do part of treaty greek hostage retained a pledge for turkish hostage in hand of greek for rest supposed that turkish fleet must arrive from day to day dramali knew have reached corinth must push on at once member of central government of greece be at time at argo where be chiefly employed in promoting other unanimously to various lucrative appointment causing what called national archive to be written record of valor of of judicious statesmanship of others remainder among such business have just appointed prince hypsilantes to be president of legislative board made quantity of regulation about prevention of punishment of crime in new greek republic enjoyed handsome salary hypsilantes who have wit sufficient to see only object be to deprive of military command be still debating what course to take sitting about time of sunset in veranda of house looked towards dervenaki when observed quantity of little bright speck issuing therefrom being not natural phenomenon looked again speck redoubled at that got up with smile fancy legislative measure will wait said to went across to council chamber where minister be already assembling for purpose of mutual appointment went to place bowed pointed out of window must draw attention to gentleman said for moment there be silence then babel of confused incoherent cry went up from terror stricken lip of legislative executive board metaxas consummate lawyer be first to run from room koletres unequalled in knowledge of conveyancing called lamentably on virgin followed at stroke on scent of danger red tape rule grabbing greed called patriotism banished fled minister senator lawyer what not ran incontinently to take refuge on few greek vessel lay opposite argo alarm spread like east wind in march through town woman child with bundle of property snatched hastily up rushed out in direction to find safety with blockading greek at nauplia in neighboring village others in mountain many fugitive from town on coast turk have sacked be in place remembering red horror from have lately escaped with bare life left behind scanty remains of property like rabbit remorselessly ferreted from one burrow to fled in wildest confusion encamped in square crowding poorer quarter be horde of camp follower who have be drawn here by prospect of fall of nauplia wild men of mountain attended by great sheep dog almost le savage than being of able body for most part unencumbered by family property very willing to become encumbered with latter spent fruitful hour while turkish troop be still creeping from entrance of dervenaki across plain in plundering house of wealthier citizen who have abandoned preferring to make sure escape than to risk for sake of good among others secretary of state theodore negris bibliophile gave thought to small library of valuable book have brought with to argo supposing that seat of government must be there if not permanently yet for considerable time laconian camp follower entering house after flight unwilling to leave behind what might be of value packed most of book in sack slung over stolen horse horse fell lame man wishing to push on to hill thought lucky to sell book lameness for two dollar to greek officer who be in need of animal to carry water for troop at lerna night fell on scene of panic confusion last of sunset have shown van of turk more than four mile off with arm glistening red in fire of evening sky moving steadily though without advance guard of cavalry be already clear of pas after interval main part of army have be seen defiling out of must enter town in not more than two hour one with horse to sell pistol to protect must sell beast for value told hundred time mule ox even calf be laden with valuable kicked goaded along road away from quarter from turk be advancing have executive council possessed slightest authority power of organization much of wild struggle for escape must have be avoided executive council be hurrying like scared hare down to where couple of greek ship lay in bay there too be disgraceful thing to see more than one boat sent to convey fugitive on to ship be swamped by stampeding crowd others private speculator refused to take panic stricken folk on board except at payment of thirty piaster per head in one case only be revolting greed properly punished for couple of men having agreed to pay stipulated sum be taken on board straightway tipped owner over own gunwale into water heedless of bubbling remonstrance filled boat with fugitive denying place in spent next two hour in plying to fro between ship land meantime greek garrison at argo consisting mainly of albanian have behaved with utmost quietness decency waited for order hypsilantes be known have be summoned by terror stricken council to join in new capacity of legislator on ship have returned answer that must do such thing place be where must be useful a soon a alarm be given with mitsos in attendance kolocotrones niketas few others met deliberated hastily what to do be quickly decided to destroy grain forage in town a be impossible to stand siege fill up well retire to lerna heavy small greek camp two mile off on sea coast defended on one side by mountain on one by sea on by large belt of swampy ground cavalry must not well pas turk must hardly go on to nauplia leaving unattacked in rear if on other hand attacked lerna be well defended dreaded turkish cavalry at least be useless above argo just outside town stand larissa old greek fortress subsequently built up by venetian hill crown be very steep difficult of access be well supplied with water be matter of first importance that must not be let to fall a have happened at corinth into hand of turk small body of volunteer among whom be mitsos threw into determining to hold a long a possible what artillery turk have did not know unless have heavy field gun there be reasonable hope that for time at rate must defend successfully be deterrent to turkish advance on nauplia meantime while be busy taking up a much provision a must lay hand on rest set to with destroying forage generally making place untenable until picket stationed at corinth gate gave alarm that turk be near at who be to keep larissa set off through now deserted silent street for new camp at lerna through hot hour of summer night seemingly endless procession of turk continued to enter argo one by one watch cooking fire be kindled until town empty hour before twinkled with light dramali troop numbered not le than ten thousand men nearly half of whom be cavalry at present intended to keep formidable force at argo until fleet appeared must bring provision supply to nauplia by sea must then make simultaneous assault by land a sultan have so curtly intimated establish headquarters there until fleet arrived must hing might help nauplia for have to forage for own supply must throw none into beleaguered fortress fleet will be remembered have already passed nauplia going to patras to fetch new captain pasha kosreff in place of victim of kanaris fire ship of dramali knew nothing waited for appearance to deliver grand coup in manner prescribed to at constantinople news of taking of argo by turk have blazed like stubble fed fire through peloponnese incompetent useless administration have gathered skirt fled war once more be in hand of people commanded might be by many avaricious greedy men by coward a thunder cloud collect on grilling afternoon on hill so from side did sullen band full of potential fire tumult gather grow on mountain round to attack turk with great force of cavalry on plain be sane scheme lesson have be taught at tripoli taught thoroughly though attack be made on turk be soon found that dramali with heaven sent stupidity have neglected to hold range of hill over have come gradually greek amassed force high on four road crossed from corinth niketas with not le than two thousand men be intrenched in easternmost road murmured softly to word have learned from english sailor be dam fine kolocotrones finding lerna inconveniently crowded removed to mountain to west of argo waited wild beast hungry for time party personal jealousy ceased petrobey with thousand mainats came from south joined greek force assembled in main camp scornful clan be noticed be very silent a habit be when there be work to fore have long conference with hypsilantes to council came krevatas primate from country of sparta man made of blood courage hatred who must go about among soldier seeing vision by day night exclaiming lord be man of war have little other conversation cried thus very frequently like hypsilantes petrobey saw that there be object to be served in attacking turk in argo supposing fleet came dramali moved to capture of nauplia must have to attack then if on other hand something a be now possible have delayed fleet be certain that dramali supply must not last very many day for turk be foraging far wide for corn provender for horse when retreated to corinth a must need do fleet not coming there be hill have left unguarded to be passed petrobey blue eye danced like sun on water krevali exclamation be fit commentary twice in first day of occupation dramali directed attack on small band of five hundred men in larissa finding that be easy matter to storm thinking perhaps that place be ill watered defender must surrender shrugged shoulder left a greek have left nauplia to slower not le sure process of starvation petrobey saw immense strategical advantage of place dramali must hardly advance to nauplia leaving well fortified citadel in rear into greek must pour a soon a left argo insisted that garrison must be increased may be a fierce a hawk a swift said number be too small also if can throw men into can also throw provision lad mitsos will be glad of that must eat roe deer a eat egg at one gulp yanni who be with father looked up oh if be possible let go among said for place be with mitsos petrobey of whose son have be killed that year in skirmish looked at boy benjamin too said half smiling half with entreaty yet did not come back safe to father so be yanni now let talk how be to be done will go on dear nikolas plan say impossible thing so take what be left daylight said yanni promptly great noise remarked hypsilantes with air of man who say good thing petrobey laughed so much be certain said then come difficulty if by night a like a not lad will think be attack from turk thus will benjamin come home shot through head by very dear friend mitsos can not call to a approach said yanni wait oh father can not signal during day from hill behind petrobey nodded not so bad said of men there who know signal tongue mitsos did signalling work at tripoli so did be worth trying now attention of turk on night enter if signalling go well enter do must be elsewhere perhaps highness must conduct skirmishing party with much noise bush firing swift running away in opposite quarter asked prince sudden glow of courage exalted man must sooner be of who attempt to enter larissa petrobey looked at approvingly be honorable service said larissa be steep hill then will see to other now yanni off with nice warm walk will have get to hill behind larissa signal till attract attention until arm drop off like fig over ripe be yet early so say that relief party will make attempt to enter citadel to night hour before moonrise will climb back of hill wherever find unguarded inside will know best disposition of turkish troop hour went on through suffocating calm of mid day when breeze stir still stifling air greek camp at lerna lying against mountain side be bakehouse of heat in low marshy ground below among vineyard melon patch stretched down to bay must see company of turkish soldier guarded by cavalry picking grape leaf a fodder for horse while men gathered only half ripe fruit for once band of fifty approached to within five hundred yard of outwork have be thrown up round mill where greek lay mainats on guard snarled grumbled like caged lion who long to smite crack head of who look through prison bar cavalry be too close to risk attack must have ended in trampled flight knifing must only store up hate for future use on other hand greek be equally secure for broken ground near camp intersected by channel bank for irrigation further defended by steep water eaten bank of torrent bed of erastinus now summer dry rendered approach of turkish cavalry impossible combined attack of dramali infantry must have be necessary to drive out of secure position attack dramali must not afford to make object of expedition be relief of nauplia until be effected dared not risk defeat several small skirmish have indeed taken place petrobey pursuing policy of keeping men out of reach of cavalry have always forbade to follow retreating turk into open ground furthermore two greek vessel moored not far off covered open space be near bay across turk must advance in case of massed attack be ready to open fire on meantime petrobey though burning to be at work found certain shrewd comfort in watching turk eating unripe melon be cool for mouth said burning fire in bowel indeed before many day sort of dysentery broke out among turkish troop added to difficulty hazard in a dramali be soon to find have placed army kolocotrones have left lerna to take up position on hill before petrobey with mainats arrived be to below outlying post of camp that yanni climbed to signal to in larissa day be extraordinarily hot way lay over long palpitating flank of gray bowlder covered hill there vegetation have long ago be shrivelled into brown ashy wisp of stuff though up higher near point to be making spring gushed from mountain side still flushed acre two of cup shaped hollow below with living vegetation great green lizard alone seemed not to have be turned brown by drought slipped pattering over bowlder into crack crevice a yanni passed overhead sky be brazen wilderness deserted of bird air over hot mountain trembled throbbed in ague of heat went fast very cheerfully carried arm for turk never went beyond plain be healthier heat to walk just in linen trouser shirt open from neck to waist than to lie sweltering in guard under arm in camp at hill of lerna hour climb gave elevation sufficient to be able to see over outer circuit of wall on larissa show sun browned top of hill peopled with tiny living moving speck of garrison who held below base of hill line of turkish tent formed circuit nearly complete at back where rock rose almost precipitously there be break in whether hill be accessible not at point did not know evidently turk seemed to think not if succeeded in attracting attention of greek in citadel must learn from where be best place to make attempt have brought with strip of linen for signalling finding distance be greater than anticipated saw that must be too insignificant object to be noticed stripping off shirt made wild waving with signalling again again mitsos mitsos codones for five minute stood there with sun scorching uncovered shoulder like hot iron without attracting attention before very much longer saw little white speck from top of citadel also waving must seem with purpose oh mitsos be said aloud then repeated mitsos a signal waited little speck answered yes be mitsos said who be yanni laughed with delight yanni waved cousin yanni have clan come many okes of under father be going to send party to support in citadel to night hour before moonrise be ready there be pause yanni forgetting that be rather over mile off shouted out do see little mitsos then laughed at soon waving began again can hold place think be short of food yanni answered oh fat cousin bring much food where will make attempt from back between where be standing be steep quite possible for not old fat be where see turkish tent who be in command hypsilantes be laughing waved mitsos for see big sword tripping up go very silently if alarm be given turk attack will help from above good bye yanni be dinner time littlest dinner ever saw put on shirt again seeing that kolocotrones outpost be not more than two hundred foot above though concealed from where stood by spur of rock bethought to go up there get drink of wine before began downward journey for throat be a dust ash also give notice of intended relief found that kolocotrones be there be taken to that brave avaricious man be short of stature of very strong make gnarled knotted like oak trunk face be burned to shrivelled being by sun wore fine brass helmet unlike petrobey who be scrupulously fastidious in matter of clothes cleanliness food cared not at for thing of body be holding mutton bone in manner of flute to mouth gnawing piece off when yanni entered old chief remembered at tripoli though be on most distant term with clan who regarded with embarrassing frankness a successful brigand nodded kindly to boy eat drink said talk will come afterwards must have torn shred of meat off flute surely will drink said yanni seating for indeed be thirsty work to stand in sun nothing to eat thank kolocotrones poured out wine into rather dirty glass when boy have drank what be forward asked be of maina come thousand of to night be sending relief force to in citadel have be signalling to mitsos with shirt from hill side now when money be not in question kolocotrones be most enthusiastic of patriot there be certainly nothing to be got from citadel dropped mutton flute struck table great blow with hand be very good said compliment to clan to petrobey lad have turk in hollow of hand fleet still come not without fleet how will relieve nauplia where already besieged purchase food from besieger can not hold argo more than week now for here too food be failing then will try to get back to corinth hill be guarded will be there for oh will be there where must of be without old kolocotrones to think for ay act for when time come yanni be half amused half offended at arrogance of old chief took great draught of wine bitter stuff a petrobey said that fellow care nothing for what eats save that must be meat nothing for what drink save that must be wet then answer why did god give palate kolocotrones took chew at mutton bone tilted back helmet little showing bald forehead panos son panos will be with continued lad will chase like sheep kill like chicken also there will be much gold eye grew small bright like bird yanni scornful young nose be in air by time manner forbade saying just what thought of panos rose to go be cooler said le dusty in throat will be going back indeed think must have paid weight for weight in gold for wine wish have chuckled kolocotrones whose humor be of most direct be free gift lad grudge yanni saluted retired once out of camp executed sort of war dance of scorn down mountainside free gift muttered free gift indeed what else must draught of sour wine be thank god be of maina not of stock must sooner keep khan than be that general pasty son yanni bursting with indignation went scrambling down mountain side thinking how fine be to be mavromichales arrangement for relief party be not long in making petrobey a soon a night fell be to lead band of mainats towards southeast of argo uneven tract of ground full of bush marsh much intersected by dike where cavalry must not be utilized against be to advance a close a safely might to gate of town fire run away come back fire generally give color to idea that noisy badly planned attack be being delivered from quarter effect of must be to make enemy alert watchful of movement in direction in case eye ear must not be too keen on larissa be quite on opposite side of town order be given that if be pursued in number must run away scattering a went return again keep up disturbance till moon rose by rising of moon relief party must already have made good entrance into fortress unless have be repulsed there be longer necessity for others to dance about like will o ' wisp in marsh must be dark by nine moon did not rise till midnight so that others must have ample time to cross two mile of plain lay between larissa in cover of dark do best relief party consisting of between four five hundred mainats be nominally under command of hypsilantes yanni alone having seen from mountain lay of ground on far side of larissa alone knowing disposition of turkish blockading line there be to act a guide object of expedition being in main to get supply into fortress took with flock of goat carefully muzzled so that must not bleat to other on back of goat be hamper of loaf quite like little men on journey said yanni round beast men marched in sort of hollow oblong thus forming pen for when came near line of turk small reconnoitring party be to be sent on to see if steep rock be practicable unguarded if so must make dash for dragging two three goat with once past turkish line must unmuzzle so that others hearing bleat might follow be impossible to take sheep for way up rock though practicable for men therefore for goat might not be so for le nimble animal whole expedition striking irregularity hazard remoteness from anything commonplace be after heart of clan grinned to other a goat with luggage strung on back be driven into living pen door formed up between have to go slowly for leading retention of beast be not very easy before have marched mile heard shout begin from opposite quarter of town knew that petrobey party have got to dancing soon black gigantic wall loomed nearer sharp cut against blue black of star sown sky halted behind bluff of upstanding rock while yanni others moved forward to examine ground hundred yard farther on got good view of turkish camp fire so that must tell roughly disposition of troop here halted in council be even a mitsos said whispered yanni there be great gap in line be doubt where steep rock came into plain said man must climb there told prince be coming at laughed thinking must trip up will do kostas mavromichales brother of petrobey shook with suppressed laughter assault of goat said oh very fine plan thought of be about four hundred yard from turkish line ground evilly for purpose be level without cover more speedily be passed better gap in line be about three hundred yard in width immediately above rock began once there one must find own path leader dragging forward unmuzzled goat two to encourage others be agreed that kostas yanni must take one between athanasi dimitri second two other mainats third whispered arrangement made hurried back to others gave what have seen six goat dragger be to be in first line who a soon a reached rock must take off muzzle then climb scramble on a fast a might be if be seen heard before got close up to line be very unlikely must be able to get in at for passed wit of man to fight drive goat simultaneously be worse than useless to get in without goat for thus there must be more mouth to feed nought to feed with so with goat not at be order ground be hard with long heat moved forward a silently a possible accompanied a went by sharp swift pattering of goat foot drumming like distant tattoo to right left of twinkled row of fire straight ahead where rock went up there be sheer untenanted blackness marched quickly man besides looking to own step have to give eye to goat nearest carrying musket horizontally at full length of arm formed useful though rough barrier already be between line of camp fire black rock be close ahead when report of musket sounded from left bullet from one sighted gun sang above head voice shouted turkish something at yanni paused with knife cut string muzzle of one of goat catch hold of other horn uncle kostas whispered run pinch devil make talk holy virgin if be dumb goat pinch oh pinch yanni gave great tweak to goat ear a ran forward dragging beast bleated lamentably loud meantime other two goat have be served in like manner made shrill remonstrance herd passed on through opening made in front rank after sufferer oh be done panted yanni here be rock good god be steep by hind leg uncle lift so have got prize goat think there be shot will be up before sentry have given alarm other men opened out little still forming barrier to right left of herd to prevent straying till gained rock then went up hand over hand on face of cliff face of hill though steep be firm reliable with good hold for hand foot in few minute mainats be scattered over ascent men black almost invisible against dark cliff dappling of trotting goat only showing vaguely uncertainly below in turkish line must see men stirring few shot be fired at hindmost of so swift have be passage so scattered climbing of rock that be already in higher bluff before turk realized what have happened from above ahead came heart broken bleatings be mitsos since sun went down have be peering into darkness over citadel wall hearing shot supposed that relief party be passing turkish line that alarm be given immediately heard bleatings of goat like turk saw only moving company of gray speck party be ready to make sortie a there be few shot waited be undoubtedly remarked in what fashion be coming went down to gate looking through window of chamber saw speck coming nearer before long foremost be close shouted yanni from darkness yanni found just enough breath to shout yes yes open gate come on brute mitsos grinned thinking that word be to surely little yanni will be sore to night said to with two others unbarred gate next moment yanni kostas rushed through struggling panting with horn of mishandled goat frightened pattering herd poured after other men have kept behind beast to right left be shepherding a soon a last have passed in gate be closed again yanni flung on ground utterly blown too exhausted to notice mitsos never again oh never panted will drag goat up larissa so ask oh will burst mitsos have broken into roar of hopeless laughter be taken up by hungry garrison while yanni be recovering rest herded goat together again ration of bread be given out few goat killed then having secured great chunk of bread came back to yanni who be sitting up still rather breathless kostas with fat red face have not yet reached convalescence lay large palpitating on ground yanni oh little yanni said mitsos be one joy to see goat too be miracle of plan yanni when did come will sleep with to night oh there be prince mitsos stood up saluted prince with twinkling eye for be deserter prince face be in patch of red white comical to irreverent breath whistled untunefully in throat a drew mitsos fetched piece of sacking to sit on stood respectfully by a paused to get breath aide de camp said prince at last smiling have to come to a persisted in going away from be undeniably statement of case mitsos waited little sheepishly prince continued will look over said getting up even second time for indeed little mitsos must have made legislator of for have call ability therefor inclination must rather be with people show please where can sleep give first water for be tired a thirsty a sand with climbing rock eh have done finer work to night than ever did in council of senate mitsos soon found quarter for hypsilantes of roughest to be sure be curious to to see how prince took sort of childlike pleasure in having to sleep in shed on heap of sacking with crust of bread little very tough goat flesh draught of water for supper face quite lighted up at thought that be playing soldier in earnest be better than sword medal mitsos said a latter brought food there will be no more honor decoration for from for indeed there be help in thing must have done better by scrambling up rock dragging goat with others from first listen at lad singing must sing too for lightness of heart have god given note of music in throat mitsos left went out to find yanni whom have not seen since taking of tripoli mainats have fraternized most warmly with other part of garrison be lounging leaning together on wall looking towards argo when mitsos came out moon have not yet risen party under petrobey be still out on far side of town sky have brightened with approach of moonrise though plain lay still sombre featureless except where flash of musket drew line of fire across dark like match scratched not lit bay have caught gathering grayness of sky lay like sheet of dull silver across water light of nauplia looked like huge constellation of star growing red to setting in town below must see that turk be on alert little patch of men a small slow a insect now then crossed street lay stretched out below hurrying towards southeastern gate goat relieved of burden stood penned near visible in firelight men have lit to cook flesh adapting with nonchalance of race to new condition still sniffing inquisitively at ground two three fighting sparring together others lying down half asleep already with ear just twitching yanni be among other men when saw mitsos coming left group went towards taking hand walked off with to other side of citadel oh mitsos said what need of word a soon a knew be here devil of pit must not have held back tell that suleima have not made forget put arm round other neck not even suleima said yet littlest one godson whom have never seen yet capsina with whom have spent more day of late than with suleima did not swear oath of clan to very willingly not thing to be sworn lightly do not love other yanni gave happy little sigh so be well said so now tell of concern what of capsina for heard of deed in gulf indeed be difficult to tell of capsina said mitsos for never have seen one to compare with soul of man think must have be given also be a beautiful a a suleima at least so must say do remember journey went together yanni well cruise with be like of woman have ever seen love one only yet think love capsina in way love asked oh like said mitsos be sure like else must not have got on so well together used to play laugh like child everything be joke be when first started before knew of suleima why did not tell of suleima oh be dear nonsense of suleima own then one day did tell because asked straight who be at home what did say forget nothing think oh yes asked why have treated like stranger not told remember now puzzled that said that christos be playing draught at time remember went out soon after though be most wet stormy yanni whistled low thoughtfully to mitsos continued expect will be soon at nauplia when fleet come oh be splendid will see pointed down hill where relief party have come up do see there cried there be light moving at bottom of hill men be drawing line more closely where came up there will be passing next time yanni spat contemptuously over wall who care for cross legged turk said saw kolocotrones to day say be in hollow of hand hand mitsos dirty hand be gnaws mutton bone holding in greasy finger licking afterwards drink sour wine why must man live like pig when there be need because have pig soul even a capsina have man soul said mitsos yanni must go turk sticking on mountain when get out of there will be plenty of turk to stick when will that be when turk have more to eat when fleet arrives whichever happens first see be like fleet still come not without fleet how will relieve nauplia not having sufficient food if fleet doe not soon come will have to make way back to corinth meantime on mountain between here there day fresh greek collect how many men have kolocotrones with ten thousand say said yanni always say ten thousand may saint have made speak truth at last said mitsos then there be mainats how many thousand said yanni niketas be already encamped on hill with two thousand oh mitsos be nice little trap have ready for devil mitsos suddenly felt in pouch tobacco oh tobacco cried not whiff have be in mouth for three day when tobacco be finished will sell soul for tobacco surely have yanni pulled out roll of half said cut remember saint be watching mitsos ran across to still glowing fire fetched light capsina said thought about nothing tobacco remarked indeed do think about good deal what be be saying oh yes stop here till there be more food then cut way out somehow there will be broken head that day pray mine will not be one of if turk move first garrison place leave men here sufficient to hold follow turk to nauplia if fleet come up into mountain towards corinth will join mainats again when move asked yanni surely paused moment frowning yanni be absurd of again be disquiet about suleima ought to have learned by now that god watch very carefully supposing turk go towards nauplia house be on way yanni laughed father andra maybe will run away leaving suleima there oh be very likely said be time to go to bed mitsos where do sleep will show there be room for two oh be guard for last two hour of night will have bed to yourself surely at sunrise will come back very full of sleep will fall on thus will be flat long barrack room stretched from near gate up north side of citadel already nearly full of men stretched on ground others on sacking asleep night be very hot atmosphere inside be stifling mitsos sniffed disgustedly will not do said will fetch sack lie outside tell guard yanni that when watch come will be asleep by gate so that may wake other men have come to same conclusion a mitsos on way to gate passed many stretched out still sleeping on dry withered grass moon have long since risen plain be flooded with white light fire near gate have died down only now then breath of wind passing over fluffy ash made glow again for moment little farther passed goat pen against wall two three goat looked up inquisitively a walked by out of long willow eye sentry be opposite gate a came up mitsos showed where must be in deep embrasure of wall where projecting angle stood out leaving dark corner sheltered from glare of moonlight threw down sacking here arranged lengthwise making bed broad enough for two mitsos have brought thick peasant cloak with formed admirable pillow for night be too hot to need a covering kicked off shoe unbuttoned shirt so a to let cool night air on to skin a pipe be not yet finished sat talked to yanni who lay down be hot beyond endurance to night said will see towards mid day to morrow when there be shelter for fly how fine grilling pan be larissa land be place for man to live must be on sea year in year out beat out ash of pipe yet be good to be together again yanni said lying down now be sleeping time wish devil must fly away with sentry duty at night three hour later sentry came to wake mitsos yanni who be not asleep got up gently will take mitsos duty said yes be yanni mavromichales who came in to night man grunted sleepily turned in wondering whether for consideration in world must take night watch out of turn chapter xi with increase in number of garrison flock of goat dwindled like patch of snow when spring have come after three day grilling on rock calculation showed that there be food for whole number of men for only three day more be judged more prudent that since turk showed sign of meditating assault garrison must cut way through turkish line go back to greek camp at lerna return again with fresh supply of food turkish fleet meantime have not appeared seemed certain that army must not hold argo much longer forage food be getting daily scarcer more distant of gathering many men be stricken down with virulent dysentery fever arising doubt from constant expedition into marshy ground unripe fruit plucked ate freely day by day greek continued to collect on mountain be decided that original occupier must go for many of be hardly fit for longer service after ten day on gridiron rock few mainats among others mitsos sturdily declared that must not leave place while there be piece of goat meat loaf of bread remaining hypsilantes also whose untrained body felt heat coarseness of scanty food most severely be after many fruitless attempt at persuasion induced to be of evacuating party object be already gained have thrown in lot with people turning back on idle cowardly senator be important until more food be obtained to have a few mouth a possible to feed provided that who remained must hold place in case of attack fortune favored escape for before sunset on night on partial evacuation be fixed wrack of storm cloud scudding out of sea from south spreading over sky with rapidity promised hurricane brought in train noisy night of storm by nine o'clock rain have come on in torrent with thunder lightning in headlong pelt marched silently out of gate crept down hill side towards turkish line have be now drawn round rock where mainats have entered three night before a have to cut way through enemy somewhere be best to choose place where there must be quicker going than down goat path to left of rock hill ended in steep earth covered slope below be line point most promised success under cover of storm approached unheard then quickening up ran down last slope under tropical downpour be more than mud slide between alley of tent be lantern somewhat sparsely placed by good fortune first greek who entered line came straight upon one of round be two three sentry sentry be neatly silently knifed before have time to raise alarm fire still at double greek passed second line of tent into parallel passage here be hardly le lucky shot two be fired alarm be given under blinding deafening uproar of element turk ran hither thither over tent rope into other without loss of single man greek gained plain beyond twice during following week petrobey attempted to force way by night through turkish line now closely invested larissa for taking in of fresh supply to troop there time without success turk have drawn off number of troop from town to strengthen blockading citadel be on lookout for expedition yet still fleet did not appear be becoming question of hour almost how long dramali must remain in argo for intense heat of last day have withered scanty forage of plain men be in better plight meantime main object of citadel garrison have be effected dramali have be delayed at argo not caring to leave for town occupied by greek in rear instead of pushing on nearer to nauplia greek have now collected in force in hill if dramali be nigh provisionless garrison be even more destitute on morning after petrobey second attempt be found that provision be coming to end almost worse than that water supply be beginning to run short have hoped that tropical storm of week ago must have replenished well source lay deep thirsty soil absorbed rain before penetrated to seat of spring only difficulty be how to get out that evening have come to end of meat there be only few loaf left water that day have be muddy evil tasting mitsos a sat round remains of scanty meal tried to persuade that petrobey must have advised continuing to hold place for to propose that must evacuate be bitter mouthful more prudent so to le savory council prevailed mainats be sitting about gloomy rather dispirited none felt equal to courage of saying have better go mitsos have be selected by sort of silent vote to command waited for to speak during long silence have be lying full length on ground suddenly sat up oh cousin of mine said be not pleasant to say will be said assuredly can not stop here longer there be more food little water that stale full of well dreg others have tried twice to get in failed remains for to get out mainats who be close heard word grunted farther off came to find out what be forward mitsos repeated word again found response of grunt at that lost patience little be not pleasant for said seem to want to stay here make coward of for thought so be stay much good may do one kostas raised on elbow fine fat face be little thinner than have be softly little mitsos said give time be with then why not have said so asked mitsos in high injured voice yanni sitting close bubbled with laughter oh dear fool said do not know yet too be with so be believe if be so good said mitsos only half mollified if be not so very good also clan suddenly recovered spirit wonderfully one man began whistling sang verse of klepht song be taken up by chorus two three men near mitsos patted on back got knocked about for pain yanni be neatly tripped up sat on mitsos also regained equanimity by use of hand turned to kostas be there word for 'yes among grunt only asked well let pas must go to night day defence be strengthened a for sour bread thank god have done with picked up few remaining loaf hurled over fortress wall be better said will grunt together cousin now at back of larissa hundred yard from rock up mainats have climbed there lay steep ravine funnel shaped cut in side of hill from top to bottom ended at bottom in gentler slope being very accessible place since night surprise have be closely guarded side of be sharp pitched stone dislodged from top went down gathering length in leap till reached bottom of hill kostas have discovered for one morning leaning over battlement have idly chucked pebble over watching course saw fall on top of turkish tent below being sharp rip hole in kostas laughed to see that man popped quickly out thinking perhaps that be bullet from above at head of ravine close to citadel wall rose tall pinnacle of loose shaly rock too kostas have noticed proposal be a follows mine must be laid in rock with long fuse a soon a be done must descend hill with silence despatch keeping on two ridge bounded ravine getting a close a possible to turkish line wait then continued kostas with admirable simplicity will nature gunpowder work for rock will blow up with gunpowder nature will lead large piece very swiftly down ravine one pebble brought man from tent how many will be left when mountain fall will be in safety for stone climb steep side when stone have passed will pas also kostas looked round knowing mainats better than did mitsos found encouragement in grunt grunt be followed by grin there will be broken head said yanni sententiously yet man will break doe great mitsos say mitsos reached out large throttling hand there will be broken head remarked will have broken be borne upon that uncle kostas be great one when will start surely a soon a may be since mitsos in wisdom threw rest of bread away have first to bore big hole in rock five men can do while collect powder there be left will need none because bolt hare fashion there will not be time for fighting also portion of rock to fall must be very great then let five men go out very silently now said mitsos begin let one watch on wall when have finished open gate come out very gently then will set fuse go anastasi collect powder from man horn bring out when be collected go for boring who be with mitsos got up went off with four other volunteer to drill rock chose place behind away from ravine so that loosened piece might not fall perhaps lead to extra vigilance on part of turk rock be soft crumbly though night be swelter of heat hole be drilled without very much labor by time be ready powder have come be carefully rammed in mitsos laid long train of damp powder in sacking making fuse of about ten minute law when be ready whistled gently to watcher on wall moment afterwards gate be put softly ajar men filed out waited till last have emerged then set light to train night be not very dark for although moon be not yet risen diffused light of star made clear gray twilight two ridge of ravine down climbed be rough with upstanding bowlder by going very cautiously quietly be easily possible to approach line without being seen indeed greater fear be from hearing for dry stone clanged rang metallically under foot a began to get nearer men took off mountain shoe so that tread might be more noiseless already foremost be a far a thought safe to go in silence others closed up till shadow of bowlder be nest of expectant eye air be still windless man heard only coming going of breath above be not sound except that from time to time bird piped with flute like note among rock strain grew tenser yet more tense now then murmur must come drowsily up from turkish line bird piped on mitsos be only conscious of one perplexing doubt must bird be killed not suddenly with roar crash windy buffet be waiting for came crash grew into roar gathered volume intolerable sound moment in great storm of dust shattered rock passed down ravine smaller piece leaping like spray from torrent up side larger coiling twisting together like rope of water in cataract passed with rush roar down on to turkish line below a tumult went on way there mingled with noise of ripped canvas broken pole human cry close on heel of avalanche came mainats from tent near men be fleeing in fear of shower of stone coming path of rock lay through line a if cut by portentous knife none thought of stopping lane through camp passed like blur of light keeping to edge of path cut by rock reached plain without shot being fired at did not halt abate pace though carried musket be without powder for knife defenceless without even waiting to fall into sort of formation struck out over plain towards lower hill at base of camp at lerna stood vigilance of greek be of sort to of turk knowing that must run most considerable risk if approached camp without giving warning of being shot halted three hundred yard off mitsos yelled aloud from citadel cried greek of maina shout answered now that be beyond reach of pursuit went more quietly sentry at first outpost have turned out in case of anything being wrong in moment be recognized passed petrobey met so benjamin have come home said kissing yanni oh mitsos have come to friend week turk in argo greek at lerna on mountain waited one for ottoman fleet to appear other for must certainly follow on non appearance already so be rumored of turkish cavalry horse have be killed to supply food for men greek heard with greedy quickening of breath one morning two ship appeared suddenly opposite nauplia be feared be first of turkish ship mitsos announced be revenge sophia though why have come knew not hill round be line of greek camp waiting like bird of prey for inevitable end down at men be growling discontentedly at waiting hot foul air of marsh smote swore must smite in return thus in silent hungry expectation first week of august went by at length on morning of th end came when day broke be to show long bright line of albanian mercenary who formed advance guard of dramali army marching across plain northward towards guarded hill from lerna lying low be only visible when began to reach foot hill of range towards corinth by time cavalry have begun to leave north gate of argo instantly in camp there be sudden fierce outburst of joy certain vengeance hill be guarded turk in trap only remained to go hill between argo corinth be rough bowldersown main pas over called dervenaki lay due north from argo be that over turk under dramali have come however have now be occupied five day before by large body of greek from village round hardy men of mountain a leaderless a pack of wolf fiercer have taken up senseless position too near plain below gorge through road passed be narrow easily held albanian therefore advance guard of force seeing that pas be occupied turned westward towards village of nemea by road joined dervenaki again after long dtour beyond gorge kolocotrones with son panos eight thousand greek be in possession of nemea news that advance guard consisting of about thousand albanian be approaching be brought a sat at breakfast in brass helmet now albanian be not turk greek serving a mercenary under sultan many of have relation friend among greek year ago at siege of tripoli separate amnesty have be concluded with have not be prevented from going home moreover be excellent men of arm poor thing kolocotrones considered a debated what to do while be still debating first rank of came in sight looked at for moment then turned to scout who have brought news may hell receive snarled be greek be greek one knew that be allowed to pas unmolested be also poor kolocotrones knew besides dervenaki nemean way to west two other possible road led over pas to east of one lay parallel with dervenaki only five six hundred yard from till nearly top of pas road then joined after running for half mile one on side of narrow wedge shaped hill became one farther away again to east lying in long loop be third road of branched off from dervenaki before coming to spot where irregular greek on pas be encamped road farthest away to east be held by english speaking niketas have with two thousand men including many mainats advance guard of turk preceded main army by half hour dramali rode with second body of cavalry when saw albanian take western road knew be held by kolocotrones burst into torrent of mussulman abuse have be betrayed sold bartered albanian be in league with greek so ordered advance up shortest most direct road namely dervenaki scout soon returned saying be held by greek dramali turned eastward into parallel road appeared to be untenanted low ridge divided two a crossed be seen by niketas outpost without moment hesitation divided band into two part with one crossed road dramali be taking took up position near top of pas on steep wedge shaped hill that separated from dervenaki on road blocking to others gave order to hang on right flank of turk a advanced northward of turk now that albanian be separated from greater part of cavalry came first a advance guard most of infantry followed between marched army of luggage mule with tent appurtenance of turkish warfare mule camel carrying embroidered clothes gold chased arm money woman behind again lesser part of cavalry remainder of infantry meantime men in camp at lerna more than half mainats have seen road turk have taken be in pursuit now that be seen that turk be in retreat have thought of attempting relief of nauplia since fleet have not arrived there be nothing to be gained by continuing to hold larissa be better to concentrate force on hill over turk have to pas if so be that passed cavalry have seen have gone first be time to think of prudence security dashed through argo empty silent street out to right at tail of ottoman force risking attack a crossed plain dramali have longer thought of attacking doomed line with train of baggage beast moved slowly petrobey reached outlying foot hill before rear of turk have left plain pas on side of niketas troop be posted narrowed gradually a went near top where waited be just road flanked on left side by steep promontory of hill on other by stream riotous only in melting of snow now mere starved trickle of water beyond be corresponding hill covered sparsely with pine grew up big among big bowlder of white limestone lying like petrified flock of gigantic sheep day have broken with pitiless naked sky a sun rose higher seemed that world be furnace eaten up with own heat niketas with hundred men have already taken up position on left side of pas through turk must come on steep turtle backed ridge dividing from dervenaki contingent be on road employed in heaping up rough wall of stone across to shelter delay advance of cavalry vanguard on right of road be remainder of niketas troop five hundred in number dispersed among pine bowlder of hill side rose so sheerly that man must see road a be stage from rising tier of theatre seat shoot down on to petrobey sent yanni forward to find niketas ask where must wish fresh troop from lerna to be posted answer came back that be most needed in road to help building of barricade stop first cavalry charge already there be under hypsilantes priest dikaios must petrobey take council with be possible also that reinforcement must be needed on right of road if so let mainats be divided have sufficient men to hold hill on left be damn fine finally wished petrobey good appetite for feast mainats knew be always hungry turk be still hour away petrobey led troop down on to road from off uneven ground of hill so that must make more speed in ten minute reached place where rest be building barricade here set to work rolled down stone from slope into valley others fetched from bed of stream while on road carried to site of growing wall piled up now then warning shout must come from hill side rock must leap down gathering speed rush across road split sometimes into hundred fragment useless for most part for limestone be hard valuable building stone eight ten men like busy limbed ant at work must seize roll up to rising barricade piling on top if not too heavy using to form part of buttress time be short wall be uneven ridge across road stream four foot high so in place elsewhere only heap of stone when be shouted from outpost that cavalry be approaching men ceased from work gathering up arm retreated to behind improvised barricade waited to left of road below barricade rose wedge of hill on niketas contingent be stationed be drawn up in five rank of about two hundred men in open order with space of thirty pace between last three rank so that owing to steepness of ground man commanded view of road rank must fire over head of in front ground however be of more gradual slope a approached road first rank lay sheltering a far a possible among bowlder not twenty pace from road second rank five pace behind knelt third stood on right of road hill be too rugged uneven being strewn with bowlder sown with shrub tree to allow of formation be in fact one great ambuscade men being hidden by tree stone here there gun barrel glistened in sun casual passer by might have gone way never suspected presence of men bend in road two hundred yard below concealed barricade defender from turk vanguard of turk halted moment seeing that hill to left of road be occupied then set forward again at brisk trot meaning perhaps to go under fire along road commanded by niketas then wheeling at top of pas attack thus enable rest of troop to march through ravine while be engaging defender reach open ground lay beyond just before first rank reached bend in road niketas opened fire on did not wait to return putting horse into canter swept round bend at that hill side on right flank blazed bristled shrub stone seemed to burst into flame of fire on side greek at short range poured storm of bullet into at step fell suddenly from in front mainats from between barricade opened fire retreat be impossible for whole of cavalry be now advancing from behind to stop meant one congestion of death spurred savagely on in moment be at wall leaped lower part of alighting seemed in hell of flame others be checked by higher portion horse reared wheeled into own rank others passed through stream bed putting horse at wall of defender a at fence found faced by rear rank of mainats who be waiting patiently higher up road till must have penetrated into range meantime check given to first division of cavalry at barricade have resulted in congestion down advancing line second division have closed up with first third with second on heel of cavalry came infantry dramali who be stationed in rear still almost on plain of argo have ordered to advance at cost till gained top of pas whence must intrench on open ground moment added crust to congealment of destruction mass of moving on from behind pushed first rank forward forward squeezed together pressing against wall of barricade a river in flood press against arch of bridge at two three point have be entirely broken down through now free for moment now choked again with body of horse rider few escaped through first rank of mainats into road beyond raked indeed by other rank who held pas higher up no longer exposed to full threefold short range fire from niketas barrier in ambush on left already wall of dead dying be heaped higher than barricade that mainats have raised horse of turk who forced way through trampled on body of fallen pas must for be forced forward a by hideous slow moving glacier by stream of dead living here there dead horse carrying dead rider be borne on upright unable to fall because of who pressed so closely on side rider bowed forward over neck of horse sprawling sideways across knee of fellow horse head supported on quarter of beast in front wedged between next more terrible even be other brute wounded screaming unable to move except a be moved carried along for second perhaps till two three of in front forced way through breach in barricade of horse rider gave space so that fell be mercifully trampled out of pain life for five deadly minute pressed on hopelessly gallantly while leaden hail hissed from flank from in front into congested horseman at end turk broke fled in direction up hill where niketas troop still untouched unattacked be stationed others up hill side opposite still spurted blazed with musket there bush be armed man stone red flower of flame rush must not be stopped more than rush even of cattle sheep can be withstood by armed men turk fled scattering in direction northward for most part towards corinth where must find safety greek troubled not to pursue shot a man shoot at driven deer almost simultaneously with breaking of troop of cavalry who have passed first rank of mainats who guarded wall once of stone now heap of men horse succeeded in spite of steady fire of rear rank with cool courage of desperation in clearing sort of passage round by stream bed be now fuller than have be red with froth of blood through four hundred of cavalry passed drove mainats from barricade with much slaughter forcing up two hill side bounded ravine charging forward passed other rank without sustaining heavy loss made way into open ground reaching corinth night dramali cavalry have be divided into two part larger of formed vanguard of four hundred have passed through valley of death of rest red fuller flowing stream gave account behind have followed first division of infantry three thousand men now scattered over armed hillside behind again baggage mule camel dramali rode with second division of cavalry three hundred yard behind rear be brought up by remainder of foot soldier have be checked in lower part of pas by congestion in front waited in vain to move again aide de camp be sent off to ascertain cause of contravention of order before came back sight of hill side covered with flying men brought quicker more eloquent message paused moment then in nervous anger drove spur into horse checked again biting end of long mustache why do not go forward said again why be scattering then with sudden spurt of anger oh dog cried dog to be chased by dog fire in word be only ash looked round on calm impassive face of staff men for most part without bowel of mercy fear who must meet death with a perfect indifference a must mete out to others absolute nonchalance of expression total disregard of what might happen to struck into childish kind of frenzy for be of different make if push on die said in sort of squeal if turn back what next at that officer near turned head aside hiding smile before dramali have time to notice fresh movement of greek from in front made up mind for under niketas on left of pas be seen pouring down off hill on to road almost before turk saw what be happening have cut army in two drawing up just behind baggage animal hardly three hundred yard in front of second division of cavalry with whom dramali rode be enough for serashier dearly a loved battery of silver saucepan embroidered armor appliance of pasha loved one thing better at least be left be determined to save a long a possible back to argo screamed let infantry open out cavalry will go first putting spur to horse fairly forced way back not drawing bridle rode through scorched plain have passed that morning by twelve o'clock be back at argo again on afternoon next day remained there in feverish stupor of inaction cry aloud at one time allah be dead world given over to hand of infidel at that ship be already at nauplia that must march there then must seem that world only contained one thing of importance that certain narghile of with stem studded with turquoise moonstone that have fallen into hand of greek let send quickly say that must give oke of gold for two greek slave of have be taken at kydonies one be sixteen other only fourteen be worth weight in gold for beauty only constantine elder made coffee a must only be made in paradise let constantine come at once make coffee anyhow constantine coffee be left nothing else mattered two day later remnant of turkish force again started for corinth time dramali who have abated little contempt for greek dog making up complement in fearful haste took precaution to send forward advance guard during night who must find out if of pass be unoccupied greek under niketas who be in hurry to engage turk again for since escape be impossible must afford to wait be still holding pas turk have attempted to cross two day before reconnoitring party of dramali found road farther away to east unoccupied niketas when be seen way be going hastened across to secure repetition of what have gone before making way over hill again stopped advance road here be wider lying between hill le easy to occupy turkish cavalry by brilliant charge won way through escaped to corinth abandoning remainder of infantry rest of baggage on greek settled like cloud of stinging insect that evening constantine coffee maker of paradise exercised function in house of father refugee from kydonies who have taken service with niketas thus great scheme came to end pricked bubble melting of snow in summer ship have yet appeared off nauplia dramali invincible army waited for have come gone eager hungry eye of besieged in nauplia starved watched in vain to hungry mouth food be scantier slowly inevitably cause of people in hand more of incompetent leader be gaining ground against intolerable burden of heartless lustful master link by link chain of slavery be snapping falling a husk burst fall from corn already mature ripe chapter xii sophia revenge a mitsos have seen have come to nauplia week ago yet capsina must have fully explained

healing lotion over roughness lay on with cooling noise of night joined in chorus to make up one great silence of night bird fluted at interval from tree frog croaked in marsh below owl swept by with whisper of white wing long drawn hoot below lay bay unemblazoned shield of silver on left hand fire of greek round nauplia pierced red hole in dark promontory falling star ever good omen to peasant shot faded in western sky stream ran through vineyard towards marsh spoke quietly to like one talking in sleep something of spirit of stillness touched capsina soul great impossible thing be not le impossible le to be desired have not known till now how aggravating chafing thing have be to feel wild vague hatred against suleima have gone must no more hate brave beautiful girl who have treated with so large frank courtesy with such true stingless sympathy than must have hated mitsos only hour ago must have seemed to pity sympathy from suleima must be crown of rank offence now be thing

foot of be great plank washtub stood in corner there be press for clothes moon shone full in at window making great splash like spill of milk on floor there be need for other light illustration spirit of stillness touched capsina soul suleima be tired soon fell asleep capsina lay long with eye closed intensely awake mill race of turbulent unasked for thought whirled dashed down channel of brain clinched hand bit lip to keep away to keep even from cry aloud blood flesh of young tingling alert be up in revolt lashing against hard cruel bar of circumstance ought never to have come here to sleep where have slept have done stupid sweet thing be paying for heavily at last must stand no longer rising very quietly for fear of disturbing suleima dressed again let out of house hour of weakness be upon lived back into year of childhood when one thing will make world complete absence be inconsolable ache like child too abandoned to imperativeness of need nothing else must satisfy nothing else be ever so faintly desirable yet must only stretch out hand to night fibre of tingling silent cry want want went up beseechingly hopelessly into indifferent moonlight dumb dry litany of supplication not only to heaven to cool sleeping earth to tree bush stream knew after while saw scorned where be great scheme deed in shared be magnificence whit impaired because incomparably small atom be in want of one thing by degree made sane weary with struggle came to herself going back into house lay down again by suleima when morning came suleima be loath to wake for slept so sound peacefully so evenly bosom marked quiet breathing waking brought hour of sweet bitter thing to girl washing dressing boy be almost wholly sweet never before have that sunny child of love be so laughed over kissed capsina showed what be to experienced mother strangest ignorance of infant toilet even adorable crease in own pink skin ever new wonder of ten divisible individual toe palled in grave interest to owner before new original method sweeter even than be unprompted staccato cap sin cap sin like silly parrot so said suleima indeed girl be truly woman though profound judge mitsos have given sex to herself little household duty so lovingly done by suleima be keen pleasure to to watch assist in after have breakfasted still lingered let wait little longer said to suleima will not wait unless promise to do must do if be not here so suleima to whom mending patching of mitsos clothes be danaid labor went into house came out again on to veranda with armful of invalid linen there be hole to be patched in trouser

deprecating dismay when have finished suleima laughed to choking will not better said a capsina prepared to rip off piece again indeed will stop a be mitsos will wear like that will know who did then perhaps will think higher of finger snatched out of capsina hand ran with into house where put among finished linen where must find stare in wonder at preposterous housewifery capsina have not tried hand at further job when returned presently after rose must get back said for at ten must be on road to nauplia oh suleima paused unshed tear stood in black eye have not skill at speaking said when heart be full word choke other be have made different have made better suleima stood moment with brilliant happy smile in eye mouth serious sweet then threw arm round girl neck kissed will be happy said with face close to hers looking in eye promise will be happy for indeed be among first thing desire capsina shook head can not promise that said know if matter much will be brave try to be will try to be good luckily have much to do will take mitsos again asked suleima if will come if will let come let come laughed think have not made plain stood there moment longer cheek to cheek then capsina gently drew away good bye said will come again before leave nauplia went quickly down garden path paused moment at gate looking back then stepped out along white sun stricken road chapter xiii kolocotrones follower have have hand in destruction of dramali army indeed only share have taken in great bloody deed be to let albanian guard pas on way unmolested whether on ground of merciful act because have be appointed generalissimo of greek force claimed in fact secured very considerable share of what niketas have taken have be idle during amnesty at nauplia having supplied immense amount of grain other supply to beleaguered garrison at starvation rate ali of argo who be in command of turk have seen that something have miscarried in conduct of fleet be provident enough to purchase very considerable provision almost satisfying greed of kolocotrones now that turk be in danger of being starved out generalissimo absented from besieging force executed several very neat profitable raid along shore of corinthian gulf certainly for month two town be amply provided while greek fleet cruising in mouth of gulf of spetzas must prevent immediate relief being brought by turkish ship when provision be exhausted kolocotrones intended to try do little more provision dealing if a seemed possible temper of army must no longer countenance marketing must certainly be on spot when turk surrendered to take possession of town in name of republic of a much treasure a must lay hand on in own during absence however certain change took place in conduct of siege other leader tired perhaps little ashamed of juggling with treaty that never meant to abide by of haggling over price with enemy else knowing that if kolocotrones be there must take lion share of spoil made spirited though ineffectual attempt since ali have broken off negotiation to bring siege to conclusion in absence during spring many volunteer from england france have offered service to revolutionist there have even be formed corp of philhellene several of notably colonel jourdain french artilleryman two englishman hastings hane have put at disposal of greek troop in nauplia jourdain ingenious impractical young man have urged greek to try firing combustible shot at town held out good hope that must set town on fire with luck might even demolish enemy powder magazine burn provision house full of provision have just be sold to captain jingling with gold of payment found plan humorous fort standing on island in bay have be put into hand of greek at first pseudo surrender of town though ali declared that treaty gave being null void a have not done part in providing transport vessel must be returned to turk answer that greek gave be come take a turk be not in position to come take be obviously misplaced quixotism to let stand empty from there ingenious jourdain suggested that combustible shot must be fired ingenuity further served to relieve of responsibility of attempt hastings hane though without much faith in method obtained leave of greek captain to do accordingly hastings be made captain of fort garrison consisted of twenty boatman from kranidi who knew about a much of artillery a of astronomy surveyed men with amusement spoke pithily be to make nauplia a full of hole a net a hot a hell said train gun if know what that mean will teach there be dozen pounder three pounder of seven inch bore fort be old venetian work tottery unstable a reuben commanded by gun of nauplia hastings surveying turned to hane from town must engage to knock place into biscuit in ten minute by stop watch said hane laughed will knock to bit ourselves in not much longer with concussion of own gun if turk hit said must a soon sail across bay of biscay in paper boat jourdain combustible ball be made to be fired from smaller gun two spent sulphurous morning made good shooting with be true that discharged immense volume of smoke when struck there seemed truth in proverb where there be smoke there be also fire jourdain have manufactured twenty of in hour have used up breeze be blowing from town volume of vile smelling vapor be wafted on hane be man of few pointed word so here be last of froggy stink pot be comment when last of shell be fired greek be in rapture of delight seemed impossible that so magnificent firework must be ineffective strongly recommended repetition of display hastings meant business after parley be allowed to make attempt not with stink pot with ordinary shot from pounder for pounder be so believed of too light calibre to be effective at distance next day heavier cannonade went on turk returned fire with vigor without much success a hastings have anticipated chief risk be from concussion of own artillery dangerously shook faulty ill built wall after first day be found impossible to fire bigger gun pounder with light shell be soon seen to be useless hastings however kept up cannonade for two day more partly to give practice to untrained gunner partly because be of nature groan to be doing nothing at end of third day turkish fire ceased altogether for flight destruction of dramali army have become known be no longer possible to hope that by show of resistance brisk firing might encourage timid serashier to march from argo attempt to raise siege have known town be now so well supplied with provision even if have to evacuate must have joined force with marched to corinth now a throughout war what seemed blind chance what be really legitimate result of cowardly hesitating policy once more combined to fight against so turkish fire ceased a be proved to satiety that smaller gun of island fort be more than summer rain to fortification of town hastings ceased fire too with hane made detailed examination of fort with view to strengthening wall enabling to stand concussion from heavier gun with little pulling down little patching rubble buttress two seemed easily possible to strengthen one bastion held two of pounder so that might fire without risk of bringing down wall on own head afternoon message arrived from captain poniropoulos firing have ceased gun produced impression on fortification greek be infinitely obliged to must not hope to share in plunder from nauplia must ration be longer supplied to for present be not intention of commander to continue gun practice dramali army have gone fleet have not come must sit down wait inevitable end hastings chucked note into sea there be answer said to boatman who have brought turned to hane be use waiting here if be not to use gun said say need not expect plunder from nauplia do think be like old man in brass helmet chapter xiv mitsos returned home after destruction of dramali army arriving there day after capsina have left suleima met at gate oh welcome mitsos cried in hurry too have seen have be here seem of little account said mitsos who may behe ' be when talk of behe do not know whom mean be le wise than saved life that of littlest

so see that there be wine to fill even oh love wine cried ah be for wine alone must be home again said suleima with light of love returned in eye mitsos bent down from great height put face to hers yes for wine alone said softly wine of many thing be not wine to soul own dear one soon after have dinner dinner finished mitsos set off into revenge be fretting at anchor in land breeze a horse eager to be off play with bridle close under fort where hastings hane have fired incombustible ball saw capsina boat light caique in sailed on hurricane errand when in port must go like fish if there be wind must be pulled by one man even mitsos used a be to over canvassed boat used to feel certain qualm when little cockleshell with tower of sail be scudding through broken sea capsina knowing used to

while be day after poniropoulos have told hastings that service be no longer required poniropoulos gunner under hastings be feeling thought disconcerted capsina have approved very warmly of silent iron man when on going that morning to fort have found hastings gone sailed across with dipping gunwale to poniropoulos demanded where why have disappeared thus poniropoulos learned true opinion of went back to island where mitsos found ignorant folk have be saying always think that one be so wise a when came here knew nothing have be taught to fire off gun without getting in front of think know why did let hastings go what did care about plunder of nauplia if have asked to stop must have stopped know that a well a saw that if continued to fire big gun fort must tumble about long ear so what

for how many day have be made welcome in swift house of yours will come to morrow let tell suleima so capsina nodded smiled till to morrow then said mitsos have construed tone aright even in very act of speaking have hesitated wondering if be firm enough of purpose to sail without wishing rather wanting that be in same act of speech have known be not question have halted on tongue have be asked answered now be gladder for pain of presence be sweeter than relief of absence most of sailor be on shore few only on ship when mitsos have gone went down to cabin meaning to go to bed ripple tapped restlessly against ship side occasionally footstep of watch sounded above head human sound came through open port hole from greek camp night be very hot girl lay tossing turning in bed unable to sleep be at such time when be alone especially at night that fever of love sickness most throbbed burned in vein now then must doze for moment lightly still conscious that be lying in cabin only knowing that be not awake by fact that heard mitsos talking saw standing by such vision passed in flash must wake again to full consciousness night be too aware of own body to doze even for moment be struggling palpitating thing pulse beat insistently in temple heart rose to throat hammered there loud quick port hole showed circle of luminous gray in darkness cast muffled light on wall opposite wave lapped sentry walked ship be alive with little noise heard only by alert bed burned love fever burned be smouldering flame listened to tread of watch growing fainter a walked to bow paused moment a turned step came back in gradual crescendo till be above head then died away again till be barely audible again paused at turn again came step crescendo so backward forward till must have cried aloud for irritation of thing other noise be le explicable surely one be moving about in cabin next hers cabin mitsos used to occupy one who went to fro in stockinged bare foot with heavy tread then michael who lay outside door stirred sat up began to scratch at backward stroke hind leg tapped door capsina vindictively said to herself that must be washed to morrow must not stop went on scratching for ten hour lifetime may have be minute called out to to be quiet lay down heard with thump pleased with sound of recognized voice banged tail against bare board then began to pant at first sound be barely audible seemed a if must be swelling to gigantic thing for noise of breathing grew louder louder till became only tread of sentry above be not sentry walked little slower than panting why must man not keep time still next door padded footstep crept about flesh blood must not stand getting up kindled lamp at little oil wick below shrine of virgin at end of cabin opened door michael hailed with silent rapture wistful topaz eye paused moment on threshold then opening door of mitsos cabin went in knowing time that tread of stockinged foot be only thought of own brain made audible inwardly cabin be empty a expected sat down for moment on bare board of bunk with lamp in hand looking round wall vaguely intently curiously without purpose pencil scratch above head of bed caught eye examining more closely saw be sprawling letter written upsidedown written backward frowned over for moment then solution drew smile from putting lamp on floor lay down on bed looking up yes be must have written idly one morning lying in bed read thus be mitsos cabin suleima capsina oh capsina oh mitsos codones suleima again again read then continued to look at not reading a one look at familiar picture half abstractedly lamp unreplenished with oil burned low michael sank on to haunch then lay down through open cabin door filtered silvery grayness of starlight before lamp have gone quite out girl be asleep on bare unblanketed bed face turned upward a have turned to read little pencil scratch chapter xv during last two month greek fleet have be playing waiting game necessary inglorious sultan a have be seen have sent out in spring great army great navy be to relieve nauplia simultaneously of army hill of dervenaki knew navy have cruised to patras to take on board new capitan pasha succeeding who be victim of kanaris fire ship now in september be coming back in full force under new commander in tardy execution of aim have left patras before news of dramali destruction have arrived turk still knew nothing of miscarriage of sultan scheme round day by day out of distance of heavy gun hovered poised petrel fleet of greek attacking attacked greek navy have be reorganized in spring supreme command given to admiral miaulis still only in thirtieth year brave honest judicious distracted by endless quarrel pretension of charge be part of purpose to give battle to turk on open level of sea to wait till turned into narrower gulf outside nauplia where cumbrous turk must be hampered for sea room while own lighter vessel born to shifting wind at home among shoal peril of landlocked sea must reap fruit of breeding latter part of august month of halcyon day in open sea drifted sailed in wake of turk returning with kosreff from patras day brought little nearer nauplia often for two day three at time must be utterly becalmed sometimes taken back by northward flowing current with sail flapping idly mirrored with scarcely tremor on painted ocean four ship have gone hack to hydra to guard harbor carry news if detachment of turk be sent from constantinople beacon hill rising black barren above town be watch tower day night day added to week still sign came from south north one out of four belonged to tombazes who be for time at hydra two to father nikola wrinkled sour a ever since night of encounter with capsina le audibly malevolent sometimes ship must put in from peiraeus other port brought news of fresh rising against turk of fresh outrage of fresh success occasionally there must be on board men who have escaped from turkish slavery le often woman then if ship happened to come from port near athens father nikola must hasten down to quay with peering eye hoping against hope face of who have escaped be always strange to kanaris only who be cousin of wife be in secret knew why old man pinched hoarded with such unwavering greed while others cursed for grasping clutching felt pity sympathy in man devotion to one purpose must not have shrunk from pain bodily mental must not have shrunk from crime if pain crime must have enabled to buy back wife from turk in athens have devil come to hydra offering ransom for signing away of soul must have snapped finger in satan face signed sometimes kanaris must sup with while father nikola gave guest hospitable fare must eat only most sparingly drink nothing water must sit long silent playing with string of bead peering at other then after time might say be very like when be boy kanaris have same eye a have finished drinking if so will put wine away kanaris who must often have wished for more must say have finished one such evening towards end of july kanaris came up with news have heard asked have heard nothing said nikola dropped fifty piaster piece to day know not where how athens have capitulated father nikola rose brought hand together with palsied trembling then sank back in chair again wine give wine said gulped down glassful holding in shaking hand spilling much unused a have be for so long to anything water be strength steadiness to got up again renewed firm own man must go then said must go not to athens said kanaris caique put in evening there have be massacre of turk

gone to hydra will help for be cousin to will sail to spetzas to night while wait here nikola took by shoulder almost pushing from room go then said oh be quick man stay do want money take what will be for walked across room to hearth wrenched up two of stone below opened space three foot square filled with little linen bag tied up took out handful of be hundred piaster said take what will take three four for time have come for to use kanaris with strange feeling of tenderness pity kissed old man hand refused too will do something for kin said belongs to a well a cried father nikola belongs to one to only tell will pay a must have paid turk oh take money go kanaris shook head very well be yours only will go wish good luck father father nikola must not speak threw down bag into place again put back stone then went to bedroom took out best clothes washed trimmed beard put on purple cloak lined with fur big gold ring buckled shoe be old man thought to at least can make le forlorn sight for woman eye ah woman be ever like old drooping mouth trembled into smile sometimes when went out must notice not with pain with hatred that people shrank from that boy called by opprobrious miser name to night a went down to quay noticed nothing walked on air unseeing crucial hour be at hand hour must leave rich alone primate more with be wife that vow at least have not broken must not be hissed out of office blithely must go must have to leave hydra must shake dust of from foot must ask pardon of economos whom have foully schemed to murder must give bare livelihood to service of war must be happier man little well of tenderness humanity have so long be choked by salt bitter sand of soul in rose suddenly swelled overflowed surely god be very good have taken again by hand after decade of sour hating year must lead into green quiet pasture quay be loud humming with news from athens tombazes be there red face glory clapped nikola hard on shoulder oh be not very fine said too be fine oh silver buckle fur cloak nikola laid trembling hand on arm where be who have escaped from athens asked knew person there who have be taken by turk whom must be glad to see again tombazes giggled unprelatically girl on spring day said when be boy oh very long time ago beg pardon father be silly with joy to night also drank much wine because of news so expect woman from athens who have better not come to hydra well well be miserable sinner go hide father will say be not on island that be dead that have never heard of ay one must stand up for one order did ever tell how ever so long ago well be old story tedious in telling refugee from athens yes boatful be expected left with who brought news sailed le fast ah be not that caique rounding harbor now will be be nearly sundown when first boat with news have arrived by now sun have set western sky still flamed with whole gamut of color from crimson to saffron yellow sea be flame reflected breeze steady singing blew from main land just ruffling water caique sped on by came black swift over shining plain of water crumpling curling sea beneath bow cutting way through crimson yellow shadow of deep translucent green lay ever before on quay crowd gathered thickened grew ever more silent for none knew what friend relative lost for year only ghost to memory ship might bring carry news of most part of men of hydra be away with fleet be woman chiefly old gray headed folk child who waited there deep water ran close up to quay wall when ship furled sail swung round to come to land be in silence that rope be flung from ship in silence that on shore made fast then anchor plunged with gulp babble into sea came alongside then a on board came ashore tongue tear be loosened among be girl who have be taken only two year before in arm be baby heritage of shame be pitiful to see how father started forward to meet then stopped for moment stood alone with down dropped eye joy expectation in face struck dead suddenly from woman behind mother ran out with love triumphing over shame fell on girl neck with sob drew tenderly away be very old man who tottered down gangway step none knew name knew none looked round puzzledly at changed quay sprouted town there be very few to return to hydra for turk have always filled plunderous lustful hand from place where men be of softer mould than stern islander tombazes with nikola still close to have pushed way forward to edge of quay where ship be disembarking crowd of jovial whistling sailor poured down plank still nikola have not seen what looked for at last came woman in turkish dress at looked longer more peeringly a came down bridge have removed yashmak from face head gray haired be bare surely to never have glory of woman be given in such magnificent abundance grew low on forehead be braided over ear done up in great coil behind head eyebrow be still black startlingly black against gray head ivory colored face eye be blacker like fire smouldered pierced like steel weary yet keen be face expectant wide eye expectant mouth slightly open still young girlish in fine curve tender line among crowd of merry strong built men seemed of different clay must have said be china cup among crockery earthen ware nikola looked eye be riveted to grew dim suddenly with little low cry broke from tombazes forced way through who stood around so that when woman stepped ashore off bridge stood full in front of hand be out stretched must have said held heart in offering to saw paused lip parted in sudden surprise amaze for moment eyebrow contracted a if puzzled before have yet frowned cleared again took hand in hers kissed on lip nikola said more for minute space there be silence between in silence soul lived back for one blessed moment to year long past neither of saw that crowd have gone back little to give room that be waiting in pause of astonishment conjecture round standing off with instinct of natural effacement supreme delicacy to let two long sundered have even in midst of sort of privacy tombazes saw guessed honest red face suddenly puckered with unbidden welling of tear be waiting a have said for one woman be be taller of two laid hand on shoulder have come back nikola said voice be sweeter more mellow than harbor bell have come back old have come back anguish more lovely than joy joy fiercer than anguish pierced bitter water be turned suddenly sweet by divine alchemy withered heart budded blossomed rest be nothing worth little one said have come back too be old at smiled little one said with undying love of love be birthright of woman be still little one said again kissed on lip let go whispered let go home lane of face parted right left in silence went up across quay through deserted street to house not till have passed out of sound of hearing did silence grow into whisper whisper into speech crowded round tombazes must only wipe eye conjecture like rest old nikola said fancy old nikola can only be wife said be waiting for person well call sister sister relation relation only call wife when be not imagined to have one person old nikola explains great deal thought mere old miser sour one at make doubt be saving for ransom anybody speak to warm hearted old pagan primate turned suddenly away blew nose violently more be seen of nikola that evening next morning servant came to tombazes asking if must dine with day two met at door hand in hand like child young lover nikola turning to wife said ask father tombazes ' blessing little one give also blessing father tombazes did so observed that nikola be dressed no longer a primate only a deacon a dined told how thirty year ago broke celibate vow a if in instant vengeance before month be passed wife be carried off from spetzas by turk how have moved to hydra where story be unknown how only yesterday have come back again now father said in conclusion will do last favor let people know what have happened go among a deacon no longer a primate hope no longer a miser sour man little one have talked long together indeed think have be made different to what be so father nikola became nikola again loss of dignity be gain in else to martha be seldom seen apart island generally partly because folk be warm hearted ready to forgive partly because strange little old age idyl pleased smiled on two nikola two ship still remained august in harbor be matter for conjecture whether when time came for to take sea again martha must go with whether nikola must give up part in war two talked of together must be selfish if tried to keep here nikola said wife for since have be in house of turk have seemed to that men have duty laid on that to root out whole devil brood care no longer little one said for have not got back martha got up began walking up down veranda be good to hear speak so said yet be not good there be other wife besides other husband also besides nikola so draw back be for only draw back go must have go looked at with shining eye heart woman noblest of woman strong unflinching looked at hesitated how can leave said can not start off again leave asked what talk be of leaving must have go will not be with doe not capsina sail on ship why not on husband no cried stung out of self be still worse if went comfort must be that be here safe that if came back must still find here let suffice then go alone again smiled let suffice nikola said go not alone looked up at with peering eye be greater than ever little one said find more beautiful than ever bent down kissed lightly on forehead sat by while stretched hand out to hers stroked must not boy girl laugh to see said for indeed though be old think still like to have touch of be absurd god bless laughter said for indeed ill thing yet came from laughter then after pause be not enviable be not content indeed be content nikola content come once twice in lifetime to most of men never be autumn of age day be warm calm storm vexes be content said nikola so during hot procession of august day indian summer of love coming late to old man who have long be of peevish withered heart to woman gray headed with something still of divine immortality of youth within sped span of day delayed lingered in speeding for wheel of time ran back to year long past year be winged with love healing of bitterness indeed man must have be something more obstinately sour of soul than dwells on earth if must not have sweetened under so mellow caressing touch for when woman be woman to core there be man whom can not make man of late have come that tender tutelage to pupil who have known hand before answered to often on sultry morning between death of breeze from sea birth of land breeze two must walk up beacon hill above town where found straying air always abroad of year of separation spoke not at for be time to be buried thought given to be hidden out of sight thus strange renewed idyl born out of old age ran course august passed thus most part of september one day a sat there looking rather than watching two mast under sail climbed rim of horizon while yet hull of ship be down two yet before long forty ship be in sight heading seemed for spetzas channel between hydra sent lad who be sheep feeding on side of hill to pas word to tombazes remained to see if more must appear be half hour before tombazes came in interval horizon be again pricked by uprising company of mast then said nikola time have come little one be fleet be turk who be now coming into sight ah here be tombazes be soon evident that nikola be right for before long a ship drew closer first fleet be clearly seen to be of greek ship who have outsailed ottoman be waiting for at entrance to gulf of nauplia like usher to show in a soon a turk be once in narrow sea with mouth closed behind by greek be a duellist shut in room fate of nauplia way be on board imminent nikola announced intention of joining fleet with one ship leaving other if tombazes thought good to help in defence of harbor in case turk attacked hydra martha sailed with at tombazes glowed making action fit word kiss hand of brave woman said turned to husband flushing with color fresh like girl sail with brave man said must ill beseem wife to be afraid other three ship be settled be to stay at hydra to guard place that evening nikola wife set off down path of land breeze to join fleet in six week have passed since capsina have taken in hand repair of fortification of burdjee have so strengthened place by buttressing with huge rough mass of stone rubble demolishing dangerous wall passed skill to put in state of safety that no longer have much to fear from turkish fire what be almost greater testimonial hardly more from own hastings be still away superintending building of steamship be to devote to national cause jourdain proud inventor of smoky ball have be seen once only on island fort on occasion finding there very handsome girl not knowing who be have with amiable gallantry of race incontinently kissed for ill inspired attention received so swinging slap on ear that head sang shrilly to for remainder of day did not again set foot on island while hurricane woman for so called after reception remained on hane have come back day two before suggested that somewhat scanty ammunition in island fort have better be reserved for ottoman fleet in case reached harbor of nauplia rather than be used up against wall of town for indeed said have quarrel with wall a long a fleet come not pen turk inside will be false policy to destroy since if fleet doe not relieve town will soon be greek fortress fortress be ever better for having capsina be on point of setting off again on revenge to join greek fleet be in hurry though must have preferred to storm away at nauplia off hand saw force of reasoning have element of good sense conceded so good bye good luck to revenge sail to day have very pretty plan in little head oh will see if there be scrimmage between fleet in harbor fire unless be sure of aim if touch ship will treat a treated little frenchman at least will try to be a big a will take punishment like man from so fair hand said hane with mock courtesy capsina glanced darkly at next day distant cannonade took place between greek turk greek on one hand preferring to stand off until enemy be well inside gulf turk unwilling to enter narrow sea with pack of sea wolf on heel approach of turkish fleet even at entrance of gulf so terrified kranidiot garrison on burdjee who be convinced that must be cut off on island that fled by night to greek camp leaving there only hane young hydriot sailor with mean of escape for took boat with have made so silent departure that hane manthee knew anything of flight till day dawned when woke to find alone however a entertained different opinion of possibility of turk gaining harbor breakfasted with extreme cheerfulness sudden puff of laughter seized now one now other at unexpected desertion afterwards spent morning in somewhat unrewarded attempt to catch fish off rock away from town manthee indeed be caught by lobster two subsequently ate for dinner now capsina mitsos have hatched very pretty plan between seeing that greek fleet be waiting to attack turkish fleet in rear be certain that latter must send transport provision vessel on first so with consent of miaulis have for whole day night of almost dead calm edged sidled up gulf till be in front of turkish fleet coaxed revenge like child took advantage of shifting current up coast least breath of wind caught in sail added to till sail be full slid one more step forward once among transport remarked capsina will be strange if orange egg get into nauplia mitsos laughed have pity for hungry folk said listen capsina there be gun from nauplia again again afternoon heavy buffet of gun boomed across water for turk in nauplia seeing that fleet be even now at entrance of gulf have opened fire on burdjee where hane manthee be catching fish hane have determined not to fire back for be better to reserve for turkish fleet especially since there be only two of to work gun so sat at angle farthest away from town dabbled foot in tepid water watched ball for most part went very wide dip ricochet in bay for three day two fleet manoeuvred idly just outside gulf wind be fitfully light variable for most part dead calm prevailed turk be a unable to pursue way up gulf a greek to attack on open sea at end of third inactive day breeze freshened steadier more lively air unusual from quarter in summer blew up gulf have capitan pasha taken advantage of risking therein little for night be clear moonrise only hour two after sunset must have run straight course before wind be at entrance of nauplia harbor by morning exposed indeed to fire of burdjee gun have there be one to work protected by gun of fort whole greek fleet so far a knew except for one brig have gone sidling up coast be eight mile in rear with so strangely favorable wind own vessel though clumsy in tack in close sailing must have run straight before way be open instead feared travelling by night perhaps with sea pack in rear did not mean to sail at hove to till morning sending on however slow sailing austrian merchantman in service of sultan laden with provision without escort for knew that greek fleet except one sailing brig a like a not on rock by time be behind proposed did not propose only knew to catch up merchantman in morning what have not observed be that a night fell breeze got up floundering brig straightened up like man lame made miraculously whole followed transport up gulf soon after moonrise austrian furled sail too mitsos who be on watch hove to also when morning dawned red windy showed turkish fleet eight mile off austrian about three mile from harbor at nauplia revenge not more than mile behind austrian capsina be on deck early surveyed position with vivid smiling satisfaction will not fire said to mitsos will take complete there go sail up there flag why be not turkish flag mitsos looked at moment two eagle said scraggy fowl be austrian in service of turk be enough be not quite enough said capsina after be swallow to raven in quarter of hour austrian be barely hundred yard ahead mitsos rather ostentatiously walked forward took tarpaulin covering off very business like nine inch gun on port bow bright brass winked pleasantly with suggestion of fire in sun be clearly visible from deck of austrian proceeded to sight gun leisurely to amidships of chase just above water line before have finished down came flag sail followed two went aboard be most cordially received by captain beautiful man with long whisker ringleted hair who spoke greek understood a little pointed inquiringly to own flag mitsos in reply merely pointed finger backward to turkish fleet on horizon forward to nauplia at jaw of beautiful man dropped little again pointed to turkish fleet in eloquent pantomime washed hand tapped breast a if to introduce to honorable heart resided there again mitsos shook head for if vessel detaches from fleet be not unreasonable to suppose that have have even still have connection with fleet then beautiful man broke into passionate expostulation in unknown guttural tongue a further progress must not be made in conversation matter be cut short party of sailor from revenge came on board armed to teeth while mitsos capsina reluctant captain returned to revenge then occurred one of thing brand character of man ancestor eternally child with inherited shame capitan pasha who have just given order to proceed up gulf saw from afar capture of merchantman supposing that greek fleet be waiting for in ambush ahead without even sending on detachment to reconnoitre put about beat out of gulf from hour fate of nauplia be sealed chapter xvi sum of greek energy like of turkey have now for many week be entirely centred round nauplia sultan have seen month ago to command nauplia hold open port be iron hand on peloponnese by degree greek have learned so too town have now be blockaded for four month irregular efficient troop have guarded pass of communication between nauplia corinth now when turkish navy turned back out of gulf after abortive effort disgraceful abandonment of town miaulis did not pursue took fleet up gulf so must faint hearted turk return must find entrance to nauplia shut locked by whole greek squadron there kanaris joined capsina again a mitsos a well a preferred to cruise after retiring fleet in hope of doing wayside damage to to remaining inactive at nauplia obtained leave to follow rest however supposing that fall of town be inevitable justly desiring that who have prevented fleet coming to rescue must share in spoil remained in gulf out of shot of turkish gun in fort waited for end so once again revenge sophia started on turkish trail in eastern sea ottoman fleet have passed outside hydra giving wide berth for feared stinging nest of wasp day after two greek ship passed close under lee so a to cut off corner from path taken by enemy fleet for having left course be certainly to constantinople to capsina island seemed remote distant from life external to lounging lad have come between to loomed gigantic larger than life yet though be nearer field of vision knew further than when thought of incommunicable loneliness be food of heart day after passing turkish fleet huddled together like flock of sheep guarded by great clumsy men of war sailed in half circle with brig schooner a vanguard again came into sight advancing slowly northward evidently heading a expected for constantinople kanaris landed at native island psara there bought couple of rickety hardly seaworthy caiques be good enough however for purpose for wanted after spending day there purchasing necessary oil fuel for fire ship went northward again after turk caught up only when be clear of archipelago two greek brig kept well out of range of big turkish gun for own be light in comparison must have to come perilously close to big men of war to fire with effect day after day wind be so light breath that must have be impossible to approach with fire ship except very slowly whereas speed be almost essential to success moreover in open sea two caiques coming up from two rakish looking brig might have attracted attention even of indolently minded so waited keeping out to west of turk till must approach northern group of island outside hellespont there with shelter of land near probability of squally wind from high ground of troad favorable opportunity might offer mitsos kanaris be to sail one other be intrusted to two psarian sailor who professed to know use that month of attendance dancing on turk be strangely pleasant to capsina since interview with suleima self control have begun to be habit with sort of crust over fire of passion so to speak must bear weight of daily hourly sociability with mitsos for day have fed on diet of wisdom taking dose like sick man in pill capsule tasteless seemed useless yet course be operative now that capsina be friend of family spoke often of wife to girl by degree such talk be le bitter to in hearing have faced inevitable in manner accepted though sight of lad touch of be le keenly dear though that be held incomparable charm for knew now that what be so much to be nothing to for part be in customary exuberance of boyishness with control not le heroical showed lightness naturalness must not deceive so normal be manner of intercourse with by st of november be passing lesbos on east on th for day by day went by without more than hour two of breeze in circle of windless hour island be still blue cloud on southeast next day however began to feel backwater from current out of hellespont move up coast kanaris knew that there be one chance more only before ship reached mouth of strait be safe under castle guarded that day came on board revenge towed two caiques with psarians who be to sail second laid plan before capsina hang said on whether take narrow channel between tenedos land go outside island if go outside will have to make attempt in open sea that like littlest bit for can not have failed to see revenge so that must seem to approach from indeed by now when caique come from greek brig know what that caique mean mean will have long sail first said capsina long row afterwards not only that said kanaris whole fleet will see in open so must make attempt by night be far le sure job happened in gulf of nauplia remarked mitsos be not acquainted with fire ship then said kanaris whereas now between one thing be no longer stranger if pas between island main land first have better chance of breeze secondly can not make strait at night for be narrow there be current therefore will anchor for night can approach very early in morning in addition revenge can shelter unseen behind headland so will be near to also fleet will be scattered can choose ship run le risk from rest two day afterwards tenedos rose from north still wind sprang up turkish fleet sidled lumbered along with sail spread to catch slightest breeze hanging day idly next morning however brisker air sprang up from west making five knot hour drew rapidly closer by three o'clock be already clear that turk meant to pas inside island wind continuing showing sign of increasing towards revenge towed caiques stopped to pick up kanaris two psarians leaving sophia hove to to wait for return wind have swept clear sky myriad star made gray shimmering of brightness on water sufficient to sail by carried light for hour after sunset lantern on turk be visible a mitsos remarked where can see light thence can light be seen tenedos comely in shape a woman tall drew near black against sky on port bow on starboard bow be light of nearest turkish ship wind still holding cast anchor under shadow of land mile away from where turk be anchored like wolf have followed trail here be lair night be very brisk fresh west wind sang through cool air under shelter of land water be smooth in mirror star shone wheeled with scarcely le clearness than overhead planet low in east have risen above hill of troad traced across water silvery path scarcely le luminous than young moon soon after midnight kanaris mitsos cast off in one caique psarians in other with capsina waving farewell good luck rowed out of sheltered bay till must get wind have hardly gone furlong from land when wind dropped again be left becalmed current of backwater however drifted gradually on though diagonally to proper path yet diminishing distance between turk on dropping of wind mist rose about mast high from surface of water light from turkish ship showed blurred fogged ripple washed idly against boat rocking gently to fro otherwise be in vast silence kanaris frowned frowned man be frown be devil work mitsos said there be nothing to be done to row in darkness a near a dare wait for wind if there be none hour before dawn will simply row up to nearest turk set light to fire ship will not please if there be wind where be use asked flame will rise straight will toast bread in fire then spit at till go out also can not pick vessel in dark said kanaris well must do best come lad row rowed on cautiously silently till blurred light began to show clearer through mist second caique be little astern soon joined other kanaris told what to do giving mitsos first watch lay down sleep be on a speedy calm a if be in own house at home mitsos sat with oar in hand by kept same position towards light of turkish ship whistled softly to kept eye on greek sailor beacon star dipping of be signal for waking kanaris le phlegmatic than other heart beat full fast at risk adventure of next day pictured to how must run ship in contrasted with shudder pleasing excitement of adventure with flaming horror of other at nauplia when beacon dipped awoke kanaris latter wide awake at once took oar from looked round dreamed there be fine wind blowing said good sleep to little mitsos be in aqueous light of dim hour before dawn when kanaris awoke air be tingling cold mist of night be drifting eastward between tenedos to west mile away sea view be clear in front little mist still hung between nearest turk furlong off farther to east be still thick kanaris have smile for look said be already clearing wet finger will feel cold from west oh mitsos dream be true wind will be here with dawn dawn be waking together mitsos sniffed with head thrown back be so said smell there be two ship near said kanaris of biggest kind farther one take nearer psarians pray god be not utterly fool with wind must burn that ship with tobacco pipe mitsos smiled sleepily hugely fine big tobacco pipe be caique said be sail fastened have done while slept said kanaris look see if satisfies turpentine only remains there be can will do now after more tobacco be drawback to fire ship said mitsos kanaris have nailed sail to mast so that must stay there burning till canvas be consumed fastened yard with chain so that too must blaze until be entirely burned not drop brushwood have piled in bow half mast high only remained to pour can of turpentine over sail deck fuel even a be thus employed star paled be quenched with first definite saffron light in east sudden shiver shook sail boat lifted moved little after moment whisper came from east sail flapped then began to draw kanaris mitsos went to stern then kanaris took rudder while mitsos kindled oil lamp soaked little dry moss with turpentine wherewith to fire ship sudden rose flush leaped up to zenith from east boat rose to new born ripple came down with cluck into trough of one star only a if forgotten hung unextinguished in sky wind have yet scarcely reached turkish ship still hung on anchor stern swung round by current presenting starboard broadside to wind now blew shrill steady taking caique along with hissing forefoot strained canvas already kanaris mitsos have passed under bow of first turkish ship be not hundred yard from second when psarian sailor set light too soon to fire ship jumping into boat towed behind rowed away kanaris gave one grunt of dissatisfaction for saw that have miscalculated time that fire ship must only just catch in bowsprit of turk also that have fired too soon giving alarm perhaps to others wind be brisk have hardly turned head again when mitsos said quietly be time kanaris nodded put helm hard aport jumped into boat behind a mitsos thrust into heap of brushwood at bottom of mast pile of burning moss have kindled at lantern have calculated distance to precision fire ship struck a mitsos jumped staggering with shock into smaller boat just abaft forechains be instantly glued to side of turk by force of wind in moment pillar of flame leaped from deck to top of mast eddy of fire shot out like sword stroke across deck of turk next moment brushwood in bow caught rose screaming curtain of fire over forepart of other be fire ship of psarians without use to have caught only in bowsprit be even then drifting harmlessly away to leeward at least burned bravely poured out dense volume of smoke coming down wind hid from victim half blinded choked with yet grateful took up oar rowed away south till be safe distance from anchored ship did not stop till be half mile from then panting exhausted paused looked back flame be well hold of ship a mounted triumphed roared with great hollow uproar of bellowing kanaris stroked beard complacently will that be enough for to toast bread by little mitsos said be

making nothing of thought more prudent to be silent christos equally puzzled hushed understand said be true enough next day set sail again for nauplia blockading fleet be stationed outside harbor having anchored capsina with kanaris mitsos went off to admiral ship to make report a news spread from crew to crew shouting rose redoubled suleima who have come down with littlest one on news of arrival to quay must scarce get at mitsos for press for time two have to be content with letting eye seek find other from afar saying that be well with capsina have gone back to ship be alone chapter xvii last day of beleaguered town have begun be only from fear of treachery not ala unwarranted on part of greek that besieged still held out scene at capitulation of navarin not eighteen month old

magnificent sound of gun smoke of firing carried too far kolocotrones still encamped on top of dervenaki in hope that turkish garrison of nauplia must attempt to cut way through greek escape to corinth be waiting there for end seeing that most part of treasure of nauplia be exhausted in purchasing provision that fine harvest might be expected from ransom of turk of rank who escaped must pas over hill of dervenaki must thus gain honor of capture also what be dearer to money of ransom repeated volley from palamede while firing came from lower town must mean one thing be turk opening fire on greek must use gun of lower fortress at shorter range rather than of palamede again answer came from side burdjee fleet also practised ear must distinguish even at distance hollow buffet of blank

sweeter after food early next morning mitsos be on quay having spent night at home returning to ship to ask if capsina must not come day to see a passed kolocotrones tent came out recognized mitsos codones be not said connected with clan of maina have heard of business of yours kanaris with fire ship be not badly done be not badly done mitsos bristled like collie dog manner of man be insufferable a say be not badly done remarked there be booty to be got by turned on heel kolocotrones broke out into great laugh be rather proud than otherwise at own adeptness in matter of plunder be sulky silent folk of maina said mitsos turned back again slowly let eye rest on level with top of spike of kolocotrones helmet little men have very fine helmet said that struck home kolocotrones face flared be of army must have whipped snarled be of navy just now said mitsos yet if will come whip will call three four men to help waited moment then turned again kolocotrones itched to send knife into a kanaris mitsos be just now most popular pair in greece be difficult to say exactly where such action must end for very likely in ooze of harbor at nauplia mitsos have not gone dozen pace when buzzing murmur rose grew into shout pasty panos rushed out pointed to wall above northern gate of nauplia white flag be flying there kolocotrones saw slapped thigh be ever so cried come surrender mitsos must not resist parting shot not so cried come hungry be filled pocket be heavy go then on errand of mercy good luck to bargain kolocotrones looked angrily round popularity with men being due to fact that so put on equality with found laughing a if joke have be directed against one of not against general from side men poured out of tent to look at flag mitsos found in crowd of to whom news of last fire ship have only come when arrived with kolocotrones be pulled way made to drink wine have to tell story again yet again presently after panos also bearing flag of truce be sent up to conduct turk down to council of chief kolocotrones be chairman with be miaulis admiral of fleet poniropoulos hypsilantes petrobey selim ali governor of argo represented besieged be pitiful to see even two of hated pasha so weak with lack of food yet with fine manner of race bowed smiled on way through crowd exchanged little compliment with panos in rather halting greek spoke of freshness of morning mitsos have shouldered way back through press recognizing being recognized by friend selim who have promised to put knife into if ever met except in time of truce hardly knew man with rough sort of kindness half of pity half of mockery from inborn joy of seeing foe like took loaf from baker cart standing near gave to for to morrow at least said seeing hungry gratitude leaped to man eye be ashamed at having done so little at half taunt in word selim have taken one fine bite out of before entered tent of kolocotrones be with watering mouth waiting for stood with concealed under soldier cloak in sitting down fell back from shoulder before have time to shift loaf to new concealment kolocotrones have seen broke out into hoarse rude laugh pointing at truly be time to come to term said when pasha snatch loaf a go by eat man will talk after selim bowed with permission will said for came in haste morning without breakfast kolocotrones laughed again maybe without dinner last night cried selim raised eyebrow a if in silent deprecation of rudeness of inferior be not worth breath to answer breaking loaf in half passed one part with quiet dignity to ali who took without haste ate like man already surfeited kolocotrones wriggled in chair with coarse delight warrant taste good said ali looked at moment without speaking then be here to discus term of capitulation understand said not matter of diet must be little food for discussion there said kolocotrones unabashed grinning at poniropoulos who went into wide mouthed toothless laughter ali merely shrugged shoulder continued to eat bread slowly indeed be strange reversing of position of turkish pasha greek countryman in spite of long year when turk have ground down even to starvation oppressed province seemed breach of manner to other officer that two of must sit cutting blunt joke at men whom wheel of destiny have brought low in revolution whom have altogether failed to rob of dignity of high breeding in very stress publicity of misfortune when have finished ali spoke again selim pasha be here said to ask what term will give for capitulation for offer same a offered before safe transport not such transport a be given to at navarin looked at poniropoulos to asia minor retention of one third of property be now six month since ship be to transport be spoken of imagine must be ready be six month ago since proposal be made said kolocotrones becoming suddenly business like for six month longer have siege expense of siege be maintained must find something different to moreover treasure in nauplia be not same a be then where have gone said ali if not to pocket of greek from where did provision come asked kolocotrones except from whither treasure have gone ali laughed be there not considerable balance asked kolocotrones screwed up eye in malevolent amusement have not lately examined account what if there be bargain be made gave provision received money well have made proposal in hour time will hear ours petrobey rose quarter be close gentleman said may give lodging refreshment there while consult ali selim accordingly withdrew petrobey having conducted to quarter where yanni be charged with giving food returned to kolocotrones tent already high word be passing not on subject of term of capitulation for seemed to be secondary matter in mind at least of kolocotrones poniropoulos a to how booty must subsequently be divided kolocotrones be on foot stamping thumping table who be appointed commander in chief by council cried be who will take possession of nauplia be who will receive distribute booty miaulis who be seated have hitherto taken part in discussion at spoke distribution of kolocotrones said blandly lord help be disconcerting for even kolocotrones acknowledged integrity honesty of young admiral must make tu quoque rejoinder then what do propose asked that who have besieged nauplia for month have one to represent in division of booty said with wonderful frank manner of expect fair play from general kolocotrones be reason why must not see that obtain petrobey rose to foot that opportunity for have be waiting ever since nikolas have given example at tripoli be come be not at siege of tripoli admiral said be in least expect fair play from kolocotrones oh hear out will be gainer even kolocotrones warn if get hold of treasure of nauplia not piaster will see what have share in siege be that have sold provision to garrison at starvation rate once already at tripoli must have made name of greece scoffing by word have not be for deed of better wiser man than of nikolas who stormed place out by hand at dervenaki what did do let albanian by a know for that claimed out of what niketas took thirty thousand piaster so be warned now can only follow example of nikolas withdraw from assembly hard blow be better than hard word to taste at least better than money mainats go with for take that siege be over petrobey distinctly have last word last word be true one knew that spoke fact about kolocotrones none must say that spoke from interested motif rose a finished turned to kolocotrones give notice said that mainats be withdrawn work of siege being over miaulis jumped to foot good go with petrobey said must that fleet be a loyal to a mainats be god know what might happen if went back saying that have resigned claim to booty there must think be admiral le doubt if there must be so many general petrobey shook hand warmly with went out leaving silence in tent many mainats be collected outside voice a spoke to be distinctly heard mainats be withdrawn said march in hour clear young voice answered have greedy old brigand be doing uncle asked be silent mitsos said petrobey inside miaulis giggled audibly prince hypsilantes visibly smiled even kolocotrones took moment to recover recovered completely for be time to think of dignity when spoil of nauplia be yet dangling will arrange claim of fleet said again miaulis interrupted have not yet arranged who take possession of nauplia rather who take possession of treasure said for propose that be registered in presence of here assembled kolocotrones must not well afford to quarrel not only with rest of army with whole fleet from outside murmur ever rising shriller higher a cause doubt of withdrawal of mainats became known warned not to go too far whole greek fleet be there if be determined to exercise prerogative of commander in chief be not at sure that might not determine to resist while still hesitated miaulis spoke again represent entire fleet said fleet prevented help coming to nauplia by sea also if so order fleet will storm place be appointed may remind by council appointed kolocotrones kolocotrones lost head temper by blood of saint cried what do want voice in matter said miaulis do not trust stormed fleet who know have reason to trust said miaulis be in interest of fleet others know cried kolocotrones pointing to hypsilantes poniropoulos petrobey knew said miaulis kolocotrones drew back upper lip from over teeth showed in snarl if have to yield must yield only step by step nauplia then will be taken possession of by admiral miaulis said representing fleet army be that agreed be not agreed cried poniropoulos came here yesterday kolocotrones what of mine who have stood burden of siege demand that treasure be registered divided in just proportion who receives submission of town care not be fine thing said kolocotrones bitterly when commander in chief have to be watched like school boy lest must steal sweet again there be silence in tent only outside murmur of men rose higher almost to roar by tear of virgin will not stand screamed now red flaming refuse to accept spying checking miaulis held up hand seems that many call for said part be done fleet be represented in matter by own promise will leave general to settle about claim of army at end of hour ali selim again entered tent on term of capitulation at rate be agreed turk be to retain single suit of clothes quilt for bedding carpet for prayer be to be safely transported to asia minor being fed on way property be to pas into hand of greek received proposal in silence withdrew

tombazes capsina hypsilantes be to take joint possession of property in nauplia hypsilantes be appointed arbitrator be to settle claim for division of in case of dispute town must be occupied jointly by kolocotrones miaulis in name of republic sooner be arrangement made known than tumult of discontent among men rose to head poniropoulos band distrusted commander a much a commander distrusted kolocotrones kolocotrones men who have taken part in siege have expected share in booty hearing that general must certainly have finger in auguring ill for own chance fraternized with troop of poniropoulos determined to resist arrangement must put whole into hand of four five men already fattened by marketing with besieged mainats discontented yet top heavy with pride at action of petrobey knowing that alone be out of disgraceful quarrel grinned sardonically told others might a well leave too for not piaster must see order be issued that man must go to barrack be disobeyed men gathered gathered round gate through commander must enter nauplia threatening to storm place declaring that must not allow chief to appropriate everything below in kolocotrones tent sat men who have be chosen to enter place knew that own faithlessness avarice have raised storm of distrust must not deny justice of be powerless to quell meantime in citadel assembly of hungry face hollow eye debated proposal of greek term be hard not preposterous for case be hopeless if refused greek fleet a knew must shell wall into stone dust done knew what to expect pillage massacre at end shamble ali selim alone held out have seen greed in eye of kolocotrones ali spoke may a well have value of money said chief will again agree to sell provision doubt not till be exhausted be pretty sure case can not be worse let surrender when money be finished others be against greek soldier be mutinous crowd at gate be impossible that must allow chief to sell provision again till treasury be empty troop be utterly out of hand moment might storm place must be navarin then came one of wonderful incident raise history to level more romantic than romance of wizard be assembled in room of fort looking over gulf selim be opposite window gazed out moment vaguely then focussed eye with more intentness rose from seat english frigate said simply that decided selim ali still held out from sort of barren pride in hour capitulation be drawn out signed selim looked again have anchored next admiral ship said boat with officer be going ashore while be going forward kolocotrones have made attempt to stop riot be made of bravery have gone out alone to face scowling threatening riot slapped one on back scolded stormed at gave tobacco to third told coarse story to fourth day of gorilla blandishment be over pleaded order of greek government fear of massacre if soldier be let into place found only black look unconvinced silence then came news that english frigate have entered harbor for moment men mind be turned to new development in situation crowd did not leave gate kolocotrones returned captain hamilton of cambrian frigate of war have be for year in charge of ship at ionian island spoke greek with colloquial fluency be known personally to kolocotrones other chief who much respected in appearance be admirably calculated to influence soldier be tall well made of saxon type blue eye fair voice rang true manner be hearty open child of air mountain who make judgment of man for most part not erroneously more by how look than by what say regarded at first with friendly eye when message to kolocotrones be made known with mind of admiration deed of capitulation be handed out of fortress just a kolocotrones turned from crowd of men have vainly tried to pacify to meet hamilton with in hand went back to tent hamilton be already there word be short greatly to point hear there be dispute about division of booty what not said that concern not what have seen be that now while capitulation be in hand of chief mob of soldier besiege town gate what may mean know know now tell if certain disgraceful thing happened at tripoli at navarin athens happen also at nauplia to rest of europe greece will appear a
