malady quite seriously though performs ordinary routine of life with correctness performs somehow subaqueously indeed be never quite from time seed of malady first attack symptom be temporarily ameliorated when to go back to first simile egg be laid for time nurse be encouraged to hope that worst be over large quantity of what be known a sermon paper must be given without stint special care taken that there must be in room where patient can possibly desire to sit plenty of black ink suitable pen for day two may refuse to go out altogether play game here be mistake on part of nurse to urge to do so may in fact be entirely left to probably favourable symptom will last for week two during supply of sermon paper must be renewed then change for worse come over patient irritability return with attack more le severe of complete idleness indescribable misgiving again express wish for settled income in consols often go suddenly to stay with friend if disease be not so acute merely lunch dines out day seems to fear being left alone then malady becomes spasmodic period of inaction alternate with period of feverish industry to succeeds attack of apparent coma with regard to

chapter more rarely inserted since in first m find that much more commonly say too much than too little here be opening for critic to point out how extraordinarily superfluous first m must have be period be tiresome part of hatching of egg writing of first m astounding though may appear be attended by certain excitement whereas writing of second be due to desire will call to catch one tripping to detect by painful process of copying one perhaps of hundred absurdity one have committed yet there be certain delight even in for since one must not set pen to paper at unless one thought one have idea of kind be mildly pleasant even now when first excitement be over to see in cool blood what idea be to emphasize what appear to be decent point to suppress bad one after that second m go to

single wicket at cricket because must ever get other out long jump because dick must jump just about twice a far a whole pentathlon have to be decided on one day so that staying power counted for something then stormy day must come too bad for man beast to be abroad in have pentathlon of intellect playing chess draught backgammon poetry game halma in feverish succession here too game at card be barred because of dick strange inability to grasp hang of card game merely fell asleep over so that made quits in matter of long jump in fact balance be in favour since there be only one long jump

mention age now there have always be in life third person girl rather younger than of neighbour in town country distant cousin of dick for year dick have liked margery have necessarily despised because be girl then there succeeded year when have begun to be men not boy margery not girl woman contempt ceased be so kind of three formed what may call alliance of laughter margery be always present at pentathlon acted a umpire in case of dispute be even allowed to join in then quite suddenly became aware that have fallen in love with be in manner knew be at conclusion of golf item in pentathlon on eighteenth green dick have holed out last putt won from have also won from margery margery have long putt of ten yard to halve with looked at for time be standing with back to sun so that brown hair be flushed gilded with eye very blue vivid with thought be intent on line to hole mouth be little drooped white line of teeth showed below lip suddenly said yes see putted ball travelled smoothly along turf threw arm wide going in cried what darling a ball dropped into hole looked up at then something caught in breath be no longer margery knew that stood there who be completion perfection woman to man for time old intimacy of alliance of laughter went on externally suppose a before think laughed le contested a many pentathlon made plan for day of dick leave usually abandoned for subsequent improvisation then not more than week afterwards there came day when margery have to go to town dick be left alone be coming back in evening be to go to station to meet have tea there ride bicycle back over ridge of ashdown forest down home in time to be exceedingly late for dinner afternoon be very hot sultry dick abandoned game at tennis have begun for be

eye though lying there be in reality waiting for train at victoria platform started in five minute have two hour run before then dick sat up look here said ive something to tell there doubt about ive fallen in love think knew almost before spoke what must say certainly before spoke again knew what be coming yes margery went on god have fallen in love turned brown eye suddenly from hot reeling landscape in front to why jack said whats matter look queer somehow dick be be sure asked that look queer that have fallen in love with margery sure youll be sure enough when do same there mistake about can tell why margery be whole point of pentathlon now have be so to for last week said dick said nothing for minute then below breath what do mean asked that be in same boat said how long have

margery waiting for on platform looking for oppressive stagnation of day like nymph of grecian waterway dick looked thirstily on feared to meet others eye for life love be in balance be friend that evening when others have gone to bed sat on in chair have be taken for coolness out of smoking room on to lawn odour of hot summer night hung heavily nothing stirred in windless air except that from

enemy whom goodness sweetness have slain dined with great gaiety foolishness dinner be succeeded by absurd game in two member of alliance of laughter did wonder for cause then margery mother went upstairs strolled into garden again to smoke for hour before going to bed with reaction of laughter rather strong upon feeling in spite of what have happened before dinner vaguely disquieted depressed mind went back dwelt with curious insistence on hallucination of dick voice night before then even while be pondering on strangeness of telling must have be asleep suddenly heard clang of gate leading from road to front door on other side of house followed by crunching of gravel after moment sound of front door bell at sudden nameless fear leaped into heart before bell sounded again be at front door outside be telegraph boy with war office telegram addressed to margery took from closed door quietly stood there with in hand struck motionless incapable of thought then upstairs heard door open next moment name be called by margery voice half strangled struggling for utterance jack jack what be called what be what be next moment saw leaning over banister of landing above hair down with dressing gown on saw what held in hand will bring up to please jack open there said faintly heard banister creak a leaned on clutched then mother hurried out of room put arm round can hear tearing of

lamp seemingly motionless while to right left tree house went noiselessly by wind blew steadily in spite of turn of road from direction in be speeding then lamp post of town began have sense to go somewhat more slowly for fear of being taken up so delayed then crossing high street came to square red brick house for interminable time so seemed to waited on doorstep then door be opened by impassive man servant dr carlton be at dinner there be party a soon a came out message must be delivered remember saying must go into dining room unless must see at once then after interminable delay

must sit still sir if be can hardly have be hour from time telegram first came to when cart with inside drew up at margerys house against porch leaned bicycle lamp still burning light saw be burning in bedroom directly over door standing on chair inside hall be dr carltons hat small black bag on floor close by be pink sheet of telegram must have dropped when ran upstairs even then remember clinging in desperate dazed fashion to hope that be dream that telegram must prove to be trivial absurdity picked up read again then sat down waited from time to time there be muffled sound of footstep movement above then silence again then more step then heard door open above droning voice knew to be margerys speaking in level meaningless tone then doctor voice said sharply yes be in bag bring upstairs if dont understand with bag in hand met servant hurrying downstairs sobbing in helpless manner took bag from without word went up again step by step after have heard door close moved to top of stair sat there below clock in hall beat out metallic minute once hour twelve only struck through fanlight above front door must see lamp of doctor dogcart three four time moved away after minute so returned again to same spot at interval terrible droning voice came from margerys room how long thing lasted can not say must have be le than two hour for knew hall clock struck once only then droning voice ceased altogether in place came short incisive sentence in man voice purport of of course must not hear then came cry of child knew that in midst of death be in life then a if have be drawn by cord crept nearer nearer to door of room cry of child still sounded cry of dick child dick oh dick if brave blithe spirit in paradise of god now free of habitation of flesh keep watch a surely must over love come here come here where there be so sore need of comforting speak to through frail tabernacle of time space comfort soul love if law of world permit come later in long night dr

be perfectly conscious for time after birth of child with consciousness have returned knowledge of husband death have relapsed again into semi comatose state proposed to wait visiting from time to time till must feel more happy about twice before dawn broke tried to go to bed a many time crept downstairs again to where dr carlton sat in drawing room genial florid face looking more anxious troubled time returned from visit upstairs then just a morning broke in thin red line on horizon heard voice call to went upstairs beckoned to to come in margery be lying in bed propped up on pillow eye be closed sat by bedside waited have taken baby away only mother knelt there with eye fixed on margerys face suddenly raised head little opened eye saw thank said thank for being here jack dick be waiting for yes dick raised little more seemed to struggle for breath be morning said let in morning even a pulled curtain aside raised blind there dawned on everlasting day july have told about may of three year ago june of two year ago because two month be so dedicated in mind to what happened then that while month be running can not free from live in present year have not certain such date in year day on live not on day be now passing on certain day in year long past there be foolish proverb say that people be happy who have history in other word be better to be cow than man can not see if will not bore if in fact may june be ever so little human to will tell quite shortly little more of if on other hand doe bore leave out next four page believe death be not so terrible what be terrible be thought that be so learn how false thought be death will not terrify for what lie behind god who died for if be wrong if be not so nothing whatever seems to to matter can look on death a on flea bite believing a do that beyond death even a on side of be god when life have ended a of margery dick so utterly without reproach when two soul have be so splendidly human a be seems that god must have be knowing what be about when allowed that bullet blindly illogical a may seem to to end life a surely a ended can understand existence of lifelong regret bitterness if thing have not be well done if man died from obvious carelessness of kind from weak persistence in bad habit then one might say if have be otherwise have done duty duty implied death death only grope dimly after what believe to be true implied hers doe seem to stoical unhuman view ah believe be not so must have be very easy for one who loved to take point of view find life dull objectless without interest merriment must have be better must have be better to have turned aside from other thing saying can not rather than to have steadfastly said can until well until one must day know on day when slam kitten stand between earth heaven in midst of four pine slam say oh be nice there will meet one who died on african upland one on whose grave sweet pea be yearly odorous will know other god will look on greeting give other well pleased how will be can not guess be only sure that will be so atheist dyspeptic two be much same may laugh if enjoy laugh so much better for so be living now on outskirt of town where margery dick lived together for one month of life on morning of st of july know may june have ended go back to ordinary little daily affair have be telling about up till end of april many great little thing have happened extraordinary conduct of jackmanni cat from next door once disinterred seems to to claim first attention have be planted against warm south westerly wall have be pampered like only child for yard round soil have be enriched dead leaf be diligently picked off really did must to make happy instead of being happy sulked did not die must have be regrettable incident anyhow proper decisive line of conduct sulked grew little for week put out several leaf then couldnt be bothered leaf withered again then sent out long tendril across gravel path instead of climbing up stick led to house wall coaxed that tendril gently back gave alternative route to house wall nothing must please finally tied to alternative route so died be willing to give thing facility for behaving so transplanted to different place where got le sun more wind also tried watering le for week appreciated enormously set about growing in earnest then one morning suppose got bored again began to wither slowly from top downwards now must not spend life in moving one absurd jackmanni from place to place though have doubt that if have done so taken to stay in other house given champagne

full of odour of complete summer sat for hour in big wooden shelter now stand finished on strip of lawn squared account happens to be birthday be thirty year old le a added up profit loss be horribly puzzled how to make affair balance for if one sits down by one self with conceivable object in world to see how one stand be probable that one be moderately honest with one self for to be otherwise

seems to of doubtful gain for there be so many indisputably good real pursuit in world that can not possibly be worth while pursuing what may not be wholly good may possibly be not wholly real here have certain small right to speak for in last year have given up something seemed to of possibly doubtful gain have found that be wise step have given up be singularly known a world once thought that be good thing to see hundred of people to multiply acquaintance to be able to say charming party be there naming people who really concerned a little a really concerned telling even then think have secret notion of conscience salving that to live in bubble roar of world be stimulating so no doubt be stimulant be not necessarily healthy thus seemed to one can only speak for one to come under head of doubtful gain be quite certain gain to study habit of ill content jackmanni be sorry for introducing again can not get over be quite certain gain to read good book to try to learn fugue prelude provided of course incidental pain to others be not more than must be reasonably asked to bear to be in open air above to do work whatever be if have none get hardly matter at what be so long a be harmless merely to go from dinner to dance be doubtful gain must do better at least must to talk to friend for hour then if wish for crowd merely a often do walk for ten minute up down piccadilly for if doe not give food want may be sure will not find anywhere else most fascinating hobby though expect be extremely easy to give too much time to be pursuit of health certainly be more easy of accomplishment to most people than pursuit of happiness one to very large extent implies other for pursuer of happiness for most part be hedonist think herein err very greatly that to multiply pleasure tends to make one happy in point of fact doe nothing of kind for pleasure be to extent obtainable by most people whereas happiness be almost completely matter of temperament happy temperament can not possibly have anything to do with pleasure amount of pleasure will foster at whereas if have got happy temperament almost everything by mysterious alchemy be turned into pleasure even a rose tree turn root fibre suck from earth into blossom certainly health be great help to happiness for to be well really well make mere living a browning say joy at time seems enough to be alive for must rather be bilious man with pleasure of world at disposal well with book of verse underneath bough thrush maybe singing of what must be above keenness of perception in fact soberly believe to be greatest cause of happiness so necessarily of pleasure since happiness turn most trivial incident sensation of moment into pleasure be within reach so inextricably be mind soul bound up with body apart from great spiritual enthusiasm ecstasy keenness of perception can scarcely be reached except through certain cleanly healthiness in fact presupposes temperament of almost divine serenity to enjoy day on one have influenza whereas there be sort of health be probably within reach of most people in from heightened keenness of perception brings with smallest thing be cause of joy laughter may sound mere vain piece of optimism truth of matter be that three quarter of world be not nearly so well a can must be almost everybody in fact be greedy lazy laziness greed be more certain progenitor of discontent than other ancestor can think of to eat rather more than one want to drink rather more than one must be to feel disinclined for one work one pleasure to be disinclined for thing mean with most of to miss pleasure of doing to be inclined for work pleasure implies that find nugget of happiness therein for be alchemy of inclination turn trivial incident to gold for keenness turn dross of mere achievement into happiness be thus that happy temperament may most readily be cultivated by who have not naturally got have royal birthright worth more to possessor than piled crown of great power by others have to be cultivated to cultivate keenness of perception by mean of health be simplest most practicable method organ in ill health mainly resides be to put matter frankly liver because a rule eat drink too much avoid air a if be strychnine take enough exercise thus prescription be worth trying eat drink le open window more if work permit of be out of door more may of course be easily possible that to do work properly have to sit in stuffy room neglect health somewhat if so let health take care of by mean get through with work short of let health receive attention deserves be very sound investment will yield excellent return dear god in spite of may june how happy allow to be how have allowed in consideration of foolishness to find in life so much happiness to day for instance golden sun be swung in blue sky when awoke only half dressed breakfasted in shelter in garden where be writing now three yard off be jackmanni with purple bud little

week went on though never consciously dwelt on thought yet somehow thought seemed to grow there in dusk of mind until knew that subconscious brain be full of more especially desired to remain in ignorance of who intruder for so thought of be a long a remained utterly vague unknown must feel definite incarnated resentment if once be visualized felt that growth in shadow might peer out with poisonous leaf into sunlight of active conscious thought have tried to put incoherency coherently feel be drawing with definite outline that be necessarily ill defined in other way except by word of definite meaning can one indicate impression however mist like let then say at once that what have said be overstated in sense that if one try to draw actual phantom of nightmare be overstated because to state at be to lose pervading vagueness for hard outline on other hand again what have written down be think understated since try in vain to convey by word vague abiding disquiet felt at thought of owner of furniture van unloaded at door only a have said lurked in shadow though grew yet by persistent refusal to think directly of by persistently endeavouring to continue in ignorance of whom new tenant be dark growth never emerged into sunlight seems curious irony of fate so soon after have written about road to happiness phantasmal unreal ghost must arise to poison joy at rate be not exaggerated language for thought of house tenanted once more lay like shadow over spirit be wholly unable at rate thought be come to same thing to banish shadow from mind haunted waking sleeping thought with dull never ceasing weight who hardly ever dream then only of astounding mirthful adventure groped nightly about ill lit passage believed to be passage in house in intolerable apprehension sometimes so seemed to certain room be vividly lit inside through crack below door through chink of door ajar saw that there be bright light inside room yet cast filtering illumination into passage through have to feel way at other time whole house be wrapped in misty obscurity be not light of early morning yet dusk of falling night something almost palpable to touch be a if gray veil of future brushed across eye unseen hand stirring a if to lift away in dream eye must strain into darkness for light must show what agency moved about dream be very persistent occurred in dim sequence many time during night always opened in same way on falling asleep passed straight into nebulous atmosphere have tried to describe be walking up to margerys house for darkness never must see more of than square shape blot against blotted sky door be always open groping in passage began be conscious always of many presence close round dusk hid into lighted room never must enter for be somehow forbidden then one night entirely new dream came sandwiched between dream of dusk in be going along road to house not wrapped in obscurity in brilliant sunshine bird trilled in bush flower of extraordinary brilliance grew in hedgerow thought with upleap of exultation that passage must be blind longer then turned corner came on house though knew be right one yet have changed almost beyond recognition step led to front door be cracked ridden creeper have so grown that hung in curtain over window indescribable air of age have passed over room over front door margerys room be untouched by gray hand of time wall be still smooth seemed to brick newly pointed creeper be cut back from window be wide open from inside came voice singing sang song margery always loved though voice be like hers yet be not quite like be with wildest hope expectation entered house once again though be bright outside passage be dark groped way upstairs saw that door of margerys room stood open there framed in misty obscurity stood figure must be hers line for line repeated that form knew so well slight bend of neck outward sweep of shoulder be hers in darkness gazed gazed for veil seemed to brush upwards against eye did not lift in agony cried out margery margery be own voice suppose awoke for found seated up in bed night outside be still very dark hot heard hissing of steady rain on shrub so lay down again must have gone to sleep immediately for without conscious pause be back in dark passage a usual once again on same night new factor appeared in dream for presence though still invisible be inaudible no longer footstep passed about around very close for long time listened heard none concerned at last there came one knew to be dick with went be margerys passed near went out suppose to garden never occurred to to follow for be outside life somehow if came near other be that came near to after that step of many stranger passed repassed then once more heard margerys footstep alone when came close knew be not margerys like a singing voice be like hers then slowly a at hint of dawn dim passage began to grow bright looked to see where margery be brightness a grew showed only wall furniture of own room through open window came in pale light of early day a morning breeze flapped blind now by time dream of dark passage have lasted about week day betwixt night have be full of corresponding depression for by night be darkness troubled by day shadow of new folk who be coming to live there then came that night have described simultaneously dream of dark passage depression by day ceased entirely altogether went back at once to dreamless night to be accustomed day be once more mosaic of happy hour heaviness of day ill defined fear of night be so blackening to spirit at time soberly thought that madness have begun to lay finger on brain now that no longer fear that find wondering what must have induced melancholy weather be true be extremely hot depressing for whole week be also true be working against time at piece of work did not wish to do before have be day at knew that be distasteful before have be two at felt sure be not worth while to do at now being temporarily bored with one work be one thing radical disapproval be may easily happen to bring about situation rightly several chapter of what seems to one at time very likely be sorry stuff have to be hammered into shape due preparation for situation have to be made without giving situation away only when come reader must say to of course must be so why didnt think of radical disapproval be far different matter be rank immorality to go on spending time pain over what be worthless worse that rank immorality committed then when work in question oppressive weather disordered dream began simultaneously also ended simultaneously felt that be highly probable that be bound up together certainly be more than possible that reacted on other that thunder in sky led to general depression that made immorality sit heavy on induced gloom by day be carried over into night again fact slept in shadow brought shadow into day fact spent hour unprofitably knew predisposed to gloomy vision at same time persistence of same dream be curious society collect nightmare be at liberty to put on pin such however be record of what happened during first week of august thereafter ensued three spoilt day spoilt not by outside agency by fussy stupidity on part to ordinary citizen such spoiling mean nothing for in probability will never experience thus to trial of three day be senseless given that household comprises only plain very plain cook what must be called in london general though such have idea of campaign will appeal to minority to know that question of what one wanted for ten day at bayreuth perhaps week wandering in germany be crucial be use saying vaguely a suppose one doe to valet will be away for ten day pack seriatim have to think of must conceivably want result be that early on second day found that have packed necessary of life have to unpack again subsequent repacking took whole of third day even then since have to leave at cockcrow to catch evening boat to ostend there be many thing insoluble be there bath at bayreuth must take indiarubber bath be there washerwoman must take a much linen a there be day seigneur quelle vie now though regret pin point of indecision yet defend for if one be going abroad for six month be necessary to do be to put out stick button have in world bid grand portmanteau advance for ten day fortnight surely such equipment be beyond mark therefore one have to select here come in worst of imaginative mind one can easily picture circumstance even in course of ten day in one will want single suit of clothes one posse for instance there may quite easily be cold spell of weather therefore be necessary to take one suit of thick clothes also to be worn on night journey supposing one get caught during cold spell by sudden storm cold spell continues thick clothes be wet therefore one must take two suit of thick clothes however warm weather be more likely there must be at least two suit of flannel four suit then for emergency of social kind one must not be found defenceless sort of tailed apparatus must come five suit dress clothes six also there be excellent trout fishing not far from bayreuth have be particularly told to bring rod entail knickerbockers norfolk jacket seven suit at point paused be taking seven suit in order to clothe unworthy body for space of ten day in bavarian village yet where be flaw of thing in world hate to be away from home wanting something have forgotten to take be worse decided not to take time be when be so simple to put in article opportunity be mine no longer sigh for undenuded wardrobe scorn to reproduce more of indecision must sooner reproduce french a spoken in hot bath will suffice to say that having spent hour will never return in process of careful selection eventually discarded selection altogether filled portmanteau posse however for future will waste more time in thinking what will want on short journey for know will end in taking have save trouble to begin with know whether be descended from gipsy certainly in most people something of instinct love to wander to make journey merely for joy of going survives true be that punctual train south eastern however have good deal of admirable romance uncertainty about well appointed steamboat leave stone jettied port at regular ascertainable time have sucked much of unknown from travel so robbed instinct of fruition can not quite starve even though travel in pullman car sit on plush with head among voluptuous gilding gaze into looking glass show country telegraph post reeling giddily backwards yet still travel at

sinner yet hated sin now to kingdom of grail have come again then in turn heard of long sorrow of knight how strength have gone from now that more beheld holy grail that for lack of sight thereof old king titurel be dead when heard that pity for sin of world so seized that staggered where stood lay in swoon near spring then did old knight gurnemanz minister to faintness from hut came kundry who knew parsifals helm knew that be whom have tempted in klingsors garden now rebuffed not loosened armour also laid by washed foot in spring with hair of head dried then gurnemanz anointed on head when
