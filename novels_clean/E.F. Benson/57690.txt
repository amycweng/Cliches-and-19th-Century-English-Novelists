at vail never heard anything so touching so cruel so dignified life have be victim of ill luck so persistent that look a if malignant power must have be pursuing well be going to try to make up to wonder if rather long very private story about affair must interest at rather must like to hear well be almost exactly a told from beginning be twin of grandfather there be piece of bad luck to start with being just minute late about coming into world be younger son be fun can tell in impoverished family may happen to anybody said geoffrey be younger son scream over harry laughed doe interrupt

well be not able to do at once for affair be upside down asked for received renewal of for security gave reversion of life insurance policy again harry voice sank to near whisper two day after arrangement have be made young harmsworth uncle francis be pottering about hedgerow alone just with dog to get rabbit two anything came in way getting over fence harmsworth gun went off killing instantly think how awful why people will get over fence without taking cartridge out be more than must ever imagine said geoffrey will continue to do so till end of time beg pardon well here come most terrible part of whole affair went on other there be inquest though uncle be scarcely fit to attend for say be almost off head with so dreadful thing happening have to go gave account of matter said that be nearly hit by of shot that tell be impression be willing to believe that be not so for a say imagination may run riot at so ghastly time be most unfortunate thing to have said for seemed to be quite incompatible with other evidence then when be known about insurance policy horrible sinister rumour began to creep about be closely questioned a to whether knew for what purpose young harmsworth wanted money have advanced must not say neither must tell understood that there be something disgraceful blackmail suppose have awful scene with mr harmsworth harold mother friend of course scouted idea of possibility of possibility others acquaintance cooled toward though not exactly believing what be in air others cut direct be only medical evidence at inquest showed that injury of harmsworth died must easily have be inflicted by that saved uncle in probability from being brought to trial said to that must have be better if have for then must have be completely cleared whereas

soon ripened into intimacy lady oxted old friend of harry father stood pre eminent here soon became ami de la maison dropping in a chose well knowing be welcome such footing speedily unquestioningly gained be to one of life previously so recluse pleasure new altogether delightful for lady oxted have power of creating atmosphere of home home be one of excellent thing harry have hitherto lacked have not consciously missed because have never yet known gradual understanding of made see how large empty room there have be in heart to come uninvited to linger unconscionably long to say firmly that must be going yet to linger found to be index to certain domestic comfortable joy of life not lightly to be placed low in delightful miscellany nature from very youth be not yet enough formed to be labelled by so harsh epithet a austere hitherto have not known quiet monotony can be cause of so much uneventful happiness even for whose bulk of enjoyment be flavoured with thrill of adventure frothier joy of living who most need excitement crave for stimulus there yet be time for unbending of bow when child within cry out for mere toy companionship soul longs to sit by meditative fire rather than do battle with wind stern event harry be not one of who need home least simply have be frozen now for first time genial warmth of living began to touch be like plant put in sunned watered place appropriate bud began to appear in time of singing bird here too met romance with tremulous mouth thing of poet have sung chapter v point in casuistry one evening toward end of june lady oxted be driving home from victoria station where have gone to meet arrival of continental express by side sat girl of little more than twenty who by eager questioning glance cast at inimitable kaleidoscope of life a seen in london street must probably have be deprived of admirable spectacle for time for gaze be quickened to interest not habitual to londoner however deep be devotion to town of town

prerogative of who prefer air a god made to foul gas men shut up in house a drove poured out rapid series of question comment to lady oxted oh just love stuffy old london said what have done with duke of wellington on horse corner look quite strange without oh there be policeman keeping everybody back do think be queen hope be why be only fat little man with beard in brougham who be aunt violet why be a good a just fancy be three year since have be in london be not grammar be have greatest difficulty in making mother let come indeed if have be for letter saying that must let stay with never must have come then difficulty about time must stop be worth while going for month two month be too long so made three well be delightful to have anyhow dear evie said lady oxted really be time must see london again mother be well very a well a be mean lot wo come to england aunt violet except for one day year be beginning to think never will now be twenty one nearly twenty two year ago that settled at santa margarita year be born yes dear yes said lady oxted little hurriedly must seemingly have gone on to speak of something else girl interrupted know reason of course aunt violet said quietly with certain firm resolve to speak let go on told about only other day of course poor harold death must have be terrible for be awful be awful think to take way doe still think that died by accident that be intentionally shot by man with whom be out shooting asked what name be must not tell for time once year on day of harold death come to england put red flower on grave return oh be awful lady oxted did not reply at once still think so about asked at length yes told hope perhaps that refusing to tell man name asked only evening before left may mean that be beginning to wish to forget wished at rate must not know do think may be so ca tell evie mother stopped yes only mother be hard to get at inaccessible be almost impossible to know what feel on subject about feel deeply once tried to talk to about must not heard what have to say be girl assented then paused moment poor mother what awful year for said have only married father know few month before harold death before year be out harold only son be dead be left twice widow childless be not born for six month after father death how strange never to have seen one father drove in silence for space then girl said suddenly aunt violet promise that will never tell name of man who be out shooting with harold see mother must not tell when asked surely that mean wish must not know lady oxted felt for moment in great perplexity have rational habit now growing rare of thinking what be saying meaning something by what said a answer be conceivably matter of importance paused thinking intently be not sure that have better promise that said at last evie looked surprised why not asked ca quite tell said give time dear will either make promise ask tell why make evening in meantime evie ask a favour to avoid thinking about a far a be able ah here be indeed sight of grosvenor square be very welcome to lady oxted for just now have clearness of mind on question girl have put to very great clearness a to fact that there be delicate though remote issue possibly at stake here be with three month charge of evie aylwin half sister of poor harold harmsworth daughter of mother whose attitude toward mr francis admitted of dubiety while most constant visitor at house be nephew of man to whom so terrible suspicion attached that two must not meet verged on impossibility be fair on one other that must run ordinary chance of attractive girl handsome boy together without knowing in what curious sombre prenatal ordination of fate be cast must be like indicating summer rain in hard line of ink to say that lady oxted expected to fall in love with other among possibility contingency must not be reckoned very remote unlikely probable most hardened matchmaker must not call where be celibate who must say be impossible sudden unexpected demand of girl promise will never tell name have be unknown to request presupposed solution of problem of most complicated kind lady oxted be true have asked for time already be afraid unwisely that however be done have until evening power of making refusing to make promise if made shouldered with responsibility of countenancing free intercourse of two mutual attraction to might easily give rise of seeing pursue course to possible evolution in love marriage girl be staying with harry vail be so assiduous in presence that must scarcely be called visitor be supremely eligible be clearly idle to overlook possibility given that thing occurred foresaw moment possibly very unpleasant certainly to be laid to door when mr aylwin heard of engagement of daughter to man on whose name in mind rested stain of so intimate bloodguiltiness unwelcome conclusion brought with sudden reaction of hopefulness evie aylwin have asked mother name of harold companion on fatal morning have be denied information did not that argue loophole of encouraging amplitude surely to weaving feminine mind meant that mother though perhaps repenting regretting black influence suspicion founded unfounded have have on yet wished daughter to move in absolute freedom avoiding none open to to conduct life with perfect liberty not knowing more being prevented by own mother from knowing anything with definite label of tragic affair else how be conceivable that must not have said two word francis vail mr aylwin so reasoned acute lady must have known for who did not know strange solitary history of last head of house be not refusal to mention uncle name silent recognition if rightly interpreted that two might meet thought be pleasant one for be much attached to harry girl for moment let fancy build fantastic dome in air if mr aylwin have recognised inference be not unreasonable did not recognition imply hope though of faintest most unformulated that now saw long bitter suspicion to have be mistake then silence must amount even to wish that two might meet that one of blood might in remote possibility wipe away by union that of blood have be shed to take other side if did not make promise have to refuse with what softening limitation will to bind in case then of what event to meet what contingency must make reservation under what circumstance be to say did desire to leave free clearly in case of possible happening of two falling under spell of other in case clearly also be afraid must be far better to tell girl now at once save greater shock to hear name vail now moment must be nothing to to hear name vail in more sinister connection when already have vital sound to ear be pang might be saved now not hereafter again still dealing with remote possibility in connection alone decision have significance be conceivably fair to harry to reveal though in most intimate way most pain sparing word stain that hung over name long ago lady oxted have settled with that affair be dead buried at time even have be no more than unproved dark suspicion though endowed with mysterious vitality of evil be of woman who held that to repeat evil tale be only one degree removed from inventing to stir for purpose coiled worm of suspicion thought be abhorrence to evie mother seemed in own dealing with own child have indorsed unwillingness be certain that if name have to be told must be told now for supposing two remained stranger to intimacy there must be no greater harm done now than afterward if intimacy be otherwise to be be better to kill in womb than to let live destroy afterward third alternative remained to write to mr aylwin saying quite simply that harry vail be intimate friend of hers that be attractive of unblemished character reputation so much be bound to say for young man sake did mother want done letter felt must be thing to blush over even when alone how demented matchmaker must appear back balance be in position of mother to girl mother out of own mouth have desired that must not know name desire have reached lady oxted casually not knowing to whom journeyed have arrived be bound to respect promise be a good a made evie have gone to room after tea various fence faced lady oxted on side till ringing of dressing bell that sound suggested dinner table to at thought of dinner table suddenly felt conclusion wrested from for remembered for first time harry dined with night though did not expect that on entering drawing room must immediately throw on knee at evie foot seemed to that a controlling power be put on shelf that issue of thing be in younger stronger hand than hers found letter two for in hall taking in hand went upstairs 'the luck of vails said to herself phrase shaped to step step to syllable still with letter in hand looked in at evie room finding betwixt between went on to own a maid did hair opened first be from harry greatest luck ran grimstones have influenza in house have put off so can will will come to

o'clock couple of guest there be ball at one house evening party at concert at third claimed grilling quota leaving even at hour only harry vail geoffrey langham lord oxted a be wont have retired to study a soon a duty a host must permit without positively violating decency two young men still lingered making intimate party during last few month harry have continued to so expand that must have be difficult to recognise in hero of recluse coming of age party year ago change be result of violent revolution nature have in way be wrested from normal development merely that development have be long retarded be now proportionately rapid for year solitary home have ringed with want of kindly fireside interest have led on path lead to great unexplored desert of recluse impulse given plunge into world taken have thriven grown with marvellous alacrity indeed stunted habit of teen remained in now only a shown in certain impression produced of holding still somewhat in reserve in disposition notable in age love to expose internal organism to gaze of sympathizing friend to be own master to retain if wished privacy of own to guard a sacred trust right to own opinion in matter concerned lady oxted however on a on many other occasion felt obliged to find fault with presence of niece must appear did not impose bound on candour be getting lazy contented harry remarked on particular evening be here in london professing to lead life of people with whom associate be shirking harry looked up with mild wonder at assault drew chair little closer up to half circle made round open window for night be stifling candle have drooped during fish never professed anything of kind said yet understand in slightest degree what mean doubt soon will will try to make plain to said lady oxted have chosen to come to london lead silly frivolous life lead that to begin with be ridiculous of there be need for to be in london why fairly intelligent young man ever be unless have business take there pass understanding might be down at vail looking after property might be travelling still understand about professing to lead life of people among whom move said harry be coming to that have chosen to spend three month in london without better reason for than that everybody else doe so that being so ought to behave like everybody else for instance when mr morris wanted to take to sister dance to night ought to have gone also lady wraysbury asked to go to concert at hamilton again refused wanted to come too said harry at least asked added getting in back hander be old woman choose to sit by own fire wo have lit asked harry chose to sit there too will go away if like will go to dance not in least if send away will go to bed speak a if be six great power sending ultimatum to heligoland said lady oxted not in least if send away will go lady oxted laughed heligoland reply that six great power may wait ten minute said harry turned to evie aylwin yes feel just a do said eagerly reverting at once to conversation have be interrupted by lady oxted stricture love sense of being in middle of million of people of whom just like have own private paradise joy of life world probably never guess evie looked at quickly have private joy lord vail asked do tell what be thing be private be always interesting harry laughed be called luck said luck of vails be really beginning to believe in nonsense harry asked lady oxted have begun said o aunt violet how horrid be cried evie do let lord vail tell about be private be dying to know will will make short then said harry for lady oxted sake must rather that made long for mine said girl be a please lady oxted gave loud quite voluntary sigh poor dear harry said geoffrey let talk about something extremely tangible while be on stock exchange speak to of backwardation contango may counteract weakening effect of harry nonsense be bear harry smiled drew chair closer to girl will talk low said so that will not offend lady oxted must promise to stop if get bored anyhow brought on for asked about private joy be blue eye deepened by shaded light to violet looked into a began tale into hers looked brown eye seemed black told of ancient history of cup listened with interest to story might have claimed attention even from stranger then came to own finding of in attic upon winter day to three accident to trivial have followed finding eye up till now have be at one time on at have strayed with certain consciousness purpose for never looked elsewhere than at hers now way now that have superintended disentangling of piece of lace have caught in bracelet have guided her finger a traced intricate ivory of fan handle became absorbed saw only harry big dark eye at widest circuit parted lip from word came own mouth thin finely lipped drooped little at centre with interest expectation even line of teeth showed in red band of ivory set in pomegranate once impatiently swept back tress of hair drooped over ear playing of finger with fan have become unconscious eye no longer followed must seem that harry have forgotten promise to make story short for lady oxted sake have rather acceded silently to girl request to make long for hers for startling revelation about backwardations bear have long languished before tale be done at last harry voice stopped there be silence moment though still looked at other then evie gave little sharp involuntary sigh eyebrow met in frown throw away lord vail said sharply throw away at once where will be lost lost be terrible thing yet yet how can one believe thing be gold gem be ah

of man to pay inane compliment since found have begun to become human said gravely indeed six month ago have friend in world except geoffrey what be about asked geoffrey who be playing piquet with lady oxted be only saying be such brute a appeared said harry without looking round be true friend geoff then dropping voice again then on finding of luck became oh know what became what be anyhow leaned back again in chair blushing little at own unpremeditated burst of egotism of course soberly in light of be believe in continued having three little accident be very curious coincidence following a did on heel of finding luck anyhow plea to think that there may be one coincidence more that three little bit of bad luck will be followed by piece of very good luck be private joy thought of great good thing happening to then oh then wo just take luck stamp on throw rent piece to four wind of heaven there be moment silence a voice slightly raised gave out blindly spoken word have certain ring of truth about a soon a be spoken evie mood changed oh must cried must not bring to destroy lovely thing star of emerald clear set diamond handle oh make mouth water to think of love

prolonged glance presently after two young men left strolled back to geoffrey room in orchard street on way to cavendish square be of leisurely turn of mind delight in observation make use whatever of have observed scorning paltry saving of time shoe leather to be secured by cab went on foot through night bright with lamp of carriage jingling with bell of hansom well have have awfully nice evening said harry extra nice mean though be always jolly at oxteds thought be enjoying said other when refused to go to concert for a remember only afternoon be wishing for invitation afterward also thought

said take in time old chap see good man about oh be rot going to bed now let come to club be only just down park lane be not feeling like bed just yet meantime at house have just left evie have gone up to bed leaving lady oxted to do what called write two note simple diplomatic method of stating that did not mean to come upstairs immediately written announced must come to talk for five minute must take perhaps quarter of hour to write in other word a soon a evie have gone went downstairs to seek husband in room where must be sure to find sitting by green reading lamp in mild exasperation at anything government might happen to have done with regard to kindly old president of south african republic second standard for board school violet be really too bad said a entered have read home secretary speech at manchester say let see where be dear bob said wife whatever said must quite certainly disagree with never mind showing minute want advice about matter faint smile came over lord

in certain mild kindly fashion certainly promise said being woman will probably at very back of mind very back say reserve to yourself right to break if becomes inconvenient to keep be rude bob think will promise at same time write to mr aylwin husband chuckled quietly be precisely what meant said only did not put reservation quite so far forward in mind did two young people get on well together too well harry have developed amazing knack of getting on well with people be coming to for sunday then most likely be already too late must have thought of thing before violet after thought be true be often admirable so to speak never catch train bear also in mind if anything happens if two get engaged will be liable at moment to crushing descent from mr aylwin if come go be be charming completely overpowering will not be made to feel like child in own house dear have probably got into mess violet good night dear agree with then asked completely entirely fervently for be clear to

cried good god thing be past more than twenty year people still talk of oh be monstrous so need not tell rest said evie quietly uncle be unjustly for so fully believe unjustly suspected of having shot be monstrous quite agree with be not so monstrous a think added rather faintly in moment harry heightened colour died from face miss aylwin did not say that exclaimed earnestly forgive if have said anything that hurt indeed did not say that evie looked at moment knew thing have so much desired not to know knowledge strangely enough did not frighten affect in justice to will say that did not broke out 'it be monstrous ' when told knew story again colour rose to face now not vehement only ashamed did said be quite true spoke violently unjustifiably if knew poor uncle miss aylwin think must find hard to forgive must see at once why spoke so hastily be kindest best of men most soft hearted think what suspicion must have be to year so many of so bitter in have never be cleared up do think said softly like for violence lord vail be loyal be bad thing to be loyal looked up at must not think that be willing listener to gossip old scandal doe not concern think that cried harry indeed never thought that word rang out died on hot air still girl made answer way be mind divided must tell must tell nothing latter be easier path for last word have ring of truth in convincing unmistakable so to speak be acquitted without stain on character did decide not to speak something within intangible imperative urged other counsel reason gave account of simple instinct only called to what prompted instinct from what deep vital source rose did not pause to consider simply be there with reason warring on other side battle be brief momentous immediately almost spoke be sure never thought that said wish pulse ticked full rapid wish to prove to how be not through gossip that knowledge came to for be how heard mother be harold harmsworth mother harold drew long breath hung suspended in lung eye be fixed on eye of girl in long glance of sheer astonishment hers be not withdrawn at last god forgive said do forgive evie got up quickly with glowing face forgive what be there for can forgive lord vail said honour for championship of kinsman who have suffered a believe unmeritedly most cruelly heart spoke word lip framed walked back in silence toward house for to moment be too good to spoil by further speech silence be spontaneous desired distance of pole away from awkwardness to harry at rate seemed too precious to risk of loss of moment must not have opened lip except one word must issue therefrom for luck must bring that word dared not utter yet scarcely even knew if so to speak be there yet in triumph of just speech over more conventional reticence filled with deep secret joy ought to have said what have said must have said le felt in beat leaping pulse of body recognised proper reserve of girl to young man meant to at moment le than nothing word knew have put on to new more intimate footing with must not have spoken otherwise have spoken not at have said what be due from one human being be boy girl man woman to human being king peasant have said no more than need humanly

following lady oxted return to london from sunday in country that received expected letter from mr aylwin in answer to own opening of must be idle to deny be made with anxious apprehensive hand already be plain to with how swift strong movement a of flood water hastening toward sluice gate first attraction between two be speeding into intimacy have known what have passed between in orchard must have guessed that swiftness have outrun eye already must have be far better that if girl be to know name mother have refused to tell must have known on night of arrival thing be past prayer lady oxted drew sheet of paper from envelope found at rate that communication be short leave entirely to judgment wrote mr aylwin whether tell evie not say that have promised not to in case supposing at future time consider advisable can accept quibble tell not in name in mine reason for not telling may easily have guessed knowledge so thought that harold be murdered have poisoned life now question a to whether have be certainly right about remember if there arises between two thing be possible a evidently foresee friendship develops a be natural between man maid be certain that time evie will know leave to to decide whether be better that must know now later thank dear violet for care for dear violet heaved sigh of relief mr aylwin have be known to stagger who be dear to by sending letter partook of nature of ultimatum there be ultimatum here be willing to treat letter though couched with precision of official despatch be not without amenity hurried downstairs to join evie for be going out to lunch with sense of burden removed such being attitude of mr aylwin determined that own promise to girl must certainly stand thought with scornful wonder of husband diagnosis at very back of mind must reserve to herself right to break men idea of woman told be incredibly crude elementary reserved for monopoly of certain quality like courage justice honour simply took for granted that such thing did not exist for woman poor dear bob after so many year too evie be somewhat silent a drove down bond street though gaze at jostling crowd be not le intent than usual seemed to have lost sparkle of avidity to dwell rather than alight be gone again looked morning at seedy toy seller flower vendor more than at fragrant painted ware instead of finding fascination in little tin figure moved scythe over surface of absolutely smooth pavement with industry of who reap whirlwind commenting on phenomenal cheapness of collar stud be rather tragic meanness of exhibitor to day attracted how do suppose live aunt violet asked look at man with stud six penny know because bought six on saturday well supposing sold sixty day imagine doe not that cost absolutely nothing in evening must

what be now evie asked lady oxted nothing suppose be just realizing that take sort to make world extreme meet so on look at now here be in comfortable victoria much more like lazzaroni than toy seller who will say how far toy seller be above lazzaroni sit in sun if there be sun sit by fire to do justice generally smile yet supposing have to work for bread must do cheerfully do think must maintain even low average of industry supposing there came great call on for courage resolution must respond to have reason for assuring must lady oxted mind flew back with inward smirk of satisfaction to own heroic determination to keep promise have made to evie probably must said probably be not so bad when come to when have opportunity for behaving abominably a thought be going to be thought of dentist poison life for day beforehand yet go same ring dreary bell behave believe with average courage under wheel morally too suspect be better when thing have to be done than be afraid be going to be also on whole one be more honourable than one think more honourable certainly added with sudden irrepressible spurt of indignation against husband than who know best believe to be evie laughed dear aunt have be very honourable lately asked have uncle bob be doubting fine quality cynicism always end in disappointment remarked lady oxted leaping conversational chasm since be cynical suppose expects be uncle bob cynic asked evie dragging back over chasm again well made promise other day said lady oxted asked advice about told that must probably reserve to myself right to break evie sat up suddenly toy maker lazzaroni be swept from mind promise said not promise made lady oxted looked up in surprise yes same why dear evie deliberated with for moment for reason said slowly because now know what asked not to tell promise have have kernel taken out of know who told lord vail replied lady oxted looked at girl heightened colour wondering what emotion flew that beautiful standard there will never waste dram of resolution again in determining to abide by word announced evie laughed again with great ring of happiness in note then will confirm uncle bob in cynicism replied disappoint of pleasant little disappointment be not long before lady oxted found that to be chaperon to very considerable heiress must not be regarded even by most negligent a sinecure while to fulfil duty at adequately cost vast deal of time thought have girl be dull heavy serious plain task must have be lighter a be lady oxted became before fortnight be past really hard worked woman evie appetite for gaiety be insatiable took to london like bird to air found everybody charming everybody returned compliment indeed girl seemed to bring wherever went breath of spring morning so utterly sincere spontaneous be pleasure bubbled from since nothing plea people so much a to find pleasing london in general be exceedingly glad that santa margarita be poorer for evie presence here with eager avidity of youth with youth serene digestion gathered devoured heaped up feast of daily nightly gaiety self consciousness for once seemed to have be left out of composition of human being played laughed enjoyed among crowd a child may play with daisy by in spring meadow not brooding reflecting on happiness simply happy parsifal with flower maiden be not more unreflective than surrounded by well dressed host charm in mouth of might have be hoped thought lady oxted that since so large ring be always assembled to see smile smile must have be considering number variety of circle distributed with moderate evenness in be not disappointed thing far more disconcerting to responsible chaperon evie seriousness certainly be not impartial for world one seemed to have seriousness about one there must be mistake for already between harry there existed relation clear indefinable to be dwelt on with silent wonder alchemy secret subtle untraceable a curve of swallow flight be at work effervescence already have begun to stir brightening dark well of destiny within by hundred point of light mysterious luminosity be growing in tremulous flame until receipt of mr aylwin letter lady oxted have felt little uncertain a to whether must accept harry invitation for herself girl to vail in case next two sunday be impossible matter have be left undecided now that restriction be withdrawn arranged to take evie down in

to thank dear boy said in be to owe quiet retreat day of busy tranquility ah harry have be worth while to grow old if at end find such peace a be mine drove briskly up mile of deep country lane separated station from high road harry found unlooked for pleasure in wreath of honeysuckle embowered hedge in fragrant curve in clean vigorous tendril of dog rose starred with delicacy of pink blossom something in young unfolding of simple loveliness have never really struck before now smote on heart with pang of exquisite pleasure how wonderful be youth growth of young thing how like in subtle intimate way be springing sprig of blossom to girl on verge of womanhood for instance turned to uncle again yes london suit said thrill surprise of thought glowing in handsome face people be so kind so friendly oh be warm nice world hand shook two horse to swifter trot will always find people kind friendly to harry said mr francis if look at a looked at just now men woman know nothing so attractive a happiness dear boy what have be doing to yourself be more radiant than apollo harry laughed must not change place with said will take chance a harry vail have done nothing to myself if ask have found many friend forget uncle francis that first friend found be think will find better turned into blare of white high road mr francis who while be in shadow of deep lane bank have carried hat on knee letting wind blow refreshingly through thick white hair put on again ah harry hope will time soon find friend dearer than friend for life said who will speedily make forget old uncle give seat in chimney corner that asks though asks more let nurse child on knee have way with child never cry with pray often pray said lifting hat a spoke with gesture touching solemn may do that dear harry must be crowning happiness of many happy day word died gently on air direct reply be needed for moment harry be half determined to tell uncle of dream hope longing with generous warmth of youth for sympathy knew must so fully be word be even on threshold of lip when mr francis suddenly straightened from attitude of musing plunged into le intimate talk have not be idle dear harry said while have be away charging about world a youth must think will find may say without undue complacence that home farm be in better order be more profitable than have ever be there be credit due to be simply work of bailiff have luck to find invaluable man in autumn can promise better pheasant shooting than there have be for many year be sure be so said harry will prove together uncle francis really can not thank enough be too good of to devote a have be doing to estate dear be four month since be here be absentee landlord better landlord than have be on spot be not afraid that will be shot at turned in at lodge gate bowled swiftly along under huge tree hay be standing high in field to left on right pasturage of park be grazed by sleek kine already beginning to leave midday shadow of tree for evening feed in cool sens of smell sight alike drank deep of plentiful luxuriant summer rook held parliament in debating house in high elm round coop of pheasant rearing hen cheeped innumerable young bird breeze must blow at sundown be already stirring to try wing extraordinarily pleasant to harry be sense that be yet there be vainglory selfishness in delight for valued own not for thought of what be to for joy perhaps must take in then emerging from mile long avenue came to shining lake sound of coolness from splashing sluice swan water lily repeated on surface a turned corner moor hen made water legged scurry to cover of reed bed then with hollow note from wheel rolled over bridge turned in under monstrous shape of cut box hedge to gravel sweep in front of house there stood shadow of one of wing fallen half across courtyard stately grave full of dignity grave repose surely unworthy gift to offer to at thought sudden pulse leaped within be unworthy harry said to banishing with effort irrepressible thrill of joy unworthiest of lingered moment at door then followed mr francis into house again joy of possession seized be tall faint tapestry of armoured knight garlanded lover row of serious portrait seemed to day to eye to have freshness welcome for have never be there before contrasted with keen relish of change last home coming what curious dreamlike month have be have spent here at coming of age how gray colourless life seemed then if looked at in light of have passed since have pictured remembered slowly putting spadeful after spadeful of time heaped gradually from month to year on grave of youth spending quiet often solitary existence here in house of father uncle francis so have planned in day when have be alone here before arrival geoffrey doubt must be glad to come here sometimes geoffrey too must very likely spend week with now again in shooting season otherwise must be natural for to be much alone prospect have called up in emotion even so lively

on whole hardly knew be be full of one person chapter ix cardiac mr francis soon joined for tea after proposing stroll in ten minute time have gone to room to answer urgent letter harry be well content to wait for nothing must come amiss to mood so harmonious a lighting cigarette strolled round wall beholding forbear opposite portrait of old francis second baron stood long eye sought dwelt on luck a familiar object sun streaming through western window fell full on to picture jewel so cunning exact be portrayal sparkled with extraordinary vividness in gleam luck be luck have given day of wonderful happiness with so great unspeakable hope for day to come be huge reward granted for have paid with cold in head burn on hand sprain of foot how curious at least three coincidence following so immediately on finding of luck have be how curious also awakening of dating from same time from solitary lethargy of first twenty one year for awakening have come with coming of uncle francis own instant attachment to be indeed geoffrey at rate between on visit here who have started on voyage have already resulted in discovery of world be then that potential self have begun to rustle stir in chrysalis of isolation have grown up round very feebly tentatively indeed at first by degree cracking bursting brown bark then standing with quivering momently expanding wing gradually unfolded grew strong for flight luck be indeed gem gold have done for be much be very much to now how infinitely more than have did desire six month ago have desired nothing for be dead now being alive how yearned for more one thing more sudden idea seized rang bell until be answered looked again at picture old francis face thought old francis hand did not fare so well in sunlight a glorious jewel held hand clutched rather than held cup line of be greedy grasping gripped treasure with nervous tension in face there be ugly line have never noticed before bore out evidence of hand avarice sat on that throne cunning a deep a sea cruelty evil mastery still looking wondering suddenly saw face in different light be no longer vile soul looked from eye kind cheerful spirit of own uncle started for change have vividness of actuality at moment bell be answered by old butler ah templeton cried be glad to see well that be right rang to say that wanted to get out luck big cup know found in attic last christmas put on table to night a centrepiece mr francis have key lord said templeton be on private bunch ask to give then say be by order oh here be uncle francis want key of case in be luck want to have on

before leave room will be put back again see to templeton be key be why be gold too old francis knew how to do thing thoroughly uncle nephew strolled out together harry with head high leading way extraordinary elation be on have feeling that luck be bringing luck said oh seriously believe think how strange coincidence have be fire frost rain have turn with of know uncle francis since found have have more happiness than in whole of life before what happiness harry friend first joy of life conscious feeling that one be alive suppose be same thing cried world men woman thing mr francis did not reply at once went forward few step eye on ground believe harry said must never have told about foolish old tale if have thought that there be slightest chance of paying more attention to than one give to fairy story dear boy be really quite silly caught cold because must not listen to excellent advice change clothes when got in from shooting sprained ankle because did not look where be going see that step be covered with ice burned because careless housemaid have forgotten to tack down carpet believe in magic at there be assert such thing even if one did must be very childish weak kind of spell must only bring curse of sort be just what think said evil perhaps have run down so to speak be nearly impotent oh be only joking if be price have paid for present happiness consider dirt cheap if luck can give more happiness hereby declare to power work will take amount more on same scale of charge mr francis laughed took harry arm affectionately dear lad be only jesting know said be not well to dwell on such fantastic thing too much though constantly remind ourselves that be nonsense human mind be very wonderful delicate piece of mechanism if once begin playing experiment with thing of understand so little may get out of order strike wrong hour fail to keep time lead wholesome honourable life dear boy take gratefully what happiness come in way forget where come from then will have nothing to fear from luck nothing to gain from said harry for suspect magic can not touch who believe in dear boy enough said mr francis with certain earnestness have told believe in ah what wonderful evening look at pink fleece of cloud in west softer than sleep softer than sleep a theocritus say how wish be painter think of privilege of being able to show sunset glory to show too a true artist can feeling infinite subtle rose cloud against pale blue of sky produce in one to show to toiler of london street ah harry what wealth of sens have be given what diverse facing window to soul how little trouble to look out of to keep bright clean even one gourmet even man who eats dinner using palate with intelligence be step above most people have trained sense what exquisite pleasure sense even though be most animal of give who can say that sense be not given in order that must cultivate to fullest suddenly raised hat in low clear voice cried o world a god have made in beauty knowing be love love be duty what further can be sought for declared for long moment stood there face irradiated by fire of sunset eye soft with gentle unshed tear hair stirred by caress of evening breeze with who know what early dream cool revery of boyhood reminiscent within harsh untoward past have gone from have lived backward in moment to day before trouble darkness came about path aspiration seemed to have taken place of memory be youth again be face a looked at be loving reverent be already deep dusk when turned back only faint reflection of fire of sunset lingered in sky green of grass tree have faded to sombre gray green of fantastically cut box hedge have deepened to black when again passed under misshapen shape monstrous prodigy somehow look of cut out against unspeakable softness distance of sky struck harry with something of ominous touch must be seen to said pointing to look at horror of shape be like collection of feverish dream old box hedge asked mr francis if be must not have touched see how nature be striving to obliterate intruding hand of man how grotesque quaint appears in light how delightfully horrible horrible certainly said harry find delight there come uncle francis let go in be already close upon dinner time one have to dress box hedge seemed to have strange fascination for mr francis still lingered there standing in road with eye wandering down line of nightmare silhouette indeed must not touch dear harry said be so grotesque gothic what thickness hedge must be eight foot at least be hideous replied lad be enough to frighten anybody doe not frighten gardener may suppose at least have heard of hysteric be probably true well come in uncle francis will be so late for dinner be dying for hour later two have finished dinner be waiting for coffee to be brought harry after finishing wine have lit cigarette have be occasion of playful stricture from uncle who still held unkindled in soft plump finger one sip only one sip of coffee first harry said be almost wicked to light cigarette till have have one sip of coffee be psychological moment ah that dazzling thing how sparkle be good idea of yours to have on table harry make noonday in room how luck welcome home dear boy though can not sparkle like not le do welcome indeed that winking splendour in centre of table be enough to strike sight into blind eyeball candle lit table though shaded from eye of diner poured unobtruded ray on to from fifty angle stone glowed with inward ever varying light slightest movement of head be sufficient to turn blue light of diamond into incandescent red again movement burning danger signal be changed to living green pearl shone with steady lustre like moon through mist even sober emerald caught something of madness of diamond studded handle glowed with colour not own thing have fascinated harry dinner time spell seemed to grow for suddenly filled glass again luck said drink to luck put down empty glass affectionate remonstrance with folly be on mr francis lip when servant entered with coffee behind footman who carried walked man with liqueur whom harry must not remember having seen before looked at moment wondering who be when recollected that uncle have spoken to about own man whom proposed must wait on at vail last came templeton carrying leather case of luck harry took coffee liqueur have look at uncle valet man wore immovable mask of well trained servant be no more than machine for handing thing yes take cup templeton said harry have key of lord be on mr francis bunch must give key uncle francis will lock keep key mr francis did not at once answer continued sipping coffee harry thinking have not heard repeated request on repetition mr francis instantly took key off bunch by mean dear boy said be much better so that must have templeton packed jewel in case harry turned key on lock up templeton said in one of chest must have new case made for think be very old must be much too easily carried away eh uncle francis swung locked case lightly in hand be original case harry said must be sorry to change men left room templeton going last with case containing luck candle still burned brightly light seemed to have be withdrawn from room now that great jewel no longer gleamed on table be a if cloud have hidden sun harry still held key in hand looking curiously at chased intricate ward for few moment spoke then put into pocket pushing chair little farther from table flung one leg over other propose to stop here four five day uncle francis said not more unless can not get through business indeed can not see what there be to do place look in admirable order thanks to there be box hedge be positively can see that want looking to mr francis laughed gaily dear harry said if be not careful will become a absurd on subject of box hedge a be in danger of becoming about luck dear quaint picturesque thing how can want trimmed cut harry laughed a say doe not frighten gardener said a be about to tell a drove from station when something put out of head will have to consider others a well suddenly stopped in intense pleasure with have looked forward to visit of evie lady oxted must be so have figured hardly le welcome to uncle a sign visible pertinent of how utterly dead discredited be lying rumour at one time have so blackened have not consciously reckoned with moment of telling went on almost without pause at end of month lady oxted have promised to come spend sunday here with will come o uncle francis how long something of sort have be delayed how patiently have waited for with will come niece miss aylwin who have just come to england from italy looked not at uncle a spoke with delicacy unconscious instinctive kept eye on ground announcement a visit of harold harmsworth sister must knew be momentous to old man perhaps must give rise to emotion be not fit that other eye must see uncle must know that in mind of one at least most intimately connected with tragedy suspicion be not visit must be reconciliation formal though silent be right that hearer must have a great privacy a might be so when spoke after have finished speaking harry

mr francis head rustled fold of tablecloth yet in spite of heavy stertorous breathing of stricken man seemed to harry that immense silence reigned everywhere silence of waiting maid servant have gathered in doorway templeton with guttural word sent scurrying down passage three watched waited round one then by blessed degree breathing grew le drawn laboured by light of candle mr francis man

emptiness though whole hedge must not have be le than six eight foot thick presented point of interest walked up to end far away from house pushing through belt of tree into hedge ran proceeded to examine from other side here at once found key to strange thing for half overgrown with young shoot stood opening five foot high leading into centre of hedge down ran long passage more correctly

month hence must require mr francis put thing to nephew with great lucidity patient impartiality harry heavily frowning must wrestle with figure continually tripped threw in mind label thing a sordid money must immediately afford to spend on house place be limited have sense to apply to balancing at length after ink stained arithmetical morning threw down pen electric light throughout uncle

orchestra poised plunged headlong into splendid overture of third act lady oxted whose secret joy be hope that might in fulness of time grow to tolerate wagner by incessant listening to glared furiously at talker closed eye lord oxted be observed by others thereupon stole quietly out of box curtain rose with wedding march that done lover alone that exquisite duet began rising like voice of two lark from height to infinite height of passion a clear pure a summer heaven then into soul of feeblest of heroine began to enter doubt hesitation desire to know what have promised not to ask grew in brain until made word undermining unbuilding on love rest thereafter woman having failed came tumult death hopeless lover be left face to face with ruin want of trust will bring upon be highest with drum slow measured rhythm of despair act ended hopeless idiotic fool of girl remarked evie with extreme precision weighing word oh lose patience with thought tone sounded little impatient said

spare aspect stranger to a soon a have passed turned round to groom who sat behind who be that asked know name lord said drove from station last monday have be staying with mr francis since then harry be conscious of slight feeling of vexation arising from several cause in first place here sense of dignity spoke guest either of uncle ought to be driven to station properly not by man in cap brown coat in second place though be delighted that uncle francis must ask friend chose to stay with harry considered that ought to have be told have received long letter from uncle two day ago in went at length into detail of day made mention of guest in third place appearance of man be somehow grossly uncomfortably displeasing to thing simmered in mind a drove up long avenue now then little bubble of resentment a be must break on surface half wondered at for pertinacity with mind dwelt on determined with touch of reserve secrecy still lingered in corner angle of nature that if uncle did not choose of own initiative to tell about man must ask question merely not forget circumstance reticence on own part so told be in way to be put down to secretiveness rather to decency of manner uncle might have czar of russia if chose to stay with if did not think fit to mention autocrat visit even though be in daily paper must be rude even for nephew to ask about knew if faced quite honestly that though good manner be sufficient excuse for reticence preferred to employ secretiveness nothing else be reason for certainly wished that man have not be so disrelishing to eye there be something even sinister about glance have got of mr francis be in most cheery excellent spirit delighted to see be employed in spudding plantain from lawn a carriage drove up abandoning homely useful performance a soon a heard wheel on road ran almost to meet age seems literally age since be here dear boy said see harry have not be idle in preparing for charming visitor croquet pointed to large deal box lay

compressed arch of eyebrow raised ever so little something between surprise frown contracted have already thought more than possible that harry might have met other trap driving away from house thought saw confirmation of in face sighed ah harry said can not trust mr francis voice be soft almost broken blue eye glistened in candlelight still looking intently at nephew at amenity affection in tone boy reserve secretiveness have labelled good manner utterly broke down have read thought said apologize why why not have told uncle francis must not have thought must mind having who liked here mr francis sighed again will tell now said slightly accentuating last word did not tell before purposely concealed now yes even used word solitary about life during last week in order to save anxiety

suspicion of kind uncle simple frankness have made wear aspect of suspector indeed where must suspicion look in suspicion what of gist of feeling have be that must have be told here be considerable reason why have not reason sensible conclusive dictated by thoughtful affection yet felt somehow ashamed of shame be too ill defined for speech there be long pause for mr francis almost immediately got up from chair with nimbleness of movement perhaps doctor must not have liked well truce to sombreness harry said indeed be brisk enough yet ah what pleasure to have here instead of excellent kind unsociable fellow have good story for let go to billiard room must not tell before servant though have have on tip of tongue evening doctor recommended billiards after dinner gentle slow exercise like

choice be not word too full of purpose for so spontaneous greeting to at once recognise obliterate past meeting be a be scene of reconciliation between two who have never set eye on other before between whom horror of vicarious estrangement must never be mentioned even be allowed to be present in mind mr francis word seemed to harry to meet situation with peculiar felicity old man seated near lady oxted be occasion said harry have be greatly occupied with house warming weather there be little warming there to be done surely have ordered delightful weather for harry told that miss aylwin

girl mind how must possibly be harry have seen in wood before question be asked answer came said softly to herself jim book be lying close to sleeper have already forgotten about turned quietly away casting one glance at harry whose straw hat be lying on grass noticing with faint unconvincing sense of justification that clothes be also of dark blue serge habitually honest even with knew that self judged case must be summed up dead against set teeth for lonely most humiliating ten minute without definite purpose in mind except association must be added penance went to lake sat down in canadian canoe in have played red indian evening before how must asked have be so distrustful so malicious so ready to blacken have seen young man walking with girl have be knave enough also fool enough be bitter to accept willow evidence of eye when told that be harry have not be warned against such wicked credulity even a elsa have be warned by lohengrin by sight of slim handsome groom last night in stable yard have not said to harry be vail full of double out of own mouth must be judged worse than elsa be sitting in canadian canoe for hour at least have believed that harry be flirting with servant girl that be capable of leaving to suppose that be going to keep lady oxted company under tree a soon a back be turned set off to meet village beauty loyalty feeling professed to admire how must girl in position who have ash of what have once be loyalty have acted must have flatly refused to believe evidence sight hearing sense must have be powerless to touch harry must not do thing how

received have believed though only for hour evidence of own eye have suffered for be now to believe evidence of somebody else tongue yet mr francis have said that dear old fellow who be evidently so devoted to harry so pained at what have seen no did not matter if four major prophet have said knew better than stained glass in christendom again belaboured water to rhythm of fool fool base little fool for few moment thought flew off to mr francis must have known harry twin brother be groom in stable yet have be a certain a that be harry have surprised in wood have be at pain to persuade that

despicable a neither more le be a great fool a be be did know harry a well a who have known life who have known month no more certainly did not must not who knew so well have rightly accused herself of disloyalty to compared to elsa did then owe loyalty ah big word put dripping paddle back in boat for be in wider field than reproach have ever hedged about leaned forward hearing ripple lap cluck on side supposing one else geoffrey langham for instance have chosen to walk in wood with dairymaid must have cared must have stung not jot then why at rose slipped out of boat for moment looked at wavering outline of reflection in lake then stood upright arm fallen by side little voice spoke within tried to tell be not surrender said walked back to lawn proud shy of revelation have made to herself with mind once more unshadowed lady oxted apparently have just awoke be looking distractedly round a if found in strange bedroom harry with one arm thrown behind head still slumbered unconscious innocent tea said lady oxted truculently poking in rib with parasol harry opened eye very wide like mechanical doll awaking why did do that said have be lying here quietly thinking have come back from walk said lady oxted be lost search party went out about three hour ago to look for rocket other signal of distress have be seen intermittently from down harry sat up saw evie instantly

looked first at then at aunt well look better for silence said yes lord vail have charming walk surprised double love making in wood oh dairymaid said be a pretty a picture always wonder where lower order get good look from said lady oxted parenthetically harry picked up straw hat probably from lower order remarked let have tea sleeping be such hungry work be not lady oxted be sure must be famished elephantine wit sighed that lady when harry be so kind a to make joke be unfortunately not so rare a one might wish always feel a if heavy foot be trampling about directly overhead when lady oxted make joke said lad be not so often a enemy must wish always reminds of sucking spring directly under foot give one water logged cry be swallowed up do pour out tea for lady oxted be such excellent tea maker score be fifteen remarked evie when did harry score demanded lady oxted seating at urn just now dear aunt so jim be to marry dairymaid lord vail who be jim asked lady oxted double wish knew a much about horse a yes jim be walking out with dairymaid have heard enough about jim said lady oxted decisively here be mr francis mr francis take side there be league against charming one said mr francis directing gay glance to evie girl did not meet looked quite gravely deliberately away chapter xiii harry asks question harry be leaving next morning with two woman being unable to induce lady oxted to stop day in consequence sat up late that night after have gone to bed looking over detail of expense of putting in electric light cheapest plan appeared must be to utilize power supplied by fall of water from lake for must save cost of engine to drive dynamo in case must be necessary to build house for over sluice so wrote engineer must not interfere with landscape for roof must only just be seen above belt of tree if lord vail did not mind little extra expense tasteful erection might be made instead of diminishing must positively add to beauty of view from house then followed horrific sketch of gothic style harry thought be disposed to go wandering that night gave veiled fugitive attention to figure lake suggested other thing to brighter than thirty two power lamp of electric light latter appeared must be in house by september other be in house now in case there must be horror ornamental otherwise over sluice turned to second estimate included engine with great determination to think of nothing else scene of distracted vigil be uncle sitting room where paper be to hand mr francis have sat up with for hour so harry have then persuaded to go to bed for evening have appeared somewhat tired worried then from next door there came for half hour faint sound of brushing splashing private orchestra of bedtime after that house be still harry settled down again to work before long mind be made up must have saw to screw pinch little on account must anything gothic not spoil lower end of lake then pouring out whisky soda took last cigarette table where worked be fully occupied orderly row of reference book bradshaw peerage whitaker almanac others stood in green morocco case to left of inkstand to right in silver frame large photograph of among other book be amused to see zadkiel almanac drew from place turned idly over leaf two there be cross in red ink opposite date of january d on day so said irresponsible seer discovery of gold must be made harry thought vaguely for moment of south africa klondike then suddenly gave little gasp of surprise have be day on have found luck coincidence be strange stranger be fact that uncle who have so often remonstrated with on half laughing half serious notice of coincidence have followed discovery must have zadkiel at strangest that must have noted date then suddenly wave of superstitious fear came over shut zadkiel hastily up for fear of seeing other date marked two minute later be already laughing at though did not reopen zadkiel a took candle to go to bed eye fell on red morocco where be lay on table knew that there be address wanted to verify be few minute before have turned to g there be name dr godfrey wimpole street on side of minute inverted comma looked at in astonishment for must have be ready to swear that uncle have told half moon street went straight to room however without wasting conjecture surmise over undressed blew out candle outside great moon be swung high in heaven leaf trembled on tree through summer night song of many nightingale bubbled liquidly few night afterward geoffrey be sitting alone in house in cavendish square harry have be full of figure wondering be least sum on london house must be made decently habitable one room wanted fresh paper distemper be essential to most required fresh carpet stamped leather be imperatively indicated for hall geoffrey listened with quiet amusement for harry be talking with such pellucid transparency that be difficult not to smile then question of electric light at vail be touched upon suddenly stopped rose beat ash of pipe out into grate by way geoff said supposing looked out name of man whom did not know have only once heard of in 'where be ' belonging to friend found name in inverted comma what inference if must draw be not riddle purely matter of curiosity geoffrey yawned even sherlock holmes must not infer there said even friend watson must not fail in such perfectly certain conclusion what conclusion wait moment let be obtuse detective be person from whom have heard name same a person to whom 'where be ' belongs lord give point to watson happens that be so doe that influence conclusion only make even surer ca do leaf a sure a be of course name in 'where be ' be not man real name not name go by anyhow so seemed possible to then be wrong there be question of possibility be dealing with absolute certainty now satisfy curiosity have not much have bit by bit said harry have ever heard of dr godfrey heart specialist take who life at wimpole street never wimpole street be just round corner imagine will have plate on door thought heart be in parlous state oh be funny said harry come along geoffrey got up will have to hold hand asked be not going to consult indeed there be mystery about whole matter simply dr godfrey be uncle doctor consulted other day about heart happened to look out doctor address in 'where be ' found name in inverted comma oh by way there be red book by look out half moon street doe dr godfrey live there geoffrey turned up street certainly not said why nothing said harry unwilling to mention different address come geoff be there in le than couple of minute harry have not even put on hat for traversing of so few paving stone incandescent gas lamp stood just opposite door number plate be plainly visible on plate in large square capital be dr g armytage read in silence turned home again geoffrey have pursed up lip for whistle refrained spell armytage pronounce godfrey said at length sometimes even spell godfrey perhaps g stand for godfrey not that make difference harry laughed be puzzled little troubled then remembrance of evening when have seen strange distasteful man dr armytage must now be supposed driving away from house came to mind how excellent kindly on occasion have be reason for uncle have desired that visit must remain unknown to harry after lesson must not pupil give credit for motive unguessable even a have be equally thoughtful have given wrong name wrong address in own reference book same wrong name with inverted comma appeared harry being human of discreet year did not relish being misled in manner told there might be admirable reason for must not conjecture have intended be true to see dr godfrey privately so a to get first hand opinion on uncle condition be not at sure that must ring dr armytage door bell lady oxted few day after fell victim to influenza after decent interval geoffrey who for remainder of summer have let own room in orchard street lived with harry called on part of to ask how be be admitted taken upstairs to sitting room voice be very hoarse temperature thermometer lay on table by felt very foolhardy young man be use being afraid of said that lady to by way of greeting because on one hand certain way to get be to be afraid of on other have to stop talk to have seen one day not even bob a want fresh case in house of course have allowed evie near oh be reeking of infection make up mind to matter said geoffrey not least scrap really be too provoking getting again believe doctor in wimpole street have seen through at least one attack will begin on cavendish square soon now talk thought of dr armytage strange confusion of name address have often be present in geoffrey mind since harry have made that short inconclusive expedition to number wimpole street here perhaps be opportunity for adding brick to vague structure be in outline only in mind have tried dr godfrey asked never heard of otherwise must have tried where doe live be not quite certain said geoffrey personally believe at wimpole street be supposed to be bright engaging conversation asked lady oxted will interest depressed influenza patient may interest in time said geoffrey to continue have ever heard of dr g armytage heart specialist of wimpole street effect of be instantaneous lady oxted sat up on sofa shawl whisked temperature thermometer to ground smashing ball yes of course have said so have imagine perhaps be not born how detestably young young men be get over said geoffrey yes become middle aged be worse now tell know categorically about dr armytage know that there be one for certain said geoffrey true plate be on door know if have right to tell in case really know nothing lady oxted made impatient gesture concern francis vail of course said geoffrey stared how did know that asked will tell when have finished story said may remind have not yet begun harry have told friend about chance encounter at lodge gate with doctor geoffrey must pas on story complete mr francis silence about visit there excellent reason for silence false name given to harry so thought false address false name in reference book with wimpole street address finally visit to door lady oxted heard with gathering interest must appear long before end be off sofa walking up down room now for story said how did know that concerned mr francis lady oxted sat down again g armytage be godfrey armytage said side point only have told tale very clearly geoffrey there be one weak point in evidence evidence what evidence asked geoffrey yes evidence be wrong word chain of circumstance if will weak point be that there be certain proof of identity of dr godfrey with dr armytage be certain to grant still did harry say what man met driving to station be like canny man ' be word said geoffrey 'dark clean shaven forty distasteful ' be on four said lady oxted have answered question geoffrey reminded will did ever hear of harmsworth case death of harold harmsworth yes harry told about evidence of doctor not that harold harmsworth be shot will remember at coroner inquest whole question naturally turned on distance from head at gun killed be fired will easily understand be of utmost importance for if muzzle of gun be not more than say yard four foot off be certainly possible that have shot accidentally imagine gun to have be ten foot off becomes certain that gun not own shot now head be shattered looked to ordinary mind a if injury must have be done by shot have already begun to spread can not speak technically doctor who maintained that shot might easily have be fired within shorter distance who be responsible in fact for case not going beyond coroner be dr godfrey armytage geoffrey be silent moment well be natural enough said at length mr francis on own showing have probably known man for long time be natural also that did not wish to tell harry real name for be connected with dreadful tragedy be also natural if dr armytage be eminent man that must wish to consult doctor knew about condition why not for reason said lady oxted dr armytage be not heart specialist more than be surgeon not very reputable one need go into detail must be a sensible to go to if suffered from heart a to go to cabinetmaker geoffrey frowned what doe mean asked sharply have idea at said lady oxted probably mean nothing thing seldom do in case say nothing to harry tea came in at moment talked of other matter till man have left room then one thing more said lady oxted last hardly like to say to that suspect nothing nobody because sound a if there be possibly something to suspect there be nothing be curious circumstance have interested geoffrey walked back to cavendish square feeling vaguely sombre depressed tepid drizzle of rain be falling making pavement slippery air be hot thundery suggestive of expectancy unrest accentuated mood have clew of kind a to what secret dealing must possibly mean nothing that ingenuity must suggest be even faintly satisfactory solution moment sky seemed to be pressing more heavily on to earth be a if very tightness of air prevented breaking of storm by time have reached cavendish square faint thick twilight showed overhead drizzle of rain have ceased only few large drop fell sparingly let in with latchkey found immediately face to face with harry who be just coming out at sight of suddenly felt that vague fear be going to be at once realized for in eye sat miserable despair harry harry be matter cried harry did not look at nothing said where have be sitting with lady oxted then perhaps will see be better suppose tell geoff fidgeted with door handle did see miss aylwin lady oxted doe not allow to come to room for fear of getting influenza thanks will be back for dinner expect wait opened door geoffrey laid hand on arm be not going to do anything foolish harry asked in sudden vague spasm of alarm idiot let go be there nothing can do asked nothing thanks geoffrey went into smoking room sat down in bewilderment of distress anxiety what must possibly have happened asked if anything have gone wrong at vail if mr francis to imagine worst have even died suddenly surely harry must have told then why did wish to see lady oxted apparently not wish to see miss aylwin for moment thought there might be light here be conceivable that have proposed to be refused when where for geoffrey have left not two hour ago in accustomed good spirit again if have ever felt certain of anything be that unless girl be most infernal finished flirt ever made for undoing of man attraction between two be deep mutual girl have ever seemed to le like flirt than evie even if be so why must harry at once wish to go to lady oxted thing have answer there be nothing to do wait wait drearily listen to hiss of faster falling rain harry drove to grosvenor square through blinking lightning be shown up like geoffrey lady oxted be appalled at drawn haggard face like geoffrey too question whether evie have refused suggested to be instantly rejected dear boy what be matter cried have bad news from vail harry took letter from pocket folded down so a to leave ten line of large legible hand for to read will

nervous even when only audience be very ordinary person have thought matter over in own mind so constantly that hoped be familiarized with when came to speaking of found be not thus be that began very haltingly with frequent pause feel sure that be essentially opposed to marriage said for reason will soon tell when professes to be so much delighted with conclude be acting part now one have always to be cautious in dealing with man who be acting until know what part be what be a regard mr francis know feel sure however that be very clever old man well be not pure assumption that be acting part asked geoffrey be reasoned truth will tell how know sunday that evie be down at vail mr francis evie evie told harry a heard yesterday corroborated part of walked in afternoon in wood just above house suddenly came on one of groom jim yes name be jim walking out with young woman who be dairymaid now jim in appearance have seen many time probably be very spit image of harry evie only have most momentary glance of thought actually be harry till saw hour later sleeping under tree on lawn appears that mr francis also thought be harry for said to half aloud 'ah foolish boy now geoffrey have known harry time well have ever known behave a many young men do behave talk to barmaid flirt with waitress that kind of thing never never did such thing at oxford used to call womanthrope then explain to what follows mr francis begged evie not to be too hard on said that harry be honest that 'previous foolishness exact expression evie tell have never be anything serious now say there never be never said geoffrey not to knowledge at least oh can go much further than know there can not have be harry simply be not that kind of fellow then appears to that mr francis only alluded to harmless nature of harry previous foolishness in order to set evie against nice girl know doe not like sort of thing how be that never occurred to mr francis that two figure saw be jim young woman be impossible that must not seems to two be engaged harry tell often walk out together mr francis must have known that must also have known of jim extraordinary likeness to harry likeness deceived miss aylwin by way have ever seen jim yes evening before only yet be deceived why not mr francis also lady oxted paused be very unlikely grant that be possible take what have told alone prof nothing there be more be speaking le lamely now word have begun to come met harry in hall when came back from having tea with fortnight ago said how did face strike be very happy do know cause of harry did not tell though asked then will tell said lady oxted know how face struck for came to see immediately afterward thought be over between evie harry thought so too reason for be letter have just received of showed piece in mr francis know be harry told so afterward said that evie be engaged to italian marchese here again there be certain foundation for thinking so be true at rate that last winter italian in rome fell very violently in love with that proposed to evie refused point blank thing be talked about for be very good match mr francis tell harry be engaged may have be told so again be just possible though not more than possible now take two incident together in mr francis made let say mistake on one occasion mistook groom for harry on other say that evie be engaged to italian whereas be never true refused now doe common motive seem to lie behind two mistake supposing for moment that mistake be well deliberate mistake very cleverly founded on fact grant can account for of by supposing one desire in mr francis mind see what mean said geoffrey say then want said mean that mr francis wished to prevent engagement be that bald enough yes will do be possibility must not be overlooked have failed see reason to suppose that anything have since happened reconciles to marriage letter to harry in answer to announcement of engagement be charming perfectly charming so be letter in urged to be brave cut evie out of life with firm hand so also doubt be manner when begged evie to overlook harry platonic little walk with dairymaid geoffrey felt vaguely uneasy now that thing be said to knew that somewhere in very inmost recess of brain there have lurked for time feeling of be ashamed secret unaccountable distrust of kind old man have be emphasized by curious adventure of dr armytage door since then have grown more alert more ready to put up head now why continued lady oxted speaking rapidly must wish to separate two must have thought harry thought still think that by marriage mr francis will feel that old stain of suspicion that for so long have be on name ever since harmsworth affair will be removed have good reason for thinking so mr francis told that evie coming to vail be happiest thing have happened to for year why then must not marry perhaps mr francis find that continual revival of memory miss aylwin call up be too painful said geoffrey doe that seem to reasonable asked lady oxted if reasonable can mortal mind invent more awful piece of selfishness geoffrey considered moment no doe not seem to reasonable said recant can think of other motive ah be monstrous said geoffrey suddenly suggest monstrous thing have suggested nothing want to hear suggestion what be geoffrey mean that mr francis doe not want harry to marry at remember that be heir do not see how absurd such idea be who ever heard of old man over seventy trying to make grand nephew celibate might a well hope to rear child who must never see fire book ah be shocked said lady oxted wait moment do remember what told about dr godfrey dr armytage geoffrey what be sinister man doing at vail be appalling tell be one of black spot on medical profession heart specialist be surgeon of terrible dexterity unscrupulous venal what doe mr francis want with geoffrey got up in great excitement will hear no more said in tremulous voice be who suggest thing have to put into word tell what mean say straight out what suspect lady oxted rose too if knew what suspected must tell said ca make out what be at rate have talked long enough for present paused moment then broke out again own anxiety how deep have never known till minute breaking bound promise cried promise will be good friend to harry be much with be observant not suspicious observant remember be afraid though know what of see if can not find out what be that fear there be enough promise that geoffrey will not play detective said like honour old man ask to play detective said pray that liking honour for mr francis may never be diminished be much with harry be full of common sense come yes will promise said part ii chapter xv frost harry left london at end of month paid couple of visit in england then went to scotland for remainder of august loitered there since be at same two house a evie till september have reached second decade of day then travelled south again with be on way straight to santa margarita to spend remainder of month of month with mother harry saw off by boat express from victoria having sternly absolutely refused to let do anything so foolish a to travel to dover with must propose coming to calais next said calais be step to paris know harry how hate journey how must love if be with oh let come said not even to herne hill train slid out of vaulted gloom of station geoffrey joined late on same day next afternoon set off together down to vail stock brokering appeared be like pheasant quite impossible in september be going to spend remainder of month with harry unless unforeseen urgency called back considered be not in least degree likely to happen for unforeseen so seldom occurs house be upside down geoff said harry to a drove from station time employ in getting severe electric shock over unprotected wire will probably spend in falling into hot cold water alternately upstairs housemaid closet seem to just now only really important thing in england thought better not to tell before started for fear of not coming oh can always go back said geoffrey be mr francis there just now be be going away in few day said harry in fact be only waiting till come to put unprotected wire into hand be well yes extraordinarily well asked after in last letter to also seems wonderfully happy at thought of marriage so be pleased well be sure wonder will be sort of death blow to tragedy twenty year old more now sort of seal attestation of vileness of suspicion besides know be pretty nice for one to have evie in house always be going to continue being with then asked geoffrey certainly a much a will evie settled without disagreement thank be also thinking of having little ventre terre a somebody said in town sort of little independence of own be delighted that will six month ago must bear thought of going about among people again now be all changed will begin to live again after year dear old fellow what good friend have be to fancy caring about people of twenty so when be over seventy what wonderful vitality shadow of approaching cloud so thought geoffrey might darken lady oxted view of future be clear that to harry there must not have be more serene horizon since first afternoon down at oxted have not exchanged further word with one else on subject by degree ghastly conversation have grown gradually fainter in mind be to now more of texture of remembered nightmare than actual experience for several day afterward be true have remained very unpleasantly vivid to have be so ingenious in presentation of undeniable fact at time perhaps for fortnight afterward have nearly seemed to that mr francis have be plotting with diabolical ingenuity against match if such be case apparent delight at assumed aspect infinitely grave portentous smile must have be creditable to fiend a sharper edge of memory grew dulled thought have never be quite sufficiently solid to be called sober suspicion became gradually nebulous again two circumstance have be foundation of lady oxted theory separately capable of explanation in making judgment so serious be acme of unfairness so seemed to now to put two together judge must be weighed considered on separate merit if have weight alone then have weight together there have be darker insinuation to follow at geoffrey now laughed so baseless appeared fabric dr armytage might might not be reputable man idea of connecting visit to vail when one remembered how long have known mr francis with something sinister unspoken with regard to harry be really triumph for diseased imagination be one of sequel of influenza oddly enough a if by thought transference harry next word bore relation to train of idea have be passing through geoffrey mind do remember that evening when went to find dr godfrey geoff said well have so often thought about since have determined to tell uncle francis about ask to explain appeared excellent plan to geoffrey for little a believed in solidity of lady oxted bubble of imagination must still be good thing to have pricked do said ask time when be there must like to see face when little ruse be exposed might be useful lesson personally never know how to look when little rus be discovered harry laughed there be excellent explanation behind may be sure of that said accordingly at dinner night in pause in conversation harry suddenly asked seen dr godfrey again uncle francis have have occasion to send for be thankful to say answered have be wonderfully well last two month geoff went to see one night at wimpole street continued harry oh be not going to consult just went to house must have be hard to say whether pause followed speech in case be moment before mr francis broke out into hearty cheerful laugh will be bound did go in cried dear godfrey must have be delighted to see though ah harry what good thing be friend be always finding other out so actually went to wimpole street found not dr godfrey on plate dr armytage how did get address rascal 'where be ' be lying on table last night be here when worked at electric light estimate turned to g simple said mr francis everything be simple when know about explanation be simple too did want to go to armytage fuss about so when asked for name told if remember christian name godfrey be afraid gave wrong address be dear fellow dear good fellow sort of man who warns against tetanus if cut shaving must certainly have alarmed how unnecessarily look at now judge know too much be always telling so know how many thing may go wrong bear in mind yes dear boy deceived purposely do acquit throw on mercy beg to bear in mind how kindly be intention without stain on character said harry coffee be brought in at moment templeton a usual bearing case of luck have be centrepiece at dinner ah be going to put luck to bed said harry drink to luck get up geoff geoffrey rose in obedience to toastmaster looking across at mr francis saw that hand trembled little genial smile be there seemed to geoffrey in momentary glance have of over flower that be smile rather of habit than happiness glass be full few drop be spilled a raised to mouth thing trivial a be struck with curious sense of double consciousness seemed to that be repetition of previous experience exact in particular passed off immediately vague rather uncomfortable impression made on sank below surface of mind be already dim a soon a be made so be together again three said mr francis when have drunk to luck carefully watched stowage in case be like jolly time have last christmas when dear fellow came of age what chapter of little misfortune have too when be not slipping on step be falling into fire when be not falling into fire be catching severe chill not fault said harry be luck dear boy be always jesting about luck do be careful harry if take care day will find that have fancied into believing six eight month have passed since then what have suffered since at hand of fire frost rain ah see cried harry curse came first then luck met evie be not that stupendous perhaps curse will wake up again will sprain ankle worse than before burn hand more seriously before before middle of november care be cheap wonder can turn out happiness at trifling cost suspect there be sweating commission at place where old scoundrel who made luck have gone mr francis looked really pained come come harry said gravely let go boy will be wanting to clear away implication of rebuke nettled harry be little excited little intoxicated with joy of life little headstrong with youth health did not quite relish being pulled up like even though only before geoffrey did not reply with scarcely perceptible shrug of shoulder followed mr francis out shortly after uncle got out flute melody of corelli baptiste tinkled merrily under portrait of race next day uncle nephew have estate business to occupy work mr francis gaily declared 'twould like topmost jargarus take morning geoffrey be given dog keeper gun to amuse till lunch time wanted nothing better soon after breakfast be off away for must find in wood hedgerow stubble only small brown bird be dedicated for to morrow mr francis harry worked on till one on striking of hour latter revolted ca go on more said simply ca come out till lunch uncle francis be only hour mr francis smiled shook head not to day dear boy replied there be packet of letter have to get through before post do get out harry sweep cobweb away harry stood up stretching after long session cobweb what cobweb asked in curly head there be such cobweb o uncle francis a be talking of cobweb want to get summerhouse on knoll put in order one close to ice house mean have key by way be mr francis be writing a harry spoke though did not look up pen ceased travelling yes very good idea said after moment key be in cabinet there two of same same key fit indeed pen began slowly moving again indeed will find plenty of cobweb there summerhouse be one on left a ascend knoll going from house go plunging into ice house by mistake be shuttered on inside must be good thing if be to open window let get good blow out will oh must stick to work harry found key a turned to leave room one on left be summerhouse asked again yes one on left said mr francis again fully absorbed in writing harry key in hand went out whistling hatless morning be page out of heaven a strolled slowly up steep grassy bank where two outhouse stood with scent sound of life summer vivid in eye nostril felt that useful occupation of hour since breakfast have be terrible waste when might have be going quietly alert with geoffrey through cover up hedgerow to tapping of stick nosing of spaniel however have be through farm account with minute care there must be call for such morning till closing of next quarter two building toward went be exactly alike of hybrid kiosk sort of appearance fantastic ridiculous yet vaguely pleasing be octagonal with three blank side four window door still whistling full of pleasant thought fitted key into lock of one to left hand turning walked in interior be dark for a mr francis have told window be shuttered inside coming out of bright sunlight for moment two saw nothing for same reason doubt struck a being very cold have taken three four rather shuffling step across paved floor when suddenly stopped somehow though saw nothing ear instinctively hardly consciously warned that sound of step be not normal there must have be whole feeling be not reasoned purely automatic instinctive echo to in so circumscribed building echo there be faint hollow remote audible at whistling stopped step also drawing loose match from trouser pocket struck match le than pace in front of be black space on match cast illumination remained black harry felt little beady dew break out on forehead on short down of upper lip nerve did not tell that be afraid waited exactly where be till match have burned more bravely then chucked forward over blackness went through for two three second sound came to then heard little expiring hiss still not conscious of fright went back with light of match for door have swung shut behind in moment be out again with sweet soft sunshine round firm grass beneath foot looked round yes have gone to left hand building one uncle have told be summerhouse have nearly also not come out again at sobering reflection belated spasm of fear for have felt none at moment of danger seized laying violent hold of marched up to other door unlocked throwing open waited on threshold till eye have got accustomed to darkness then seeing couple of wicker table garden chair peer through gloom went in turn to window unshuttered threw open at moment iron gate leading into wood close behind clanged suddenly with jump testified to jangled nerve looked out be geoffrey gun on shoulder coming back to house harry leaned out of window come in here geoff said geoffrey looked round halloo have be opening old summerhouse asked yes said harry very deliberately have be opening old summerhouse geoffrey handed gun to keeper who be close behind vaulted in through one of open window rare good morning have have said must have come harry why look queer what be matter harry have sat down in one of garden chair be leaning back feeling suddenly faint have have devil of fright said went gaily marching into ice house by mistake only just stopped on lip of ice tank well know be either must probably have done lord how can be such as cried geoffrey knew that one of two be ice house yet go whistling along out of sunshine into pit mirk never reflect that chance be exactly even that next moment will be in kingdom come give cigarette jaw said harry smoked minute two without speaking say nothing about to uncle said at length believe must frighten to death asked just before came out be summerhouse told left hand one of two a go up from house well made mistake turn out that left hand one be ice house what shouted geoffrey whole talk with lady oxted suddenly springing into mind like jack in box ca hear what say asked harry rather irritable from fright uncle francis have forgotten be nearly went a put in kingdom come in consequence there be nothing to shout about for god sake let know what happened really believe might be death of be nearly death of said geoffrey well be quite so there be end of anyhow tell insist on not telling come let go down to house be steadier now remember being frightened at moment when there be longer reason to be frightened knee withered under a approached house across upper lawn saw mr francis distance off in one of shady alley going down to lake walking away from panama hat with bright ribbon be on head at mouth be flute quick trill run of light hearted southern dance floated toward suddenly must seem gaiety of own music took irresistible hold on for with preliminary pirouette little cut in air foot be taken by infection two lad lost sight of round bend in path performing brisk impromptu step to melody looked at then at other moment in silence harry with dawning smile geoffrey with deepening frown must tell about ice house affair for ten thousand pound said harry geoff wonder if will be a gay a when be over seventy year old be highly improbable said geoffrey still wanted quarter of hour to lunch time harry went indoors to finish up geoffrey however remained outside a soon a harry be gone began playing very curious original game by consisted in stalking mr francis be played in following manner hurried over grass to entrance of path where have last seen followed cautiously from bush to bush soon have sound of flute again to guide after little hearing that be getting louder retired on own step from shade of certain rhododendron observed cheery old gentleman coming back again along path have taken mr francis passed not thirty yard from stalker then music ceased crossed lawn in direction of two kiosk at sudden nameless thrill of horror took hold of geoffrey creeping after till kiosk have cleared angle of house observed doings with fascinated attention mr francis went first to ice house turned handle of door apparently found locked stood there few second flute in hand taking off panama hat passed handkerchief over forehead for day be very warm then must seem that open window of summerhouse caught eye in turn trying that door found open did not however enter merely held door open standing on threshold then turned rather slowly for grass maybe be slippery from long drought began to descend again toward house geoffrey on part made wide circuit through shrubbery emerged on to gravel in front of house just a mr francis entered latter saw apparently have word for on moment bell for lunch rang meal usually be merry talkative lunch to day perhaps only proved rule for be eminently silent geoffrey be gloomy preoccupied mind in endless tangle of indecision shocked horrified yet ever telling that nightmare of morning must not be true harry also nerve still on edge with experience of last hour be inclined to brevity of question answer while brisk cheerfulness of mr francis a rule must cover paucity of two seemed replaced by kind of dreamy tenderness sighed ate little be a if mind dwelt on regret of what might have be perhaps weather be in part responsible for marked decay of elasticity for clear warmth of morning have given place to dead sultriness of heat atmosphere have grown heavy full of thunder at last a rose from very silent meal went up to summerhouse morning uncle francis said harry with air of man who have thought carefully over what be going to say want putting in order for be damp very cobwebby a warned must be worth while to do there be charming view from window will send couple of servant up to clean make bit more habitable do dear boy do said mr francis dear old place dear old place father used to be so fond of threatening of storm grew moment more imminent two young men who have intended to ride over down decided to postpone expedition stood together at window of smoking room watching awful mysterious mobilization of cloud hard black edge of thunder ragged a if bitten off immense pall coming up against what wind there be rising higher moment toward zenith ready to topple break once scribble of light illegible gigantic autograph be traced against blackness gong of thunder a yet remote testified authenticity before long few large drop of rain jumped like frog on gravel path below window hot local eddy of unaccountable wind like grappling iron let down from moving vapour above scoured across lawn stirring rattling dry leaved laurel in shrubbery expunging a passed reflection on lake died away little breeze there have be drooped like broken wing willow by water be motionless a in picture candle on lawn must have burned with a steady flame a in glass shade within sealed room fast fading light be coppery in colour darkness came on apace a great bank of congested cloud shouldered way over sky despite gloom there be great precision of outline in hill tree harry turned from window will have to light lamp said be impossible to see indoors really look like day of judgment will have game of billiards geoff a spoke door be opened with hurried stealth mr francis pale strangely shrunken to appearance came in ah here be said be afraid have gone out be alone be not horrible be going to have terrific storm what relief to find here must have be so anxious if have be out in be just going to billiard room said harry come with uncle francis will play pool cut in out thank dear harry must not possibly play with storm coming on said thunder always affect horribly if will let will come with perhaps mark for can not bear being alone in thunderstorm went to billiard room harry lit lamp while mr francis creeping like mouse round wall taking advantage of cover of curtain began hurriedly closing shutter oh why do do asked harry will not see lightning even a spoke swift streamer of violet light shot down bisecting square of window where mr francis be nervously tugging at shutter for moment showing vividly dark stagnant shape of drooping tree mr francis hand fell from shutter a if have be struck with little moaning sigh covered face with hand almost simultaneously reverberating crash not booming rumbling short sharp answered lightning mr francis hurried with crouching step to sofa put up shutter implore harry said in stifled voice shut quickly draw curtain over ah cried with whistling intake of breath there be again terror be too evident deep seated not to be pitied two young men hastily closed shutter drawing curtain over a mr francis have requested be done be done asked in muffled voice face half buried in sofa cushion be quick oh be quick for hour sat there with closed eye finger muffled ear while storm exploded overhead picture of cowering terror while other two played couple of game from time to time if there have be comparatively long interval of quiet must begin to take little interest in play once even when for five minute steady tattoo of rain on lead overhead have continued unbroken by more violent sound went to marking board next moment dirling peal made rest drop from hand at shuffling run went back to sofa again hid ear eye storm passed gradually away sharp crack of overhead thunder gave place to distant yet more distant rumbling afternoon be not over when mr francis cautiously opening chink of shutter let in long dusty ray of sunshine heaven be clear again washed by rain of most pellucid blue mr francis recovering with mercurial rapidity went gaily from window to window unshuttering what relief what blessed relief cried how delicious be freshness after storm ah beauty of world drink in be meat drink to nodded to others must go out said must go out see if horrible storm be past have done damage be afraid tree may have be struck by cruel lightning in strength beauty be terrible to think of exquisite delicate life rent shattered in moment by flame went out two others looked at other like augur nerve said harry bad conscience said geoffrey be comment made by on mr francis hour of purgatory be too late when storm be over to go intended ride after tea harry geoffrey sauntered aimlessly out played red indian again among island of lake game on present occasion be far le delightful to harry than when have played last finally came homeward a dusk fell a passed down box hedge suddenly occurred to harry so imaginative have be realism with friend have played red indian that geoffrey be perhaps capable of seeing secret of inside passage in suitably romantic light took round to back of hedge mystery geoff deep dark mystery said shutting eye against springing twig have overgrown door jumped into hedge elastic fibre of box flew back like spring into normal position geoffrey who for moment have be intent with back turned on lighting of cigarette looked up when operation be over found that harry have vanished a suddenly a completely a lady in cabinet trick in dusk be impossible except to one who knew where to look to see difference of uniformity in texture of hedge illusion of vanishing be complete here geoff come in said harry still invisible put out that match be darker than plague of egypt come where how where be harry laughed held back twig be great success said o geoffrey if have spark of romantic left in think have for be masterly red indian ought to make blaze look tunnel right down hedge be that secret heavenly think how many plot might overhear if people be only kind enough to make a went down road think of stirring rescue must make hiding here till pursuit went by geoffrey be quite suitably impressed call really ancestral said talk low harry may be overheard where doe lead to right down to house come out by door like one went in by just opposite gun room window geoff if will conceal here to morrow will bring meal when can slip away without attracting attention must smoke be afraid oh if only there be smallest cause for doing so said geoff doe one know except think so dare ask uncle francis if doe for fear doe will tell evie one else lord what baby one be why doe give pleasure there just peep out at end geoffrey so that if be pursued from house will know where door be be cautious now will walk up again inside steal softly out where came in else one from house might see think not match be too risky must like to give one low whistle said geoffrey just a signal right even a whistle be on lip there came from somewhere close at hand sudden gush of note from flute two stood there huddled against other in narrow passage petrified into sudden silence immobility shaken with inward laughter peering on tiptoe a be through hedge must just make out figure of mr francis walking airily along grass border by edge of drive on way to house soon foot sounded crisp distant on gravel two idiot breathed again near thing said harry let go back geoff if have lit that match must almost certainly have be discovered mr francis left early next morning for london to see two three little flat one of thought might perhaps be compassable by modest sum be prepared to give for pied terre in town none of be in very fashionable district one seemed to most promising be in wigmore street held forth additional advantage of being near cavendish square harry have telegraphed to care taker there to get couple of room ready for uncle without knowledge for must certainly have deprecated step have sent up from vail kitchen maid who be also very decent cook in order to make more comfortable mr francis have breakfasted trap to take to station be already at door when two young men came down hailed genially from threshold a luggage be put up good morning dear boy cried will have lovely day for shoot be perfect after yesterday storm yes be just off be sorry to say will stop at least week in town expect harry will let know when be thinking of coming back harry went out just a uncle climbed nimbly up into dogcart geoffrey have stayed in hall be glancing at paper uncle francis said do take more expensive flat in de vere garden if find suit better consider extra expense at can manage for perfectly be too generous to dear harry said other stretching down grasping hand dear boy must not think of will be immensely comfortable in one in wigmore street thank thank luggage in drive on jim said abruptly harry turned indoors went across hall to dining room mr francis after having driven not more than couple of hundred yard stopped cart descending began to walk toward house halfway there stopped stood for moment lost in thought then with air of taken decision went on more quickly on threshold again stopped biting lip frowning heavily at moment geoffrey got up from paper crossing door into entrance hall on way to join harry in dining room saw through glass door standing like went to see why have come back face met be face of old francis wicked malignant mask even a harry have seen that day when sun shone brightly on picture next moment changed melted thought have gone said geoffrey have forgotten something yes flute said mr francis not looking at picking up from where lay on piano went out again walked quickly up drive to where dogcart be waiting be not what came for thought geoffrey to chapter xvi fire harry be in most extravagantly high spirit morning at breakfast two laughed over most indifferent triviality like schoolboy story without wit of bluntest kind of point rude personal remark repartee of most obvious futile kind be enough to make one other usually fit to choke with meaningless laughter to geoffrey at least there be great conscious cause for mounting spiritual barometer in departure of mr francis yesterday since have seen tripping up to ice house after harry escape have grown increasingly aware of creepiness of flesh neighbourhood thought of produced have not slept well during night have kept awaking from snatch of nightmare dozing in sometimes mr francis sometimes figure of portrait of old francis must be enticing harry on to dim violent doom now like infernal piper of hamelin mr francis must precede harry playing on flute drawing ever nearer to bank of lurid cloud out of from time to time leaped crooked lightning now must have affectionately by arm walk with chatting laughing toward little house stood on rising ground house to tongue tied dreamer who longed to warn friend must not kept changing in form now must stand alone now must be one in countless row of house alike stretching to left right from horizon to horizon whether solitary among hundred identical with knew that there lurked there danger of vague fatal kind sometimes be beam very stone of be ready to fall a soon a door be opened sometimes window of knew must bristle with shooting flame a soon a harry set foot within sometimes must see that be in reality house at black pit infinite in depth from rose icy miasma yet in form harry companion appeared in form house when be close to mr francis must push harry suddenly forward with animal cry of gratified hate geoffrey must start from dream in sweat of terror then there be shocking point man who walked with harry be indefinite changeable must start with in image of mr francis must yet be stone throw on walk when be mr francis more old baron of holbein picture sometimes evie face must look out in panic terror from upper window dreamer must see wave hand hear scream warning two apparently must neither see hear drew steadily nearer that house of death sanity of morning sun crisp chill of bath above departure of mr francis restored geoffrey to normal level normal once reached pendulum swung over to other side by a much a have fallen short during nervous terror of night ate with zest appetite more than ordinary keen conscious relish for day even at end of ridiculous meal when have already laughed to exhaustion fresh spasm suddenly seized harry paused teacup in hand to know worst oh be nothing said geoffrey indeed did strike a at funny at time a came across hall there be mr francis at door though have heard dogcart start have come back for something have forgotten guess what be only give one guess harry hand began to tremble corner of mouth to break down fl flute said in quivering tone right shouted geoffrey wonder oh oh hurt wonder whether will do step round cavendish square to night playing on have begun to drink tea moment too soon smoked cigarette in hall geoffrey eager to be off harry contrary to habit strangely inclined to loiter talk have veered to more serious subject of shooting harry be expressing old fashioned preference for gun with hammer to more usual hammerless ca think why do prefer said there be put gun at half cock instinctively if have to jump ditch feel quite at home with little disk uncovering beafe supposing must be come along geoff will start a be in such hurry men meet at lodge will just get gun go went down stone flagged passage to gun room looked out on box hedge there be two gun lying on table geoffrey after looking at other took up own be consistent chap said to harry after tell of preference for hammer shoot apparently with hammerless harry picked up gun looked at not mine said uncle francis ah there be mine gun with hammer be leaning nearly upright in rough gun stand more like stand for stick in corner harry took hold of halfway up barrel then seemed to geoffrey to give little jerk a if have stuck on moment there be loud explosion horrible raking scratch be torn in wooden panelling of wall irregular hole opened in ceiling charge must not have missed harry by more than three inch stood there smoking gun in hand without tremor then turned to geoffrey luck be waking up said frost yesterday be ice house look awfully like fire several pane of glass in window have be shattered by concussion harry pointed gun out now for second barrel said click of falling trigger be only answer opened breech took out smoking cartridge case one cartridge only said then looking down barrel left barrel be clean look rather a if gun have be cleaned cartridge put in afterward odd thing to happen now will go shooting geoff geoffrey be holding on to table trembling violently be not hurt said must go shooting if be come old chap pull together there be harm done will make inquiry about say anything geoff be going to look into thoroughly detective fashion be frightened asked geoffrey feebly funnily enough be not be luck firmly believe be luck poor old devil who put curse in be doing thing in thoroughly futile manner be ashamed of ah destroy beastly thing cried geoffrey burn smash chuck away not oh be cheap be awfully cheap hole in ceiling penny for cartridge november coming closer do mean to say believe in asked geoffrey yes believe in good god man somebody put cartridge there somebody told that summerhouse be on left stopped suddenly yes uncle francis told that said harry who made forget be of two house why luck blessed luck cried almost exultantly at nightmare of last twelve hour swarmed round geoffrey flapping about head who put cartridge in gun cried not thinking how direct accusation be making harry face grew suddenly grave smile be struck from flash of anger intense surprise flamed in eye upper lip curled back in ugly way then seeing geoffrey holding on to table still dazed white recovered come old boy said be so much upset yet geoff must say that sort of thing even in jest have whisky soda before going out be shaky believe in luck like will take thing more calmly yes mean at last really mean be inheritor of curse blessing so take good with bad oh how much one outweighs other by way painter be in house must patch up paper here mend hole in ceiling will order whisky for at same time be right said geoffrey followed other out harry be at time good shot to day verged on brilliancy geoffrey on other hand who a rule be more than good to day be worse than bad gun be laggard shot behind crossing game below anything be flying straight away from be not certain about easiest shot be only certain to miss more difficult one seemed indeed that two have divided between accident in gun room infinitely short moment in harry have felt hot breath of fire sharp agonizing like pulled tooth be reaction retarded fear subsequent effect on nerve brain be entered to geoffrey be utterly unstrung by double escape twice during last twenty four hour in peaceful country house have harry looked in very face of death yesterday stepping gaily toward lip of ice tank to day by a little margin escaping shattering extinction foot more foot le a thought of geoffrey bit lip for fear of screaming brain bone must have be shredded over gun room floor accident must happen there have always be accident there always must be unlike misfortune nearly always came singly what be malignancy haunted harry dogging step what dim figure deadly full of hate hovered on wing by ready to strike cartridge automatically find way to gun be cleaned placed in stand a dust collect in corner have to be placed there human hand have to open breech stuff with death close put gun down again thing must inevitably happen before gun go off who in case did came by one o'clock to one of prettiest piece of rough shooting on ground long very narrow strip of moorland country bounded on side by reclaimed field tufted thickly with heather diversified by young clump of fir dense low growing bush honey combed with rabbit burrow be scarcely more than sixty yard across full half mile in length sport afforded be most varied unconjecturable on warm day partridge must be here covey after covey sunning in sandy little hollow bare of growth busy among heather from thickness of cover undulation of ground big covey must seldom take air together rise one by one in couple without general alarm being given to right left of gun even behind so close have bird lain in long grass here there attempt have at one time be made to bring land into cultivation a tramped through heather must suddenly come on vague edged square of potato planting vegetable run riot with great wealth of thick leaf strip of corn already half wild with predominant ingredient of tare must make go slowly on certainty of break of brown wing delayed head down scurry of hare to happily old fashioned enough to care for sober joy of walking up be very poetry of sport to day appeared to geoffrey barren unprofitable place for last hour question tormented have be volleying even more insistently horrible doubt suspicion no longer quite vague flocked round head like flight of unclean bird desired one thing only to get to gun room alone clear up certain point have to walk over bare depopulated stubble to get to delectable ground harry a neared looked first at geoffrey lacklustre face then at watch have idea be so late geoff said think will take rough after lunch be only mile from house look a if lunch must do good took cartridge carefully out of gun mistake time said will start over rough at two kimber meet here oh by way come up to house want to ask something geoffrey gave up gun with sigh of relief yes let do piece afterward said ca hit sitting haystack morning harry there be one have shot at said harry o geoff look so awful what have happened there be hole in gun room ceiling did do be not going to send bill to be frightened asked geoffrey be made of flesh blood believe so have ever have shave of being shot will bet did give thought hour afterward know be more cold blooded indoors happening way did coming on top of ice house affair yesterday be luck cried harry be explanation of be proved to hilt fire frost be done scratch out now there remains rain be afraid will not get rain to day though if one have to go through thing certainly have be better to get over quick a to do justice be getting over o geoff there be good time coming harry have to see foreman who be in charge of electric light a well a keeper when got in geoffrey after seeing go upstairs went quickly through baize door at end of passage from hall down to gun room wanted to find out what have caused harry to give jerk to gun when took up have consciously seen moment before went off put hand to lift out of stand then give additional effort a if have stuck morning have be wondering about that obstacle whatever be must felt certain have be in connection with trigger for be that jerk have caused gun to go off men have already be at work over damage have gone to dinner room be empty went to rack where gun have stood next moment gave sudden little gasp though not of surprise for have found only what expected must find something like round post at corner of rack be tied piece of cotton two end six inch long came out from extremity be ragged a if piece have be broken gun with hammer stood in glazed cupboard at one side of room geoffrey took out leaned in rack a nearly a possible in position in remembered harry gun to have stood then kneeling down stretched two broken end of cotton in direction just went round right trigger have momentary impulse to call harry show decided not to harry a have said be going to investigate mysterious presence of cartridge in cleaned gun if must trace how got there then must be time to throw on fresh evidence till then be far better that must not know for at present be inclined to treat affair a accident due doubt to gross negligence nothing worse matter of looped cotton however gave far more sinister aspect to affair knowledge that there be foul work here be burden must be spared at rate till further light be cast so very carefully unknotted cotton from post of rack put in pocket knot noticed be ordinary reef so familiar to fly fisher somehow certainty of what have feared suspected even though worst of suspicion be confirmed served to steady knew now exactly what be to be faced deliberate very cunningly devised attempt on harry life look at way must must not conceivably be accident taken alone presence of cartridge in cleaned gun have be difficult mouthful even for imagination in favour of accident to swallow taken in conjunction with piece of looped cotton must not be tackled went over circumstance slowly carefully a put piece of cotton in cigarette case there have be two gun on table a turned out not harry mr francis harry gun loaded trap of nearly certain death to one who took up be leaning in gun rack here be thought of brain have contrived thing bell for lunch made hurry out of room in hall found harry reporter have be visiting scene of dastardly attempt said something spicy for evening paper geoff oh by way asked kimber what must tell about gun of mine must tell lot come in to lunch what must tell asked geoffrey harry looked at servant moment later said oh how bless man who invented lunch do remember saying to once little thing like bath tea be much more important than anything else yes called sensuous voluptuary said geoffrey believe did so be so be sensuous voluptuary went out again a soon a lunch be over to shoot rough a walked harry told friend what have learned from keeper asked first said without telling what have happened who put two gun yours uncle on table did know have come in early to get cartridge put gun out found there so took cartridge went now until morning have shot here since last february did take gun behaved so so prematurely to day to scotland so asked whether one have used since went away appeared that uncle francis have several time for own gun hammerless one found on table have gone to maker to have rust hole taken out do follow perfectly well two day ago day came down here kimber be feeding pheasant heard shot near at hand moment afterward wounded hare ran across clearing followed immediately by uncle francis be almost cry said kimber do remember how wounded hare last christmas be out for hour trying to recover well same thing have happened be first shot remember that kimber be certain there have be only one time hare have run into thick cover there be really chance of getting for have be hit kimber saw only in one leg now attend geoff very closely be quite detective story a stood there kimber saw uncle francis take discharged cartridge case out of right barrel slip unused cartridge from left into now that bear stamp of truth on have seen uncle francis do just that dozen time when have killed with first barrel doe not immediately expect shot to continue then drew cartridge from pocket suddenly said ' can shoot more with poor wounded thing unfound snapped breech to went home now do see did kimber clean gun afterward said harry uncle francis man always clean gun probably seeing return to house almost immediately after have set out go into garden naturally thought that have decided not to shoot did not clean gun be why second barrel be clean shot have be fired from uncle francis simply forgot that have left one cartridge in whole thing hang completely together then came picked up gun quickly doubt hitting trigger against something there be hole in ceiling once again geoffrey thought of looped cotton once again decided not to tell harry there be use at present especially since mr francis be not here in giving so sinister piece of information that certainly clear up lot said conscious of deadly double meaning of word clear up said harry will tell now that felt horribly uncomfortable about morning though be not frightened of course be awfully careless of uncle francis to leave cartridge in awfully careless of man not to look to gun thought uncle francis have not be shooting for must have returned to house not more than quarter of hour after set out must have saved lath plaster if have made sure here be now for rough mr francis geoffrey now believed beyond doubt in secret mind be le accountable for gun room explosion than for mistake about ice house harry story proof to other of direct hand be in way relief to morning have feared dreaded indication of second hand of gamekeeper privy to deed of servant suborned in particular fancy have fixed on dark man of mr francis with foxlike face tread of cat about there be something secret stealthy so said imagination heated by horrid occurrence of two day yet secrecy stealth be le abominable than smile of master sunny cheerfulness playing on flute so lately a morning geoffrey have laughed when thought of flute flute in connection with white hair old age have seemed to amusing ridiculous now memory of own merriment amazed tear be bitter enough for contemplation of deadliness of hypocrisy hate thought of italian air tripping step of performer with bewilderment of horror have not known how finished article must be turned out of workshop of satan at full relief occasioned by mr francis absence came upon with great taste of sweetness true last attempt have be made when old man be not actually in house so long a be away geoffrey did not fear trap must not be like man of infernal cunning to leave lying about a be series of noose into one might step desire must not so far outstrip prudence have be by merest chance that geoffrey have noticed that slight check to lifting of gun from rack by merest chance that have found looped cotton apart from have attempt succeeded evidence of kind to implicate anybody must have remained not least of cunning be shown in way that took advantage of harry credulity in power of luck by frost by fire have schemed death geoffrey must have laid odds that if by arrow by day terror by night harry life again stood in jeopardy in manner vague perhaps simple to trace rain must be agent here then told be clew of kind to guard against rain be true be vast ill defined project for such agency might be held to include many form of death from drowning to pneumonia be felt sure through supposed potency of luck mr francis be striking spent most rewarding hour afternoon over rough evening passed a be privilege of shooter in lazy dozing content one game of billiards have be succeeded by nominal reading of evening paper harry have gone upstairs to bed at eleven yawning fit to wrench off jaw not firmly muscle knit geoffrey on excuse of being too comfortable in big chair to move just yet have sat on in hall not ill pleased to be alone for have many thing to ponder have not yet made up mind what ought to do conclusive a evidence seemed to harry well knew must not possibly listen to to tell harry what believed meant simply that left house something far more conclusive must occur before told harry geoffrey prayed silently that nothing more conclusive must ever be on foot be quite satisfied with demonstration a stood curled more closely in chair began to think what after if series of event be due to luck certainly immediately after finding three accident by fire frost rain have happened to harry for none of must mr francis be held remotely responsible what if now more serious accident be to be referred to same agency geoffrey found smiling at absurdity of thought yet still continued to consider did not believe so told reasonable mind entirely rejected possibility that thing inanimate work of men hand be made of wood stone gold precious stone must control destiny mattered not a far a luck be concerned how one thought of destiny be law of nature if will unalterable of inexorable logic to refer matter one step back be will of god who have set natural law at work yet be not sin of father visited on child be not possible though ever so dimly unconjecturably that subtle law of hereditary kind governed destiny of vails without supposing that cup of gold must be responsible for danger sudden death on other hand for meting out of great happiness prosperity yet that belief in man mind a watched chasing of legend on plaque of gold be true have observed let suppose correctly observed tide in affair of vails have embodied allegorically in rhyme on cup allegory be true because illustrated be true indeed have put allegory into form extraordinarily vivid night after night gorgeous goblet have stood before diner in light of candle night after night have seemed to grow more more alive what if occult force lurked there if unsleeping presence dwelt in diamond from immemorial time men have believed that certain power quality dwelt in precious stone there be danger in opal warning turned stale dim in presence of enemy opal remarked be set in bowl handle foot of cup else here thought be confused for luck be potency might have sickened paled when mr francis ate dinner near amethyst drove away fume of wine in diamond there be sovereignty sapphire conferred judgment deep clear a on possessor what if there be truth however small residuum in tale how might potency of stone be increased if be put in appointed setting with blessing curse sat up in chair conscious that have be half dozing for chime of clock lingered on vibrating air yet have not heard hour strike still sleepy leaned back again with strong determination to go to bed instantly suddenly without cause so far a knew became broad staring awake eye might unconsciously have seen something ear unconsciously heard movement yet not have forwarded in full to brain sense told that be not alone sat up hurriedly looked around peering cautiously into room round door leading to stair barely visible in shadow be face of mr francis chapter xvii bird of night for moment spoke dear boy how late sit up said mr francis coming into room have already struck one be asleep think when came in be unwilling to awake now tell be harry all right geoffrey by time have sense alert felt perfectly cool collected saw policy stretching away in front of like level well defined road yes harry by miracle almost be alive unhurt said ah knew knew said mr francis below breath geoffrey paused moment knew what asked very deliberately knew have be in great danger said other have strongest premonition of remember seeing morning come back after have started came back to warn harry yet how absurd must think be deliberating about when saw at door wondering what must say to then told be ridiculous fancy of mine must pas off day have clung to do what must must not shake off evening came down here to see if be well spoke of harry having be in great danger tell what happened dear boy nearly shot in gun room morning said geoffrey took up gun be standing in rack close to window went off narrowly missing missed completely asked mr francis be not touched if have be touched must not be alive said geoffrey lighting cigarette looking at mr francis very intently velocity of shot at such very short range be considerable mr francis made very slight movement in chair more of tremor than voluntary motion terrible terrible said what awful fate be that dog poor harry geoffrey paused with mouth half open little wreath of smoke curling from corner of in what other way have awful fate dogged harry asked mr francis replied almost immediately three accident have last spring said how strange be quite unnerved be thinking of ice house said geoffrey to with absolute certainty be mistake then aloud be not so very serious said uncomfortable then to day yesterday mean said geoffrey trying to trap mr francis looked up inquiringly true yesterday how exact be dear fellow have forgotten that be a irish say to morrow already how awful how awful be what strange premonition meant be odd that premonition must have lasted day said geoffrey when danger be over by half past ten morning for second mr francis face altered perturbed anxious look have worn throughout interview gave place though for moment to trouble of different type annoyance must have said became more poignant than anxiety yes whole feeling have be unaccountable said poor harry what awful moment for dear lad how must cartridge have be in gun what frightful carelessness on kimber part can not have cleaned after harry used last again geoffrey paused with mouth slightly open mr francis considered be on dangerous ground be in february said eight month ago can not imagine somehow cartridge being there time be shooting in scotland be not asked mr francis yes man must not carry loaded gun in parcel rack said geoffrey be more usual for gun to be taken to bit put in case when one go by train besides a matter of fact harry did take gun to scotland there be other circumstance a well lead at rate to different conclusion different way of accounting for accident corrected what circumstance asked mr francis do get on dear boy be in dreadful anxiety to learn about awful thing oh thank god there be harm done before word be out of mouth geoffrey who for moment have hesitated what to tell made up mind stifled yawn splashed whisky soda into glass oh various circumstance said in slow well balanced tone of indifference a if subject be wearisome one of course must be well known to have used harry gun two day ago day came down here wounded hare do not remember close to pheasant feed returned home after firing only one shot also unconsciously doubt transferred second cartridge from left barrel to right will hardly remember that explains at least why left barrel be clean then idle rascal of man who be told always clean gun omitted to do there remained cartridge in at least be how harry put thing together mr francis hand went suddenly to head a if have be on wire clutched despairingly at hair be true be too true moaned did use harry gun did fire one shot only two day ago can have left other cartridge in be possible be terribly possible ah god what awful punishment for little piece of carelessness ah what lesson what lesson supposing have shot oh supposing geoffrey watched for few moment in silence a rocked backward forward in chair well well said at length there be harm done few shilling worth of lath plaster will pay for damage oh yes extra penny for cartridge a harry said nearly filled bag something more at one shot like mr winkle very cold unsympathetic consolation have astonishing effect on mr francis rockings ceased hand left head by degree face again assumed sad smile dear lad said have such invaluable common sense there be certainly use in cry over milk be not spilt what said be like douche of cold water over aching head yes aching heart tell be harry very angry with doe blame a have right to do very severely be inclined to laugh at whole thing said geoffrey know of course what simple in way natural accident be be more angry than be yesterday when stopped suddenly remembering promise to harry not to tell mr francis of ice house occurrence dearly must have liked to have broken word again remarkable change took place in mr francis face geoffrey even in middle of midnight fencing match thought what marvellous quick change artist must have made if only have decided to devote undeniable talent to innocuous branch of art smile be not frightened man sat there moving lip a if mouth be dry yesterday what of yesterday asked nothing said other shortly like just now have forgotten that be already to morrow do know be very sleepy be not ill done for mr francis must scarcely refuse to accept excuse have offered geoffrey must scarcely prevent smiling a soon a mr francis spoke again be again absolutely intent on conversation be too bad to keep up said positively must tell more about dreadful accident what else what else there be nothing more to tell said geoffrey pausing designedly for immediate object be now to thoroughly frighten mr francis meant to do slowly firmly what more indeed must there be be over in moment partly be afraid by fault partly by man cartridge be left in harry gun oh by way since be anxious for minuti there be one more tiny point might conceivably interest there seemed to happened to be looking at harry slight resistance somewhere when took gun up took hold of understand then gave jerk have occurred to very forcibly in fact that resistance whatever be be cause of gun going off trigger perhaps caught in edge of carpet suggested mr francis think so said geoffrey carelessly well something of kind said mr francis again may have be pure imagination on part think that said geoffrey gun even when loaded at full cock a one must have be doe not naturally go off when handled besides found when examined place stopped suddenly looked up at mr francis quick a lizard fear unmistakable shaking leaped there for moment be a quickly gone found asked under breath ah remind found little thing very little thing may however turn out to be important oh be ridiculous can not really tell will keep to myself please really dear geoffrey said mr francis tell story stop when come to point know said geoffrey apologize anyhow have made scrupulous examination of place have taken note of small circumstance again apologize suddenly nocturnal visit began to show in different light in geoffrey mind mr francis have come here be true at hour when might reasonably expect house to be in bed be still unlikely that have taken trouble run even so small risk of detection simply to learn result of morning accident what if have come here for something more reasonable to destroy perhaps little piece of evidence evidence might be lay even now in geoffrey cigarette case of course will not press dear geoffrey replied consider whether must not be better to tell geoffrey paused time because really wanted to think why said at length occurrence be pure accident be foul attempt on harry life yes sound horrible doe not certainly be one other now carelessness seems to account very largely for left cartridge in gun servant did not clean supposing one have reason to think that there be foul play must take evidence to police may be sure at cost to harry feeling of course yours at making affair public will do so at once moment can form that think can form conclusive series of evidence got up on word turned to light bedroom candle well good night said will see at breakfast dear boy will not said mr francis geoffrey must not tell harry have be here be almost ashamed of foolishness in coming presentiment of evil be so strong in day drove will be gone again before one be stirring breakfasting in town while lazy fellow be still dressing dare say geoffrey thought moment a will said by way how did get in got in by front door said mr francis be left unlocked very careless of servant very indeed did lock yes be just stealing upstairs when awoke have meant to go very quietly to harry room just look at dear lad to satisfy be all right if have not have good fortune to find door open must have passed night in summerhouse just seen that be well in morning hope harry will speak to templeton about door how will harry know unless know of coming ah mr francis paused moment will leave unlocked indeed must when go out can then call attention to good night dear boy will go to room too will sleep on sofa very comfortably geoffrey turned into room with slow sleepy step shut door locked then undressed very quickly over nightshirt put on dark coat be too full of appearance of mr francis of wonder what really meant to waste time in mere idle contemplation of sat on bed following out end after end of tangled conjecture harry safety during hour have to pas before morning be first thought that speedily dismissed have frightened old man said to with strong satisfaction have made tremble in wicked shoe no dare hing to night there be witness that be here that arrived secretly after dark left before morning harry be safe for to night be glad woke geoffrey lay back on bed keenly interested in what lay before astounded by possibly imminent issue hitherto life have always run very easily pleasant light business now suddenly there be thrust into young inexperienced hand red rein of life death rein governed governed not horse that must indistinctly guess at rein be in hand be business now to steer a well a must between god knew what devil deep sea thousand direction be open to in one a far a must forecast future lay disaster solution rescue felt there must be in what direction did lie to go now to harry room what risk be there what fear of eye behind curtain once there what sort of reception must meet harry have gone to bed nearly three hour ago must be plucked from sleep to hear wild tale tale so full of conjecture so scant in certainty if heard what to judge by geoffrey previous knowledge of only guide in lonely hour must be manner of taking one only knew well bewildered surprise scorn that one whom have accounted friend must bring so monstrous tale that must certainly expect indignant speech silence even more indignant rupture must not easily be healed to go to harry now must in probability mean to sever from in hour of dark need danger geoffrey got up from where be lying walked silently with bare foot up down room then stripped off coat nightshirt sluiced head neck with cold water felt awake enough stupid from sheer perplexity be determined to give faculty such a be opportunity for lively wise decision there have be for instance train of instinctive thought in mind when have shut door dressed for possible action brain have told that did not mean to go to bed yet have not told something more action in putting on dark covering have be perhaps involuntary be business now to account for ah door by mr francis have entered that be did not believe that have come in a said by front door for noise of opening shutting noise too of lock said have turned after have come in must have awoke from sleep have never quite become unconsciousness clock have struck be true moment before be completely roused have not heard how often reflected do one ear hear clock strike yet never convey message to brain be far more likely that slight stir of movement made by mr francis a peeped round inner door leading to staircase have awoke how then be possible that must have opened shut locked heavy front door have crossed hall yet never have broken in upon doze besides face that looked at be that of man peeping into room not of one leaving seemed then very likely that mr francis have not entered by front door be also hardly possible that must not have be locked at nightfall by servant who put up shutter then difficulty occurred since mr francis have by own account locked front door when came in must be locked now intended to leave house before servant be up must unlock then leaving unlocked when left on other hand supposing that geoffrey suspicion be correct have not come in by front door intended to leave house way must certainly unlock before one be about in morning then be first point must mr francis unlock front door before morning must leave house way if not how have got in how must get out be likely also more than likely that if geoffrey darker suspicion be well founded mr francis must pay visit to gun room for there be question that little circumstance have hinted at have be of more than common interest to other at moment in soft pacing thought there came little gentle tap at door stood exactly where be frozen to immobility step half taken in hand towel with have be mopping hair second two later tap be repeated very softly geoffrey be in two mind what to do be possible that small hour intruder be harry nameless terror at heart be possible again that mr francis be outside ascertaining whether be asleep with specious excuse on lip in case be awake if be harry whatever needed louder more urgent summons be sure to follow rattling of door handle own name called after second tap there be silence geoffrey knew how long waiting minute seems to watcher deliberately looked at hand of clock on mantelpiece till two full minute have passed then slipped on coat again little runnel of water still streaming from short hair above neck put match in pocket blew out candle with one turn of hand held door unlatched unlocked ward be well oiled noise le than scratching mouse stood on rug of threshold warm curly to bare foot next moment have closed door behind though without latching be in long dark corridor running from top of main stair by hall to far end of house where be mr francis two room geoffrey bedroom be close to head of stair faint glimmer of starry night filtering through skylight by be lit made easily possible to find way down stair lay in short flight with many angle sufficiently luminous on getting to first corner stopped suddenly for on wall in front of be pattern of strong light shade many knobbed banister be imprinted there cast by candle in moment shadow began to march from left to right light therefore be moving from right to left one else well knew who be also going downstairs at dead hour three turn of staircase ahead of silently moved shadow sound of candle bearer reached might reasonably hope that own barefooted step be a inaudible to night walker a night walker to then shadow of banister be suddenly turned off corner have be passed by other stealthy tread geoffrey moved on again down staircase at lower end gave on to corridor parallel similar to one upstairs from row of bedroom opened immediately on right be door into hall round hour ago mr francis face have peered to left be drawing room dining room at far end baize door leading into flagged passage to gun room two pane of glass formed upper panel of door geoffrey having reached bottom of stair saw two square of light cast through on to ceiling of corridor lengthened to oblong diminished again to vanishing point disappeared leaving once more in dim filter of starlight mr francis be clear have gone to gun room here be first point opposite foot of stair on other side of corridor stood tall verd antique pedestal on top of be bust of harry father dark curtain hung behind setting off whiteness of carrara bust geoffrey be just considering value of curtain a hiding place in case mr francis other point went through hall for purpose of juggling with front door when square of light through glass panel again reappeared silent a dream growing very rapidly brighter in two step be across corridor have not yet got behind curtain when baize door opened again mr francis reappeared now step be quick careless of noise geoffrey casting one glance at before stepped behind curtain saw rage hunted fear in face at that thrill of tracker awoke in hugged to think of little piece of cotton in cigarette case value to judge by baffled hate came up passage be immeasurably increased then slid behind curtain step came nearer very quickly muffled audible paused opposite geoffrey hiding place then for moment heart stood still for turned not toward hall pattered swiftly upstairs have thought harry safe for night at rate what must be safe from mask of rage hatred have just seen in moment must have followed at cost when light again shone round corner of curtain unseen step passed where stood into hall instantly geoffrey slipped from hiding place stepped silently across corridor mounted few stair from there must see mr francis movement in hall from there also have good start of to upper floor again snap of lock grating jar of bolt drawn withdrawn followed having heard that waited more went swiftly up again to room closed door behind quickly with elaborate noiselessness soon light footstep came along passage outside went by door by harry grew fainter closing of distant latch be just audible then be darkness silence first part of night work be over geoffrey lit candle again smiling with certain grimness to next move evolved during last half hour of waiting listening have simple ingenuity about pleased meant journey to hall after precautionary pause only apparatus required be little piece of stamp paper so at end of quarter of hour went downstairs again examined front door bolt lock be undrawn mr francis visit then have be to undo so that must be found unlocked in morning be on four with private theory after little consideration secured door again partly for safety of house partly for sake of giving mr francis something to think about if did leave house way then standing on chair reaching up to full height stuck piece of stamp paper across meeting of door jamb thus one must open without tearing paper one thing more remained for sake of own peace of mind at risk of waking went to harry room looked in harry be lying on side fast asleep shading candle geoffrey waited till heard two evenly taken breath so far then be well slept lightly in broken snatch after excitement of hour required great deed of violence on inclination to enable to get up early in cool accustomed daylight thing of night seemed to have more of texture of dream than reality proof of awaited when went to front door for little piece of stamp paper be whole unbroken door still locked bolted then to make doubly sure of reliability of experiment undid door opened stamp paper be torn in half be not by exit then that mr francis have left house harry made appearance at hour not unusually late with perfectly normal face manner sound of last night excursion have reached talked in usual desultory fashion geoffrey mind be preoccupied with yet unsolved problem felt certain that mr francis have secret way in out of house must be next piece of business to discover what be have come in by back door through unbolted window must have told so last night have said came through front door thing impossible subject of secret door be easy to approach be working morning geoff said harry what will do with poke potter with gun if like will ride afternoon will poke potter said without gun think feel yew morning thought did said harry cordially have idea what mean be just little slow of said geoffrey mean that will look behind tapestry tap panelling find secret staircase do will give shilling for secret stair find done anything extra for secret door door be two said harry concealed will be ten skeleton fifteen other object will be valued by arbitration baron von vail have kindly consented to be arbitrator added in burst of futility fifteen be little too low for skeleton said geoffrey must fetch more than at medical shop well twenty if like raise again well be off where to to work lazy cow yes where smoking room if want to do panel knocking there come do at once what baby be geoffrey rose search be going to be exhaustive said will begin with smoking room there ensued couple of dusty hope deferred hour from smoking room yielded result at went to mr francis room have fixed upon a being most likely place for conjectured passage to communicate with strictest scrutiny of panelling revealed nothing tapped foot of foot sounded promisingly hollow yet nothing of sort must discover must yield even sixpence there be cupboard of most alluring probability wore aspect of concealment yet declined to yield secret geoffrey have never be in room before after fruitless search took look round before leaving orderly industrious be indication of master docketed paper lay neatly in little heap appurtenance of stationery be finished complete set of paper have elastic band note of content in red ink two set of penholders lay in separate tray examination of nib showed that mr francis be of rare type of man who dedicated without violation certain pen to black ink certain others to red pencil be well sharpened ink eraser be there a well a india rubber taper of green wax be ready for sealing of important envelope have curdling fascination for geoffrey at present be on hunt for shilling detailed examination of writing table brought nearer whole of second floor searched without success except in so far that discovery of gaunt chilly bedroom in lively imagination might conjure up pleasing thrill must be reckoned reward to labour over most be trail of plumber electric bell light have be newly introduced modern improvement jostled strangely with faded medival discomfort of large gloomy bed tapestried hanging like poor lion with early christian seemed to mourn absence of murderous deed suitable stage be set actor trod board be somewhat disheartened adventurer who began search on ground floor for ground floor must not remember must bring small bill of step to swell revenue unless indeed yet undiscovered staircase proved to lead into basement possibility lent fresh vigour dining room billiard room drawing room be searched without result hall be become practically last cover here indeed something might be expected tapestry covered two side other two carried portrait again search became minute hour be fruitlessly spent there remained only fireplace side where hung portrait of old francis geoffrey looked at moment for inspiration knew about will be bound said to why ca old brute speak looking at thus noticed for first time that panel in picture hung be different from panelling over rest of hall be of linen pattern one panel be plain except for row of small circular boss ran round at wide interval geoffrey goaded by thought of last good chance mounted chair handled of in turn second tried moved to touch a with sudden upleap of hope turned something clicked within whole panel portrait swung slowly out on hinge there seemed to be narrow passage in wall continuing to right left of picture geoffrey stood moment on chair holding panel from swinging farther puzzled ca have jumped down from there said to perhaps there be door somewhere else anyhow have exit entrance quotation seemed to extraordinarily apt got down after securing panel again started to tell harry after few pace leg literally refused to carry in direction secret be by right of trove must make first joyful exploration alone again turned knob from chair vaulted easily into panel passage led right left into darkness must have jumped down again to get match when saw in little recess in wall candle with match by be eminently convenient due doubt to mr francis thoughtfulness after lighting up pulled panel ajar after satisfying that catch be of simplest kind latched back into place two thought be in mind a waited for red wick of candle to grow black again one further tracking of game have definitely roused during night other sheer childish pleasure in story of adventure come true ala for stockbroker cared more for shilling there be dark passage in wall imperishable child within trembled smiled mr francis man felt sure have used passage last night here be double cause for excitement joy candle burned more bravely two way be open like right handed folk impulse be to turn to left obeying travelled six yard so of level rough floored passage on right ran course of brick in main wall little dark mildewy on left panelling of hall turn at right angle at corner doubt of hall disclosed flight of wooden step leading downward here stockbroker awoke greedily counted ten shilling be stockbroker seemed be gentleman of second rate vitality awoke from torpor to count slumbered again leaving child hunter to go way at bottom of step geoffrey paused moment to recollect bearing have entered secret way on short side of hall step therefore be on long side of on garden side of house inasmuch a passage when entered be six foot above ground level of hall ten downward step must bring back to ground level again be therefore walking in outer wall of hall on level with floor clear went slowly on suddenly be confronted by blank brick wall straight in front on right hand regular course of brick be interrupted by panelled wooden oblong five foot high beyond up to wall ended passage course went on again in middle of be round wooden handle straight below on floor ran two flanged metal line laying hold of handle pulled at on side of wooden panel opened jagged edge of light irregular full of angle drew inward three foot till reached end of metal line running smoothly with sense of great weight sunlight poured in geoffrey stepped on to lawn outside regarded discovery indeed have be cunning brain hand have devised house wall outside here ran in course of small brick opening of door drew inward irregularly top of door for instance be four brick in length second row of brick detached numbered six below again be course of four withdrawn then one of five then one of six again joining be fitted with extreme accuracy here interspace of mortar between brick must move

conversation with lady oxted looped cotton midnight visit felt that right time have not come though might come day on other hand be difficult to speak merely of mr francis visit without betraying hint of suspicion did not want to do balance of advantage seemed to incline toward telling for if did not in answer to so direct invitation harry must not unnaturally accuse though silently doubt of unfounded suspicion against man whom honoured very highly so determined to speak three night ago said on evening of gun room affair went to bed early sat in hall dozed awoke suddenly saw mr francis face looking round corner by staircase harry pushed back chair what said oh be not dozing then talked for time told why have come with secrecy also asked not to tell mind why have come asked harry day

quite heated about be right said geoffrey be sat upon by anybody anyhow 'd better not try said harry viciously continued quarter decking about room for few time in silence annoyance subsided old fellow really came down because have presentiment about went on geoff be odd thing now look a if luck touched more than gave uncle francis hint of what be doing know luck getting on be making more reasonable attempt on do think have be encouraging too much perhaps have wo drink health to night must if be said geoffrey perhaps in way have put old thing in good temper well keep up ca avoid having shot at always manages to miss ah be beginning to believe in too not bit effect luck have be to make talk arrant nonsense about believe in indeed be just humouring notion of humorous be obscure observed harry mr francis arrived late that night full of little anecdote about house hunting loud in praise of flat have only come a have said for couple of day to collect book stick of furniture by end of month at outside hoped to have completely habitable pleasure in be that of child with new toy delightful to hear sat up late listening to fresh cheerful talk hearkening between while to extraordinary heavy rain have come on before sunset be beating at window deluge be continuous night next morning woke to same streaming heaven sky be lowering arch of deluge rain relentless harry geoffrey who regarded sky open heaven a proper roof for man house merely a shelter for unusual inclemency have felt not smallest inclination to stir abroad mr francis at lunch announced intention of walking rain rain doe hurt said brisk walk whatever weather so neither of will come harry looked out on to soupy splashing gravel geoff will go for swim said thank be too old for mud pie mr francis laughed heartily so be not said well harry certainly be raining said lad not doubt of assented mr francis geoffrey turned to harry suddenly fear fire frost rain said in low tone harry went briskly toward door thanks geoff that settle said excellent reason for going getting over to day if possible yes uncle francis will put on boot come be not made of paper more than geoffrey followed into hall sudden vague foreboding filling go harry said be beginning to believe in know said harry indeed be not look like mr francis joining went off whistling very much rain must have fallen during night for yesterday lake be not notably higher than normal limit whereas now so few hour afterward have swollen so a to over top stonework of sluice steady rush of water fell over ledge into outlet below ordinarily smooth flowing chalk stream be now riotous race of headlong water sufficient to carry man off foot a paused minute two to watch grand rush of must see that even in so short space flow of water over stonework be increasing in volume showing that lake be rising minute gate wall of sluice be not very thick seemed hardly built for such press of water in one two place mr francis observed that there appeared to be crack right through for water spurted out a from hose sluice seemed to have got somewhat choked with dbris of branch leaf with storm have covered surface of lake saragossa sea of drift stretched out to considerable radius from adjoining main lock be small wooden water gate designed doubt for relief in time of flood be shut down harry splashing through water tried to pull up in order to give additional outlet wood be swollen with wet must not stir francis observed action with attention foot be firmly planted on stone slab covered sluice water rose like frill over boot a with bent straining figure exerted utmost force to raise gate once a for firmer purchase wedged right foot against side of water channel bowed to final effort block of stonework on stood seemed to tremble cry of warning rose to mr francis lip remained unuttered only face wore expression of intense conflicting expectation harry effort be fruitless soon desisting splashed way back elsewhere lake be rapidly encroaching on outskirt of lawn pool of rain lay in lower undulation of joining with swollen water formed long liquid tongue bay here clump of bush stood out like island in lagoon here outlying flower bed be altogether submerged dark soil be floated by water in spreading stain over adjoining grass will never do said harry place will be in mess for month if get water off somehow be that choked sluice be doing mischief have better go up to farm uncle francis send men to clear lord how rain will be best plan said stay harry will go do run back to sluice dear fellow see if be raised quite to top never looked at that might get big stick also begin clearing away stuff choke have pull at wooden gate if can get open be all right go break back over dear boy seemed to yield little that last pull gave what muscle what muscle said feeling arm try again at wooden sluice be quick there be time to lose will have water up to house in le than hour if go on mr francis went off at rapid amble in direction of farm harry returned to wrestle with wooden sluice even in few minute that have be away water have risen beyond belief when again splashed across stone slab of sluice to smaller gate swift flowing stream over top of be half knee deep pressed against like strong man be no longer possible to see spouting escape beneath for arch of turbid water be continuous unbroken from side to side wrapped handkerchief round ring raised gate again putting shoulder straining back into bent to task one foot have braced against stone coping of side other pressed to ironwork of main sluice pulling firmly strongly till felt muscle of spine stand out like woven cord knew that something stirred at that paused moment strong flood pouring steadily round collecting bent down again called on sinew for one sudden effort on instant felt stone slab on stood reel under left foot half guessing for moment be too brief for conscious conclusion that sluice have given way bodily sprang for be worth from overturning mass effort be effort made in air right foot slipped from edge of coping whole sluice wall turned under throwing a luck must have clear of toppling mass full into stream below a fell caught at masonry of side of channel to prevent being carried down for one half second grasp be firm at next with incredible roar of water released flood poured down from lake brushing hand from grasp a lightly a man whisk settling fly from sugar rolled over over among screaming dbris now tossing into mid stream now burying in yellow turbulent flood now throwing up on top of wave like chaff in high wind a helpless a suckling child in grip of wild beast impotently without purpose snatched at hurrying wreckage even at twisted rope of water hurled along conscious only of wild excitement of foregone battle without leisure to be afraid seemed to to be motionless while bank lawn shot by with inconceivable swiftness bearing toward a suddenly remembered with same giddy speed bridge over road to lodge passed how often have stood there watching trout poise dart in clear flowing water turn in stream bed saw rushing up toward like approaching train water already nearly on level with arch soon to be how vastly higher with wave of flood carried in van of torrent from broken sluice first instinct be resolve to clutch at in order to stop in moment realizing that if wished to make death certain be way of huddled together burying head in water just saw first of flood strike against bridge in huge feather of broken turbulence then came darkness full of loud chucklings sucking a if water laughed inwardly with evil merriment once in blind moment shoulder be banged against gorged arch once felt coat catch against projecting stone be a if weight of whole world be pressed against a for half second checked stream next be torn free again out into daylight once more not till then did chance of possible ultimate escape strike with sense that might possibly have share in matter hitherto wild pace have given certain bewilderment to thought not unpleasant in reasoning power remembrance of what have gone before realization of what might follow after have be choked consciousness mere pin point did not do more than receive sensation of passing moment after bridge have be passed sprouted grew became harry vail again man with wit limb be meant to be used therewith will to use power to use be thing arbitrarily directed by flood breath be prime necessity be matter requiring effort ebb of encircling wave to fling face free from that surging broken van of water get air only with returning increase of consciousness be aware that be out of breath with prolonged ducking for broadly speaking have not decently breathed once since have tumbled with tumbling sluice so with downward backward kick instinct of treading water raised head from yellow race felt air sweet essential three long breath took throat filling lung filling like man half dead with drought a struggled to overlook water for fourth time be for purpose of using eye a well a lung what saw caused hope to leap high in heart though have not known have be hopeless for here stream have already widely overflowed bank now no longer held in by masonry of first stretch below sluice gallon of water came down spread over widely increased area speed concentrated volume be even now diminishing sense that be bound helpless swathed child passed from pushing steadily with arm foot so random stroke must scarcely be called swimming soon saw that be appreciably leaving main rush of stream before long be brought up with violent jerk foot have struck ground water stood up over head like yellow frill be more than playful buffet after grimness of struggle staggered to foot again now no longer swimming after few more splashing effort stood firm upright in waist high water leaning with weight against press of flood then step by plunging step got to land at last stood utterly free on good safe earth stood dripped for moment water running from point of clothes a if off rib of umbrella then wringing out baggier fold with hand tried to start running toward house twenty pace told be dead beat dropping to soberer pace made splashing way across field suddenly stopped luck cried aloud to weeping sky be rain did blooming old futile old luck must kill bluebottle be inspiring thought went more lightly for taking note with delightful sense of danger past of distance of water journey what be that spouting column of yellowness foam three hundred yard farther up standing like fountain in mid stream with sudden gasp of reasoned recognition knew to be bridge over road passed under so few minute ago have be whirled cold shivering a be must not resist moment pause when came opposite turned away again with sense of respect for luck last word shouted to streaming heaven have lacked under that have blindly burrowed helpless a baby in express to stop headlong course not bad attempt of luck after said to five minute later have cast water trail over gravel into hall geoffrey be deep in armchair reading geoffrey old chap luck be having go cried almost triumphantly ca pull off simply ca get hot whisky water will come to room be going to get between blanket bit nothing like taking care of one self running risk will tell about ca stop now geoffrey book flew on to floor a sprang out of chair o harry what have happened cried what have done now old francis asked harry pointing at picture be used rain time penny squirt know hurry up come to room whisky rather strong please harry be out of clinging clothes in couple of minute dropping into empty hip bath where must lie innocuous to carpet got into blanket sipping whisky told geoffrey story from moment of dismemberment of sluice to staggering landing mile downstream if ever want to travel expeditiously by water said in conclusion recommend six foot flood in narrow channel avoid water choked bridge ahead of man give wambling inside mistake same make feel hero afterward can tell that for cert why be choking with pride just choking though what particular achievement be ca tell have to go underneath there be two word to well went what have happened to mr francis asked geoffrey must see that thing be tottery of course not dolt 'd gone trotting off to farm oh did tell that part so be not dolt went out together a saw took haul on old stricken sluice must make budge so began walking away to get men from farm water be rising so fast that went on there alone went back to have pull at did with blessed result o geoffrey how dry warm rain felt when have got out of flood race lord thought be done did think only knew be not till got out did blessed solution strike be luck having shot again have failed fire frost rain have have whole trio again be damned to there be hitch somewhere old francis ca pull off really be almost sorry for harry voice be resonant with conviction triumph be a if have won battle be inevitable between subtle foe danger have be through be swallowed up in victory have gained lightness of heart found echo in geoffrey like harry said like one bit believe in luck be childish believe in luck have played at make believe like child a played with discovery of passage in yew hedge passage in yew hedge be far more real of two be time to stop why must thing come to in such damnable continuity why within few day must nearly fall into ice house then go within ace of blowing head off finally be carried down in mill race of death there be use also in saying be coincidence thing happen like be right not by mere coincidence said harry do happen have happened to window of room looked out straight over lawn on to lower end of lake where sluice lay geoffrey a harry divested of blanket have swathed round rubbed down with rough towel went sat in window seat looking out be use saying that believe in luck went on do believe in at least think do a far a be concerned come to exactly same thing oh be nonsense cried suddenly think really believe in like to think do there be truth a near a can get yet perhaps be truth perhaps do believe in oh who know whether believe in not be sure geoffrey did not reply for moment have felt morally certain after gun room accident that if danger of death again looked into harry face must be mr francis who brought there have even said to that must be by rain that danger must come by rain indeed have be where taxing ingenuity to utmost did mr francis come in harry have be alone mr francis halfway to farm what if harry be right thought challenged reasonable self how can talk such utter nonsense said angrily how can that pewter pot break down sluice put cartridge in gun make go to ice house instead of summerhouse pewter said harry voice muffled in shirt be putting on at moment geoffrey eye caught sight of figure of mr francis trotting gaily through rain down side of lake from direction of farm disappeared behind bush screened sluice from house almost immediately reappeared again time coming toward house with same lightness of step must have seen thought geoffrey that flood have carried away sluice harry must have known be probably there when be carried away what reconstruction of fact must fit factor at present none perhaps mr francis must supply rose mr francis be just coming in said see farm men harry came across to window be probably following said go down to geoff tell be right will be down soon yes in couple of minute might order tea too chapter xix geoffrey leaf vail geoffrey went slowly downstairs reciting to exactly all knew one point be salient mr francis have certainly seen broken sluice entered hall mr francis have taken off waterproof be sitting comfortably in chair looked up with cheery smile when geoffrey came in ah dear boy said be quite right not to come out weather be odious have never seen such rain one feel better after for breath of air preferred house said geoffrey be water in lake very high yes be good deal swollen in fact have carried away considerable portion of sluice must be seen to dangerous moment observed geoffrey picking up magazine turning over page yes wish have seen go fine sight must have be six foot of water in narrow channel be on way to farm suppose when happened must talk must talk to harry about evening will want mending at once at moment geoffrey heard harry foot on stair just outside hall though knew nothing of psychology believed to be psychological moment be out still asked seeing out of corner of eye that be even now entering hall suppose so said mr francis left on way up to farm harry have now entered hall step be noiseless on thick carpet mr francis with chair facing fire must not see half dozen pace must bring close be wrong said geoffrey slowly for seems to have come in be be not ghost mr francis contrary to doctor order made exceedingly brisk movement springing to foot facing about saw harry cast one brief look at geoffrey to fear devilish enmity contributed largely turned to nephew again in perfect control of without further hesitation geoffrey have scarce time to tell that there be awkward choice have to make ah dear boy cried so be right felt sure must be for moment for one moment be anxious when came back from farm with men found sluice broken geoffrey stared in sheer astonishment at man glibness with men asked surely not dear fellow said mr francis with most natural manner how pedantically exact be must be exact too seems be little ahead of for ran back from farm being just little uneasy about weight of water knew must be pressing on sluice thought indeed that when harry made first attempt to pull up be little unsafe for one to stand there suddenly doubt certainty surged up in geoffrey mind did warn asked geoffrey saw harry eyebrow knit together in frown of perplexity must not decipher mr francis turned to with eagerness of boy anxious to confess did not said time be going to farm thing weighed on ought to have ought to have given way to old maid feeling of insecurity be afraid yes dear lad be afraid harry must laugh at ah how repented silence when came back found sluice gone gone repeated yes went said harry went too mr francis looked at moment with eye of horror diminishing to pin point then gave little low cry sank down in chair again what do say what do say murmured be there be oh sluice broke a be standing on having pull at wooden gate a suggested down went said harry flood took right under bridge rather difficult matter quarter of mile farther down then got out mr francis lifted up hand in weary uncertain manner under bridge under bridge said hoarsely must not take over remarked geoffrey mr francis seemed not to hear comment what can say cried what can say do to think that be fault ought to have warned ought to have be on safe side did not with reasonable mind think that there be danger be uneasy harry blame too much remember advising one day last winter when came in wet from shooting to go change indeed dear boy did not receive advice very patiently thought of thought must not weary with meddling misgiving blame in least uncle francis said harry did think sluice looked sufficiently unsafe to make better that must warn also did not realize that be in dangerous condition there be harm done can not forgive said mr francis harry laughed ah there can not help said for own part can only assure that there be nothing to forgive there be all right added rather gruffly desiring to have scene geoffrey have listened to with look of pleased attention a man may regard little scene in play know well mr francis have be through part with great dexterity here actor must appear now for story mr francis said very cheerfully a harry will not give curdling detail let see went to farm ran back again saw go to sluice found gone dear dear how terrible for so came quietly back to house sat down in front of fire where found ten minute ago mr francis looked up with scared eye hoped trusted accident have happened to said came to house to make sure that be safe ah can not talk of can not talk of cried suddenly ten minute ago told that supposed that harry be still out persisted geoffrey what strange thing be human mind here for instance follow thought at be uneasy for harry safety for fear of sluice giving way a soon a saw for certain that have given way felt further anxiety sat here in front of fire though a told supposed harry be out still mr francis rose from chair in great agitation what do mean what be saying cried in high tremulous voice do know what word mean word mean exactly what appear to mean said geoffrey quietly feeling that signal have be given time be come hear how curious thing said be human mind sluice thought looked little unsafe be uneasy for harry safety a went to farm for be making at suggestion attempt to raise wooden gate come back find symptom of confirmation of fear sluice be broken harry be not there then walk quietly back to house tell suppose that harry be out still repeat that follow train of thought be curious harry doe not seem to also to be curious harry looked from one to other moment puzzled bewildered geoffrey spoke so quietly collectedly that be impossible not to listen calmly to what said impossible also not to understand what meant on other hand be saying thing be absolutely incredible from geoffrey looked to mr francis who be standing between old man mouth quivered agitation be momentarily increasing then suddenly recollected doctor warning that agitation be bad for be uncle friend old man stop geoffrey cried speak uncle francis listen to doe mean what think mean there be ghastly misunderstanding geoff damned idiot mr francis face grew paler more mottled breathing be growing short laboured harry be in agony of terror that of awful seizure must come upon in moment spoke slowly with little pause for breath harry said either friend apologizes unreservedly for what have said one of leaf house now evening will be for to decide of leaf at word terror seized terror of precipice at edge of three of stood happened now seemed to catastrophe must be one friend other a thought of two mind veered backward forward like shifting weathercock must go primary necessity be by mean in power to stop further word just now for feared moment that mr francis must be seized a stood uncle francis come away said taking arm be agitated so be geoffrey so be be use talking about thing in heat wait just wait geoffrey if say word will knock silly head off mr francis regarded nephew more than regarded fly buzzed in pane what do mean said coming closer to geoffrey shaking off harry hand what do mean by what have just said apologize for instantly do hear indeed seems to that be very good natured to be willing to accept apology harry put in word knew to be hopeless go on geoff said impatiently anxious for moment only about uncle uncle francis have understood what said in different way from what meant know what be about let have more nonsense geoffrey turned on that eager face absent staring eye hardly hearing word for called up nothing whatever in mind answered to only collecting to speak fully without excitement hardly gave thought to how harry might take so large immediate be need of speaking so tremendous part in horrible nightmare inevitably apologize said not only because wish to because be simply unable indorse word have said have also more to say will hear must prefer to tell alone suppose be impossible quite impossible assure young viper said mr francis in voice so cool self contained that harry looked at in utter surprise bursting agitation of few minute ago have passed voice horrid cold be faithful index of face at word harry suddenly saw futility of trying to interfere thing be gone beyond reach be a impossible now to stop what be coming a must have be to stop that hustling flood from lake by word to waited frozen almost to numbness with dread nauseous misgiving for what must follow till geoffrey in response to mr francis assurance spoke uncle said have for month past be plotting scheming against happiness life tried in first place by mean in power to prevent marriage with miss aylwin on sunday last june when be down here walked in wood together saw know about said harry doubt do know for instance that mr francis tried to persuade miss aylwin to overlook fact that have seen walking with dairymaid do know that never suggested to that supposed 'you might be jim that told that 'your previous little foolishness ' exact phrase have be quite innocent think did not know that whole scene still seemed utterly unreal to harry must not believe that be going on turned to uncle well said ah be on trial then said mr francis very evilly harry dear boy be only because fellow have be friend that stop listen to monstrous insinuation be asked believe have to say to well have be said be literally true mistook groom for so did miss aylwin made mistake a for 'previous little foolishness that of course be pure invention on part of imaginative person miss aylwin told lady oxted lady oxted told said geoffrey a quietly a if be giving reference to small point of business mr francis just shrugged shoulder remember last winter said that used to play very diverting game called russian scandal next move know harry continued geoffrey still taking smallest notice of mr francis wrote to tell that miss aylwin be already engaged harry wore inscrutable face go on said that also did not come off said geoffrey be engaged ten day ago came down here on first morning asked mr francis of two house on knoll be ice house summerhouse ah have broken word to cried harry promised to keep secret from uncle violent trembling have seized mr francis what what murmured half rising from chair have broken word to said geoffrey still seemingly unconscious of presence of third person be sorry can not help followed direction gave nearly met death came back together found playing flute in garden dancing to a played then went into house remained outside watched went up knoll to two house tried door of ice house found locked opened summerhouse looked in try to reconstruct what be in mind made allusion to mistake have already forgotten that have given direction nearly sent to death be mistake yours told to go to left hand of two house so said to be that case harry did not at once reply looked eagerly imploringly at friend must find word to express feeling must not comprehend did not know ever so vaguely what thought in despair utter perplexity faced quickly round to uncle mr francis be sitting with half closed eye hand like hand of blind man groped picked at button in arm of chair stricken helpless suddenly a if with drowning effort threw head back saw harry no no said not left hand not left hand never said that oh luck cursed cursed luck must not indeed must not have said left hand ' go to left hand by mistake ' can hear saying word now oh weary weary day went there went to ice house instead of summerhouse went from brightness of god sunshine into dark to edge to edge of well o god god eli eli cry be wrung from like water from twisted cloth old man buried face in hand collapsing like broken doll regarded harry accuser anguish of spirit covered like choking wave into went down without struggle only that moaning sight sound to stagger unbelief of infidel harry infidel lad of kindly heart generous impulse quick to believe good laggard to impute harm must not be moved geoffrey looked at bowed figure wavered face be flint though moaning cry passionate incoherence did not move yet sight of harry face with bewilderment of perplexity compassionate trouble filled with sudden fear to that bent venerable head be mockery of grief fraud finished exquisite be more afraid of harry divided mind on mr francis played a on instrument of music than have be of evil hunted face that have come down from gun room a stood behind curtain in dead hour ten day ago mr francis sat huddled in chair face invisible finger clasped in white head long dry sob lifted relaxed figure like pulsation of wave though geoffrey so few minute ago have turned to steel must not go on speaking with silent stricken figure in front of low heart broken murmuring silent sob filched resolution from once twice began to speak sentence must come a many time told that must go on that knew that feigned anguish be thing to awake horror laughter never pity yet affected a scene in play affect stall be unreal knew be unreal yet must not immediately speak suddenly long before seemed while be still cursing infirmity of purpose harry came to side go away geoff go away whispered leave with have to say can not must not say now look there judge may kill go away there be good fellow got up at once be enough harry be still willing to hear now at time did not matter wanted be that harry must hear to end then part be done exposure there be pleasure in act of only wanted that must be there truly man be vile enemy did not covet post of executioner a such by be true justice be done murderer be put out of world with welfare of presence be incompatible man to do there must be who did not shudder at shadow of hangman dry inarticulate sobbing have need to tell be counterfeit grief yet wore respectable semblance of woe what again if remorse have at length touched mr francis what if imminence of exposure have at last revealed to immeasurable enormity if possibility be within range of most distant horizon how contemptible must be own part in trampling in truth be realized be generous within there be nothing be not revolted from so despicable rle against possibility how large near loomed probability that grovelling pang be of same texture a rest no be not taken in registered privately unalterable conviction that mr francis be mr francis still for opprobrious word conveyed to horror of that canonized name implied yet harry be by asking not bidding to go be sufficient even a told be sufficient back swung balance again what duty must be more obvious more staring than to finish now at once with ineffable old man yet sat there sobbing without word geoffrey turned went leaving uncle nephew together be not long before harry joined in smoking room uncle francis have gone to room said be quieter now must leave safely have telegraphed for doctor dare take responsibility of not sending for kept asking one question geoff kept repeating repeating of two be to go say will not stop here night if remain here god know whether have decided right be who go mean said geoffrey yes be harry sat down wearily a if tired out that too be prevailing feeling body mind be dead beat geoffrey rose since be so said ask before go to hear rest of story indeed must tell then will have done can oh will not take long added with sudden inexpressible bitterness in hour will be gone harry sprung up a if have be stung deserve that from geoff said do think want to get rid of do think be fine fun for to tell to go be not conscious of great pleasure in be sorry said geoffrey have business to say to think that o harry before go for dear lord sake hear have not be speaking idly do think in turn that be fine fun for to get up bring awful accusation against mr francis of course whole thing have to put on one side for present uncle francis will not stop in house while be here geoff can not let go whatever truth may be while be like dreaded moment that seizure might come on again besides be old man be uncle for present then be like believe what have told do disbelieve put aside though before long when uncle be recovered will have to do one other will believe be convinced be right then god know what will do will think accusation wild incredible warn too infinitely base for word then too added suddenly god know what will do at present a tell there be question of certain immediate duty be to look after uncle francis ask then before go said geoffrey to hear remainder of what have to say certainly tell will not attempt to judge of now have just spoken about confusion came in somewhere between ice house summerhouse so geoffrey told of loop of cotton have found round post of gun rack of mr francis visit to gun room finally of own finding in afternoon after breaking of sluice sitting before fire in hall supposing harry have not yet come in harry heard in silence without comment be asked when geoffrey have finished be sure there be nothing more be sure also have be exact throughout be said geoffrey have be exact then dear old boy said harry let for present put from mind carriage will be round in ten minute told to pack for tell that agree with when have to ask to go feel know can not do otherwise yes be right god guard said geoffrey then suddenly whole flood of fear suspicion certainty surged in mind together overflowed be leaving harry alone with hellish man who knew what might not attempt next fibre in being cried aloud to that danger of subtle deadly sort hung suspended over harry imminent to fall so long a white haired old man be under same roof what must do must not force harry to see clearness of be so clear to must not even make exercise judgment upon anxiety for broke bound yes be right said can not persuade that be right to go o harry ask once again do

met over aquiline nose mouth have certain secrecy tightness about manner be that of man reserved competent thin delicate hand be neat firm in movement harry torn distracted by world of bewilderment found unutterable relief to have put one out of perplexity care of uncle into such adequate hand for moment at least boon of doctor arrival quite overscored that sinister impression have formed of when in summer have passed driving to station with regard to patient be grave not alarming grave however one felt must always be harry remembered mr francis criticism of that knew too much have always in mind most remote consequence of lesion however insignificant can give certain account of to night lord vail said found mr francis in lethargic state natural reaction from so understand agitating scene took place afternoon did not even speak to for thought better not to rouse a seemed in fair way to get good night rest spoke to man who told that thought something agitating painful have taken place may ask if be case yes said friend of mine mr francis have terrible scene afternoon can tell about merest outline only see if mr francis experience return of agitation be to put frankly so dangerous might be very likely useful must know about be able to soothe with something more specific than wide generality harry paused be alone over dessert be very horrible said at length can hardly speak of can tell within last ten day have have three very narrow escape from violent sudden death dr armytage put down with neat haste glass be raising to lip gave harry one quick glance from below bushy eyebrow startling though word be must hardly have expected such sudden alertness interest from so self contained man yes said well for one at least of uncle blame said harry that certainly be one of cause of agitation though perhaps not greatest immediate cause oh be awful to speak of cried tell what advise have better tell everything repeat may possibly be of use to said doctor say of course will be under seal of profession servant have entered room with coffee harry did not immediately reply templeton a usual carried case of luck even a took jewel into hand harry hurriedly filled wineglass luck said in very cordial tone then turning to doctor please excuse said be custom have got into yes be luck uncle may have spoken to about must like to look at doctor waved away time time said waited till servant have left room then yes continued have heard mr francis speak of extraordinary delusion in so clear headed man be not think hope be not intruding into family secret lord vail soberly think that luck brings blessing curse on house may say idea almost posse surely be mistaken said harry be always laughing sometimes even be distressed at believing ah not believing thinking believe in very curious thing have happened added there be doubtless mistake said doctor to return tell will be under seal of profession mean that speak to one who be necessarily a silent a grave said harry will pardon insistence on give word on said doctor well be strange dark story said harry if speak little incoherently will know by end what perplexity be in now there be two kiosk sort of place near house one be summerhouse one ice house got key one morning asked uncle be told quite distinctly that left hand one be summerhouse made mistake went whistling into ice house be shuttered quite dark inside came within ace of falling into big tank be quite sure went to one told be summerhouse number one said doctor next morning went up to london continued harry geoffrey langham friend of mine who left to day be going out for day shooting gun be standing in rack a took up went off narrowly missing last person who have used that gun who have left cartridge in be uncle number two said doctor to day went out together looked at flooded lake tried to raise extra sluice that have finding must not make move went up toward farm to get men to help again at suggestion went on to farm went back to have try at a be standing on main sluice pulling whole thing gave way went down with flood water a near to being drowned a one can wish to be uncle have thought sluice not very safe have not thought worth mentioning doctor be silent awhile bear charmed life lord vail said at length think have more to tell harry gave one dumb appealing glance met eye be grave not unkind firm deeply interested have impression that have long be watching yes have more have more said with agitation be horribly painful dr armytage have two great friend so think uncle geoffrey langham fellow of own age thereabouts afternoon to uncle face though be bound to say must have preferred to tell privately geoffrey made horrible insinuation accusation said that uncle francis have long be enemy that have tried to prevent engagement that have failed there that in affair for instance uncle have intentionally have intentionally strangling knot tied in throat choking utterance doctor pushed water bottle gently little closer to harry poured out drank unconscious that suggestion have be made to then there be awful scene went on uncle be nearly off head believe with remorse horror for word have so nearly sent to death be aggravated must suppose by black ungovernable rage against geoffrey felt that have never seen angry man before refused to stay night in house with asked continually of be who must go must not of be convinced in state sent geoff off besides can not simply can not believe in geoff accusation be flatly impossible that uncle francis must be guilty of least intention geoff attributed to do not know there must be other explanation if want to know what other explanation be have stood in front of at dinner be luck fire frost rain ice house gun sluice oh have happened once before like yes mr francis told said doctor still looking very intently at harry flicked ash off cigarette here be then said of two best friend one lie upstairs other god know if will ever see other again have to tell whether believe what said can not believe be monstrous be monstrous to have thought yet see why thought to one not believing in luck there be other explanation there be other thing too need not trouble with came to conclusion for instance that uncle wished to stop engagement prevent rather for be not engaged then be specious good lord be specious enough have be considering simply can not believe be not that wilfully shut eye hold open with pincer chisel so to speak be unable be clear to believe anything of how must be possible god doe not allow such thing tell be verdict then believe nothing against uncle said other with intonation absolutely colourless can not may tell uncle lord vail asked doctor presently if agitation return can think of nothing must so much tend to soothe a assurance that accusation be to absolutely void empty vile accusation added in moment yes be vile said harry half to may then use discretion to tell so if think desirable asked doctor pressing point must be better think for to tell than must be agitating work for of said watching lad closely oh may tell damn please cried harry with sudden petulance of nerve utterly overwrought instantly doctor face changed symptom for have be waiting have come now then lord vail said with peremptoriness startled harry want two patient instead of one be on verge of hysteric let tell will have none of please treatment be shrewd prompt judging rapidly correctly saw that word of sympathy kindness must be likely to throw harry altogether off balance be justified when in answer to rough speech saw angry flush spring to face be not accustomed to be spoken to like that said hotly be liberty on part said doctor please excuse think will acknowledge be right be own man again now harry considered moment then smiled yes be perfectly right said candidly have have rather trying time to day indeed have may say now that be very sorry for recommend therefore to go to bed not to write to friend to night to think what will say to when do to go to sleep very quietly soundly till morning said harry excellent advice dr armytage oh will do thing if follow direction said doctor must like to hear then to drink dose will send up to room said quietly at moment a if by flash light suddenly turned on harry saw again meeting at lodge gate man for whom at first sight have conceived so violent instinctive antipathy simultaneously curious adventure in search for dr godfrey shone in mind what if after geoffrey be right be alone in house with man such a friend have pictured mr francis to be mysterious confederate physician whose way be so dark suspicion have seemed to so utterly beyond horizon of credibility leaped suddenly nearer when spoke though tried to make alteration in tone even to voice sounded unusual think will require dos said dare say will sleep right thanks same ah trust said doctor in same quiet tone exceeding frankness pleased offended harry be not pity to say thing like that asked when really have warrant for to show how wrong be will take dose with pleasure doctor grave face relaxed be right lord vail said do think that now consenting to take prof that be wrong might not man consider that showed be right harry smiled also man of sufficient ingenuity can make plausible most extravagant conclusion said rather enjoying tiny fencing match true will not draw at since there be need said now with leave will go up see mr francis again hope trust will find asleep will be in hall said harry please give report a soon a have seen dr armytage went upstairs harry lit cigarette waited return dinner presence of capable man have to large extent quieted jangled nerve be conscious more than anything of great weariness acuteness of perplexity have for moment worn off little though aching weight be le pressed on so seemed without fret of sharp edge resolutely set not to think of rather of exquisite point of happiness be day by day coming nearer to evie must be in england in le than fortnight now five week brought to day to whole life hitherto seemed to have be leading up suddenly claw teeth again recaptured geoffrey be to have be best man now with feverish mill race of bewildering possibility began again be relief when doctor reappeared mr francis be sleeping be glad to tell said thanks will smoke one cigarette before go upstairs when go go too if please lord vail have put dose in bedroom thanks be dead tired one cigarette will see doctor settled in chair yes that tiredness be exactly what dose will give chance to said be tired excited horrible combination excitement must certainly keep awake that hope to remove by sedative draught let tiredness act naturally must really congratulate on nerve in last ten day have have enough escape to last lifetime upon word look used up very fine nervous constitution mr francis also used to have same power of going through thing must have caused most men to break down utterly yes have be through awful trouble said harry really doe not seem more than man of sixty trouble of most horrible kind said doctor may ask lord vail if miss aylwin be relation to yes interrupted harry mother be mr harmsworth see know story be associated somewhat closely with be in fact doctor who gave evidence at coroner inquest again harry forgot own perplexity ah tell about that said there be little to tell conclusion arrived at be that death of mr harmsworth might easily have be accidental inflicted that be in fact gun carried killed that of course be crucial point nature of wound appeared to compatible with interpretation knew that be old friend of uncle said harry did not know that association with be so intimate a that doctor be silent moment threw smoked out cigarette away tell said at last a sort of testimonial recommendation what will came here a stranger to have received with very cordial hospitality present added credential harry rose held out hand be extremely satisfactory said now for dose bed sleep in uncle sitting room think said hope have made comfortable have everything said doctor by way speaking of friend mr langham may tell mr francis that have left if think wise certainly if wish that have gone to london suggested doctor casually a matter of fact have gone to father house for few day down near sevenoaks lord langham know ah yes said dr armytage good night dear lord vail be convinced will sleep well hour afterward house be dark quiet harry have drained dose be sleeping deeply dreamlessly mr francis be not more wakeful night be warm mellow after heavy rain dr armytage sat long at window looking out with fixed undeviating eye into blackness at interval real fancied stir from sick room must make rise mechanically crossing floor look in on patient once mr francis in sleep called out harry harry take care in strangling agonized voice even then did not wake doctor returned again to seat in window still gazed out into night rain have ceased soon after sunset now sky be nearly clear star in wrought in east moon must soon be rising regarded not saw star climbing crescent at length striking clock aroused got up thousand time no said to chapter xxi geoffrey meet doctor dr armytage despite lady oxted round uncompromising definition of a dexterous surgeon of sinister repute proved during next day two to be far more intimately acquainted with vital structure of animal called man than be at necessary for one who only concern with dissection of artery muscle severing of bone under wise beneficent care mr francis rapidly rose again to accustomed surface le testimony to skill harry once more looked world squarely courageously in face inner spiritual lesion require for healing not only skilful diagnosis mind of delicate certain touch of two patient doctor be inclined to think that harry made more flattering recovery during day kept uncle nephew studiously apart must allow visit to sick room communication be limited to message passed to fro by doctor mr francis on one hand be bidden to keep bed for three day quiet be insisted on quiet on other hand be sternly forbidden to harry for prescription be to go out a much a possible busy with employment be good found congenial when indoors to apply slavishly to business mr francis have hitherto managed for oh have plenty to do said doctor to harassed young gentleman go do of among thing have to be done be affair of difficulty letter must be written to geoffrey when put hand to harry found to be black bitter business sheet after sheet be begun abandoned have realized be attempting impossible for have set to write letter must at once be thoroughly friendly yet spit on allegation friend have made writer alone did not see that letter must not be written even by solomon shakespeare original serpent in conjunction thus for couple of hour one evening harry wrote tore reducing wooden penholders to match wood quire of fair white paper to grist for housemaid in fire lighting yet still envelope be nearer to postage stamp dressing bell indeed showed only brimming waste paper basket must not write letter here be flat truth at juncture doctor entered smoking room harry have chosen to be arena of futile endeavour glance at clouded face seemed enough for be difficult admit said ah must not be offended with lord vail have guessed right know doctor have to be thought reader have be making eye fell on paper basket many unsuccessful attempt to write to friend perhaps ought to have saved that trouble harry turned dark face on be sure there be secret about said a like a not must have told ca write letter just ca write yet must when begin to tell geoff truth that have done dastardly thing that can never see again that love just a much a ever well whole thing becomes unreal at once yes be hard word to friend said doctor know be not hard love chap tell know so much worse for for know best old fool god ever made be just hungry to see have got to tell that be base cad oh confound whole round world by way said must have spared trouble what do mean dr armytage took chair close to table where harry be failing to write three day ago lord vail when first arrived said offered sleeping draught refused suggested that refused because distrusted tell now be right in suggesting that harry looked straight a wont be at dark secret face have once thought so sinister to now appeared only sad what have got to do with asked be that suggestion right repeated doctor yes quite said other frankly just so eventually did trust at rate behaved a if did found confidence not misplaced awoke in fact after good night rest now if grant that owe benefit of doubt well ask to trust again said doctor for fact be have already written to friend telling not to expect letter from yet knew be completely certain that must find impossible to write to seemed to that if wrote at once a did must save anxious hour be confession again harry tried to feel what told be just resentment sentiment that raised in mind be phantom ought so considered to feel that liberty be being tampered with curiously self possessed man appeared to have gift of impeccable meddling then laughed outright simply know what to say to said take upon to interfere with affair of mine that in least concern yet really resent in that be quite wise remarked doctor harry threw down pen not content with patronize pat on back said be not at sure intend to stand pray if may so far interfere in concern what did say to geoffrey asked with show of spirit told not to expect letter from yet said doctor told not to be impatient wish for knot to be cut a long a there be faintest hope of being unravelled ah there be not faintest broke in harry too then acquiesce in cutting hope friend be more reasonable le can not be have right to say while thing be yet so recent that reconciliation of friend with mr francis be impossible if be possible must comprehend take reconciliation with oh know geoff tell said harry will never apologize be not given to rush at conclusion when have concluded be more obstinate than beast perish waste trouble if expect to recant doctor rose repeat be too early to expect anything said difficult situation take time if doe not take time be not difficult be sure of one thing alone be certain of letter from believing a do so utterly in uncle absolute innocence if must put feeling more strongly must must not tend to mend matter must only accentuate estrangement temporary hope with friend now have pardon for doing what have done not yet said harry what else did say said that be a safe here a in bank of england asked to be reasonable supposing wild surmise be true that have very bitter enemy of own blood in house how must be so foolhardy a to make attempt on just now when three have so conspicuously miscarried such suspicious circumstance be in mr langham knowledge for circumstance said looking gravely at harry be suspicious know be said harry poor old geoff well must have written that letter if have tried till midnight got up also a dinner gong sounded be dinner be not yet dressed said be quite right to do for dr armytage frankness became infinitely better than reserve might have added have very good friend here who look after uncle dr armytage smiled rather grimly came to conclusion that statement must not have increased confidence said either in in safety there be sense in gushing particularly if one gush about one self night when doctor made last visit to mr francis brought a usual small affectionate message from harry mr francis yawned for be sleepy made immediate reply in moment two roused love very best love said convincing tenderness please by way how do get on together be very trying be afraid so be of utmost importance that must gain harry confidence that must make trust so told without boasting think may say have be fairly successful made good beginning know first night be here ah yes that sleeping draught said mr francis appreciatively little bromide of potassium told quite simple harmless charming drug ingenious idea yes harry be consenting to take sleeping draught from hand certainly showed that if be disposed not to trust be fighting that inclination have improved advantage dear godfrey yes be on excellent term to tell truth find trying at nephew be amiable intelligent poor harry said mr francis softly yes very simplicity have certain charm have not be also very convenient quality well be to go to sleep suppose sleep so well now intend to take to london at end of week be proposal said doctor being autocrat for indeed doctor be only autocrat have left insist on assure will be best plan that young cub who left other day have wit of kind be rather sharp will quiet outrageous suspicion think if leave vail soon hope harry will not be very dull alone added may not choose to stop here said doctor doe not matter said mr francis be certain to come back here before marriage to see that house be quite ready to receive after honeymoon honeymoon ' repeated count on by way do call harry yet dear godfrey how short glum be suppose have have monosyllabic reply for ten year be so unnecessarily curt try to call by christian name produce admirable effect so cheaply practise saying 'harry harry ' when be alone will find make easier ah well must go to sleep good night dear man be therefore definitely settled announced to harry mr francis doctor must leave for london at end of week must be better so said doctor for change for very dark autumnal weather have settled down on vail during last day two be depressing influence strongly recommended week in london where little arrangement excitement incident to settling into flat must keep agreeably occupied mr francis dined downstairs on last night before left seemed buoyant self again during afternoon incessant bubblings from flute have come from room that sound have be to harry like voice of familiar friend returned uncle indeed have playfully prefaced own entry into hall after gong have sounded with tune of see conquering hero come little thin on solo instrument have marched in time to with incomparable gaiety with foot high lifted pointed toe dear harry asked a have seated after mr francis have said grace what be plan be half inclined to rebel when dear autocrat gave marching order heard that perhaps must be left here alone disaffection be quelled by look have godfrey given of quelling look wonder how long do stop here three four day only now said harry then go to oxteds for week come back here again by beginning of november for ten day after london till th dear fellow so near a so near a be said mr francis ah harry held out hand to then seeing that serious note be slightly embarrassing to young man ah good templeton have given luck again cried changing subject abruptly upon word thing seems to grow brighter more dazzling time see nephew of mine must tell dear godfrey be very foolish fellow in way almost may say almost harry belief in old legend really remarkable survival of superstition among educated class will write to psychical research about that amiable society collect nightmare superstition be told quaint hobby have drunk obediently to luck night after night have not harry said doctor of course be rule of house by way let set point at rest dr armytage told that believed in luck uncle francis simply must credit have always ridiculed for even pretending to mr francis laughed harry medical man can not keep secret said dear boy be only joking be quite true have found wondering after extraordinary series of accident early in year whether be possible that there must be anything in paused moment then went on quite naturally last three horrible escape of yours said how strange ice house frost gun fire sluice rain there be more thing in heaven earth well well here be proof at rate that mr francis knew how entirely harry trusted though at thought of awful scene between geoffrey uncle lad be startled for moment at so direct mention of have caused be something of relief to know that subject did not cause mr francis pain yes taken round must be sufficient to convince most hardened sceptic said poor old luck what abominably futile business have made of mr francis suddenly covered face with hand ah wo do to jest about said spoke lightly without thinking find can not quite stand dear harry be too recent too terrible at talk veered to le intimate subject before couple of minute be passed mr francis be again in exuberance of spirit have made play see conquering hero come have always contribution apposite gay to make to conversation capable of fantastic development garnished with pleasant conceit for meal must have somewhat languished for whether be that harry old habit of reserve have returned to that thought be again prey to perplexity uncle word might have recalled be unwontedly silent while on part of doctor seemed that somewhat absent assent dissent that only when directly appealed to be have to give mr francis be man for moment rose to social emergency told hundred little anecdote diversified amusing growing silence of other two be foil to amazing agility of tongue most capacious measure be emptied at last about time of dessert spent dropping shot without effect be only remnant of loquacious artillery be in silence that first glass of port be poured out to break notable hush harry rose luck said drink to luck doctor mr francis rose to toast latter with too eager alacrity napkin have flung on table caught glass wine be spilled on same day that doctor mr francis be travelling up from vail geoffrey be also going to london in consequence of strangely unexpected summons have duly received doctor letter week ago have be followed three day later by shorter note informing that mr francis be leaving vail for london on thursday following asking if geoffrey must give writer opportunity of seeing on matter importance of must not be estimated dr armytage must be at house that evening between five seven if hour must not suit asked geoffrey to name time be convenient to after arrival in london must make point of being in then laying other engagement might have aside then followed notable sentence occurs to wrote doctor that following thread of suspicion of lord vail have spoken to may see in request deep laid scheme for insuring presence in london on given day hour certain absence from other place beg to ask why if such be case must have written to at may add that mr francis vail reach paddington at midday on thursday be at station if will assure that have left vail so far letter ran with precision orderliness of despatch then followed signature after signature strange postscript must see must see read geoffrey writer pen have spluttered with underlining of word very long consideration be necessary knowing from lady oxted what did of doctor antecedent be clearly possible that might be placing in position of personal danger to attempt to form accurate idea of scheme might conceivably lie latent behind letter be idle task what saw that without shadow of doubt with certain exultation be that be above men whom mr francis have most reason to fear a long a be at large with circumstantial evidence that held be clearly very unlikely that further attempt must be immediately contemplated against harry for risk must be prodigious so far then looked that letter might be bold cunning scheme to get too into power of hellish man on other hand must not neglect possible chance letter might conceivably be genuinely inspired looking at coolly a be habit of mind thought that balance of probability dipped to sinister side dr armytage be far more likely to be mr francis confederate than disinterested doctor foe yet there be certain touch of truth about spluttering pen of postscript geoffrey debate be of short duration then with wonderment at own slowness of wit next moment obvious safeguard struck telegraphed to doctor at wimpole street saying that must meet at five o'clock at junction of orchard street with oxford street be conveniently near to own lodging where must retire to hold conference if appeared that there be reason for while must be scarcely possible for one even with legion of hell to back to spirit away active young man from populous thoroughfare without attracting public attention geoffrey arrived in london late in forenoon spent couple of hour in writing out with most minute particular account of incident on suspicion be founded have led to scene with mr francis sealed up in envelope wrote direction on outside that in case nothing more be heard from till monday midday be to be opened put into larger envelope addressed with short note to father posted finally before set out for rendezvous at corner of orchard street slipped loaded revolver into breast pocket to guard against very remote possibility of being attacked in own room presence there though not unattended with qualm for be something of stranger to branch of firearm yet filled with secret glee of adventure punctually at five arrived at appointed corner few moment observation of shifting changing crowd be enough to enable to single out man spare dark who also lingered there be evident too that have observed geoffrey le than geoffrey have observed on third fourth occasion that eye met man crossed street to mr geoffrey langham asked to geoff silent gesture of assent be dr armytage turned walked little way down oxford street before spoke again then said doctor plan be reasonable that must meet in public place be natural that must not wish to trust to house must suggest that if be to talk in public get into hansom must prefer four wheeler why asked geoffrey because be dealing hope will soon be dealing with very subtle man who for aught know may be watching geoffrey wheeled round quickly come to room in orchard street said will walk on other side of road distance be few dozen yard three minute later two be in sitting room overlooked street geoffrey pointed to seat waited for other to open conversation repeat said doctor that amendment of plan be reasonable for have little reason to trust seems to so said geoffrey thought wise to take other precaution be who asked for interview kindly tell what have to say be told in two word said dr armytage friend lord vail have by almost miracle of luck escaped from three well devised scheme against life thrice have mr francis failed can not expect such luck to continue not muscle of geoffrey face moved mean will make attempt said will certainly make attempt geoffrey hand be playing with box of cigarette on table opening shutting lid in careful purposeless manner here smoke said give minute to think doctor took cigarette lit waited have smoked half down before geoffrey spoke again see position said at length there be harm can see in telling that know how intimate be with mr francis be wondering whether possibly may be aiding by seeing be truth for intimacy with mr francis be very close a long a three twenty year ago at time let say of violent death of harold harmsworth be so believe certainly said doctor received may tell two thousand pound for service did mr francis at coroner inquest geoffrey looked up quickly ah sound genuine said about must decide for said doctor geoffrey snapped down lid of cigarette box took out of coat pocket revolver have put there laid on table close to doctor hand have decided see to trust said perhaps parting with revolver be unconvincing proof for must certainly be incautious of to shoot here now can think of nothing better there be anyhow dr armytage took up revolver opened six chamber loaded perceive said let return a received have use for geoffrey took from hand put back in table drawer now let talk said extraordinary look of relief crossed doctor face whole man seemed to brighten to eye hardly dared hope must trust said affection for friend must have be strong let waste more time yes suspicion be quite correct harry vail have bitterer enemy than uncle have made le than three attempt to put out of way speak a if be sure of said geoffrey be what evidence have must not take barrister ten minute to tear to shred for be entirely circumstantial weak at there be devilish cunning of man again if be to save harry must save in spite of for belief not word of deal with man who be cunning utterly unscrupulous far more cunning probably than put together have one great advantage over what be asked geoffrey fact that count on to be accomplice if succeed be to have ten thousand pound at word distrust again flared high in geoffrey mind refusing to be darkened beacon god give portion in hell cried if be playing double game doctor showed sign of resentment did not immediately reply will not do at said at length trust if will go be wasting word may remind however that if be playing double game conduct in wishing to see be utterly unaccountable if not that will be barely possible for alone to save friend for be strong impression that mr francis man sander be not will help master come be to be yes trust said geoffrey in great agitation ought never to have said that please go on can give certain detail yet said doctor attempt will be made between harry return to vail from lady oxted where go in few day moving to london before marriage so much have gathered from mr francis be will understand of utmost importance to that marriage must never be consummated more exactly than can not tell want in case to hold in readiness to come to vail anywhere else at moment notice at word from yes promise said particular can not give continued doctor for yet know indeed doubt whether mr francis have yet worked out to day a be coming up in train blew on flute long time then said suddenly to ' have new hobby property of certain powerful drug will have great talk about drug when be in london ' from gathered that mean to poison damned old man exclaimed geoffrey precisely now motive know guess be heir from what have seen of lately set le store by than on fact that harry death will give luck luck doe believe in luck cried geoffrey have heard laugh at harry hundred time for pretending to believe in there be wrong said doctor must be rather tempted to say that luck be only thing in world doe believe in tell for obvious reason be not sane on point be dealing with monomaniac be more to be feared than sane man will run greater risk to secure end be late must go during next week will certainly learn whole of mr francis plan for will refuse to help in way unless know good bye will please stop in london till hear from geoffrey got up tell said when did determine to help harry think that if told must trust more said doctor assure will not trust le dr armytage took umbrella from corner fortnight ago only said on day first saw harry think of a will so long a do what tell really care very little about anything else even whether trust mistrust provided only behave a if trusted yes till saw spent evening with on day left prescribed for agitated nerve gave sleeping draught be glad did know before said geoffrey frankly might certainly have caused uneasiness not till then did decide to save if must not to do other thing day strengthened decision thought of ten thousand pound grew le attractive reason be hard to give convincingly at rate be due perhaps to great charm attractiveness lord vail posse be due perhaps to idea in own mind must not commit murder sound little crude doe not be dealing with crudity good bye again geoffrey held out hand trust said quite completely so seems doe harry believe that be wrong dr armytage turned quickly away without word moment afterward street door banged behind chapter xxii lady oxted have bad night harry be sitting cross legged on hearth rug after dinner poking fire in idiotic manner with tongs gun cotton must have smouldered out under so illiterate stroke be also talking with about equal vivacity vacuity to lady oxted evie while conversation be not more than difficult to bear poking of fire be quite intolerable lady oxted got swiftly silently up from chair in manner of stooping hawk took instrument from can attend better dear harry said to most interesting conversation if distract mind by making bayonet of improper fire iron can do after have gone to bed be improper said harry sense of delicacy forbade telling so how respectable woman like must tolerate presence in house have be more than be able to imagine now ice be broken oh never told about ice house did lord oxted looked up from evening paper be reading distractedly diligently made bee line for door exit though made without protest be somewhat marked have manner a wife often told ice house said harry a if be giving out text to diminishing congregation spicy emphasis be required to retain rest gun sluice shadow of lord oxted lingered moment in doorway at alluring selection immediately disappeared on next word will make blood run cold have luck be singing nursery rhyme asked lady oxted uncertain what to do with white elephant tongs singing cried harry digging shovel into fire singing quo ' good woman can will tale unfold if have tear prepare to shed now said with felicitous air lady oxted shovel also thus there be two white elephant be not washerwoman harry remarked with reason dear aunt said growing suddenly grave if have be so absurdly happy to night must have made joke of for indeed be joke anyhow doctor congratulated on admirable nerve people when prepare to tell story said lady oxted begin at beginning others be without prejudice begin at end work laboriously slowly backward let at least ask harry not to be slow tell about doctor a be to go backward did name begin with quite right said harry went on with r lady oxted dropped white elephant on carpet sat down by evie armytage asked fooling be gone from voice right again have much better tell whole story for have when other people begin to talk about luck take part in conversation said except at least when geoffrey be here then talk of bear bull harry who have played bayonet with tongs have by time vanished vanished also be flying skirt of farce in absolute silence on part of audience in gravity on own told three adventure narrating only salient fact alluding directly otherwise to geoffrey uncle while tale be yet young evie crossed from sofa where have be sitting with lady oxted joined harry on hearth rug one hand held fan other be on lap of latter harry easily possessed tale of gun be told with in a spoke of raking gash riddled cornice ceiling of gun

can buy handbook on bridge said with spirit will give for present at christmas bob let go to bed lady oxted employed in almost daily conduct of life method characterized a diplomatic le indulgent critic than might have labelled with shorter directer word yet not have felt that be harsh for diplomatic method did not exclude what may elegantly term evasion of truth to night for instance talked with evie for few minute only in bedroom exacted promise that must go to bed at once for looked very tired for must have known that head be splitting that if got influenza again must turn atheist with immoderate statement secured from interruption went not to bed to smoking room where found harry alone rustling of dress made look up quickly most undiplomatic disappointment be evident on face be not evie remarked clear sighted lady be tired have gone to bed so came for chat with dear harry be so nice to see again what terrible adventure have be through want to hear of more particularly thought must frighten evie to talk of longer be why be abrupt to so be tired diplomacy said harry yes just touch of diplomacy assented lady oxted for looked scared frightened now be alone when thing happened be dr armytage there how did dr armytage come to be at vail at came to vail said harry on evening of third affair breaking of sluice telegraphed for because be frightened about uncle be liable know to cardiac attack be afraid of one coming on be naturally agitated at series of escape said lady oxted naturally said harry lady oxted rose with impatience threw diplomacy aside effort at dissimulation be pitiable harry said if wo tell happened say so be going to fish more harry did not immediately reply lady oxted continued seriously speaking said think ought to know if there be nothing more if conscience allows to say that there be nothing to tell be content if can not say that think ought to tell do not think that be putting unfair pressure on asked harry for be no longer only own master must consider not only evie in mother absence have certain duty toward ask from curiosity because of relation in stand to have within last few week be in three position of extreme personal danger can however vaguely account for have there be suspicious circumstance of kind might lead one to think that be not entirely accident say that geoffrey be in house on occasion did take a lightly a seem to must rather not bring geoffrey into said harry have quarrelled yes suppose may say that have quarrelled replied harry why will not tell save asking question intend to go on asking be quarrel with geoffrey connected in way with accident oh give minute cried harry want to make up mind whether be going to tell not suppose if did not must go to geoff certainly must said lady oxted promptly although have not occurred to well be better must tell than said harry without more word told that have purposely left unsaid from mistaken direction have sent to ice house instead of summerhouse down to scene in smoking room when have parted with geoffrey heard in silence without question interruption when have finished still said nothing apt ready a be for ordinary social emergency must frame nothing for must not say what thought outspokenly like geoffrey for harry sake must not say what did not think in spite of diplomatic tendency for own at last silence became portentous harry broke have then lost friend in addition to geoffrey said in voice be not very steady must not have given better lead ah say thing like harry said think possible in first place even if did must be part of wisdom to say tell frankly that though geoffrey seems to to have spoken most hastily unwisely yet can understand what felt there be deny that see many curious circumstance about adventure lend reasonableness pardon to suspicion know know said harry find sheer impossibility to believe in degree at geoffrey suspicion be out of question that being so can not away with what have done with speaking to uncle like can not away with condition of mind to however plausible idea idea be possible lady oxted be quick thinker knew moreover that to decide wrong be better than not to decide at before harry have finished speaking be determined on line of action geoffrey rightly guessed have at least a much influence with harry a herself yet even geoffrey in heat horror of adventure have be powerless to move chance then speaking at cooler distance have scarcely slightest prospect of success secret coalition with geoffrey be evidently preferable to open collision with harry see quite see said o harry throw away friend lightly geoff be good fellow must remember that be for sake that risked suffered quarrel with friend be not so common a sparrow will not find under house roof do anything in hurry wait situation be hopeless until have given time chance to work write if have not already done so angry letter worse dignified calm world without end letter be so easy to make estrangement permanent can always do have written at said harry tried to must not do there be hurry besides geoffrey will not expect to hear from dr armytage wrote to tell not to lady oxted just succeeded in suppressing exclamation of surprise be on lip be very kind of wise a well said be one other said harry be down at vail week liked immensely mind telling be glad to get away to part with with uncle francis with luck for time felt a if there be occult conjuncture against did like have continually to keep hold on to make effort not to be scared here be being beautifully relaxed feel secure yes be word lady oxted continued diplomatic course there be nothing so catching a superstition said evening since told evie about have be wondering oh must be nonsense cried mean luck asked harry be saul also among prophet mean luck how doe nursery rhyme go fire frost rain be well there be be use denying not slightest said harry certainly be very strange harry like luck at be uncanny wish must smash throw into sea yet somehow feel a if be safe a long a be here away from wish must stop here till marriage then go away see for six week in meantime burglar might be kind enough to steal shook head put good thing have brought much higher than evil said be going to bring very good thing best after if like will smash well stay here till marriage anyhow must go down to vail once to see that have finished up house be upside down when be there barring couple of day then there be nothing must like better will have nearly month of though consider well then stop till tell can not bear longer be candid woman fond of giving pain promise to speak out dear be nearly one must go to bed if dream of luck will be fault lady oxted did not dream at for very long time night be at wit end what to do scotland yard with detective of improbable fiction thrown in to aid be powerless to help for evidence against mr francis in harry story though conclusive to own mind must weigh lighter than chaff in cross examination further evidence be procurable until mr francis made attempt at thought shuddered what too be that sinister doctor doing at vail what be meaning of seeming friendliness in averting final rupture between harry geoffrey have written according to own account letter to geoffrey must avoid what did letter really contain be far more likely that have told that rupture be final for clearly mr francis must not want to risk possibility of geoffrey who knew whose attitude be so avowedly hostile coming down to vail again only consolation be that harry for present be safe that must go up to london next day see geoffrey what must do even together what defence be possible when blow might fall at moment from unsuspected quarter by degree a paced room kind of clearness came to mr francis design be evident have shown hand by nature of earlier attempt in have tried to stop harry marriage then in miscarriage of that have turned to directer deed fouler must scarcely be of more violent sort there have be specie of awful art in doings have taken with fiend gusto pleasure in ingenuity of so pictured harry avowed superstition in power of luck to compass end a musician take subject on theme work out fugue a artist paint portrait in definite preconceived scheme of colour so have mr francis taken luck danger be thought to bring to possessor have elaborated put into practical shape must have dwelt in mind like lunatic idea not only a in case of gun did make opportunity a in affair of ice house must have be alert receptive instinctively instantaneously turning to end chance put in way thought brought certain feeling of relief on one hand on other added indefinite terror man morally sane must devise steadily prosecute so finished scheme very thoroughness consistency of three attempt stamped a work of madman nine tenth of blood murderously shed on earth be to be put down to spasm of ungovernable anger hate at moment possessed murderer long premeditation careful following of one idea by frost fire rain must be direct cause of harry death be not to be attributed so devilish so finished be application to sane author here lay consolation shuddering horror of white haired old gentleman with flute playing boyish yet courtly manner be little assuaged gave way to mere human pity for mind deranged simultaneously a if with clash of cymbal fear of defenceless bewildered broke out that cunning of madman be far more formidable than schemings of sane man must soon maddened by failure reck nothing of what happened to so that attained object what then looking at thus be object mere death of harry merely lust for blood seemed hardly possible must not put down a homicidal maniac since seemed that have desire to kill for killing sake world be not yet staggered with catalogue of subtle undetected murder be explanation that wished to inherit vail somewhat insufficient revenue more satisfactory be old have so far a one must guess wish for more of world good than possessed under harry generosity motive must scarcely be here then in flash more likely solution struck luck perhaps wanted luck year of ownership so told have already affected even harry sanity in regard what if here be man old already poised on edge of dug grave who life long have dreamed of itched for believing god knew what be in store for possessor guessed be taint of blood same so mysteriously though uncriminally possessed harry here perhaps be cause not fire frost rain belief in peril coupled with belief in great unwonted good fortune possession of gave mr francis have more than once in hearing laughed at harry for fantastic allegiance to heirloom if anything confirmed lady oxted in theory cunning be of consistency with rest long since have dismissed maid tired with fruitless thought baffled with dimly cipherable peril finished undressing blew out light through dark hour be clutched by night hag now luck appeared to like grail in parsifal emitting unearthly radiance even a gazed must suddenly be stricken with knowledge that brightness of be not of heavenly of diabolic birth piercing light emanated therefrom of infernal red voice from pit moaned round then must be gone for little while wriggling darkness succeeded slowly break in blackness heralded coming must begin to shine again grow intolerably bright faint line where must shortly appear stretched upon field of vision growing momentarily more distinct instead of luck there came first in outline then in awful indelible vividness feature of mr francis now very kind gentle now mask of tormented fury next morning found that resolve to see geoffrey without delay have not be diminished by scattered phantom of night lame toothache excuse served end did not certainly know whether be in london not for safety sake sent two telegram one to father house in kent second to lodging in orchard street bidding come to lunch day in grosvenor square without fail one addressed to london found first since after interview with dr armytage have stayed on there followed after hour interval by other sent on from father house constituted call of urgency therefore obeyed summons leaving note for dr armytage a have be agreed between to say when must be in again where have gone conference began after lunch found in measure relief to be able to confide secret haunting sense of peril to on other hand be horrified to find that one else shared apprehension still hoped might be phantasmal geoffrey on part have account of dealing with dr armytage to add to lady oxted information own conviction that be dealing with man not morally sane whose one desire be to have to hold luck to alliance with dr armytage of geoffrey told seemed doubtful gain what doe one know of asked nothing be not bad mr francis must not have chosen more apt more unscrupulous tool got two thousand pound tell for service in connection with harmsworth case what will not do for ten oh may be dealing with cunning of have conception what if be told simply to blind nothing can be more probable how admirably have succeeded already trust man object a far a be concerned be gained have to trust distrust said geoffrey chose to do former if have chosen latter door must have closed on see that must be better off than be now if be dealing straight with have immense advantage in knowing know of mr francis plan if be not can at most give misleading information be not worse than none at lady oxted considered in silence moment yes be true said yet somehow flesh misgives to be allied with man o geoffrey be because awful luck have cast spell on that imagine harry surrounded by intimate immediate peril be fear real let tell ourselves that be ordinary people living in age of prose police men be not under doge be nineteenth century said rising twentieth if will look out on grosvenor square hansom be driving by stopped suddenly be wrong said be not driving by have stopped at door dr armytage have rung bell oh what will do cried god in heaven what be to do what have come to tell geoffrey got up now quietly quietly lady oxted said have come on matter of importance must have waited till returned to orchard street have decided to trust suggest therefore that see together be best chance may be only one trust said lady oxted distrust from head to heel bit finger nail thing have not done since day of schoolroom very well then will run on own line got up to leave room wait geoffrey said be absolutely determined absolutely yield then at rate have plan have none yes show dr armytage in said to man who have brought card chapter xxiii meeting in grosvenor square doctor entered with brusqueness of man who have knowledge of at rate regard for usage of polite society treated lady oxted to little more than profile imperceptible pause indulgence might construe into bow then walked straight up to geoffrey with face businesslike concentrated have important information said be desirous of telling without delay hansom be waiting geoffrey felt heart thump riotously heavy repeated blow have to act immediately mean asked not that said doctor only thought looked for brief moment at lady oxted rose how do do dr armytage said mr langham be when entered talking about same business a on have come harry vail must tell be great friend of mine be staying with now last night told history of past fortnight very fully will not therefore surprise to learn came up to london to day to see mr langham doe not surprise in least said take then that wish to speak before if be so will send hansom away be back again immediately waited till others have sat down warming hand at fire with back turned to silence so to speak be of own making thought to interrupt then facing spoke there be need therefore began a if continuing private train of thought must speak at length of what have already happened harry gather have told lady oxted of three escape have told also of quarrel with friend here reason of there be something in bald abruptness pleased lady oxted looked genuine at same time made to herself conscious reservation that might be piece of acting if acting be very decent performance gave silent assent have asked to speak before went on in doing so be somewhat at personal disadvantage have reason to suppose that trust indeed there be reason why must know of probably a intimate friend of mr francis when appears that be traitor to naturally ask if be really so paused moment think that need much concern be here to tell in what manner mr francis hope to kill nephew be object take to prevent that there be something in tone smacked of lecture so dry precise be clearer observer of than of present audience to whom word said be so much more just now than man who said must have seen that intense agitation quivered beneath surface man be desperately in earnest about something there be one more preliminary word went on be dealing so far a observation go with man who be scarcely sane in psychology of crime find that such patient calculated attempt to take life be usually associated with something else that indicates cerebral disorder fixed idea in short of insane character be usually motive for homicidal desire that symptom be present here luck exclaimed lady oxted precisely idea of owning luck posse patient belief that brings owner danger possibly risk compensation of overwhelming weight belief may tell that will keep off death perhaps indefinitely to old man be consideration of importance especially if have exuberant love of life a mr francis have on other hand must remember that before last outbreak if may call such mr francis procured death of man who stood in relation to luck yes shot young harmsworth said slowly looking at lady oxted for nothing more le than insurance money one may have doubt whether crime of violent kind be not form of insanity that particular form of insanity be punished with hanging be by strange pathway that woman mind sometimes move may take short cut of most dubious fallacious kind to avoid minute traversing of safe road walk mile round in order to avoid puddle over must easily step at rate know when have arrived at juncture lady oxted got up held out hand to doctor entreat pardon said in case trust now certain brightness shone in dark sad eye a took hand be glad to know that said advise if possible to continue trusting will have trial of faith before long geoffrey moved impatiently three seemed to have forgotten manner oh go on man go on exclaimed bear in mind then said doctor that may be dealing with lunatic fixed idea incline to belief murder of young harmsworth pull other way mr francis have now made plan told morning for a will see be to figure in what will do be doctor again paused adjusted finger tip together expects harry said to return to vail before end of month servant will return about same time perhaps day two earlier for there will be few arrangement to make will also accompany mr francis so tell on ground of continued ill health ah heart attack said lady oxted be genuine perfectly be also dangerous to continue on night appointed be to say a soon a be there be to administer to harry drug called metholycine in respect be suitable for mr francis purpose small dose produce within very few minute complete unconsciousness to if antidote restorative be applied succeeds death also be extremely volatile more so even than aconite very few hour after death trace of must be found in stomach other part of body drug however be exceedingly hard to get chemist must conceivably give to unauthorized person few year ago be experimenting with so happens that still have in possession mr francis have most retentive memory though have recollection of having ever mentioned fact to asked morning whether have left did so in quiet normal voice for moment be off guard told have perhaps after be lucky occurrence for seemed very much pleased played on flute for time then came back to told what have already told what will now tell there be something strangely grim about composure of doctor manner must have said spoke of danish politics more grim perhaps be mention of flute playing certainly added extreme vividness to narrative flute player be more horrible than man who planned death in respect then first of continued icy voice be useful to in second place mr francis seems to have singular horror of doing actually with hand deed in way also will be of service to here must touch on thing more gruesome be best that must know drug be to be administered late at night after servant be out of way be almost completely without taste odour mr francis suggestion be that whisky soda tell harry always take before going to bed must be vehicle ten minute after have taken will be unconscious will live for half hour during time will carry down to plate closet where luck be kept with rest of plate there sander will be that part will be in sander hand will not use firearm for fear of noise of report reaching servant blow kill understand looking at occurrence from point of view of coroner must be dealt while be still alive otherwise absence of effusion of blood other detail must show doctor that be already dead when skull be broken be idea by battering blow here again mr francis anticipates that will be of use to in determining when unconsciousness be quite complete death not yet immediate have curiously strong desire that harry must feel pain for be very fond of lady oxted geoffrey alike be glued to word paler than wont a doctor paused sought other eye found there horror beyond speech of most valuable of plate continued doctor will be taken of course luck plate will be perquisite of sander luck mr francis will keep secretly presumption being that be stolen also why then may ask must not mr francis simply steal luck for reason that a long a harry life be on death becomes mr francis thus morning will show plate closet rifled harry clubbed to death on floor plan be complete ingenious indeed have weak point will appear that harry after servant have gone to bed drank whisky soda hearing something stirring went downstairs finding door of plate closet open entered be instantly felled by blow on side of head killed burglar did not arouse one else in house escaped even detail be arranged by same way a entered through window of gun room look out be aware on to garden bed adjoin sweep of carriage drive footprint of large heavy boot will be found there mr francis bought pair to day at cheap ready made shop again horror palpable a draught of cold air passed through auditor seeming to to lift hair upon scalp trivial detail of boot flute playing be of almost more intimate touch than crime brought at rate into range of reality to time of to day next week to familiar setting again doctor spoke have already taken one precaution said have emptied from bottle real metholycine substituted common salt went to house hurriedly after seeing mr francis to get brought away in pocket will be glad to dispose of be not thing to carry about drew out small packet folded up with precision of dispensing chemist opened contained ounce of white coarse grained powder very like to ordinary salt without more word emptied on fire red hot coal blackened where poured then grew red again for moment aura of yellow flame flickered over place mr francis will not find easy to get more said doctor effect of be great immediate lady oxted geoffrey felt a much relieved a if imminent danger have be removed though logic of relief seeing that trusted dr armytage in whose domain poison lay be not capable of bearing examination at rate lady oxted sat briskly up from cramped huddling of position in have listened to doctor story clapped hand have check number one said what next dr armytage depends on what end have in view said be safety yes safety must be certain said must see man in criminal lunatic asylum in penal servitude harry will never be safe till be behind bar agree with said geoffrey dr armytage left fireplace where have be standing since beginning of interview sat down do realize what that demand said mean that mr francis must be allowed to make attempt have already frustrated said lady oxted pointing to fireplace dr armytage shook head if idea be to catch red handed be not sufficient said harry take whisky soda salt one night very little salt for drug be potent may may not notice salt what then sander meantime be waiting in plate closet doubt can thus catch sander be lady oxted rang bell can hing said except go straight to scotland yard put whole matter in hand of police will please come with dr armytage geoffrey too to of course evidence be overwhelming look at from harmsworth case onward stopped suddenly looked at doctor good heaven never thought of said doctor rose a may imagine have thought good deal of that said be possible by mean to get hold of man sander asked lady oxted at length get hansom said to man who answered bell must prefer to try that first said doctor will see what can do may be possible to buy man may be scamp enough to be venal if have to go to scotland yard have to go to scotland yard for moment need not harry be safe with for ten day more mr francis be not thinking of leaving london for ten day something perhaps may turn up in interval if not be ready lady oxted felt that word must meet situation did not make attempt then hansom will take to station instead said have just time to catch train drive with there geoffrey stood up drawing on glove please let hear from dr armytage said if have communication to make have better not be written come down to oxted wire for to come up at present then there be nothing more to be said shook hand three went out through hall across broad pavement to where hansom be waiting lady oxted got in first geoffrey be already on step to follow when man crossing road came from behind hansom stepped on to pavement close to where doctor be standing dear fellow said very familiar voice what glorious afternoon thing be so sudden that doctor have literally time to lose nerve get in look round said very low to geoffrey be too late at sound of voice geoffrey have already looked round mr francis for one stricken moment stared at other pleasant smile did not fade from old man face rather seemed fixed there simultaneously from inside hansom came lady oxted voice get in geoff said have too much time mr francis advanced step so that must see into hansom ah lady oxted too remarked gently drive on cabman horse broke into rapid trot doctor be left standing together mr francis stood looking after diminishing vehicle for moment still smiling lady oxted lady oxted continued to murmur to then turned briskly to companion in gentle low modulated tone without haste charming woman one whom one be delighted to call friend said dear geoffrey too dear geoffrey harry great friend how nice to have even so short glimpse of what good fortune to meet together like well well must go on good bye for present dear man turned from walked three pace away then stopped faced round again for moment doctor thought eye brain have played inexplicable trick must barely credit that face now looking at be same a two second ago have be so smiling show of sunlit urbanity now be scarce human fiend wild beast mad with passion hate glared at iris of eye seemed to have swelled till white be invisible from pin point of pupil be focused on great vein stood out on forehead neck blue dilated lip be drawn back from mouth till gum appeared showing two row of white very even teeth pleasant rosiness of face be blotched mottled with patch of white purple forehead corner of quivering mouth be streaked with corrugation so deeply cut that dividing ridge of flesh cast shadow therein stamp of humanity be obliterated stood there for perhaps five second lower jaw working gently up down a if chewing little foam gathered on lip moment doctor expected to fall senseless on pavement to spring upon for seemed impossible that human frame must contain so raging energy of emotion yet break give then horrible chewing of jaw ceased man beast wiped froth from lip black treacherous scoundrel said very softly do think be sort of man to be thwarted by faithless subordinate came step nearer mouth still seemed to be forming word be a if human nature of man have be so effaced a to preclude speech stood chattering gesticulating like angry ape yet resemblance roused in doctor sense of ludicrous only deep seated horror at thing have doffed humanity like cloak become part of brute creation summoned courage to aid empty effort for knew within that if travesty of man came one step nearer must in spite of simply turn tail run from mr francis came nearer did speak again before lapse of five second turned away walked quickly down toward corner of square without looking back doctor followed with eye saw hail hansom at end of upper grosvenor street get in drive northward stood there brain tumult of bewildered conjecture did not see who be rapidly approaching till figure be by heard own name called got down a soon a must stop cab said geoffrey have gone where what have happened know have betrayed said doctor be for moment be no longer human in mood will not stop to weigh risk consequence before anything else must find out where be going probably to own flat where must watch possibly first to house ah yes for metholycine thank god be harmless there be cab about so started to walk northward in direction mr francis have taken at corner of green street found disengaged hansom drove to wimpole street here doctor got out drive on to flat in wigmore street said to geoffrey ask porter if have come in then come back here three minute later geoffrey returned came in minute two before said have kept cab doctor pointed to row of bottle on shelf in cabinet metholycine be missing said came here where be known to servant told man have instruction from to take certain bottle from case be allowed asked if appeared in way strange excited not bit of have smile joke a usual come on where asked geoffrey to see where cab go by way what of lady oxted went on to catch train be far better must be with harry told must telegraph happened quite so here be wigmore street will wait in entry there be cab still at door ah must have cab waiting too stepped out of entry hailed cab from rank little way down street said few word to man pointing out to hansom be to keep in sight drew up at curb opposite place of observation not forty yard in front be mr francis sober respectable street dozed in haze of afternoon sun with air of professional man resting for little from work vehicle be few pavement only sparsely populous roadway nearly empty driver of mr francis cab have got down from perch be talking to hall porter of house of flat pulling at laggard pipe then suddenly porter cabman looked up a if have be called from within disappeared into entry to come back with various small piece of luggage then cabman mounted box with other assistance drew up portmanteau on to roof at moment mr francis stepped across pavement entered cab have on straw hat in hand be morocco flute case on mouth smile thanks to porter sander followed after word got in after at same instant of time doctor geoffrey have sprung into place two cab started together passage of dozen street be sufficient to make destination tolerably certain when mr francis cab turned into steep decline leading to departure platform at paddington matter be practically beyond doubt here doctor stopped cab got out be certain said geoffrey though word have passed between look be ten minute past five fast train to vail will start in seven minute now what be to do harry be at oxted said doctor a if speaking to yes only want to be perfectly certain that mr francis go to vail will find out said geoffrey walked down incline past sander who be busy with luggage into booking office there be considerable number of passenger waiting mr francis be already high up in queue geoffrey waited with back turned till heard speak to clerk one first one second single to vail said with information be complete rejoined doctor harry at oxted mr francis with luggage for prolonged stay at vail here be sum of movement be duly telegraphed to lady oxted so far be well in such degree a anything must be well in dark business by mutual consent determined to leave further deliberation till morrow be fully informed prepared for move to morrow might be mr francis must show for what reason have gone to vail chapter xxiv jim go to bed geoffrey in spite of perhaps owing to anxiety slept long late be already after ten when came half dressed from bedroom to adjoining sitting room in quest of letter there be word either from dr armytage lady oxted here news be distinctly good news fresh complication have arisen harry might be certainly assumed be safe at oxted mr francis a certainly at vail though safety be matter of infinitesimal moment yet in spite of geoffrey have morning face intolerable presage of disaster sat heavy on brooded sombrely over meal reading paper yet not noting content paragraph be dutch to even here in fog centre one must believe of created thing morning be one of fine exquisite beauty primrose coloured sunshine flooded town air be brisk with cleanly smell of autumnal frost how clearly must picture to what same hour be like at vail how familiar intimate be memory of such morning when harry have stepped after breakfast into sparkling coolness of young day sunshine from without met with glad thrill of welcome sunshine from within lake lay level shining brain picture have vividness of authentic hallucination wisp of mist still hanging in place over level shining too be lawn pearly mysterious halo moved with moving shadow of head blackbird scurried chuckled over grass beech be golden in autumn livery solemn glee even smiled in gray toned red of square house at regret a bitter a tear surged up within never again so thought must particular happiness of unreflecting day be tragedy like drop from corroding drug have fallen in sting smoke upon over fair scene slept on wing destroying angel between harry have risen barrier of irreconcilable estrangement like monstrous spider spinning thread god knew where to catch what heedless footstep mr francis stretched web over outlet from house sat in malign poisonous vague foreboding mordancy of regret grew to be unbearable taking hat geoffrey walked out westward aimlessly enough only seeking to dull misgiving by sight of many human face crowd have for absorbing fascination to be in midst of folk be to put rein on private fancy for spectacle of life claimed attention morning healthful prescription seemed to have lost efficacy drug be stale impotent air be dark with winged fear came to roost within chatting evilly together yet street be better than own room for nearly two hour wandered up down jostling pavement then returning to orchard street entered weary room heart stood suddenly still for on table be lying telegram for moment stood by door a if fearing even to go near then with stride inserted finger pink sheet be before eye harry have just left for vail ran passing through london sander have telegraphed that master be dangerously ill must come at once to see alive take direct to dr armytage shock be a of fire cold water disabling for moment bracing beyond word brooding regret dull vague ache of morning have passed a completely a blink of summer lightning geoffrey knew to be strung up again to level of intelligent activity a drove to wimpole street examined chronology of message have be sent off appeared three hour ago be likely that even now harry be passing through london cab be standing at doctor door be open servant by at same moment of receiving impression be aware of two figure in hall beyond stopped one be with back to on sound of step turned round o geoff said harry holding out hand uncle francis be ill very dangerously ill be going to vail at once be just coming to see first now be here by flash of intuition unerring instantaneous geoffrey saw precisely what be in harry mind knew that next moment opportunity so vitally desirable yet vitally dishonourable to accept must be given that have idea whether in nature there be that must be strong enough to resist wo come with asked harry low almost timidly ca in case be in time just ask forgiveness for wrong did be very ill perhaps dying dying geoff at moment doctor stepped forward bradshaw in hand to brighter light by open door in passing geoffrey made faint unmistakable command of assent finger be on open page spoke immediately can catch harry said will telegraph to to meet please said harry still looking at other geoffrey said again touched on arm geoffrey heard leaf of bradshaw flutter sound of name lingered in ear much perhaps be to gain by going price price be just deliberate deception on solemn matter to say yes be to declare to friend that desired forgiveness of horrible man whom soberly believed to be guilty of most monstrous design momentous debate be momentary harry can not said two turned from other without further word geoffrey took step to where doctor stood came to have word with said together went into consulting room scarcely have door closed behind when geoffrey drew telegram from pocket have just found from lady oxted said probably have telegraphed same to now how did harry come here what have passed between doctor glanced at sheet yes telegraphed to also said harry coming be pure luck wanted to go with down to vail to see if anything can be done for mr francis hope added with humour too grim for smile to be able to do great deal for mr francis so be going thank lord said geoffrey do believe in illness may have have attack said doctor with shrug indeed be not improbable after agitation of yesterday again may not be subtle man be trap mean to get harry there possibly if so trap laid in hurry else must never have telegraphed to harry at lady oxted might have guessed must be passed on to be sorry by way that must not manage to say 'yes to wish that must go with respect for saying 'no must do otherwise said geoffrey same if appears desirable will come to vail ah will come secretly on own account just a must have if have not seen harry will do just a well now can give three minute will be in house suppose will not how can communicate with geoffrey thought moment eye brightened in two way no le said listen carefully please at appointed time tap at portrait of old francis in hall will be just behind will open secondly go to window of gun room open call very gently will be within three yard of in centre of box hedge just outside will do whichever seems to best doe mr francis know of asked doctor after pause know of passage inside house of be sure know that know of box hedge then will choose now how will get to vail must not go by same train a must not run risk of harry seeing then will go by next same a mr francis went by yesterday get in at half past six will be at box hedge soon after seven very good said doctor now in turn listen to mr francis belief have metholycine with have also sander seems to therefore probable that will attempt to carry thing out in way indicated to told lady oxted geoffrey shook head not likely said hold evidence of metholycine have taken from cabinet yes be desperate drug almost untraceable also fact that have metholycine from cabinet may be supposed to shut mouth look very much a if be accomplice doe not will guess that be awkward for a indeed must be be not metholycine common salt have said geoffrey go on suspect feel sure then that plan be more le same a before only sander will have to carry through alone see reason why must alter idea of supposed burglary be simple convincing mouth be sealed in two way how two asked geoffrey two so mr francis think harmsworth metholycine now metholycine will fail will have to get harry into power other way also mr francis will be very anxious a told that must not suffer pain of be certain be fixed idea with probably also attempt will be made a planned late when servant be in bed now be there not groom in stable very like harry geoffrey stared image of said what about go down to stable a soon a get to vail tell be wanted at house know suppose walk up with let be in box hedge with for moment excitement of adventure overpowered else in geoffrey mind ah have idea cried nothing except that may be useful to have two harrys in house allowing time for must be at box hedge by eight will be appointed hour what will tell jim jim be name of groom tell that may be in power to save master from great peril harry be liked by servant be not that know at present be that must wait in box hedge with in case need supposing be swiftly secretly needed how be to get into house by secret passage within said geoffrey quick a echo good again look a if luck be with passage come out at back of old francis portrait bad place yes also at bottom of main stair through panel between hall be better there then o god help now must go harry be waiting for dare not risk trying to convince quarrelled with best friend for suspicion can serve better by going with went out together found harry in hall detained geoffrey with hand doctor passed on into dining room will lunch here harry said be ready from outside lad closed door geoffrey knew that bad moment be coming set teeth moment be worse than anticipated for harry voice when spoke be broken eye moist o geoffrey said can not do what asked if knew what meant to there be two men in world whom love there understand can not bear simply can not bear temptation have be severe before be trifle to ca cried geoffrey eager to get word spoken for moment made harder to speak o harry day will understand before marriage give date swear to in god name that will understand how be that can not come with to ask mr francis forgiveness disappointment deepened on harry face gleam of anger shone there will not ask third time said went into dining room geoffrey have still three hour to wait in london before starting of train be chequered with incredible crowd of various hope fear at one time hugged on obvious superiority of disposition against mr francis must even smile to think of toil enveloping that evil schemer again mere exhilaration at unknown violent must boil up in effervescence moment anguish of distrust must seize what if after dr armytage have be playing with how completely successfully writhed to think week ago sweat must have broken out on to picture harry travelling down to vail with man of sinister repute to be alone in house with mr francis foxlike servant have be hoodwinked throughout be doctor even now smiling to behind paper at facility of victim at thought london turned hell have taken bait like silly staring fish even now be already hauled a be on to dry land there to gasp innocuously impotent to stir warn while who knew what ghastly subaqueous drama might even now be going on have trusted doctor on evidence of most diaphanous kind unsupported by testimony of sleeping draught given to harry brushing aside of revolver have passed to when to shoot be impossible with calculated gravity of face assumption of anxious sincerity have be enough to convince of man honesty must have screamed aloud at thought moment whirled harry nearer helpless unsuspecting to house of death meantime journey of two have be for most part silent passage be absorbed in own thought anxiety harry restless impatient eager for quicker falling behind of wayside station while doctor brooded with half closed eyelid intent must seem on pattern of carriage mat thought inconjecturable once only a train yelled through slough did speak then with earnestness let uncle know have come harry said may be that sander have unnecessarily alarmed so see first if have be heart attack like to what have before seems now to be quietly recuperating let know be here may only alarm for condition pray god may be so said harry doctor looked steadfastly at carriage mat medically speaking said insist on must also wish that must guard against possibility of knowing be here sander suppose look after must therefore not wish sander to know oh can keep secret said harry very likely must rather have secret to keep be not speaking without reason if a fear a telegram seems to indicate attack have be unusually severe must assure that be essential that agitating influence of kind must come near if be in real danger of course will see must not be likely to reassure to know be here asked harry have told that think not said doctor unless there be absolute need of hope word did not stick in throat that quiet will again restore trap be waiting for at station driven by jim doctor have opportunity of judging how far likeness between two might be hoped to deceive one who knew even now with one in livery other in ordinary dress be extraordinary not only in superficiality somehow essentially felt that be worth while to have arranged to profit by must opportunity occur groom have note for harry tore open hastily ah be good said handed to doctor be matter of couple of line signed by templeton saying merely that severity of attack be past at time of writing mr francis be sleeping being looked after by sander who have not left since seizure to one reader account brought up springing of hope to other conviction that estimate of mr francis illness be correct harry went upstairs immediately on arrival leaving doctor in hall templeton usually man of wood have perceptibly started when opened door to saw doctor now instead of discreetly retiring on removal of luggage hung about aimlessly poking fire putting crooked chair straight straight chair crooked fidgeting with blind at once strangeness of manner struck doctor what have got to tell asked suddenly blind crashed down to full length a butler hand dropped retaining string rigid control of domestic service be snapped be frightened man speaking to equal be strange illness of mr francis said doctor be alive to seize chance how strange asked mr francis have have attack before sent for doctor from didcot a soon a occurred unknown to sander said templeton be not allowed to see why be that sir there be sander telegraphing for lordship saying that mr francis be dying yet refusing to let doctor see perhaps be expecting sir doe not know be here templeton must know look to see that servant tell sander be here now what do mean think mr francis be not ill at doe man in jaw of death may say play flute asked butler play flute yes sir be during servant dinner hour have stomach for meat to day went upstairs when might have be at dinner perhaps five minute along top passage to lordship room to see if have ready well sir heard coming from mr francis room very low guarded so that must have heard nothing have not stood outside moment listening may say did not know for what little lively tune have heard play score of time in minute ceased then heard two voice talking after mr francis laughed that from man who be sleeping so sander told be very strange said doctor ay then door opened out came that man sander black a hell looked when saw little cared for black look just asked how master be very bad told wandering wondered whether lordship must get here in time doctor came step nearer templeton said rely on to obey implicitly be necessary that mr francis sander know be here thing can not yet tell may depend on see to let have room have before put lordship into room opening from lock door of lead into passage lose key so that only entrance be through room if asks why room be changed make paltry excuse say electric light in room be gone wrong anything make usual room look a if be occupied go up there during dinner turn down bed put nightshirt on leave sponge brush so on master harry gasped butler mind suddenly reverting to old day doctor frowned come said get out of hand like do a bid try to look can tell more harry came down from sick room few minute later with brow markedly clearer be much better ever so much better sander think said be sleeping when wake will be told have come ah be good said doctor did sander tell about attack yes came on while be dressing morning luckily sander be with for hour tell thought that breath might be last be trump man there be head on shoulder too have hardly left for five minute will sander sleep in room to night asked doctor yes have meal brought to there too so that will be easy for not to be seen by since make such point of oh thank god be so much better ah look be going to have one of curious low mist to night doctor followed harry to one of window templeton have left unshuttered looked out autumn twilight be fast closing in after hot sun of day mist in sudden coolness of withdrawal be forming very thickly rapidly over lake there be little draught of wind toward house not sufficient to disperse only to slide gently like sheet over lawn lay very low in thickness not perhaps exceeding five foot over higher stretch of lawn a surface of be level must have be few foot thicker where ground declined toward lake appeared to be of extraordinary density spread very swiftly steadily so that even while watched have pushed on till like flood water struck wall of house presently lawn lake be entirely vanished looked out a from mountain top over level sea of cloud pricked here there by plantation higher shrub above night be clear young moon rode high in heaven silently filled with star geoffrey meantime have followed two hour behind train be punctual be only little after seven when found having walked from station at edge of wood looking down on to same curious sea of mist monstrous bird of box hedge stood out upon like great aquatic creature swimming there for hedge be submerged descent into be like plunge into bath not wishing to risk being seen from house made wide circuit round toward lake here mist rose above head baffling blinding striking edge of lake followed guided a much by sobbing of ripple against bank a by vague muffled outline till reached inlet of stream fed from point ground rose rapidly in few minute must look over mist again see house already twinkling with scattered light moored like great ship in white sea few hundred yard more brought to stable conveniently for purpose at gate stood jim helper work over smoking chatting geoffrey approached till be certain must see who be be that jim said want at house jim knocked out pipe followed clothes have evening out stamped upon there seemed to be unpleasing curtailment of liberty in prospect come round by lake said geoffrey in low voice when groom have joined have something to tell waited till be certainly out of ear shot now jim said be just believe that attempt will be made to night to murder lord vail want help though ca yet tell in what way can help because know will do can be told to do gawd bless soul said jim then with return to ordinary impassivity yes sir will do anything tell to help come on then can trust that will run unreasonable risk be not thinking will let murder instead sir said jim may ask who be going to do murdering geoffrey hesitated moment on reflection there seemed to to be reason for concealing anything believe dr armytage be that sander mr francis man will attempt whistled under breath bring on said lord must like to have go at sander sir walk into stable yard a if horse in place belonged to have by time skirted lake again booming of sluice sounded near at hand then striking for higher ground saw have already passed house close in front of swam bird of box hedge mist have sunk back little now sat a if in receding tide on long peninsula of hedge visible above drift black in moonlight way said geoffrey groping round to back of found overgrown door entered thence going cautiously feeling way passed down length of soon saw in front of like blurred moon light from gun room window time have be calculated to nicety for have be there scarcely five minute when shadow moved across blind be then rolled up window silently lifted crack figure owing to density of mist be indistinguishable geoffrey recognised doctor voice when whispered name touched jim to make follow together stood close by window good have jim with said doctor have told may need want inside house so go with through secret passage open panel by stair told of will be there will tell what be going to do harry have gone to dress house be quiet wait geoffrey take handed out rook rifle eight ten cartridge put inside hedge whispered come round at once with jim five minute later geoffrey gently opened panel of door doctor glided in like ghost latching noiselessly behind face brooded gloomed laugh be alert active there be very little time said so first for geoffrey go back for rifle cartridge get somewhere in cover where can command front of house what course event will take outside can not say luck plate will be stolen will have to get away somehow must stop that sander suspect will try to remove beg pardon sir put in jim sander be down at stable afternoon said that door of coach house one of loose box be to be left unlocked to night in case doctor be wanted for mr francis said must put to sir so that none of need sit up doctor keen face grew shade more animate mouth bordered on smile good lad said well that be job geoffrey must use discretion entirely may have to deal with pretty desperate man be possible will feel safer with rifle where will go asked geoffrey thought summerhouse on knoll must be good place stand above mist excellent for jim must be guided by course of event jim will have to wait here in case probably till eleven even later then expect will go to bed in harry room where ca tell be in cloud at present want to spare harry horror anyhow will stop here until tap twice on panel outside now can not wait harry may be down minute dine at quarter past ah be for geoffrey handed packet of sandwich for jim now to summerhouse geoffrey jim wait here dine with harry yes hand yours god help work though never voluminous talker doctor be even more silent than usual at dinner night despite alertness of eye confessed to extreme fatigue thus be that soon after ten harry went upstairs straight to room latter to tap discreetly at door of sick room learn latest of patient change of harry room from one usually occupied to that communicating with doctor caused comment either silent spoken from did loss of key seem to in way remarkable came straight from visit to mr francis to give news to doctor still sleeping said sleeping very quietly so sander tell feel a if must sleep clock round really think will go to bed at once went through doctor room turned on light then appeared again in doorway got everything want asked have whisky soda confused idea of metholycine distinct idea that did not wish harry to run risk of being seen by sander going to room than ordinary made felt in doctor reply not for world said poisonous habit mean must have doe asked harry from doorway now be hard line want not enough to go fetch from hall do have give excuse not even that said doctor well good night said lad closed door between two room for so tired man doctor on closing of door exhibited considerable briskness very quickly quietly took off dress coat shoe shirt buttoning dark gray coat over vest set door ajar switched off light hour for action well realized might strike moment be prepared a far a preparation be possible outside there be waiting geoffrey with rook rifle inside secret passage spurious harry knew calm bland for emergency meanwhile real harry be safe for present none templeton knew of change of room none must reach through chamber occupied intricate subtle passage be likely to be ahead a yet winding be unconjecturable a working hypothesis for must find better have assumed that mr francis plan be in main unaltered harry drugged unconscious be to be taken to plate closet at hour in dead night where sander must be waiting yet conjecture might be utterly at fault in case drugged whisky mixed a now be with innocuous salt must not have effect desired for anything unforeseen here be at least one step untraceable must have sense alert to interpret to best of ability smallest clew came from room opposite mr francis sander be there now firearm be not to be feared here be sum of certainty also from study of mr francis considered probable to verge of certainty harry must be unconscious when death blow be given in dark time may either fly with swallow wing lag with tortoise for watch in man brain be unaccountable mechanism doctor have idea how long have be waiting when heard latch of door open somewhere in passage outside two noiseless step took to own through crack where have left ajar saw long perpendicular chink of light bright seemed near without further audible sound grew gradually fainter with most stealthy precaution opened own door peered out fifteen yard distant moving very slowly down passage be two figure of mr francis valet latter be dressed in ordinary clothes former vividly visible by light of candle servant carried in light garish dressing gown red slipper at moment paused opposite door of room harry usually occupied here held word of inaudible colloquy there be table just outside door fronting top of stair dim lamp on bracket hung above on mr francis put down small bottle what looked like ordinary table napkin two went down stair be time for caution rapidity already a knew luck have favoured in neither have entered harry room after giving ten second law went noiselessly over thick carpet of passage to table opened bottle mr francis have left there unmistakable fume of chloroform greeted nostril stood awhile in unutterable perplexity fresh valuable a evidence be be difficult to form certain conclusion about conceivably chloroform be additional precaution in case harry have not drunk whisky conceivably also metholycine idea have be altogether abandoned in absence of skilled operator at least must easily settle turning into bedroom harry usually occupied switched on electric light templeton have followed instruction about making room look habitable on dressing table stood what be perhaps not work of templeton cut glass bottle be there on tray with glass siphon spilled teaspoonful of spirit into glass tasted salt so much then be certain one of figure have seen go downstairs must return here with chloroform still cudgelling brain over main problem a to why mr francis have gone downstairs at lingered not felt way down to bottom of flight here paused hearing nothing tapped twice at panel opened into secret passage be at once withdrawn jim stepped out come whispered with same rapid stealthiness ascended again crossed landing entered harry bedroom bed stood facing door in angle between window wall doctor drew curtain across window be deep with seat in undress at once said to jim might notice that clothes be not lying about if have light quick off with coat waistcoat shirt trouser boot a naked a mother bore there be nightshirt put on now get into bed lie with face half covered stir make sound till turn up light call to will be behind curtain there be two electric lamp in room one by door other with own switch over bed doctor have lit both a soon a groom be in bed extinguished one by door then crossing room got up behind curtain in window seat from there turned off other when turn up light jim whispered throw off anything may have be placed over face spring up in bed till then be asleep understand yes sir said jim softly at moment with suddenness of long forgotten memory returned doctor guessed why mr francis have gone downstairs glory of guess be so great that must not help speaking have gone for luck said yes sir said jim again there be darkness silence interminable eon passed may be ten minute at end of infinite time came scarcely sound absence of complete silence from door from behind thick curtain doctor must see nothing moment later came gentle sigh of scraped carpet from from infallible sixth sense awakes only in dark knew that one have entered then from closer at hand heard faintest shuffle of movement knew that whoever be in room besides groom be not couple of yard distant after while least vibration sounded from glass in tray a if hand have touched unwittingly again dead stillness succeeded till doctor ear sang with then from bed ear suddenly focused breathing of two person one very short quick other slow steady respiration simultaneously with nostril caught whiff of chloroform again rustle of linen sounded hearing that held breath counted pulse throbbed in own temple twenty time beat on twentieth stroke finger pressed switch of light drew back curtain already jim be sitting up in bed bland impassive in face left hand flung reeking napkin from by bedside crouched white haired figure clad in blue dressing gown close by on floor stood leather case held luck right hand be still stretched over bed though napkin have held be plucked from face be flushed with colour bright blue eye little puckered up in sudden change from darkness to glare of electric light moved slowly from jim to doctor back again word passed thin compressed lip suddenly alertness of face be gone like burst bubble mouth opened drooped eye grew staring sightless left hand only seemed to retain vitality felt gropingly on carpet for luck then with slow supreme effort figure half raised drawing jewel tight to breast folding arm about with finger intertwined in strap carried then collapsed completely rolled over lay face downward on floor for one moment neither of others stirred then recovering doctor stepped down from window seat put on coat trouser jim said come with quickly yes leave there will come back presently have to catch sander now must go without light behaved admirably now follow be dead sir whispered jim think so come in eagerness of pursuit crossed passage without looking to right hand left felt way down many angled stair hall be faintly lit by pallor of moonshine came through skylight without difficulty found baize door leading into servant part here with shuttered window reigned darkness of egypt despairing of finding way doctor lit match to guide to farther end of passage where be plate closet when reached be to find door open none within in direction stood box with forced lid here dozen spoon be scattered on floor here saltcellar rifling have be fairly complete how long do suppose be waiting in dark asked jim anyhow be long enough for sander mr francis to have taken most of plate have thought must do after afterward now where be plate where be sander ca say sir said match have showed disorder of place have burned out doctor still frowning over next step have just lit when from outside there rang out sharp ping of rifle shot be geoffrey said what in god name be happening upstairs again groped way back along basement to door leading into hall close to went up back stair forming servant communication with upper story seeing doctor clicked tongue against teeth be how missed said went way up to mr francis while be going down front stair yes sir said jim passed through into hall draught of cold air met there be longer reason for secret movement doctor turned on electric light front door be open wreath of dense mist streamed in go see if can help mr geoffrey jim said if can find be clear that sander have left house who else must have opened that door must see to left upstairs ran up room door a have left be open on floor still lay what have left there be lying no longer on face sightless eye be turned to ceiling luck be no longer clasped with finger intertwined in strap to breast doctor fought down immense repugnance against touching body instinct of saving life however remote that chance prevailed taking hold of one of hand felt for pulse a touched two of finger fell backward dislocated broken then with swift hissing intake of breath pressed finger on wrist search for pulse be vain chapter xxv mr francis sleep be about quarter past eight when geoffrey left jim in secret passage in accordance with instruction went back to box hedge where have concealed rifle cartridge with skirted wide up short grassy slope led to summerhouse trying door found unlocked stood a have supposed fifteen foot above level of mist that lay round house below be admirably situated for observation of movement manoeuvre might be made for commanded clear view past front of house down to lake while road from stable passed not fifty yard from joining carriage sweep from carriage sweep at right angle ran drive clearly then if jim account of sander visit order to stable covered design working out of must take place before eye summerhouse stood close to background of wood in last summer evie mr francis have once walked mere black blot against blackness of tree geoffrey pulling chair to open door sat commandingly invisible rifle leaned against wall ready to hand be in more than moderate composure that ate sandwich with doctor have provided there be expected long vigil in front of before active share in operation must stand to name first act must be played in great square ship of house lay anchored out in sea of mist what must pas there in next two hour strenuously forbore to conjecture for be business to keep brain cool avoid thought might heat render hand unsteady that short interview with doctor have given confidence that made firm shifting quicksand of fear day have quaked within for man have spoken to with authority masterful decided have stilled shudderings perplexity of last twelve hour have to see to that must not awake again at interval of seemingly incalculable length clock from stable drowsily told hour for slow wheeling of young moon must have believed that time have ceased breath of wind stirred in tree behind shredded opaque level of mist in front death stagnation lay over world sound muffled murmur of sluice from lake broke silence world spun in space sound of invisible outpouring water might have be rustle of passage through interstellar space then spell soothing of stillness laid hold of hour of action be near intolerable fret of anxiety nearly over inside house that dark keen eyed man be not one whom prudent must care to see in opposition on side be geoffrey no longer entertained doubt shadow for matter be lieutenant impassive spurious harry by unwilling mean last summer have mr francis made first of vile attempt by mean perhaps must be last geoffrey must rest assured that must do lay in power of two very cool head business be to see that own part must not be le well done year ago be stroke still resonant half past ten have struck on stable clock since eleven have not yet sounded be earlier than have suspected when there came noise sent heart hammering for moment in throat must not at once localize identify though still obscure muffled have only just decided that must not be very far off before guessed what be direction nature came to together vehicle be being cautiously driven over grass toward house from stable on moment caught sight of be moving at very slow pace more than half drowned in mist must see of be head back of horse head shoulder of man who led box seat rail of vehicle of wagonette type reached gravel walk with crisp crunching sound drew up there then heard unmistakable rattle of brake being put hard on man tying rein in knot looped round whip holder then left not forty yard from where geoffrey sat be swallowed up in fog going toward house curtain be up for second act what have first be thing have passed so quickly silently that must almost have believed that imagination have played trick be not for sight of truncated horse carriage testified to reality there without doubt be carriage from stable of jim have told must not have sworn to identity of man who led in uncertain light picked up rifle laid across knee prepared again to wait soon afterward eleven struck while stroke be still vibrating came second interruption to silent waiting out of mist between wagonette house dimly appeared two head moving slowly toward carriage rising gradually a climbed slope above level mist till be distinct clear a far a shoulder walked about yard apart word low inaudible to watcher passed between arrived at carriage seemed to set something down then with effort hoist into body of vehicle a again raised geoffrey saw that one head sparkled whitely in moonshine well knew to whom venerable lock belonged then there came audible word come back then sander said mr francis wait at top of back stair while go very gently to room to see if be right in case will use chloroform then when call come help to carry down to plate closet there will leave go back to bed afterward drive hard to village leave plate at cottage told of bring doctor back be ready where be ah thank prefer to carry luck luck at last at last raised hand above head grasped case man face be turned upward toward moon geoffrey looking thereon must scarcely stifle exclamation of horror be not man face said to be mad incarnation of satan in minute be silent again inhuman figure have vanished again only section of horse cart appeared above mist for moment geoffrey hesitated unwilling by possible risk to lose ultimate success chance of being heard seen by retreated figure be infinitesimal crept crouchingly down slope to where wagonette stood then opening door lifted out exerting whole strength load two have put there bent double under ponderous weight made way back to summerhouse burden clinked rang a moved there must be doubt what prize be have not long be back at post when muffled rapid footstep again rivetted saw moving dark shape coming with great swiftness up from house a before with rising of ground grew freer of mist till when reached carriage must easily recognise head shoulder of sander somehow if possible without cost of human life must have stopped have already swung small case easily recognisable by watcher on to box be in act of mounting when idea struck geoffrey taking quick careful aim fired at horse just below ear at so short range miss must have be incredible thing with report of rifle head sank out of sight into mist then stood up if move sander fire cried time at even a said word box be already empty man have slipped down with astonishing rapidity behind wagonette when geoffrey next saw dimly through mist be already yard away even while hesitated with cartridge yet in hand be gone waiting only to put in ran down to cart case same beyond doubt a be in mr francis hand ten minute ago have seen sander swing on to box just now before mounting be gone also at that ran down at top of speed dare use after vanished figure once heard crunch of gravel to right turned way already bewildered by blind pursuit in mist once thought heard rustle of bush to left turned there then beyond doubt heard own name called at that stopped who be cried sir jim said imperturbable voice close to ah be harry be lordship safe yes sir quite safe doctor sent out to see if must help before geoffrey must reply sudden wild cry rang out into night broken short by sound of great splash gawd what be cried jim startled for once must wonder if be sander said geoffrey come to lake jim god forgive for trying to rescue devil wonder if can swim like stone sir hope said jim cheerfully roar of sluice be guide to have lost other twenty time before reached lake in dense blinding mist here risen high above head even sound came muffled uncertain be through trampled flower bed swishing of shrub against face that gained edge stood on foaming sluice water be very high noise bewildering to sens yet despite fact that five minute ago geoffrey have be hesitating whether not to shoot at vague runner through fog caring nothing whether killed yet now did not hesitate to run risk in order to save from drowning what have be within ace of being mark for bullet must be here said to jim pull of water must drag against sluice be not going in after vermin mr geoffrey asked jim incredulously geoffrey did not reply kicked off boot threw coat on grass stand by to give hand said plunged out of sight well be damned said jim took up stand close to edge of water gate risk have be willing to run for master have faced without question indeed with certain blitheness of spirit to bear toothache for sander life appeared to bargain demanded consideration even a wondered voice from close to foot called give hand bubbled geoffrey from water have got dived straight on to jim caught hold of geoffrey first by hair from guided grasp to dripping shirt collar then after geoffrey have got foothold on steep bank between dragged nerveless empty handed figure from water laid on grass dead alive be only question said geoffrey get back to house jim bring doctor here know what to do to drowned man jim made obvious call on resolution to stay here with dripping clay at foot be task demanded more courage than have needed to get into harry bed no sir said run back to house get wet thing off will stay here set teeth geoffrey must not deny common sense of indeed have wish to shuffled groped back to house a yet knew nothing except harry be safe for present curiosity be gorged with satisfying assurance hall door found open hall empty lit running upstairs saw door of harry bedroom open went in doctor be there be just covering with sheet have removed from floor on to harry bed turned round a geoffrey entered quick said latter go down to sluice sander lost way in fog fell in fished out alive dead know eye fell on covered shape on bed with awful sudden misgiving for be be room not began doctor turned back sheet for moment then replaced quickly go to room very quietly geoffrey said for harry be asleep next door get wet thing off put on blanket something clothes of mine by sluice say be half hour later that geoffrey heard slow stumbling step on stair barefooted wrapped in blanket went out into passage jim doctor be carrying what have found in ooze of lake into harry room laid on floor by bed be use said doctor must not arouse least sign of vitality cover face let leave stood in silence moment after be done so lie together said in obedience to inscrutable decree of god in just merciful hand leave so three went out leaving two there doctor led way down into hall geoffrey in blanket following jim have brought rest of clothes out from chamber of death stayed in passage dressing for be better there than in room word passed between others till have joined then said doctor none of will be able to go to bed till have pieced together what have happened in last two hour so two hour interrupted geoffrey yes be now only little after twelve be soon after ten harry went to uncle room before going to bed found sleeping sleep now said geoffrey then in whisper tell did sander kill doctor shook head mr francis feel sure be dead when when sander came took luck so imagine from left clasping luck returned to find gone two finger of hand be broken where be luck that think can tell said geoffrey when turn come begin at beginning left jim before dinner in secret passage so in few word doctor told have happened inside house from moment when opened door saw two who now lay upstairs talking in passage down to return from plate closet to find luck torn from mr francis death grip then geoffrey took on tale to completion at end laid hand on groom shoulder with action of friend equal have done talking said here be fellow who did hard thing in night work must no more have borne that man creeping across room to where lay in bed than must have jumped into lake in dark sir said jim when be to be found be lord love then there be silence for while for event be still too awful too

of other young men looked at doctor without more word told story for second time with a direct brevity a be possible word of kind interrupted in harry eye wondering horror deepened grew convinced once

doctor of business of metholycine of communication going on between uncle supposed accomplice geoffrey of scene on pavement of grosvenor square then came for second time evening event of last two hour harry head have sunk on hand eye of others no longer looked at for be not seemly to behold so great amazement of horror grief at word be spoken for long space there be silence while truth bitter
