course depended on how many teeth mammoth have number of boy might be guide david in throe of grinding out weekly letter to father passed tongue round own teeth trying to count by sensory quality of losing count put inky forefinger into mouth instead there seemed to be fourteen in lower jaw thirteen half in upper for half of front tooth have be missing ever since few week ago have fallen out of tree on to face most industrious scrutiny of fatal spot have never resulted in finding in case then have twenty seven half teeth be reasonable to suppose that mammoth therefore unless have fallen out

written mr dutton be not sabbatically employed for nestling between book be yellow backed volume of story by guy de maupassant mr dutton found most entertaining skated on such very thin ice never quite went through mr dutton turned page yes how clever not to go through for there be certainly mud underneath gave faint chuckle of interest dexterously turned chuckle into cough at sound small sigh of relief sense of relaxation went round class for be clear that old dutton dub be more general nomenclature be deep in yellow book when consummation so devoutly wished be arrived at diversion of moderately quiet nature might be indulged in crabtree began be boy of goat like face have be known a nanny till somewhat voluminous appearance of new pair of trouser have caused to be rechristened bag have finished letter to mother with remarkable speed have by writing small conveyed quite sufficient information to on half sheet there be thus other half sheet noiselessly torn off to be framed into munition of aerial warfare folded neatly into form of dart inked point of by dipping into china receptacle at top of desk launched with unerring aim enfilading cross bench where david sat hit just exactly where other half of missing tooth must have be for lip be drawn back tongue slightly protruded in agony of composing suitable letter to father soft wet point struck full spattered ink over lip oh damn said david very softly then paused stricken to stone quite ready to deny that have spoken at eye apprehensively sought mr dutton saw that have not heard being deep in misfortune happened to mademoiselle fifi ill lick afterwards bag said gently better lick now whispered bag faint giggle at bag repartee went round class like sound of breaking ripple penetrated into mr duttons consciousness shifting attitude little without looking up leaned forehead on open hand so that must observe boy through chink of finger david of course be far too old hand to be caught by paltry subterfuge for playing chink be manuvre of enemy have got quite stale through repetition therefore gently laid down on sloping top of locker dart have just dipped again in inkpot to throw back at bag with industrious air turned to letter again twenty minute allotted on sunday afternoon school for writing home to parent be already more than half spent date have copied off neighbour dear papa be a far a first fine careless rapture of composition have carried be really difficult to know what to say to dear papa for event of past week be completely thrown into shadow by one sunlit fact that have got school colour for cricket have made twenty four run in last match a knew perfectly well father cared a little for cricket a did for football indeed david ironically doubted if knew difference between that deplorable fact restricted zone of interest common to really only other event of true importance be that aunt have sent postal order for five shilling must not be politic to tell father about in case of inquiry being made a to what have done with when got home in fortnight time for summer holiday must have eaten long before then for be strawberry time david bit heavily into wooden pen holder in effort to think of something innocuous to say found mouth full of fragment of chewed wood proceeded to masticate rather ostentatiously while still sucked inky lip joy of being that old dub be still playing chink must certainly a surprise ask before long what be eating be stimulating to mind plunged into letter be being taken in museum because be building new first form class room there be dry rot too in wainscotting of old one have be doing cicero week a well a virgil xenophon in greek medea holland in geography james have got to division of decimal be very interesting square root be most difficult because have others dont david gave one fleeting blue eyed glance at mr dutton saw that blessed moment be approaching chink have widened there be doubt that be who be being observed then bent yellow head over letter again chewed fragment of pen holder with renewed vigour be very hot week two other chap be taken to bathe at richmond bathing place day before yesterday by blaize what be eating said mr dutton suddenly david looked up in bland innocent surprise eating sir asked pen holder sir slight titter went round class for david have enviable reputation of drawing pastor master always excepting head by geniality unexpectedness of reply on occasion blandness be little overdone instead of taking back seat mr dutton put down yellow novel on desk back upwards came across room to where david be sitting dart with wet inky point lay there be too late to draw blotting paper over more dramatic dnouement than mere discovery of inky dart might be assessed at fifty linesor perhaps hundred since be sundayhung in air open mouth said mr dutton not yet seeing dart david have good large useful mouth opened very suddenly to extremest extent putting out tongue little might might not have be accident unruly member be undoubtedly covered with splinter of common pen holder nothing else at sir may shut again said david in one breath opening moment have spoken to widest mr duttons eye fell on inky dart what be that said david gave prodigious gulp swallowed a much wood fibre a be convenient that sir said politely paper dart sir inked did make asked dub david face assumed expression of horror sir sir said in tone of wounded innocent indignation suddenly david became conscious that impeccable scene with mr dutton be arousing interest amusement among audience artistic feeling be hurt for hated playing to apathetic bench looked earnestly soulfully at mr dutton missed appreciative giggle nobody appeared to be taking smallest interest in dialogue round be bent head pen industriously scratching then saw what rest of class have already seen standing just outside open window foot noiseless on grass be head austere enormous fierce frowning have picked up from mr duttons desk yellow backed novel that lay there be looking at with portentous face then who made ifi say ifyou did not said mr dutton still unconscious of presence of superior suppose fellow said david in very different tone from in moral indignation have found dramatic utterance mr dutton took up dart inked shirt cuff david did not smile who made began turned saw oh jam said david under breath head left window with yellow book in hand took two step to door entered class room be tall grizzle bearded man lean wiry with cold grey eye to boy appeared of gigantic height be tragedy fate personified terror encompassed scintillated with a radium scintillates be unconsumed scintillated also with splendour be probably omniscient of omnipotence there be doubt whatever have rowed for oxford against cambridge boy wondered that cambridge have dared to put boat on river at year have also got double first in be le impressive be believed to be fabulously wealthy how woman have ever ventured to marry one knew after if have expressed wish way be equally inconceivable that must not be gratified though there be not boy in school who did not dread displeasure above everything else in world there be none who must not have taken infinity of trouble to be sure of winning approbation one of leg be slightly shorter than other gave swaying rocking motion when walked david must imitate admirably must nearly have died of astonishment if have known that more than once head have seen do have laughed in beard with twinkling eye there be twinkle laughter there to day still with yellow volume in hand came stood before skeleton of kangaroo silence fell will perhaps be equalled for breathlessness on day that judgment book be opened probably not before then spoke silence said there be not more silence possible so have to be content with addressed lieutenant who stood abjectly twirling small moustache trying to look tall what be use of trying to look tall beside matterhorn to twirl adolescent moustache when head hand clawed beard be simply silly mr dutton said head when silence have begun to sing in ear of listener by strange mischancei repeat by strange mischancei have found disgusting licentious book on desk how got there how happened to be opened atat page wish to inquire be more than enough for to have found there be willing to believe to tell so publicly mr dutton before boy whom be superintending on sunday afternoon be willing to believe that obscene bird passed over museum dropped from claw stinkingyes sir stinkingcarrion dropped sir while back be turned on very table where see book of book also book of common prayer with leave with leave mr dutton will do thus thus to unholy carrion then ensued slight anticlimax for head though very strong man in hand arm found impossible to do a have designed tear three hundred page across across form generally mr dutton in particular be too stiff with horror to notice so instead head tore off section after section of lightly sewn leaf instead of tearing page laid dismembered carrion on floor stamped on then with indescribable ejaculation of disgust threw mutilated remains into fireplace be excused mr dutton said from rest of lesson will take will do honour to call on immediately after evensong afternoon fierce eye wandered from mr duttons stricken face to david desk where lay inky dart be engaged now see in inquiry said paper dart perceive on blaizes desk will conduct inquiry wish good afternoon waited in tense silence till mr dutton have taken hat left room then turned to david blaize did make dart did throw asked expression of despairing determination have come into david face be conscious also of large ink stain on lip sir said then who made said head also for perceive point be blunted who threw dead silence on david part do know asked head yes sir said david do refuse to tell be not here to be bullied may remind david felt slightly sick have swallowed good deal of chewed pen handle do refuse to tell repeated head yes sir said david then came one of strange calm in middle of cyclone sometimes puzzled boy conjecture perfectly right one be that head in spite of question like did not like sneaking anyhow for moment fierceness faded nodded at david just a one pal might nod to in sympathetic assent quite right boy said then turned to rest of class holding up bedraggled weapon name said miserable bag stood up without speech oh crabtree said awful voice so master crabtree think that calm quiet of sunday afternoon be made to give leisure to forge filthy weapon that paper be given to write home on be designed to be desecrated to foul usage ink to supply filth to will write out with ink have so strangely misused two hundred line of virgil in copper plate hand eat dinner at pig table apart from companion for next week pig table may be mentioned be separate table in dining room without chair where boy detected in swinish habit have to take meal standing for period of sentence poor bag cup be not full yet for head eagle eye fell on david inky mouth infer that ink on blaizes lip be made by weapon said be so then will now beg blaizes pardon a soon a catechism bible class be over will fetch basin of water bathe blaizes mouth with own sponge until be pronounced clean by matron hour for writing home be up sign name direct envelope catechism now catechism class have already be held mark for have be put down in mottled covered book lay on mr duttons desk to suggest hint be not le inconceivable than to propose playing leap frog more imaginative saw that there might be fresh trouble when catechism mark be put down be found that mr dutton have already entered in neat small handwriting idea of venturing to correct head when be in brimstone mood be merely unthinkable david indeed boldest of at moment with something of halo of martyrdom about wondered what must happen if did so quailed before possible result so catechism began again for little went smoothly head of course knew that among small boy at school christian name be held to be effeminate disgraceful thing so omitting first question asked stone head boy who have given name stone knew ferrers also knew what godfather godmother then did for david expressed accurately a bound to believe to do what have promised for commandment went smoothly trouble began when boy have to explain what chiefly learned from commandment meaning that might have possessed effort to attach rational idea to be overshadowed by fact that primarily be lesson must have be acquired by heart in order to recite faultlessly to awe inspiring presence frowned at mr duttons desk duty towards neighbour have already baffled david afternoon for moment having recited eighth commandment turn be passed trouble never coming singly bag be faced with abstruse question first sentence went rightly enough then began to falter to honour obey king be put in authority under asked head bag prayer book comparatively ancient one given at christening by godmother be queen prayer book queen be put in authority under quavered getting confused next said head king be put in authority under said sharpe major in shrill treble to submit to governor teacher spiritual pastor master to order lowly reverently to better toto honour obey king next said head with ominous calm dreary tale of failure went on with portentous figure sitting in chair of innocuous mr dutton consecutive thought became impossible memory took wing fled boy who have got full mark earlier in afternoon found unable when facing grim mood of head to repeat duty towards anything ground already covered be taken again in order to give fresh start now creed presented pitfall stumbling block already normal hour for class have be exceeded from other happier class room boy poured out into field in front of window lay on rug under shade of big still elm with linked arm treble intercourse wandered across sunny grass even when catechism be done there be bible lesson to follow before bible lesson there be certain to be discovery that catechism have already be put down be that as dub fault for leaving rotten french novel on desk worse than anything bible lesson when came be that most inexplicable second voyage of st paul thyatira be laodicea be seven church of asia what exactly did underpinning ship mean be that manuvre executed on other voyage mr dutton always consulted new testament maclear over elusive cruise whereas boy have to shut up useful volume when be questioned seemed scarcely fair even bible lesson have not be arrived at yet be still sticking bogged in quagmire of catechism at last stuck altogether there be more progression possible only remained to hear sentence on condemned head everybody without exception be condemned one have to write out creed commandment duty towards neighbour will myself take same lesson to day week said head if form generally doe not show far better knowledge of catechism will be unable to adopt leniency with have treated shortcoming to day next sunday then will hold class in study significance of be not lost upon anybody study be room of awful import comfort of low red morocco settee interest of photograph of oxford crew on wall in head appeared with side whisker beard must not compensate for uneasy knowledge that in middle drawer of knee hole table at sat be couple of cane be rare thing for head to take bunch of rattling key from pocket be first step to fit one of into centre drawer sometimes with rising voice turned opened drawer if thing still went badly trembling victim be put through farce of choosing cane preferred then advancing palm of hand head paused after prodigious announcement about venue for catechism class next sunday opened mark book mr dutton be scrupulously neat in method there in first column of mark for new week be list headed catechism head scrutinised in silence mark for to day catechism be already entered said stone be head boy of class why did not tell that mr dutton have already heard catechism will tell why wanted to waste time yours so that must not have so long for bible lesson be that sir n said stone what be reason then for not telling stone looked at in sort of stunned despair dont know sir said be indeed black afternoon head probably owing to discovery on mr duttons desk be in sternest most awful mood already five oclock have struck whereas lesson must have be over by half past four outside boy be beginning to gather up rug book be strolling over grass of cricket field to school building from warning bell for tea be invitingly clanging be maddening to think that time might have be saved imposition hour next sunday in dreaded study avoided if only a now turned out stone have have courage to say that mr dutton have already heard catechism courage be not quality blossomed when head be in poor temper boy in class knew that if have be in stone place must have held tongue might easily have be told not to bully head somewhat favourite expression have be witheringly requested to give permission to conduct class in manner preferred chapel be held at six when tea be to come in be difficult of conjecture yet even tea le chapel must be something of relief if only three quarter of hour intervened must be got through without storm before then must have to embark on missionary enterprise if be a dangerous for st paul a be likely to prove for student of must have required bold heart what added sting to be that stone have received hamper from home only day before on to night friend must have gorged sumptuously minute went by with paralysed slowness for if catechism have be trying be infinitely worse head who very likely wanted tea too for sake of discipline education mortified appetite a well a of boy took gloomier gloomier view of attainment collateral ignorance of position of iconium be seen to be moral crime of deepest dye dictionary be beggared of wounding epithet in order adequately to convey enormity of not knowing position a regard lystra if ferrers major have committed parricide under circumstance of unique horror must not have be held up to blacker obloquy than be volleyed on for remark about thessalonica none escaped task of making map with name of principal town track of journey in red ink le fortunate have to produce two map by time next week only thing be possible to be thankful for be that nightmare of hour have not be taken in study else be felt function of key must not have be limited to mere rattling already field be beginning to be dotted over again with group of boy who have come out of tea be waiting for chapel bell to ring how earnestly be possible to desire chapel time to come david have never known before anything even litany a must happen to day psalm for fifteenth evening of month have seventy two verse be better than sulphurous divinity lesson whole class be limp with heat hunger terror then merciful relief of querulous bell came head closed bible lesson have be disgraceful said hope for sakesi say hopethat next sunday will not be repetition of to day be more particularly distressed when think that of like blaize be son of clergyman have therefore greater opportunity of studying sacred history got up huge towering in rustling silk gown immediately a be amazing manner of who never nagged however severe might be mood completely changed eye twinkled a observed depressed class there boy thats over said like good fellow try not to make angry with again hate finding fault may not believe do neither have have tea so when chapel be over will go to housekeeper room ask with compliment to give real good tea stalked out rocking slightly a went instantly oppression of anger being gone spirit of class rose sky high jolly decent of said ferrers gosh im glad didnt take in study say blaze wouldnt have mouth washed with bag sponge itll be fit to poison why do know what doe with sponge loathsome detail invented on spur of moment followed fancy being washed by bag at said stone dont know how to wash yet stone fool why devil couldnt tell head that dub have taken catechism from bag anyhow im glad father isnt clergyman like blaizes do do divinity with in study on sunday afternoon in holiday whack whack there boy oh papa dont hit whack whack oh papa squeaked sharpe major david by dexterous movement got sharpes head in chancery rubbed nose on desk pulled hair hit over biceps more remark about papa asked cheerfully come on out with chapter ii others poured out into sunshine david lingered behind with bag ferrers major began burrowing in locker to find box belonging to two stag beetle be male female a lady absence of long horn testified be hoped that even in confinement might day be confined indeed there be several bet on a to form baby must takewhether must be egg sort of caterpillar minute fully developed stag beetle box in question be small cardboard oblong of cramped dimension really be no more than saloon travelling carriage for lived in david washing basin at night since have be ascertained that side of be too steep slippery to allow escape at other time have run of desk in school hour be allowed quantity of healthy exercise when owner be unoccupied must look after wayward step now since after chapel david must not come back to class room be necessary to put in travelling carriage be pierced with hole so that such air a there might happen to be in david pocket must penetrate to few slip of grass leaf must be sufficient to sustain until be regaled with bit of cake strawberry two from tea be to be provided for first form after chapel lady be lying on back a good a gold waving leg slowly in air having probably fallen down on climbing expedition about roof of locker stag called monarch of glen must not at once be found little careful rummaging disclosed sitting morosely in crevice between grammar geography book say dont believe monarch well said david shouldnt think so living in fuggy desk said bag strolling out of room suddenly david perceived a by special revelation that must kick bag bag have thrown inky dart at though in depression of bible lesson have be forgotten started into prominence again in mind further bag have added insult to injury by saying that desk be fuggy certainly must kick bag just once juicily call square david gingerly took monarch by waist so that pincer nipped empty air put spouse into travelling carriage come on ferrers said on way across to chapel paused moment to pick few leaf from bright squib of root growth on elm just outside class room took ferrers arm dont let go too quick said want to catch bag up just a get to chapel door if be alone might suspect then youll see ill give one kick just one beauty let seem to be talking diabolically diplomatic david managed manuvre well gradually gaining on unsuspecting victim stalking with infinite stealth relish there be question of honour in coming behind thus unaware for bag have launched dart at without provocation have also gone jauntily across to chapel after making ill advised remark about david fuggy desk must bag resent good sound kick be pretty just payment of score david must be perfectly happy to fight afterwards if desired be quite all right david sometimes lounging sometimes hurrying time talking in foolish interested manner to ferrers came up close to rear of enemy just two step outside chapel door be last of boy to go in david have space to swing leg for moment bag be too much astonished to be hurt david passed with slight smile on hopelessly seraphic face went up gangway to seat in choir just opposite organ knelt down covered gratified face with hand loved doing thing neatly to kick bag just once quite correctly like be a good a cutting ball just out of reach of point evening service began psalm canticle hymn to be sung be that terrible fifteenth evening of month page after page of psalm must be gone through only that morning david ferrers have have impassioned argument a to whether old new testament be beastliest ferrers maintaining that there be nothing in new testament must compare with king of israel judah while david argument be strengthened after last hour affirmed that nothing bc must beat missionary journey not if tried with hand a psalm for fifteenth evening to single chant too went on felt that be difficult to feel honestly that there must be anything beastlier especially if have not have tea hoped ferrers must not adduce that a crushing argument for supremacy of old testament on went a antidote to interminableness david began to think of other more pleasant thing there be eleven cap twenty four run in last match to muse upon a resisting topic to tedium of child of israel in especial one gorgeous pull for four have made also must feel on side of leg slight vibration from travelling carriage of monarch wife showed be moving about enjoying be to be hoped fresh elm leaf have nipped off for be in left hand trouser pocket that be confined place to be felt stealthily exteriorly since hand in pocket be forbidden attitude in chapel just below box be two half crown yet unchanged splendour of aunt eleanors gift also in anticipation be thought of tea must succeed chapel in retrospect remembrance of beautiful kick have given bag seventy eighth psalm be corker for if ferrers major brought up must have to admit psalm began to show promise of ending be already possible to count remaining verse then suddenly there be something so delightful in a topical allusion that ferrers must no longer advance a being beastlier than anything in new testament david contribution to music swelled out at once more lustily looked beamed towards bag a sang smote enemy in hinder part put to perpetual shame ferrers caught eye understood bag did not be pity david felt must have seen appositeness of verse did not look up poor old bag perhaps be much hurt david have not meant to hurt much have only wanted to kick neatly squarely peacefully ready to fight afterwards if desired senior boy of first form read lesson at service be turn of stone ferrers to make ass of in school phrase rest of congregation master boy followed reading in bible at rate found place meditated among master there be mr dutton looking peculiarly depressed with whom in spite of general beastliness david felt certain sympathy a be commanded to honour head immediately afterwards on subject of yellow backed novel at organ be seated two miss acland daughter of head one to play other to turn over leaf for sister to pull out stop put in also poked away at pedal occasionally dropped book on key producing most wagnerian effect two female figure with plump back turned to afforded david plenty of rather acid reflection goggles so called for obvious reason addressed a miss mabel be elder wasnt so bad though have woeful tendency to improve console occasion when of boy got into trouble be kind of official dove with olive branch after deluge carrot concerning hair otherwise belonged to miss edith have lately shown altogether too beastly be moral certainty that be who have sneaked to father when last week ferrers have gone out of bound because have seen in richmond so of course have seen told head have be whole school day other master have be in class room must have be carrot ferrers have have toothache be excused afternoon school feeling better have gone to richmond wasnt fair of family to spy for head of course rest of master be natural enemy if be caught by be fortune of war if carrot goggles crew be enemy also ought to be declared enemy instead pretended to be friend with sisterly advice olive branch treacherous smile oh magnificat be soon over again david disapproving eye glanced up at goggles carrot during second lesson time have turned round on organ bench spread bible on knee ostentatiously following lesson a example to school david be afraid be hypocrite having found place continued to meditate on yes there have be first form conference on subject of goggles carrot when ferrers returned that afternoon from short extremely painful interview with head have be settled that goggles carrot must be cut david have at time be opposed to cutting goggles a well a sneaking sister because goggles wasnt bad chap there be nothing against personally small minority have be overruled if carrot have sneaked goggles might sneak next be wiser to have truck at with enemy family though goggles at moment looked innocent enough with low sun shining through stained glass window on to spectacle protuberant eye david felt that after be wiser to err on side of prudence than to be led into course of mistaken kindness be rather difficult only yesterday have congratulated with apparent sincerity on inning of twenty four have offered visit to strawberry bed in garden have be compelled by resolution passed by sixth form conference to decline temptation to say with stony face thank miss mabel cant even be not strictly in accordance with vow ought really to have icily raised cap said nothing whatever be part of career of goggles carrot to make service what be called bright meant there be good deal of singing presupposed in order to ensure proper performance certain amount of choir practice practice be not allowed to take place of other school work be held in le useful hour of play time in compensation member of choir be rewarded with extra half holiday towards end of term if have missed no practice before now goggles have be known when boy have missed say only one practice to falsify register send up name to father a unremitting attendant did not look a if be bad chap on other hand be sister to sister about whom there must be doubt must have sneaked ferrers have seen in richmond immediately on return have be summoned dealt with probably girl be dishonourable so be best to cut goggles too be not a if carrot be only kid who must be taught proper way of school life be quite grown up very likely must never see fifteen again besidesoh nunc dimittis though be long way off being dismissed yet slight alleviation happened here for wind of organ suddenly ran out with wail wheeze be started again by blower in so feverish haste that note shook trembled a pumped soon after in privacy of kneeling david be able to peep into stag beetle travelling carriage observe with delight that monarch be browsing on elm leaf appeared to have excellent appetite be swiftly put away again a rose for hymn instead anthem be announced by head without further particularisation since there be one seemed scarcely credible that one must have be so mean a to couple anthem to unending seventy eighth psalm doubt be reprisal on part of goggles carrot must be duly considered afterwards david mind have be pretty busy with train of thought attention to service from devotional point of view intermittent fragmentary more than once stole glance at bag a general reconnoitring measure appeared from certain gingerliness in bag movement when sat down stood that be not quite comfortable since account have be squared between david hoped have not hurt much kick in main be meant to be symbolical determined that unless bag actually wanted to be nasty must make up directly after chapel david cheerful eager soul hated prolonged nagging warfare since bag have be paid for injudicious behaviour during school that afternoon david be quite ready to proclaim assent to cordial pax naturally if bag did not want pax must have a much bellum a wished for during prayer for parliament in be frankly impossible for proper boy of thirteen to take interest david planned raid two bag be like girl in way couldnt stand creeping thing so if didnt want pax must find black beetle in bed without more ado about matter be easily procured lived in water pipe of disused lavatory by turning on tap horrible half drowned specimen descended wriggling into basin have put two in bag bed once before with splendid effect that bag spent night on floor in dressing gown rather than encounter whereas when have tried same trick on david david have smashed intruder to death with slipper slept soundly amid mutilated corps yes must be about bag path about bedparticularly bedhe must find in pocket boot until abandoned nagging warfare either came to blow have done with made peace like gentleman david have fought bag once before bag did not want more on occasion said so david a matter of fact did not want more face for next few day have be notably more lumpy than bag by virtue of extra ounce of grit have not said so therefore amen sang david fervently looking a if have just come down from italian picture of singing angel forgot that last amen went down instead of remaining on same note sermon time afforded more opportunity for meditation for swiftly decided that must not understand what head be driving at there be most important cricket match at end of week until be over must not be able to smoke at because have made vow that if made more than ten run in last match must not smoke for ten day vow have written out on piece of paper buried in match box below certain tree on whole have be rather clever vow since to begin with did not like smoking at only did because just now be smart thing to do vow of importance must have to tell smoking club about when met on tuesday must certainly be held sacred even by stone who be dashing president of club often smoked cigarette right through without minding though be only incumbent on member to smoke cigarette at meeting have to do without being sick if be sick three time be turned out of club furthermore a additional cleverness in vow have be told by fellow at public school that smoking be bad for eye even when people be quite old a at oxford cambridge never smoked when be in training again if vow be not accepted a reason for abstention must have to resign that really did not mind about for be stupid to put smoking before cricket also secret of smoking club have somehow leaked out now that badge be no longer mystery to who did not belong fun be gone badge be piece of copper wire bent into shape of s c for smoking club when be engaged in sacred operation have to be worn in buttonhole otherwise there be fine of halfpenny helped to fill coffer of club be spent in cigarette only last week bag who did not belong happened to see badge said casually hullo belong to sick club do be annoying because not only implied knowledge of club darkly alluded to rule david have be ready enough on occasion have answered smartly if belonged to s c must be sneak club shot have gone home for bag have sneaked once of course be ever so long ago term before last before bag have become decent chap incident have be suitably buried thought of possible resuscitation made bag extremely civil for several day certain word horror of sin infamy of evil caught david ear at moment attended for little seemed to rather poor stuff why head must sway about shout like be impossible to conjecture gave hint david closely listening intended to reproduce of in dormitory night night shirt made admirable surplice pair of trouser hung over shoulder must make ripping stole must be head a have thought of stone ferrers must be stuffed with pillow to represent goggles carrot with bed a organ david must march whole way down dormitory after matron have gone with head rocking walk cotton wool for beard preceded by small boy carrying poker then suddenly head voice changed became extraordinarily solemn beautiful a did sometimes when read to word be beautiful affected david in puzzling incomprehensible manner in word did word picture dim only half conscious that produced in mind often have that effect on gave sort of homesick yearning ache a if mind be hungry be clear that what be saying moved head in same sort of way voice shook grew lower yet reminding david of something have felt once when woke early heard chirruping of bird before daybreak so prepare to be men said when manhood dawn on let dawn on a on clean dewy grass with bird singing in heart innocence still looking from eye never contemplate evil desire of will fade from run away from if by staying near must yield whatsoever thing be lovely whatsoever thing be of good report think on thing david gave little gulp not only be beautiful word meant something sermon be over be impossible not to remember that in few minute now must be having tea in housekeeper room while wretched dub be doing head honour to wait on have be jam to see head stamp on yellow covered book with luck fragment of must be in grate of museum to morrow david determined to get up early see what be about be in french be bore be worth while even at trouble of looking out heap of word to see what be that have made head in such wax have something to do with thing head told must run away from rum old bird head did say jolly thing sometimes chapter iii tea with head compliment mr lowe provided after chapel be apotheosis of tea head dinner be going on simultaneously most delicious remainder be brought in from for boy ending with ice pudding at entrance be practically untouched though soon there be nothing left to touch have really be worth while to voyage at such peril over unknown sea land if be to be eventful haven when at end ferrers proposed health of iconium toast be drunk with acclamation thereafter be little quiet ragging david have not joined in for when be seized by somebody have said in plethoric tone for god sake dont bend will be sick for fear of untoward result have be left alone bag also be not disposed to active exercise david have taken opportunity to be agreeable according to resolution in chapel say hope didnt hurt bag said see have to kick just once to make square be pax bag looked sideways at david with willow goat like eye before answered oh rather said wasnt anything hardly touched be surprising for david have distinct impression in toe instep that particular kick have be juicy one right oh then said say there one piece of cake left will halve couldnt said bag getting up though must not be bent david thought that cautious attack might defeat one piece of cake strategically accomplished be funny that bag must not have tried too for moment have suspicion be pax then asked oh rather said bag lip right isnt blaze quite clean mean think head only gassed about on spur of moment will swear washed if necessary oh yes said david gosh full im going to preach in dormitory night shirt trouser for stole can remember lot of sermon oh may come asked bag right dont be sarcastic spoil show itll be in cubicle rather not said bag moving away may be goggles carrot sorry stone ferrers have bagged might blow organ let go out with squeak same a did evening oh thanks thatll be ripping said bag beginning to practise squeaking in realistic organ like manner now bag mater be a world knew jewess bag have volunteered that information on first day at school adding loftily that be of tribe of judah if be meant to be impressive have singularly failed in object only consequence be that for first term so bag have be butt of various embarrassing question a to whether be allowed to eat sausage observed other levitical injunction david a matter of fact have not joined in painful catechism holding that wasnt fair to consider fellow responsible for mater have always secretly felt that might account for there being something rather odd about bag for bag have retentive vindictive memory be ever on look out to repay antique score though other people must have forgotten about be therefore not likely that must have overlooked scene so recent a kick after bag have gone david said to that be being too infernally geniala jolly sounding word have just learnedto deceive wary in fact though bag have definitely agreed that must be pax david be subconsciously little suspicious of attitude be confirmed by bag having said that one beautiful kick have hardly touched absolutely must have there be mistaking quality of touch did not dwell on much must bag prove to be bellicose still in spite of treaty felt utmost confidence that must deal with david woke next morning very early with sense of immense interest in thing in general be still only hour of faint early dawn lay quiet little while drawing knee up to chin clasping leg with bare arm in order to multiply consciousness of limb body life generally just behind be open window through fresh breeze of morning came coolly ruffling hair on side varnished pitch pine of wall of cubicle gay with wonderful decoration face be turned to partition close to bed thus earliest object that eye fell on be school eleven cricket cap have won last week hung on nail on nail beside be watch chain father birthday present to on attaining immense age of thirteen on same nail though not conjoined with jewellery mystic badge of smoking club little farther on be gift of father small chromolithographic reproduction of sistine madonna by fellow called raphael whose name somehow appealed to david though picture be rather pi close beside that photograph of carrot exchanged for one of in happier day before sneaked now carrot intelligent feature be turned face to wall david wondered whether ought not to be deposed altogether anyhow have be carrot who have asked for photograph promising hers exchange have come from side then there be photograph of ferrers major unframed tacked to wall one of hughes david great friend who have left year before gone to marchester where david hoped to follow at michaelmas term hughes be altogether godlike david adored then came small fretwork bracket homemade in holiday with sort of petticoat of crimson silk hanging round edge of shelf on be placed small china lamb lying down among amazing flower david assured friend be jolly valuable cuddled knee for little while contemplating precious thing forbearing to turn round look other way because even more agreeable object with exception perhaps of photograph of hughes must meet eye there zest for be to be sharpened by abstention to begin with there be chair last night have made so perfect pulpit even sight of trouser now lying on last night have made so lovely stole must make giggle again at thought of highly successful sermon there also be photograph of two eleven in last week match more precious still snapshot of standing at wicket ferrerss sister have taken have developed have sent to very next day jolly cute of thought david longed to turn round assure by ocular evidence of permanence of thing teasing went on with enumeration of there be cricket bat one right hand batting glove have bought second hand most people did not rise to glove at indeed stone glove be only other one in school for moment idea of staggering humanity by purchasing left hand glove also with aunt eleanors five shilling flashed across probably nobody at helmsworth have ever have two batting glove before fancy being snapshotted with two glove then there be pill box filled with yellow dust from cedar cone in ground have collected labelled cedar sulphur lastly there be washing basin in ever ineffectually trying to climb up slippery steep side be monarch of glen spouse david must resist that longer rolled round in bed got up good morning monarch said politely how then stopped there be two three elm leaf in basin half eaten strawberry otherwise be empty there be monarch there be wife for moment david must not believe felt that must be there that for curious sleepy reason although be not sleepy must not see again again turned over leaf looked underneath strawberry a if monarch have be made little by meal like alice in wonderland there be sign of then searched about cubicle scrutinising varnished wall examining floor searching in blanket in case have strayed there time felt futility of for be convinced in own mind that monarch lady must have climbed glazed ascent of side of washing basin often have watched attempting to do so even gradual slope at base be beyond adhesive power of foot a for precipice of side be hopelessly incapable of surmounting must not get out one must have then sudden suspicion struck went softly barefooted to far end of dormitory where bag slept shook awake have to be accomplished with silent caution since boy be allowed to leave cubicle till dressing bell sounded say bag have taken stag whispered if tell have give up swear wont do anything to bag sat up in bed yawned heavily to give time to think do really think must touch filthy crawler asked doesnt matter what think said david want to know if did bag be considerably astounded by david having so instantly suspected considering that have agreed to pax yesterday evening well then didnt said so thats flat where did put last night in basin said david suddenly bag saw stout figure of matron in ante room just outside dormitory while david facing towards must not see if must detain david in talk here for minute be more than likely that must hear voice find out of cubicle in case must certainly report to head have not forgotten about incident a went into chapel last night temptation be too strong laughed silently into bed clothes what be laughing at said david raising voice whats blooming joke bag did not answer david repeated question at bag saw that matron have heard talking be advancing in felt slipper up dormitory be already past david cubicle retreat be cut off sank back gently into bed cave whispered there glanders coming stag beetle can fly fancy not knowing that closed eye sank apparently into refreshing sleep david turned round glanders be coming straight up dormitory have already seen since there be hope of concealment went out to meet fate out of cubicle before dressing bell said glanders bleakly will report master blaize not first time david got back into bed again in very different mood from in have awoke hour ago week be beginning just about a badly a must sight of cricket cap batting glove failed to console in least bring back sense of happy awaking have two map of second missionary journey to make have to stop in between twelve one when must have be practising at net to learn catechism monarch wife have vanished be to be reported for being out of cubicle before dressing bell sounded be serious breach of school discipline glanders might have gone further when so feelingly reminded that must not be first time for must not be second on last occasion head have told precisely what must happen if occurred again colour of new cricket cap have faded glove looked ridiculous washing basin be like house of one lately dead felt furious exasperated against fate be bitter to be reminded by bag stag beetle must fly in general way supposed have known too have not occurred to that monarch wife must dream of such thing then there be good fine caning to look forward to hurt hideously at time couldnt hold bat day afterwards because hand be so sore there be awful legend too in school that head have once broken fellow finger who knew that must not repeat savage feat to day first one hand then other same bruised smarting hand again just in same place blood blister rising there dressing bell sounded be necessary to get up be just sort of morning too that made fellow wild with mysterious delight if thing be going well when thing be black seemed added insult that sunlight sky be in such excellent spirit there be cricket professional in field outside whistling a put up net for practice there must be practice for david to day instead from twelve to one must be making map staring at catechism hand must be tender bruised lumpy there be stag to cater for went down to bath feeling utterly wretched dispirited with completeness of emotion that only child know who be unable to look beyond present immediate future happiness misery of posse entirely other boy be splashing about throwing sponge at other be hailed with derisive taunt indicating general good spirit friendliness hullo here blaze what reported again blaize dont bully sir other hand sir whack whack say blaze hows monarch flown away bag say dirty vermin anyhow so whats odds come practise at net at half past twelve with ferrers david chucked sponge into bath kicked off slipper cant catechism to learn thanks to stone oh yes so have expect wouldnt be able to hold bat never mind buck up same in hundred year besides hughes be caned two morning running last year didnt blub even at second helping goat like bag entered at moment say rough luck said to david warned a soon a saw glanders found monarch yet be rather too much david felt suddenly sure that bag be at bottom of misfortune already goaded by high spirited sympathy turned on havent shouted im jolly well going to search cubicle believe stole look here chap believe bag took monarch believe saw glanders coming when be talking to didnt warn took brown head out of towel in have be rubbing why what evidence asked unless youre too blooming omniscient to want evidence said bag because youre sneak because jolly well hurt last night said hadnt to put off scent said david with sudden inspiration why youve got bruise a big a football cried pointing to injured part of bag anatomy yet said didnt hurt must have hurt rot to say didnt said be pax in order to put off look out bosh thats not evidence said ferrers whose father be kc be much looked up to on point of school law thats only blooming guess well must be evidence if found monarch in beastly cubicle said david perhaps youd say that stag can fly that monarch have only flown there be sarcasm of deepest dye produced due effect on boy who in various stage of undress surrounded two except stone who never must understand what sarcasm meant oh rot blaze said at rate monarch may have flown to cubicle im not going to have search turn everything upside down for sake of sickly stag beetle man of law considered point dont see why shouldnt make challenge out of blaze said disregarding obtuse stone if youre so certain of can challenge bag to allow to search cubicle if dont find monarch there give three cut of hardest with racquet handle pax immediately afterwards david be standing in bath slipping plumped down into heaving out solid water sorry fellow said to who be wettest right then challenge bag have moved away in general stampede caused by david plunge on instant with fresh suspicion teeming in head david jumped out got between door of big bath room say bag havent have bath said be going back without arent going to have bath not feeling dirty anyhow challenge do accept bag took off dressing gown oh thought be going back to dormitory to put in cubicle again did said just happens to be bath there by door well do accept cried david executing sort of indian war dance round said bag dont want to give three with racquet handle a made up last night dont want turning everything upside down in cubicle ferrers put on dressing gown with solemnity of judge assuming black cap then simply prof plaintiff case if wont have cubicle searched said rot about not wanting to whack blaze because be pax last night he challenged isnt pax longer state of war ferrers be in element seemed to court generally even a to that never at old bailey have net be woven in such impenetrable fashion round most palpable criminal bag too felt that net really enmeshed be of very different sort from what appeared to be certainly be in hole not hole one thought be in majesty of law proceeded if dont accept challenge said ferrers prof be guilty plaintiff continued to dance ill let give six cut if dont find monarch in cubicle shouted must be guilty if refuse six mustnt ferrers ferrers tore sock in trying to put on to wet foot not for cert said bag be beastly cunning may be running up to higher figure then ill let have twelve cut said david feeling absolutely sure about if may search cubicle not find monarch oh search dressing gown too added quickly conjecturing perfectly demoniacal piece of cunning on part of bag bag stepped out of bath with dignity feeling there be escape then accept blaze challenge of three cut said just to show didnt want to run up if did must take twelve done said david ill go search at once there quarter of hour before school may a well search dressing gown first not there oh blow what will say if glanders find in cubicle again know bag be in bath room want liniment if glanders doesnt think that likely can come look at now bag dilemma net in be really involved be have awake for two hour last night in savage anger with david whom in secret boyish fashion adored who have be so beastly to open vengeance be out of question because if came to fight david be more than match thus revenge for infernal kick must be done stealthily plan after plan suggested to none be suitable until thought of very simple one of taking monarch wife a knew quite well lived in david washing basin at night be accomplished very easily without disturbing owner few hour later be awakened by david who have conceived revolting suspicion that bag have done precisely what have done then at same moment almost while be hot with indignation at being justly accused have seen matron at far end of dormitory must not resist temptation to get david into further trouble too have be successfully accomplished david must certainly be caned after morning school then bag began to regret success affection for david whom one must help liking even when be being beastly sense of own meanness pointed finger of scorn at having ensured david caning wished have not at rate taken beloved stag beetle a well so lingering behind till rest of dormitory have gone to bath room induced monarch wife who be scratching about in soap tin to crawl on to sponge a passed david cubicle have shaken off on to bed then have come bath room complication have be forced eventually by ferrerss resistless legal acumen to accept challenge must have to whack david for one might search cubicle till doomsday never find stag beetle there one of cut must be unjust have taken stag beetle david be perfectly right fact of having put back did not ease troubled conscience david rushed upstairs again to dormitory with clatter publicity went straight to bag cubicle began violent intimate search searched in pocket examined lower tray of soap dish peered behind picture ransacked receptacle usually called synagogue box where bag kept family letter such like nowhere be there faintest trace of monarch to be seen operation glanders observedand david observed that be observing themwith bleak stony eye just a be very busy approached do want to be reported twice master blaize asked oh certainly if like said david crabtree asked to get liniment why cant master crabtree get then asked glanders why doe want liniment oh dont be tedious said david cant get because hasnt got clothes on be afraid of shocking want because have got bruise can see if arent afraid of being shocked anything else can tell muffled laughter sounded from various direction a glanders sniffed be congenital way of acknowledging legality of doubtful proceeding david finished search turning over pillow of bag bed without further hindrance there be monarch to be found have to go back to bath room to report that must find liniment have lost challenge be depressing because beloved monarch be still missing also wife hope of race because loss of challenge meant three nasty cut from bag racquet handle head be going to let fly at first there be missionary map to be made whole blackness of dreadful monday morning dissipated for moment by certainty that must find monarch overcast sky again on way back passed cubicle pausing to throw sponge towel down eye fell on bed there on blanket be two black blot of familiar shape david gave great sigh oh monarch missus said affectionately little devil travelling carriage of royalty be to hand in moment black pair be safe again how have got on to blanket did not pause to think three cut due to be jolly cheap at price made couple of leap down stair to bath room say ive lost challenge bag said ive found monarch be on blanket so be andi say im sorry suspected whenll take cut bag inconvenient conscience affection gave nasty prod at if david have only not said be sorry suspected must not have felt so beastly on other hand be dangerous to try to stifle internal beastliness by magnanimity since might lead to fresh suspicion on david part magnanimity salted with sarcasm might serve turn oh dont want to whack said a say be sorry a if must have touched filthy stag clip wing take to marchester next half see if hughes be proud of pal who keep vermin david stared in blank surprise to forgo pleasure of chastisement be not in spirit of shylock oh well thanks awfully said if dont want to take cut im sure dont mind not getting why dont bag be struggling into shirt speech be for moment extinguished simply because challenge be too silly for word said a head emerged repetition of silly reason did exactly that bag desired must not happen suspicion vague unformulated a yet again sprang up in david mind such magnanimity be simply childish think ill take cut then crabtree said to mark complete severance of friendly relation roused bag rejection of spurious highly superior motif quite stifled prod of inconvenient conscience right then will said gosh ill let into ill put beef into blaize ive got racquet handle thatll do nicely bet break youll want liniment afterwards ten minute bell sounded at moment boy ran upstairs again to finish dressing say prayer for last five minute of ten be bound to be on knee at bedside while glanders patrolled dormitory with care discreet peeping through finger be possible to get through neglected dressing during devotional five minute david who be good deal behindhand buttoned collar put on tie laced one boot without being detected mr dutton be in unusually docile mood during hour from seven to eight wanted little penetration on part of pupil when remembered visit have done head honour to pay last night to guess cause of david felt chagrin at fact that have be detained in bath room have not be able to take dismembered yellow back from grate to find out what made head so waxy there be doubt that be head who have made mr dutton so mild indeed have often be debated question a to be really worst caning proper jaw from head for hardiest be reduced to unwilling tear by head tongue when really chose to apply so convincing dismal picture must paint of boy satanic iniquity inevitable ruin that such course fashioned for in world next be point of honour not to cry at application of cane after be twelve kid might cry not elderly person cane might break hand make set teeth be not allowable to let break spirit jaw broke spirit into smithereens doubt that disintegrating process have happened to old dub anything in way of construing be sufficient morning grammatical question be mere child play be already ten minute to eight school sergeant whiskered veteran who visited different class room during early school with order from head summons for boy who have be reported have already passed museum door without coming in david heart rose if glanders have reported be quite certain that sergeant must have conveyed summons that be to go to head after chapel to class room yet have passed without delivering from time to time remission happened glanders occasionally forgot to report even when have promised sometimes even in act of complaining stoniness of bosom relented then with sinking of heart proportionally greater owing to premature uplifting there be tap on door sergeant entered saluting beg pardon sir said to mr dutton handing small slip of blue paper forgot a went by mr dutton glanced at blaize to go to head after chapel announced david thought detected faint smile showing malicious glee of fellow sufferer chapel usually tedious be not long enough that morning psalm lesson hymn prayer passed in flash ferrers a went out administered spurious consolation if stick hand in cold water said itll numb bit remember last winter held mine in snow for five minute didnt sting nearly so much there such sight of snow about in july isnt there said david bitterly ferrers shrugged shoulder right then said feeling slightly hurt got three cut from bag too havent bet bag lay on minute afterwards be in awful presence even a entered heard jingle of key when advanced to table where occupant be looking vexed saw that fatal middle drawer be already open that must have be opened for other reason did not strike supposed that case be already judged for moment head seemed unaware of presence continued to read letter apparently annoyed pish said at length in dreadful voice looking up a tore in fragment saw david ah blaize said sent for youyes want to answer question two looked a unpromising a possible drawer be already open seemed that jaw be coming first why couldnt cane have done with thought dejected david head rapped table sharply question one said be case that daughter have incurred wrath of first form david head reeled at thickness of trouble yes sir said good question two need not answer if sense of honour forbid why have deserved thiser disgrace why do join in inflicting david drew long breath there be sense of honour must be violated in telling head to do so be like taking high header into unknown water when required courage be possessed of to go off low board into four foot of familiar swimming bath please sir quite obvious that car have begun with rush rush have carried too far carrot said head suggestively lord how did know thought david please sir felt sure that miss edith have got ferrers into row because saw in richmond week before last said david andand sneaked to suggested head yes sir told dare say miss edith saw said head havent slightest idea whether actually did not saw miss edith have nothing to do with kindly tell friend so ill tell said david theyll be awfully glad sir why asked head again david dived off high header board into dark water because nobody wanted to think be sneak sir said always thought be good chapyoung lady mean sir head nodded for next half minute busied with report have come in morning think there be something else wanted to see about said yes here be be reported for being in crabtrees cubicle before dressing bell morning explanation sir said david knew be against rule yes sir head drew large dreaded book towards contained list of boy name against number of time have be reported for misconduct during current term next name of blaize be that of bellingham glancing at hastily credited david with bellingham stainless record see have not be reported before term said moment have spoken saw mistake on line below be david record showing that lie have be reported twice waited for david answer have not considered what must do if david accepted statement believed wanted to prove to that david must not joyful possibility whirled through david mind be conceivable that previous report against have not be entered then not really knowing why spoke sir have be reported before said for same offence yes sir once before asked head feeling that test stood firm sir twice said david squeezing hand together head closed book put in middle drawer closed that also thank for telling truth said now want a personal favour to make effort to keep school rule be made for purpose good bye boy ah be late for breakfast so come have breakfast with if be late for school afterwards explain to mr dutton david be joyfully late for school not only explained briefly then categorically afterwards to form in interval at half past ten sausage said poached egg bacon sloshy buttered toast strawberry gosh head doe well have breakfast like day expect didnt tuck in oh thing carrot didnt sneak at be head who saw ferrers in richmond told so dont believe said ferrers who have misogynistic tendency well then youve got to head never lie so carrot be right head pal cant think why didnt whack though said ferrers perhaps knew be going to catch from bag he be binding racquet handle too to get firm grip be slightly malicious on ferrerss part what with special tea last night special breakfast morning recovery of monarch remission of caning thought david little above even information about bag did not appear to depress cocked yellow head on one side like meditative canary half shut eye a if focussing something blow if hadnt forgotten about bag said ferrers there something rummy about bag show why did bag not want to take up challenge if knew monarch wasnt in cubicle why didnt take dozen cut at rot of to say that didnt care about whacking decent chap mouth must water to lick fellow who have accused of stealing two boy have wandered away in half hour interval between school to distant corner of field below chestnut tree there david lay down flat ferrers flicked fallen flower at face stopped at see caught juicy hack too last night continued david he revengeful beast in general way perhaps day of atonement something suggested ferrers david sat up cant be said else hed want to make atone hallo here come across field racquet handle suddenly gave shrill whistle through broken front tooth say will back up say asked ive thought of something ripping ferrers peered short sightedly across field did not often wear spectacle since be supposed to give resemblance to goggles be rise of intolerable comment so seldom graced freckled nose yes here come said ill back up what be oh youll see said david bag made truculent approach swinging racquet handle have done must humanly be done in easing of conscience since have be literally unable to get out of rle of executioner with honour have wisely determined to dwell on bright side of hit a hard a must in same place ill lick now if like said brightly david turned cold face on thanks awfully said settled for twelve see good deal may happen before twelve ferrers be just talking over wasnt pity that ferrers minor slept so badly last night remark seemed slightly to disconcert bag carried off with fair success point asked bag politely slapping leg gently with racquet handle oh thought might see said david point be that didnt go to sleep beforewhen be ferrers heard clock strike one said ferrers at venture shade of relief crossed bag face machiavellian david noticed still dont see point said bag david pursued ripping plan youve mixed up goat said to ferrers minor told awoke heard clock strike one lay awake till dressing bell bang wide awake likelike toothache sorry of course be said ferrers backing fellow conspirator up bag shrugged shoulder began to walk away afraid cant see point said so ill whack at twelve blaze david lay down again with complete unconcern right oh said of course if youve got anything to say about might be wise to say not letwell somebody else say for ferrers minor hasnt told anybody yet except major not yet know added bag appeared to take notice of unless strolled away rather more deliberately than before then david turned quickly to ferrers whispered in ear go find minor said dont let bag talk to im going to stop here shouldnt wonder if bag came back what on earth be about asked ferrers david eye sparkled with devilish intrigue cant explain now said just go stick on to minor dont let bag question there something up ferrers obeyed bidding of master mind by rapid flank march got in front of bag who called to took notice presently david saw lead off minor like policeman at habitually seraphic face grew shade more angelic one who did not know must have be surprised that wing did not sprout from low slim shoulder machiavellian device have practised have come to like inspiration if bag conscience be clear must not mind scrap for wakefulness of young ferrers david be morally immorally sure that bag conscience be not immaculate have have something to do with disappearance of stag beetle though exactly what david have idea then gave little cackle of delight for saw that bag have stopped in indolent stroll with racquet handle then that turned be coming back towards david lay down at full length whistled in absent manner without looking became aware that bag be standing close to say blaze want to tell something said that conscious stricken one at length david sat up with air of great surprise hallo that said tell away then if wont take too long well private must swear not to tell one david shook head oh couldnt do that said why not david turned on indulgent glance oh expect know said partly because know already what youre going to tell partly because youre swindling stealing liar sooner other chap know that better bag made swinging blow in air with racquet handle well then dont care said ill give three of jolliest cut ever have at twelve will after ferrers minor have told story asked david well tried to get out of said unhappy bag there be awful bright moon last night crabtree said david thoughtfully about what want to tell might make difference if told voluntarily bag capitulated well then took beastly stag beetle put back on bed when have gone to bath oh be way be said david pretty cute then see be cuter ferrers minor didnt lie awake minute a far a know saw have bad conscience cant think why didnt accept challenge straight off why didnt looked at dejected bag funny boyish little soul suddenly grew perceptive whats row bag asked bag sat down on grass by feel perfectly beastly said youre always horrid to andand like so awfully kicked fit to kill last night just because threw ink dart at only did for lark just because felt fit after have taken stag be sorry tried to get out of challenge though knew must lose david ceased to sit in seat of scornful whatever bag have done really have done good deal have blurted out that liked so awfully be time to inquire whether have seen glanders not warned to examine further into bally show what bag have said in sincerity took rank over anything bag might have done with wiped whole affair clean off mind held out rather grubby hand bet get on rippingly after said hopefully chapter iv david be swaggering aboutneither more lessin new school blazer eleven cap on morning of cricket match against eagle school be great event of entire year a matter of fact swagger be hollow show though be completely conscious of being object of envy admiration in eye of small boy indeed of anybody who be not in eleven did not envy in smallest degree to begin with have that in later life be called attack of nerve though at present came under general comprehensive head of feeling beastly made mouth dry hand damp inside empty not hungry to make worse father have announced intention of coming down to see match might not sound tragical to david be cause of awful apprehension require true sympathy with sensibility attaching to age of thirteen fully to appreciate to begin with father be archdeacon since wore shovel hat odd black wrinkled gaiter even when a during last summer holiday climbed hill in lake district with small edition of poem of wordsworth in pocket from read aloud at frequent halting place david have not allowed to hope that on present inauspicious occasion must be dressed like other person so escape biting criticism that curious garment must be sure to call forth there be much worse than for father be going to stay with head over sunday be to preach in school chapel in evening have occurred once before thought of repetition of made david feel cold over for father among many other infelicitous remark in course of infliction have lasted over hour a timed by indignant holder of surreptitious watch have alluded to chapel service there a central happiness of school life david have barely yet lived down fatal phrase everything connected with chapel have be rechristened chapel bell have be called central happiness bell be time for central happiness one be late for central happiness school have be addressed a lad in springtime of hope promise be most deplorable affair might easily in coming trial give birth to more of degrading expression david felt to be personal disgrace be not even father dress possible behaviour in pulpit david dreaded most be fear that must again a have expressed before take part in school life on lamentable occasion have have dinner with boy not sitting at master table must have be bad enough side by side with david at table of sixth form a ill luck have there be provided for dinner day beefsteak pudding otherwise known a resurrection bolly since be firmly though mistakenly believed that be composed of scrap left on plate during last week tradition be beyond question of argument conjecture be founded on solid proof since ferrers have distinctly recognised one day in portion of resurrection bolly piece of meat have intentionally left on plate four day previously consequently however hungry might be be point of etiquette never to eat mouthful of resurrection bolly david misguided parent have not only eaten like oliver twist have asked for more unlike have obtained eaten a well with praise unction of course must not be expected to know that have be eating scavenged remains so much justice be done have remarked on excellence of whereas be popularly supposed to stink clearly then be sort of food blaize be regaled on at home in holiday witheringly sarcastic picture be drawn of blaizes pater in gaiter collecting scrap from dustbin in shovel hat gleefully taking to kitchen miserable foreboding well founded on bitter experience be interrupted by arrival of team from eagle school home team took visitor off to dormitory to put on flannel fell to david lot to be host to boy called ward of trying deliberation in matter of dress who parted hair four time before arrived at desired result looked with marked abstention from comment at decoration in david cubicle consequently when got down to field again rest of two eleven be practising at net grass be dotted over with group of boy whose parent have misguidedly determined to visit son while happier class unhampered with danger responsibility attaching to relation be comfortably dispersed on rug in shade of elm david cast anxious glance round to see if own responsibility have yet arrived when eye fell on figure at net appalling truth burst upon there be possibility of mistake mingled with crowd at net on other side of field be figure in gaiter shovel hat just taking off coat betrayingan added horrora brown flannel shirt held up cricket ball to eye moment in manner of fifty year ago taking short stodgy run delivered hat fell off ball be so wide that went not even into net for be intended into next adjoining david companion saw for matter david felt that europe saw laughed lightly say look at funny old buffer in flannel shirt said bowled into wrong net wonder why wear such rummy clothes david felt heart sink into toe of cricket boot leak out there be help for father be perfectly certain to kiss when joined fellow at net truth might a well come out now oh thats pater said be said ward politely with faint suppressed smile expect heshes awfully clever isnt guvnor played cricket for england one year made fifty just then david be beyond reach of human comfort at other time must have be glorious thing to be walking with son of man who have made fifty for england just now such glory be in total eclipse there fifty yard away be own father putting shovel hat on again wore gaiter flannel shirt bowled into wrong net must preach to morrow perhaps again eat twice of resurrection bolly certain innate loyalty made stand up for parody of parent oh father doesnt know thing about cricket said he frightfully clever writes book aboutdavid must not remember what be abouthe writes book be supposed to be jolly good took double first at oxford too archdeacon have seen son to david great relief did not bowl more came towards there be bad moment to follow for kissed in sight of whole school at ward looked delicately away also have turned up sleeve of brown flannel shirt a if brown flannel be not bad enough revealed fact that below wore long sleeved jaeger vest how hopelessly impossible that be word fail to convey nobody ever wore vest in summer have coat waistcoat shirt then be be fuggy to wear vest in summer unless have cold everybody must see that have fuggy father oh idiocy of attempting to bowl be pure swank to try for at home never joined in childrens game here deplorable habit of joining in life of place asserted same habit made when at seaside talk knowingly to bewildered fisherman before whom soon exposed ignorance by mistaking mackerel for herring when in switzerland in summer holiday to walk about milder slope of alp with climber rope about shoulder piece of edelweiss stuck into shovel hat if must only stick to thing at be frightfully clever not go careering about in amateur excursion presently field be cleared for match home side won toss poor david who be going in fifth wicket endured torture of lost father sat next on bench in front of pavilion still with coat off continued to enter into life of place by pouring forth torrent of most dreadful conversation there be crowd of boy sitting standing close round one must hear exactly what be being said one david made doubt be saving up for exact reproduction afterwards virgil said wrote to that be reading story of dido infandum regina jubesbut must attend to cricket mustnt have there fine hit well played sir well played indeed fine hit in question be accomplished by stone to one who knew rudiment be perfectly plain that intended to drive ball mishitting have snicked off edge of bat through slip where must have be caught instead of went to boundary four fine four said archdeacon enthusiastically ah butter finger wicket keeper must have fielded that be only being thrown in to bowler said david ah if wicket keeper have fielded might have stumped batsman said father knowingly suddenly pleasantly recalling fragment of cricket lore long since forgotten batsman be yard out of thethe popping crease quite without warning small boy standing close behind where sat burst into bubble of irrepressible giggling walked rapidly away cramming handkerchief into mouth otherwise just close round be dead silence attention david looked in impotent exasperation at row of rapt face slightly quivering mouth knowing that priceless conversation be being carefully stored up be aware that father be being gloriously funny that if have be anybody el father who be enunciating view must have listened with internal quivering like stephen must have found compelled to move away from politeness agitated nervous waiting for inning must see nothing funny about wearily explained that must not be stumped off hit to boundary that be given four run without running for father thought arguable point argued two wicket fell in rapid succession after david began putting on pad aunt eleanors five shilling have be spent in left hand glove even at dark anxious moment afforded gleam of consolation donning of protective article awoke further criticism why be putting thing on boy asked archdeacon shouldnt be afraid of knock two why never thought anything of shooter on shin when be lad glove surely cant bat in glove firm fixed smile illuminated face of round david have rubbed second glove in so to speak rather profusely during last week school generally have heard little too much about david be hearing little too much about now shooter on shin how must shooter hit shin blaze pater be talking through hat very odd hat oh one wear pad glove if theyve got said david rather viciously well well suppose be rather too spartan for day said father ah well blocked well blocked sir thing be going badly for home side four wicket have fallen for thirty david be feeling colder clammier moment be far most important match of year knew quite well that largely lay on to stem tide of disaster knew too even more keenly that did not like look of one of bowler in very least wicket be fiery be bumping in most nerve shattering manner be primarily bowler owing to twenty five run have made last week be put in fifth wicket instead of being reserved for tail when sting being taken out of bowling must have be quite likely to make run morning sting have not at be taken out of bowling be still detestably steady saw in agonised period of waiting for next wicket to fall that ought to play careful game wait for opportunity of scoring instead of running risk on other hand with nerve in condition felt that nothing must give confidence except one two proper slogs with duly accomplished thought must wipe off paralysing effect of father presence conversation then came shout of hows from field stone be out caught at wicket there be three more ball in over to be delivered not by bumping terror by slow bowler a david walked out to pitch abandoned prudence determined to hit out if possible at once so get confidence needed looked carefully round field stood to receive first ball if have be able to choose must have selected other ball than that be half volley clear of off stump very ball to smite at did so in very moment of hitting heard that have mistimed somehow other got right underneath soared soared almost straight up in air a ran knew feverish clapping of one pair of hand father voice shouting well hit well hit david then ball be easily caught by cover point david be sure that never till end of life must be able to get over what have happened be out first ball off simple half volley in match of year everybody from jessop downwards must know must despise be boy whose father have made fifty for england who have caught be falsely said that serious trouble of life only begin when manhood be reached there be never anything so grotesquely untrue when manhood be reached on contrary apparently irremediable nature of most event almost cease man though bitterly disappointed in one direction have power of seeing that there be other direction know also though be acutely unhappy at moment misery will be alleviated not only by own effort by mere passage of time to boy whose keenness enthusiasm promise well for future such alleviation be possible have knowledge of healing power of time in crucial year realisation that other opportunity will come misery like happiness be exclusive of other consideration moment to david be completely horrible be out on monumental occasion without scoring while hopeless father though with sarcastic intention have shouted well hit david there be added sting in simple phrase now boy in school must know what christian name be for christian name at helmsworth be hidden secret if liked boy very much might tell what christian name be to have publicly shouted out so that one knew be quite horrible a walked back to pavilion world contained more for than that be out first ball that name be david sort of story from book of king most unfortunately be being read just now at morning chapel must be treasured up against must ask after jesse a likely a not stag beetle must be known a bathsheba uriah inning of home side proceeded disastrously whole team be out before lunch for seventy two eagle made twenty before interval without loss of wicket david at present have not be put on to bowl be fielding deep near where archdeacon be sitting talking to goggles carrot who be apparently instructing about disposition of field while archdeacon in manly way deplored fact that wicket keeper wore glove pad also thought that boundary be effeminate institution in day everything have to be run out jolly lot of running have to do thought david with optimistic hospitality helmsworth hoped that lunch must worry batsman though helmsworth howling apparently did not be assiduous in filling visitor plate glass david acquaintance of morning who have made fifteen out of twenty run already scored proved a distinguished at table a be at wicket ate lobster salad in perfectly incredible quantity during last fortnight friendship have prospered a david have thought probable between bag bag who did not so to speak know bat from ball so be not called upon to defend honour of helmsworth have wise thought that day have be of group have listened retentively to archdeacon preposterous conversation have seen david inglorious fruitless inning then came wise thought must be jolly difficult to play cricket if pater be making as of directly after lunch bag proceeded to tempt pater away from field got hold of key of chapel listened with sycophantic interest to legend about saint in window managed to inveigle into long stroll round ground there be something heroic about for though bag must not play cricket wanted to watch in especial to watch david for when be nice be in bag unspoken phrase awfully fetching chap have that one boy admires in be quick ready of laughter be in eleven be attraction be very good looking be in point of fact at portentous moment when be made matter of common knowledge blaizes christian name be david bag must have rather liked if one have proclaimed that own name be jonathan a be only george might a well remain secret now david be bowler of type known a wily in other word bowled ball apparently so slow stupid devoid of merit that batsman who did not know quite about felt insulted tried to do impossible thing with so score having risen to thirty without loss of wicket stone said over end blaze david have seen departure of father with bag from field felt enormously better opportunity in new direction have come a took up ball finger tingled with possibility have few practice ball sauntering up to crease pitching slow high without spin then epical matter began took enormous prancing run at top speed delivered ball of surpassing slowness ward who received suspected there be something funny about there wasnt a be clearly off wicket left alone next one be slow straight half volley very properly hit for four so also be next with did likewise then came wile david fourth ball for did not take nearly so long run be considerably faster than other two ward completely mistimed be bowled off last ball of over really fast one caught bowled incomer be better though still bad two wicket be down for thirty eight whereas none have be down for thirty then ensued hour of tip top excitement at end of nine wicket be down for seventy of david have taken seven a be one day match be to be decided on first inning if there be not time for two at rose coloured moment david be probably most popular person in surrey be over again first two ball narrowly missed wicket third be gently spooned into hand promptly dropped fourth be hit for four eagle have won by one wicket with next ball david captured remaining wicket have already lost match for by dropping easiest catch ever seen two exultant batsman eleven miserable fielder went towards pavilion stone with spurious consolation slipped arm into david a walked by jove well bowled blaze said took eight wicket for about thirty jolly good for average oh blast average said david a if didnt know lost match david comment be more in tune with popular verdict than stone be quite certain that helmsworth must have won have not that as blaze david blaze dropped pottiest catch ever seen exactly a in world afterwards achievement in having so nearly won match for by bowling be entirely wiped out by subsequent mistake criticism in fact have nothing to argue about be so clear a tea be in progress in tent bag archdeacon in state of high animation appeared on lurid scene be instructed a to result somebody caught couldnt catch said david father playfully yes just said david wanting earth to open must have caught that ball with eye shut archdeacon found next goggles who have told that morning difference between point short leg have be seeing chapel organ said young friend crabtree tell will play to morrow noble instrument now have returned to see more cricket be blaize family have not helped much to day to morrow will try again david be in choir be not one of in choir other in pulpit tea thank cup of tea after excitement of match must not be amiss david felt a if be being publicly insulted though be really at fault be father friendly adaptability have be markedly interested in cricket when cricket be predominant excitement of being over transferred mind to next engrossing topic be sunday when blaize family must make effort erred in not adapting to age outlook of with whom strove to identify in thinking that be possible for boy in school eleven who have nearly won then quite lost match for side to treat tragedy like lightly feel smallest interest in pulpit choir hour of cricket succeeded tea since be impossible to arrive at finished second inning be tepid performance after eagle eleven have be speeded with cheer in david father joined with waving of curious hat turned to more serious concern again took david off for stroll in ground to have paternal talk to there be comedy in of proceeding for when have put hundred yard so between cricket field archdeacon took out cigarette case must not like to be seen smoking said by of companion think be unobserved now david nearly laughed managed not to a luck must have father have stopped on very spot be sacred to meeting of smoking club head smoke said encouragingly saw too that father brand of cigarette be that preferred by smoking club then ensued serious talk cricket be commended in moderation a amusement only not a end in david school work be gone into gave again information have put into sunday letter few week ago then appeared father have heard boy swear a watched cricket match hoped that thing be rare if not unique occurrence david with barrier of age rising swiftly impregnably between hoped so too transitionally noticing blue of july sky true meaning of latin word caeruleus be debated david cordially agreed that probably meant grey not blue then prayer be touched on a rule be not very fervent performance morning however have said one prayer with extreme earnestness to effect that helmsworth must win cricket match have just lost david after view have be expressed on subject of cricket felt better not to give detail on subject take altogether talk be hardly success david father feeling that boy be not being open with be perfectly true david feeling that father didnt understand anything at about happened to be true also at rate father have conception of what felt like to be thirteen more than david have conception of what felt like to be forty five then came one bright spot head be very well satisfied with said father a turned instantly david eye brightened oh be really asked how awfully ripping even after stopped knowing that father must not understand even after what said david blushed oh be nothing said only be going to say after missing that catch butbut suppose must think that didnt matter though of course he awfully keen for school to win eagle match left father at head house walked back across field to museum class room where be already late for preparation a lock up bell have sounded ten minute before knew quite well that father be fond of be anxious about well being somehow serious talk froze up must not feel thing knew be expected to feel be so odd not knowing that fellow swore when jammed finger in door be suddenly annoyed at anything probably grown up people did not be because be grown up be afraid be distinct relief that jaw be over on top of in way that did not understand be sorry be glad then suddenly swept puzzling regret off mind became alertly absolutely thirteen again walking across field towards came mr dutton who on approach a david extremely observant eye noted put something in coat pocket in interesting furtive manner without doubt have be smoking pipe a came from common room thing school knew be forbidden to master in school precinct for fear of bad example to boy be interesting might lead to something david knowing that fact that have be walking with father neutralised possible penalty for being late for lock up advanced timidly a if thought be detected in breach of rule mr dutton have just come out of meat tea with other master be feeling autocratic called david in peremptory abrupt manner come here blaize said now mr dutton be not at nice young man unpopularity in school be perfectly justified have favourite usually pink pretty little boy whose misdoings treated with leniency while who be not distinguished with regard visited with hundred petty tyranny mastership gave opportunity of exercising also have effective trick of sarcastic speech be unfair weapon to employ to who be not in position to answer back of under charge there be none whom so cordially disliked a david who returned aversion with uncommon heartiness mr dutton be often not quite sure whether david under polite demeanour be not cheeking though need not have have doubt on matter be also aware that imposition set boy did not make in least object of reverence however in small way must make burdensome after lock up blaize said what be doing out only walking about sir said david did know be after lock up david looked guilty shifted from one foot to ye e sir said then will write out two hundred line of fourth neid bring to on monday evening suppose thought that heroic performance to day splendid inning of yours came to end little prematurely perhaps wonderful catch so nearly held entitled to place above school rule be excellent duttonese cutting insulting impossible to answer without risk of further penalty for insolence for moment david face went crimson with anger mr dutton rejoiced in mean heart proceeded to pile up irony have forgotten pipe in pocket smoke of curled thinly up david have not forgotten did fail to see that head be coming up across field towards with swift rocking motion vengeance of singularly pleasant kind suggested to have not dub made so gratuitously offensive must not have dreamed of taking if have even only stopped there might not have done so disgusting dub intoxicated with own eloquence rejoicing to see david writhing under did not stop be grand day for be not proceeded odious man with father to look on call out well played blaizei beg pardon well played david to finish with being late for lock up be fine achievement head be close to now coming up silently on grass behind mr dutton at few yard distance joined in colloquy what be what be inquired mr dutton turned blaize be late for lock up said have just set two hundred line well blaize said head david shook off guilty slouch stood erect confident please sir be walking with father said mr dutton didnt ask to explain a went on about being out first ball missing that catch have only just left father asked head yes sir two minute ago head nodded will remit imposition observed then david suddenly stared at have be secretly glancing at namely whorl of smoke from mr duttons pocket please sir youre burning said anxiously pointing at something be burning in pocket head transferred awful eye to mr dutton sniffed with omniscient nose may go blaize said well mr dutton david scuttled off scored off cad said to still hot with indignation at insult a david have expected there be far worse thing to be faced than sarcasm of mr dutton since conclusion of match david performance heavily handicapped by of father have be subjected to serious debate have be found to be wholly unsatisfactory be true that have captured quantity of eagle wicket at small cost with match in hand literally in hand have let go taking record a whole therefore futile inning being also brought under scrutiny be fair to make unkind allusion to father there be dissentients from general view chief of whom be bag who said hotly that be chouse to rag blaze considering that if hadnt be for eagle must probably have won by eight wicket instead of one for who stood slightest chance of getting out fellow whose father have made fifty for england even weighted a be with salad of many lobster view be that of small minority untrustworthy sort of hush settled down on first form class room a david entered with simulated composure master be in charge during hour of preparation on saturday evening though boy have to sit at desk talking be allowed sometimes sort of patrol master visited occasionally for pleasant surprise head came round knowledge of possibility checked exuberance provided that row be made there be nothing to be feared so there be uncomfortable silence when david entered sarcastic intention of be not lost on for there be mistaking chilliness of reception bag be true greeted with hullo blaze otherwise nothing be said then trouble gently began to accumulate like quiet piling up of thunder cloud with old testament allusion say jesse must have be fine old chap said somebody have such lot of son oh did asked somebody else politely how many bout ten elder one didnt seem to matter much there be dead silence david gathered up within then conversation began again with rustling of leaf of bible to refresh memory suppose jesse be jew oh rather thats why bag be so keen about kid say sausage to morrow isnt bag jesse kid have breakfast bad luck david looked up caught bag mild eye be gleaming with sympathetic martyrdom then attack became more direct say dai mean blazesi hope have good blow out to night david have got certain fighting light in eye bag altogether lacked replied briskly yes thanks said why oh didnt know a there be sausage for breakfast subdued giggle went round david opened lid of desk say mullins remarked to last speaker if dont know youd better find out ill ask about when go up to dormitory right oh said mullins strong in consciousness of number to back lot of chap will tell then ill ask said david two at time if funk heart quaked essence of courage be not that heart must not quake that nobody else must know that doe jesse have younger son a well said somebody else while mullins be thinking about there be one who be ruddy must think be beastly to be ruddy oh yes be awful corker kept sheep dont suppose must keep wicket anything like probably couldnt hold simplest catch expect must spoon up all right old jesse must like that must probably say well played say be name of kid asked voice in tone of intensest interest david have be rummaging in desk in meaningless manner not in order to find anything to have something to do to cover self consciousness when direct question be asked hand closed firmly on tight solid classical dictionary waited for answer think be called david said mullins who have plucked up again after david threat have silenced for time yes david think repeated oh do said david before mullins have time to guard classical dictionary discharged with low trajectory hit violently on nose proceeded to bleed if anybody else want to talk about david thats what hell get chuck up here bag bag gave shriek of exultation a returned dictionary jolly good shot said bang on proboscis though david have followed that excellent maxim of war if in inferior position attack probably must have thought twice have not completely lost temper before attacking for almost everybody bag seemed to have coalesced against be taking on rather large order very suddenness savageness of attack certainly surprised host of enemy for moment gore streaked mullins retired to comfort nose amid dead silence david cause be unpopular one knew eagle match be won except for one be level headed enough to reflect that must have be much more decisively lost without under circumstance though have silenced mullins altogether for mullins certainly must not want to be hurt again david in present mood did not care two straw whether be hurt not knew that must expect disagreeable evening david must have supplied that night excellent concrete example to philosopher who wished to study unstable nature of popularity during exquisite hour when be tying up confusing eagle side with wily bowling there be bound to popularity in one moment by insufficient closing of hand have forfeited bag alone be faithful though shot with classical dictionary have silenced one of tormentor have be great mistake for one who have lost match so palpably a have done must expect to have sarcastic remark made if david have only taken with meekness that justice demanded there must probably soon have be truce to punishment meekness unfortunately be one of christian quality be totally devoid of though summary hard cornered answer to mullins have be successful enough found that even if have be possible to continue making violent assault on everybody have not heart to do so so chilly dispiriting be general attitude towards stone for instance though have congratulated david on bowling directly after match be swayed by popular feeling when on going up to dormitory david offered one of supper biscuit be highly sought after stone said thanks in tone must have chilled salamander one definitely cut there be more direct allusion to son of jesse for portent of mullinss nose be danger signal must have be folly to disregard if spoke be answered in polite monosyllable if joined chattering group chatter ceased until went away again one bag came to sit on bed though made pretence of being particularly communicative cheerful jested with hollow heart next morning be sunday in lieu of early school boy be allowed to spend hour before breakfast at bathing place when david asked stone to come bathe with stone replied that be engaged to mullins be bitter to see ferrers lend mullins towel though after have finished with find mullins fat stupid mullins be regarded not only a injured person anybody must see who looked at face unjustly injured person in middle of david bathe who must appear archdeacon be true that went to far end of bathing place be known a master bathing place where head sometimes swam fiercely about stout apparition of father clad in striped jersey cut off at knee shoulder standing on header board be distracting affair even loyal bag who have followed david down to keep company for bag be not allowed to bathe having weak heart even bag gazed in dismay at squat square form said lor simultaneously somebody behind david remarked anyhow take gaiter off david felt too desolate to resent also be watching father almost praying that must take neat header loud flat smack be heard a fell into water ferrers said to mullins say can pater take belly floppers then mullins with watchful eye on david a dried with ferrerss towel began to whistle once in royal david city other boy began to whistle too be deplorable day have begun badly continued badly david offered to share hymn book with boy who sat next in chapel who appeared not to see what did asked stone to come for walk with after chapel again stone be engaged to mullins time bag be waiting like dog to divert console master if only master must allow eagerly braving unpleasantness of alliance with unpopular side though twenty four hour ago david must have scouted idea of bag consoling turned to eagerly now even allowed to have monarch travelling carriage in pocket at dinner though slight sneer surrounded be of general nature of chaff be of specie of chaff be meant to hurt a bag have once acutely remarked can hit fellow over head just to show like can do very same thing in opposite spirit be spirit just now that animated small boy be rag doubt rag with sting in for david be paying penalty of having be popular a well a of having disappointed admirer eye wholly unsuspected be watching situation head be perfectly aware that david have lost match against eagle though have so nearly won be aware also what manner of impression david father must make on irreverent school when day saw david no longer centre of group be making rather more noise than be necessary alone with bag took counsel with stroked grey beard for several minute then went across to museum where first form be sitting under mr dutton about time that catechism must be finished third missionary journey embarked on there having excused mr dutton suddenly addressed david blaize said though be sunday be in school must just congratulate on bowling performance yesterday have watched good deal of cricket at helmsworth for last twenty year be by far finest piece of bowling can remember school ought to be proud of now for work antioch stone where be antioch there be getting round stone ferrers david bag walked arm in arm to chapel together mullinss nose suddenly became subject of unkind universal comment chapter v david returned from station on monday morning where have be permitted to go in order to see father off in extremely good spirit with straw hat trimmed with school eleven colour well back on head hand in pocket where one caressed five distinct shilling other travelling carriage of monarch while fragment of cheerful tune came piercingly forth from aperture caused by broken shape of orifice doubt have something to do with deafening quality of whistle went through head of hearer like chirping of canary in circumscribed room when deed of infamy such a illicit feast be going on in bush at far end of second club field be often suitably bribed to keep watch at railing nearest school building for whistle carried that distance quite easily there be therefore when melody be heard time to remove trace of debauch before dub other incarnation of danger must arrive so desirable indeed be gift of really resonant whistle that ferrers have at one time begun operation on one of own front teeth with file on nail scissors in order to get similar configuration increasing tenderness have made desist before have got far david be conscious of great many thing made for cheerfulness father to begin with have put gloriously right with school have very wisely left in hour of supreme popularity so that there be fear of forfeiting by gaiter christian name flat header at bathing place such tragic folly esteem have won for greatly daring a seemed to boy have asked head to grant extra half holiday announcement that must be given afternoon in honour of visit have duly appeared on school notice board be supposed by one who have seen flat header that phrase in honour of visit must mark sarcastic intention on part of head whether be so not there be doubt about half holiday be that mattered even david when quite respectfully appealed to have clear idea a to why father visit be honour supposed must have something to do with book wrote be printed by clarendon press at oxford in case felt quite certain now that error of father have be guilty must be pardoned forgotten that must never hear more of hat gaiter of excruciating performance at cricket net of belly floppers into bathing place of betrayal of own son christian name finally of disastrous discourse have unfortunately delivered at school chapel on sunday evening for moment a remembered that david whistle ceased clutched at five shilling monarch travelling carriage for comfort have be too awful not only have talked most dreadful rot about joy peace of chapel service same a last year only worse under influence of trouble anxiety melted away have gone on on on in manner quite unparalleled for forty stricken minute have detained stone said forty two beat known record by at least nine minute be wonder that boy next david have written now in capital letter on fly leaf of hymn book passed to be over have made most honourable amends david knew that father must be considered credit to indeed that be first rate old buffer be quite moderate estimate of one given by most critical there be other satisfactory point about also have asked that david must be allowed to see off at station so that must have further talk with meant missing hour more if lingered on way back a be doing of repetition of latin prose david have not be certain at starting that must not sooner do prose repetition than have more jaw jaw when came be of most delightful kind not only be certainly to go to marchester in september after consultation with head have be settled that be to go there next week to try for one of scholarship wholly lovely adventure apparentlythis be news to davidhis work have shown great improvement during last term showed sign of perception taste though greatly wanting in accuracy archdeacon reminded must always be attained by industrious painstaking might prove up to scholarship level david did not attend much to generality point be that must go to marchester for three day examination next week finally a cause of happiness father have on platform presented with five shilling now clutched in pocket to commemorate having got into school eleven presentation have be so sheer surprise david must have fallen flat on face with astonishment must have expected if fatal topic of cricket be to occur again to be reminded that be only game to be bidden to take thought of just a such more to be tipped on scale have not entered into most sanguine calculation then train have come in david submitted to be kissed publicly without shying even though small vendor of paper with whom have slight difference before ceased shouting dily mile squeaked kiss ducky in perfectly audible tone must be dealt with after train have gone so father waved shovel hat from window david straw hat from platform after twitched off paper vendor cap rubbed face upwards with hit on hand so that dropped paper strolled back to school again in highest spirit not only be spirit high for first time in life be conscious of how happy be instead of just being happy morning seemed to stand away from envy boy only be who be going to try for marchester scholarship next week be certainly going there in september have five shilling two stag beetle in pocket be in school eleven child

tobacco tin lay in road with such firm accuracy that flew with whirring gong like sound over fence of house where assistant master of school lodged david thought wise to go swiftly away not look behind dropped to sober pace again after putting corner between master house into garden of empty tin have so pleasantly flown from mere happiness made quantity of good resolution one of immediately put into effect by not going into tobacco shop where have originally intended to buy packet of cigarette a present for smoking club just now solid satisfaction of life rendered unnecessary such minor adjunct since did not like smoking be convenient that happened to be contrary to school rule there be such host of thing pleasant not against school rule that wished by way of thank offering for to

go up for scholarship at marchester next week do best wont be credit not to doesnt matter so much to told father be proud of meant have have what call word before now havent in fact im afraid that sometimes have come to blow have often be most unsatisfactory idle careless disobedient dare say there not single school rule that havent broken told father have never found mean bestial look upon a boy can trust david young skin flushed with pleasure then went white again with resolution frightened iive done lot of thing dont know about sir said dont think right must think goodive head stopped david heart sank into boot what as have be to say why not have received handsome tribute however undeserved without disturbing misplaced faith prompted yet knew that have done deliberately because have to do wish to tell about asked head voice be still quiet kind david seemed to to be going mad just heard voice in quaking whisper say yes sir well then david dont want to hear about said astounding man though thank for wishing to tell feel sure have broken rule of school often enough dont think have broken rule of character be much more important though school rule have got to be kept a well suddenly grip on david shoulder tightened eye fixed on back of small boy who be sitting on wire railing at edge of field unconscious of approach ferrers minor think called out in awful voice head thought right ferrers minor presented startled dejected countenance did did not know rule about sitting on railing demanded head yes sir said ferrers minor then be wilful disobedience thundered

be part of whole joy of life music sense of longing for something did not know about produced in then attention be completely diverted by feeling of slight vibration in trouser pocket caused by movement of monarch wife who be there in travelling carriage now that recollected became part of beneficent joy of thing in general so for fear of not getting proper share of oxygen of world withdrew box from pocket laid on grass forgot about again in hearing of foam of perilous sea head finished ode invited question stone wanted to know what hippocrene be thinking intelligent question ferrerss

if at hoary age of eighteen must only have played real part in life of scene be now unrolling to felt that honoured grave must be natural conclusion everything might happen after public school be over seemed posthumous sort of affair be old after at moment even head for terror glamour appeared tomb like creature hughes exchanged hullo with friend two said right half past four to one of made david long to know what heroic thing be to happen then took past east end of chapel without further comment david quickly quite mistakenly drew conclusion based on private school experience suppose chapel pretty good rot said be worse than buttonhole chapel rot said hughes why perfectly ripping maddoxs uncle be architect finest school chapel in england bar eton perhaps youll see to night never saw

passage past step leading up to school library even a approached there be clatter of foot on concrete floor above boy came flying down four step to stride beneath one arm carried sheaf of book straw hat be in other hand maddox said hughes quietly on moment maddox took last six step in one leap nearly fell over hero worship of david be capable flared up never did hero make more impressive entrance than in long lithe jump landed in passage nearly knocked hughes down dropped book caught round shoulder steadied again there be splendid crisp vigour about line of body black short hair dark full blooded face topknot silly owl said dont get in man light when he in hurry havent hurt have id die sooner than hurt david picked up scattered book maddox turned to oh thanks awfully said youre topknot pal suppose come up for scholarship racket good luck nodded to david flicked end of hughes nose went off down passage to sixth form room whistling louder than even david thought possible gosh said david there be really nothing more to be said oh he always like remarked hughes feeling that meeting must not have be more impressive wished good luck said david still feeling dazzled wasnt awfully jolly of flicked nose same a might flick mine oh lord yes said hughes after immediately followed seemed setting stage from chief actor have departed for glimpse of maddox have be to david like appearance of spirit of public school soon left college building walked down quarter of mile to where red roof of adams rose between full foliaged elm have to cross broad swift flowing chalk stream where rush twitched in current cushion of star flowered water weed waved hughes pointed out wagging tail of great fat trout who be supposed to have baffled wile of fisherman from time immemorial arrived at house have to part for david a guest must present formally at front door while hughes went round through yard where stump cricket be going on to boy quarter there be cheerful cry of hullo topknot david waiting for bell to be answered thrilled again at thought of being part of idea of mr adam be no longer formidable though have pictured a being rather taller than head be shown through big oak panelled hall into mr adams study even if have entered in trepidation fear must have be at once set at rest in long chair by open window with pipe in mouth while two boy be leaning over back of chair sat master clerical a to collar with blazer on instead of black coat just a david entered one of two boy scarcely older than to appearance with shrill voice yet unbroken be expostulating with oh say do go back construe again sir said wasnt attending sorry adam held out hand to david thats right said delighted to see just wait moment now ted if dont attend time will not go over again ted

centre of two boy tall black haired girl whom conjectured to be adams daughter be playing croquet round edge be cut five six golf hole where other boy be putting slightly to derangement of geranium bed dozen more be sitting in shade of lime tree reading talking here inside two occupied sofa a david waited for ted to be construed to tall fellow strolled in lay down on hearthrug with illustrated paper wall be lined with low bookshelf on top of be strewn cricket ball book straw hat while on table in centre be litter of paper in middle great bowl of rose honeysuckle trailed trumpeted spray over space of open window dark stained floor be bright with persian rug construing be soon over adam gave book back to one of boy then who have lain down on hearthrug looked up from paper sir jessops coming down said adam got up from chair then get out at once with very fastest ball ever bowled crookles said one from sofa joined in oh dont be too hard on crookles said let hit over pavilion bit

purpose to see said adam incidentally to get scholarshipeh david horror christian name again nobody appeared to think least ridiculous more than ted who be climbing out of window must be known a ted adam looked rather unfavourably at one of two boy on sofa ozzy go wash hand at once said wont have fellow in here with dirty paw sir maynt just finish began ozzy finish when youre clean come out into garden david hows father topknot met at station didnt youre going to have tea with might find strawberry david be packed off early to bed night in order that brain might be in most efficient mood for examination next day in whirl of happy excitement never in day dream have conceived that adams must be like be not like school be like new entrancing kind of home with jolliest man have ever seen a master father for family friendly boy black haired girl adams daughter whom everybody called by christian name yet glamour of public school lay over among happy family there moved like ordinary mortal great one of earth maddox cruikshank westcott captain of school fifteen behaving like everybody else seemingly unconscious of divinity hero have be seen with mortal eye have be taken by hughes into maddoxs study after tea where have be permitted to help in washing up tea thing to be vatican room twelve foot by ten in material dimension shrine centre there be book everywherenot school book merely novel book of poetry book in french maddox read for own amusement cricket bat press of racket be piled in corner such space on wall a be not filled with book be mosaic of school photograph perhaps most astounding of though maddox have school cricket colour racket five colour there be trace of glory anywhere instead on nail behind door be hung straw hat with just house colour on david must be allowed to wear next september somehow be tremendously grand be like king who have right to cover with star garter preferring to go out to dinner in ordinary evening dress david bedroom be in private part of house next door be one of boy dormitory merry muffled noise leaked through wall from open window of dormitory there came into room whistling cheerful riot from time to time clump of boot kicked off on to floor by degree sound grew quiet still lay in wide eyed contemplation expectancy most trifling preoccupation be always sufficient to make forget to say prayer to night have got into bed without ever occurring to a lay awake among million surmise came to about life in enchanted place wondered whether fellow in house said prayer since chapel apparently be thing to be proud of on moment tumbled out of bed knelt down only one petition seemed possible made o lord let get scholarship come to adams said very fervently thought for moment really there seemed to be nothing else that heart desired amen said jumping into bed again fell asleep chapter vi be morning of day before helmsworth broke up examination be over list have be read out place remove assigned to who must reassemble in september just now whole school be employed in joyful task of packing play box be not affair usually demanded anxious consideration consisted in shying book into box shaking until lid consented to close burst in attempt david on particular occasion be not sure that be very joyful a outward visible sign of doubt be actually packing book fitting in one with be to say instead of making salad glorious thing have happened dazzling future be doubt to follow be dimly aware that chapter in life be closing in spite of drawback terror annoyance have be jolly have be happy be aware without knowing whatever future held must not hold again such scruple afflicted ferrers who be emptying locker into play box in manner of cheerful cataract holding up for competition anything did not want old testament maclear said quis for old testament maclear list of king of israel judah in with lot of nought cross over lord id like to make parcel of send to dub without stamp on david be considering question of catapult in famous visit to marchester have discovered that catapult be scuggy invention have at present be unable to bring to part with one so great be calibre stag beetle have given to ferrers minor day after return new owner have sat down on with total loss of life few hour subsequently now hardened again quis for catapult said heroically chorus of ego answered threw to stone who have clearly be first with ego rotten thing catapult said to strengthen only scugs use at marchester then came upon smoking club badge since return from marchester have broken with s c since a leaving gift have made club magnificent present of twenty five cigarette cherry wood holder defection have not roused unpleasant comment badge have still something of preciousness of past about remembered pride with by assistance of pair of tweezer have shaped copper wire into mystic letter slipped into play box there be loose cricket scoring sheet have craftily torn out of book because showed own analysis on day of eagle match did not record fact that have missed catch lost game well there be use for now more than for catapult stag beetle since fellow at marchester must care precious little what bowling analysis have be against private school of nobody have ever heard have not heard of at thought david saw just where vague regret melancholy came from have to start over again on new page to part with everything for own sake from familiarity have become dear to be nobody again instead of being big boy in circle have be used to consider rather swell with assured position now be nobody again with position at school sergeant minister of fate who brought round slip of blue paper on head have written name of culprit whose attendance be required looked in at moment master blaize to go to head at once said david heart stood still not with fear with suspense for last three day have hourly expected that news must come of result of marchester scholarship examination perhaps meant arrival friend thought otherwise ferrers major rattled key slapped book with suggestive resonance dont bully sir said other hand sir whack whack whack in same place fellow who be going to take wicket in old boy match wont be able to bowl ball whack whack sob cry oh piffle said david getting up be word have brought back from marchester be new to helmsworth vocabulary have distinctly overworked with result two day ago there have be piffle conspiracy against question be to say that david asked anybody be answered by piffle became rather wearing to nerve conspiracy be short lived have lasted indeed only few hour since david distinctly announced that must firmly hit in face next fellow who said piffle to that checked off junior at once unfortunately there be others when david moment after said to stone will come bathe stone said piffle immediately afterwards stone have black eye david bleeding nose went for next piffler with undiminished zeal thing have dropped for be not worth while fighting david over little thing like also have dropped use of word time slipped out by accident if anybody say piffle remarked cheerfully there heap of time to smash silly before go to head be too high handed one two three said stone whole class room simultaneously shouted piffle at top of voice be manuvre previously agreed on in case david used word again be scored off oh funny ass said witheringly be about best thing must be done under circumstance david walked down path led to head study with suspended heart feeling certain that be scholarship news not one of private misdeed be to be set before yet hurriedly attempting to recollect omission trespass of have lately be guilty credited with so stainless record that be really open to damning imputation of having become saint for effect of glimpse of public school life have be magical on conduct have literally not cared to do sort of thing more that spelt trouble at helmsworth at marchester for example only scugs smoked therefore temptation of so doing especially since did not like have ceased to beckon only reason for indulging in have really be notion that be grand if by higher standard be not grand at point of be gone again fact that at adams house be thing to work have made industry perfectly palatable mode of passing time where when have once seen master like adam be use of cheeking that dreary as dub couldnt cheek dub more be beneath to do such thing dub be pure piffle there have be paralysing row in school few day before at head have appeared in most terrific light david have have nothing to do with series of small theft have be going on culprit have eventually be caught red handed in dormitory deserted for cricket have be held up to public execration expelled that scene have made david feel sick with terror personally did not in least desire to steal other fellow thing quaked at thought of being made scorn of assembled school a have happened to anstruther supposed that whole subsequent life must be cursed blasted a indeed head have assured anstruther that be david tapped at door entered in obedience to stern gruff permission head looked up frowning blaize yes wait moment finished letter reread directed threw on floor be one of great way just threw letter on floor if wanted to be posted be picked up stamped have just heard from marchester said have done well have not got scholarship there be six given be eighth on list dont be discouraged have done well be recommending father to send to mr adams house anyhow be more expensive than in boarder wish have got scholarship so a to begin helping in own education think may consider that will go to mr adams next september head suddenly took key from pocket rattled in lock of drawer held cane be doing so seemed to david in sort of absence of mind not to be thinking of what lay within then leaving there got up rocked across to fireplace where stood on hearthrug looking gigantic began portentous terror breathing discourse david said few day ago saw schoolfellow publicly expelled saw turn white saw horror at task be forced on now be on point of going out into bigger life of public school when have be week at marchester will look back on time have passed here a sort of babyhood wonder whether be who smoked cigarette now then cheeked mr dutton puterput resurrection pie into envelope burned good lord thought david be going to be caning for sundries apparently wasnt will find continued head that there be worse thing than smoking misdeed may may not have be punished for will find out that there be even worse thing than stealing that many quite good chap a must say dont think there be harm in do know what mean david looked up in quite genuine bewilderment sir said thank god for then said head then moved across room to cabinet of cigar broke own rule for took one out lit smoked in silence for moment in sacred presence of one of boy then turned to david again dont understand now said will when do understand try to remember for sake if be anything to for own sake certainly be for god sake be best of that there be worse thing than stealing thing damn soul david now forget have said till time come for to remember will know when come dont listen to argument about there be argument possible yes sir said david blankly must not understand why be head have thanked god there be time for wonder for instantly head whole gravity seriousness vanished be wanted to say to said feel sure wont forget now when doe old boy match begin twelve isnt hope youll be in form to day with bowling havent beaten old boy for six year dont think weve ever have such good chance a have to day wicket ought to suit if sun come out gradually sense of dawned on david tremendous import flushed with incredulous pride oh fellow like hughes will hit round clock sir said will if think be going to remarked head thats then david hughes be staying with over night youll sup with yes sir thank sir said david in spite of failure to win scholarship david walked on air a went back to packing of play box for far more important from own point of view than getting of scholarship be fact that be going to adams for minute wondered about what head have said concerning thing be worse than stealing having be told to forget about instantly proceeded to put question out of mind in favour of more agreeable topic there be doubt that head implied that be who might win old boy match for school jolly decent of considering that be who have certainly lost eagle match for soon after great men from eton harrow marchester began to arrive appeared more enormous than last to day however there be baleful father to trouble david peace in half hour before match began went bowled to hughes at net who incontinently hit three time running out of field david have true temper of slow bowler who expects to be hit while study hitter observed that hughes be not nearly so comfortable with slightly faster ball pitched little outside leg stump if luck accompanied intention breaking in quite mistimed two that david sent down upon having got valuable hint david bowled more of variety lest hughes must get used to then a there be plenty of bowler at hughes net went on to next where cookson who have left two year before be batting there again wily david tried ball hughes did not care about found that cookson have special affection for hit juicily to square leg be le confident with very slow ball such a hughes have hit so contemptuously so here be second bit of information david committed that to memory tried third net where have success of sort kind there have be six school match before stone have lost toss on five occasion on sixth when have won have put other side in with disastrous result to day however having contrary to expectation won toss took inning by lunch time six wicket be down for hundred three while cookson only bowler of real merit be losing sting david in last over before lunch have hit impertinently for twelve thus bringing own contribution up to twenty during lunch made beautiful plan that must really go in for hitting hard afterwards miscarried lost wicket off first ball received owing to hitting hard at at moment when bail be already whizzing like driven partridge through air three quarter of hour later inning closed for hundred thirty five total might have easily be worse undeniably must have be better david heart sank when saw two immense figure coming out of pavilion to open inning of old boy found that have to begin bowling to one with moustache forearm seemed about a big a own leg a head have augured might happen sun have come out during lunch time after rain of night before have rendered wicket easy morning might render very difficult also very suitable for mode of attack during afternoon without doubt turf must cake ball if judiciously handled might do very odd thing indeed felt a if head have ordered sun on purpose for be kind thought suddenly glowing with optimism again pranced up to crease with usual extravagant action be immediately hit clean out of ground head have appeared in front of pavilion just in time to see done david candidly reflected that be worth seeing didnt often happen that first ball of inning be slogged for six juicy hit too david approached crease again in much more staid manner delivered second ball exactly like first there be really reason why must not have be treated in exactly same way giant carefully blocked instead for looked different that thoroughly pleased david be creating atmosphere did not use that phrase to merely thought that batsman suspected something again altered action took hardly run at time delivered slightly faster ball have puzzled hughes during practice at net be feebly returned straight into hand where remained till buzzed vertically into air gosh im devilish deep said david to in spasm of odious pride by six be over helmsworth have won by twenty run david have taken eight wicket though since return from marchester have often told that be only scuggy little private school be moment worth living for for not only did scuggy little private school roar at a came to pavilion with rest of team disgraced vanquished giant of public school people of sixteen seventeen came out shouting well bowled blaize with most generous appreciation head be there too clapping hand goggles be there beaming through large round spectacle carrot with hair shining in sun be there david came up step to pavilion alone for rest of eleven suddenly stood away from shoved forward crimson in face with exertion joy oh twasnt sir said to head who patted shoulder be just ground played awfully queer buried delightful confusion in quart of lemonade so in delicious triumph last hour of david school life passed from train next morning saw between tree fleeting glance of roof for three year have be home chapter vii david father lived in grey rambling house in close at baxminster plan of a far a david went have something to be said for against in favour be fact that house contained whole top story of dusky mysterious attic roofed in dimness by cobwebby beam used only for lumber place cistern here have be delightful in year gone by to find pleasing terror in dark doubtful corner amid gurgle of water pipe here sister in year gone by in other word until few month ago have often passed entrancing wet afternoon daring other particularly at closing in of dusk to explore farthest recess even to last attic of contained large coffin like box cistern unexpectedly gave sudden mirthless goblin chuckle to most harrowing to nerve already keenly on edge rule generally in force be that one of have to go sit alone in very spooky chamber with face turned honestly away from door while other dressed up in horrific garb might suggest to fevered imagination having stealthily entered frightened watcher with hideous apparition accompanying by such noise of screaming groaning might appear suitable with victim looking steadily away from door noise might go on like artillery attack until nerve be thoroughly shaken though have not yet seen what apparition be to be david have once frightened margery into hysteric here having entered room in silence swathed in sheet wriggling snake wise along floor have coloured face purple from margerys paint box having serpentined along till be in front of suddenly yelled disclosed horror of apoplectic countenance on occasion gurgling cistern have be useful for swiftly washed own face to reassure by variation of rule having be ordained that frightener must enter room first get up to receive frightened on entry margery have got back own again for have chalked face put tongue out lain down in coffin shaped box closing lid a

only last holiday that be only little boy dont mind now because know youre changing skin whatoh forget that word of yours marchester one piffle suggested david yes what piffle must have thought keats ode only few month ago at time thought grand grown up to smoke david sat down again thoroughly interested in own metamorphosis yes thats rum said not really just growing up sound sort of philosophical said margery picked up two three fallen mulberry put into mouth absently one after other dare say said oh david do be quick about changing skin let see new one now let go do something vote go look at old bookstall by priory gate might find keats among cheap lot in tray asked to come look for one morning held out hand to brother pulled up right oh said say margery youre not bad sort margery be extremely content garden where have be sitting be one of peculiar charm though to david ranked rather high among disadvantage of place for lawn be not big enough to play game into hitting hard kicking hard entered a be paramount requirement demanded of piece of grass there be really very little to be said in favour of garden ball always went into bush flower bed be very second rate arena house rambling grey stoned lay between road circled round close to north south garden on longer side be bounded by brick wall century of sun wintry weather have mellowed to inimitable softness of hue below southern facing wall deep flower bed grave of many ball ran whole length of grass on other side came up to wall flush a carpet to wainscotting few rose bed sunned below low stone terrace bordered house most distressing thing from david standpoint be that kindly thick leaved mulberry tree propped strutted like very old man taking air stood bang in centre of lawn so lawn tennis be out of question along far end of garden be collection of sculptured stone roman something beastly be verdict there probably unearthed when garden be first made here gate in middle of third brick wall led into kitchen garden of course from orthodox athletic view of garden be also quite futile to unorthodox nothing must have be more charming brick wall be starred with stone crop sown wallflower over grey tiled roof of house rose norman tower of cathedral grave gracious against sky care of flower bed have lately be given into margerys hand who have adopted radical measure against dreadful row of

cathedral monastic place sthetic a such atmosphere be be not greatly appreciated by young indeed be there smallest reason why must be everybody everything such be david view be old here for inscrutable reason age be considered advantage old bishop lived in old palace venerableness of appeared to inhabitant of close to be equally admirable elderly rook at least talked in elderly boring

archdeacon be in residence in august september monotony of six deadly week day be only to be broken by even deadlier monotony of sunday such be pessimistic outlook over life david took to day since pessimism be of uncommonly infrequent occurrence with be more than possible that margerys reference of to skin changing be correct one sort of philosophical explanation on part have already done something towards restoring to more normal level inspection of box of book outside window of second hand shop with event followed completed process for there by most apt dispensation of providence found margery actually found instantly passed on to david rather battered dog eared copy of keats be triumphant affair showing that good must come even out of baxminster hurried inside to complete sixpenny purchase coming out again into street saw outside straw hatted figure turning over box have just left suddenly david heart leaped for saw that colour on be of adams house moment afterwonder

loved christian name whether sister yours couldnt possibly thanks most awfully be sure asked david laughed why of course be what do take for oh cant bother about beastly book now know whats come out of tray will go then on way question of rightful possessor of treasure have to be laid before margerys contention be that david have suggested going to see if must find keats that have merely accompanied therefore book be david on other hand have contended that have found couldnt get over referred decision to maddox with seventeen year experience of world depends on what be going to do with said if mean to sell really think must divide proceeds if notwell must have box made for with two key one for of anyhow shouldnt suggest solomon trick cut in immenseness of momentarily obscured honour glory of taking maddox home to tea fate of keats be warmly debated david be rather inclined to sell revel in gold margery hinted that if be possessed of five pound certainly must not be who revelled in gold saving bank before question be settled have got back to close david pointed out father house little way ahead of maddox clicked teeth with tongue in show of impatience be rather too much said find second edition of keats bring home to most beautiful house in baxminster call rotten may see over before tea garden david felt must apologise for garden oh garden awful hole said though

frightened said maddox ought to read ghost story to other here one who read may make sort of noise chooses at moment just when ghost be going to appear know lord hope will never get beyond sort of thing margery david be standing in row opposite coffin shaped box just then cistern in room behind gave one of best goblin groan maddox looked awfully round oh whats that said thats not cistern thats man bleeding to death in there be throat cut from ear to ear said david im sure be cistern be may have be cistern before dont believe be that time pity not little darker there too much light really just now already to david attic bristled again with entrancing possibility under stimulus be queer that one of maddoxs age attainment must see sport in what few hour ago have seemed childish savourless to since be so be clear there must be something in school boy hero worship made see through hero eye maddox did said be invested with authority true have seen perhaps dozen time altogether be quite sufficient to make matchless glamour in world there be one so instinct with romance glory a boy three year senior who realised for wanted to be of course went downstairs again on pronouncement that be not dark enough im afraid youll think garden be rot said david there beastly mulberry tree bang in middle of lawn not so bad to have tea in margery cant have tea out there so fairy prince be escorted downstairs out into garden to give verdict on despised spot looked round with quick movement of eye from side to side without turning head again seemed now only possible way

cathedral be built publius aelius set up because god have be good to what lot of jolly thing there be fellow go mooning along never looking at anything im afraid mean suggested david modestly maddox looked up at over shoulder well dont said there bit of arch perhaps came from temple where p aelius put altar maddox asked for be given look at keats before left proposed to david that must walk with a far a old palace best afternoon ive spent for age said idol a parted wish wasnt going away to morrow must ask to be allowed to come again anyhow meet at adams in september haunting doubt have be

of showed pink through while water trickled steadily down bare calf into dejected sock lay limply round top of shoe leg be stained with splash of watery gravel shirt open at neck slightly torn across shoulder lay like wet bag glued to back hair be mere yellow plaster from water must have be wrung in pint bag be in similar plight except that wore thick woollen jersey over shirt gave slightly le

david artless incessant conversation be felt by to be unsuitable maddox watched in silence for minute let ball drop more said bag having made egregiously futile return dont take easy ball like till quite low david play with whole arm like windmill whereas only want wrist just keep flicking look here maddox gave david large umbrella to hold taking racquet knocked up down left hand wall of court sending ball parallel close to with easy accuracy like more le said now im wet blast took umbrella again reminded david of parcel splashed off across quadrangle familiarity closer acquaintance have not in least made david get over glory wonder of maddox by gad said fancy taking trouble to coach two scugs like isnt ripper come on let have one more game oh vote stop said bag too wet for anything rot cant possibly get wetter than be david of course have way be not till twenty minute later that trotted off down bath road on way to adams david going by preference through larger puddle bag mind doubt david also still ran upon maddox doe always call david asked at length lord yes when be alone said david suppose thought didnt count remember how sick be when father called david at helmsworth sort of disgrace to have christian name known what beastly little scugs be with smoking keeping stag beetle never did said bag in rather superior manner david jumped with foot in particularly large puddle covered bag with splashed water know didnt said be scug see that didnt do thing when be scuggish not to now when scuggish to do believe do bet smoke plug went out smoking yesterday after hall well what if did said bag how did know because stunk when came back simple what funny chap be never smoked at helmsworth where be right thing yet do here where wrong thing bag plodded on for little while in silence adam doesnt really mind smoking said chiefly want not to have brought to notice yes maddox doe said david wish hed catch at wouldnt sit comfortable for week two david pranced into footpath there be limit to amount of mud that be convenient to carry on shoe let walk bit said im blown moderated pace to walk david squeezed hand into pocketsa difficult operation a be glued together

le than time be day after hughes asked if maddox have become saint lord wait minute for inconjecturable reason known only to feline mind mr adams cat have thought good to sit out in rain afternoon on top of one of brick pilaster stood at entrance of passage up to house there sat unconscious of david bag contemplating scenery with infinite craft david having picked up small pebble threw with such accuracy of aim that passed through fur at top of head between ear threw up paw looked wildly round in startled dismay be there no more slap between ear shrieked david lord didnt look funny when threw hand up blow ive forgotten maddoxs parcel what as be not to have reminded hot bath anyhow then ill go back to college fetch cloud laden gale have caused dusk of evening to close in very early passage leading from dormitory to big room with row of bath be already nearly dark on side of passage be study of prefect david have to tiptoe delicately through danger zone since owed fifty line to cruikshank have not yet written though be overdue reached bath room without encountering enemy wallowed in heaven of water so hot that if moved must almost scream bag be in neighbouring bath finished washing first left david intent a water cooled little on matter of soap mud between toe then rain soaked head did not seem satisfactory washed shower out emerging eventually towel girt to rub head into semblance of dryness be tingling exhilarating affair accompanied by bout of piercing whistling next door to bath room be maddoxs study about time perceived that david have not filled kettle for tea since davidfor whistle betrayed himwas next door be simpler to go fill kettle rather than go in to fetch david to do there on end of bench below steam clouded window be david sitting head enveloped in towel violently scrubbing whistling whenever towel be not in actual contact with mouth have not noticed entry maddox thought must be rather amusing to sit down without speech close beside holding out in mute reproach empty kettle david must have filled did in minute david head be sufficiently dry to satisfy emerged from towel looked round astonished to find one there for bag have gone hullo maddox said yes got to fill kettle said david jumped up say im awfully sorry said bang forgot give maddox still held looking at oh doesnt matter said just having bath be david paused there be maddox only looking at only smiling instantly have sense of choking discomfort looked back at frowning puzzled sense of discomfort hugely increased merely wanted to get away oh then think ill go dress said hurriedly picking up sponge left room ran away down dark passage to dormitory david sat down on bed for minute feeling a if have escaped from distant nightmare have vaguely threatened to come near then very sensibly running away from instead of thinking about began to dress in great hurry washed hand over again went on rubbing hair did anything to occupy in few minute bag came in dressed from dormitory next door david have voluble conversation on hand a have hour ago in five court continued dressing in silence bag tried few amiable topic got more response than grunt monosyllable be quite unlike david usually rampageous loquacity after three four thwarted attempt be borne in upon lucid mind that there be something matter whats up blaze inquired nothing why said david savagely oh dont know havent got a much to say a usual well who want to talk to chap like asked david getting tie in knot venting in irritation bag felt slightly hurt for be unaware how must have caused since david did not want to talk to chap like most rudimentary sense of self respect forbade chap like to make further overture david cracked nail over collar stud failed to get sort of parting in hair broke bootlace material adversity somehow sobered began faintly to see really bag have nothing to do with own mood sorry bag said at length having tied end of broken bootlace together bag be most amiable of mankind besides be david right oh said at once do tell whats up if can be of use good old bag cant thanks awfully dont ask anything about if dont mind suddenly fact of parcel at lodge have forgotten to bring down for maddox presented felt that couldnt see maddox again just at once say there be one thing might do said wish youd come up to college with get parcel of maddoxs must be frightfully obliged if must im going to tea with fellow there must have to go up down twice bag felt that if david offered a explanation of ill humour be pretty thin one oh be that youre so sick about asked david irritability returned right dont come then said david be ready by now without word marched to door must have to bring parcel up be determined to get somebody else to take to maddoxs study wait second said bag in slightly injured tone of course ill come up with david took arm be brick said dont ask anything more isnt anything expect ive made fool of shouldnt wonder bit said bag pacifically funny fellow dont strain maddox have gone straight back from bath room to study without filling kettle sat for ten momentous minute in front of fire without doing anything without thinking even looking with open eye so to speak on week intense friendship be springing up between david have be splendidly growing till now influence over have be exerted entirely for david good have constantly shielded a on night when have found hughes sitting on bed from must sully have checked hint of foul talk in david presence for of lovable quality there be none so nobly potent to elder boy than david white innocence utter want of curiosity about be filthy didnt exist for danger of though thank god be passed knew that have brought near to then got up looked at in mirror above mantel piece hating damned beast said deserve to be shot presently there came tap at door remembered that have told david to bring up parcel for probably be not david for usually whistled hardly ever tapped on answer bag entered oh parcel maddox said blaize forgot to bring down after finished playing squash so went back with brought maddox held out hand for thanks said diddid blaze ask to bring yes be having tea in college have gone there yes went up together maddox got up right said he forgotten to fill kettle must mind please be exactly like maddox always thanked fag who did thing for treated politely bag in consequence retired with pleased alacrity returned getting on right crabtree asked maddox trouble oh thanks like awfully thats right forget who fag master be cruikshank oh yes hell look after thanks for filling kettle bag went delicately rather proudly away cruikshank never thanked put heel into fire to make level place for kettle sat down again to work other thought kept interposing between book claiming precedence knew from david abrupt exit just now that scented danger if be too strong image just turned back on miry road have be in maddoxs mind getting bag to do forgotten errand confirmed that vaguely perhaps david have guessed something of nature of muddy place have gone clean footed from with much greater sureness maddox saw that if friendship be to continue must turn back on too convince david that have done so be ashamed hated kettle boiled over sending puff of steam light ash into grate took off put in fender still sat there looking backwards into life finding comfort there then looking forward seeing gleam of saving hope at last outside study there came familiar step there be whistling after step paused there came tap at door david entered looking shy frightened oh came to clear thing away wash up said hurriedly maddox did not want to shirk what lay before friendship have become so intimately dear to be at stake will shut door minute david said rising standing by mantel piece with face turned away david did so remained by door want to say just one thing said maddox im damned sorry apologise neednt be frightened of shant happen again thats there nothing to wash up havent have subconscious horror still lingered in david mind have be obliged to come back here to see to maddoxs washing up else perhaps maddox must have sent for must have be worse at moment have other desire in spite of what maddox have said to get away ill go then said quickly right david left room have gone only little way down passage outside when foot simply refused to carry farther to allow to leave maddox like love loyalty insisted that be wrong not to trust regret assurance have be given that be doing mean cowardly thing to retreat like talk that have have with head on last day at helmsworth be very vivid in mind head have told there be use in arguing about certain thing instinct in spite of innocence told that such vaguely distantly be thing about head have spoken head have never told to turn back on friend to refuse to trust heart knew be sincere so once more from inside maddox heard familiar step return once more david tapped entered dont know why went away said why be frightened when said neednt be soso came back sorry then have instant reward of confidence saw maddox look up at with unshadowed eye of affection came stood close to bang right said imim awfully glad right then positive inspiration seized there be nothing more to be said on subject sooner be dismissed better instantly became maddoxs fag again say youre awfully late having tea said why kettle not boiling longer maddox followed lead took off forgot said put on again there cake in parcel bag brought take out will david tore open bag two cake said do want now either can stop have tea with if like thanks awfully have tea with chap in college well have david considered proposition simply on own merit well think will said youve got rotten fire shant take kettle to gas stove yes good egg pour little into teapot first though hi not over finger sorry didnt really touch did maddox laughed of course not must have smacked head if have thought be going to just for safety said david always swear before im hurt then take more care yes stick kettle bang in middle of gas stove say mine if one object right said david itll be boiled in two shake chapter ix david have be placed in one of two parallel form just below lowest division of fifth form when entered marchester at michaelmas failed to get promotion at christmas now in middle of lent term be face to face with fact that nothing in world be more unlikely than that must get out of at easter there must be not more than dozen boy out of remove promoted then a place be seventeenth in list of half term result lately published only first class miracle sort doe not occur must do for have just received letter on subject from father who a usual david thought failed to grasp situation altogether a david have not dreamed of telling father what situation really be be not much to be wondered at that archdeacon failed to grasp there be thing couldnt tell people be one at moment david be reading extract to bag from letter with comment interspersed must have be absolute infant phenomenon said if really got promotion term a say nobody doe now simply isnt done he written to adam about work blow bad luck said bag have asked whether hadnt better have private tutor in latin in holiday continued outraged david really too sickening just a if one didnt have enough of dreary fellow in term of course have to lie about what go on in form asked at christmas whether there be cribbing looked a if simply didnt know what cribbing meant perhaps nobody cribbed when be infant phenomenon said bag david scratched head rather rotten if come to think of said only crib sufficiently to get off impots very often run too fine dont crib enough do think rot to crib way to top of form cribbing wasnt meant for plug got full mark last euclid lesson just by copying proposition slap out of book didnt have decency to make howler two bag inserted lump of sugar in small hole have bitten in rind of orange began to suck sweetened juice have come on amazingly during last half year david be longer in least ashamed of a pal wasnt good at game consequently must have be entire nonentity in house except adams in adams so rest of school thought even junior took interest in sort of queer thing like reading book have got nothing to do with school work knowing difference between liberal conservative such topic pursuit be held to be laudable affair for occupation of mind in adams daily paper be not merely source from be discovered who have made century in county match adam have house in out of study day conversation be generally supposed to be of most abstruse type odd thing be too that house be just a keen on game a other be possessed of most of competitive cup having trained practised won cup house did not make sole topic of interest congratulation be not usual plan consideration that bag have won at adams must certainly not have be elsewhere bag considered short disquisition on proper sphere of cribbing for little be in parallel remove to david where so happened that cribbing went on be merely question of fashion be a arbitrary inexplicable a other fashion a binding form cribbed didnt local fashion not sense of honesty directed tisnt satisfactory state of thing though said if everybody cribbed everything must be all right because then everybody must get full mark david laughed old tovey be suspicious dog said in case might suspect something he a blind a bat can have crib spread out on desk bang in front of nose wont see didnt ought to be beak at put out tongue at other day right out like held there never saw think beak ought to have eyesight tested year two like do for army to see if theyre competent make up for eye by ear though if try to prompt fellow right at back of room hears likelike megaphone bag continued to suck orange till david have finished then went on repeat if everybody cribbed everything must be all right said only proper alternative be that nobody must crib nothing oh ah said david case of jerusalem golden a applied to toveys when be saint well wear nightshirt stead of pyjama golden crown bare hoof dont be profane said bag youre going to be confirmed david wrinkled up nose right oh said david lord do remember catechism class at helmsworth david finished father letter tore up grown up people seem to think that think same way a do said thats such rot might just a well expect to think same way a theyve forgotten about being fourteen never knew about being forty fifty do remember pater sermon too about chapel being centre of school life just because cathedral be centre of think he forgotten lot about being boy bag have certain persistency about cribbing remarked dont see why worse to get full mark for thing by cribbing than to avoid impot by cribbing crib dont if crib why not crib dont see that plug be bit worse than blaze why dont tell maddox about youre such pal with though be fag word do have rum notion said must be sneaking maddox always whack fellow if find crib just confidentially said bag simply imposh said david briefly door of study be open at moment plug wholesale cribber came whistling by real name be gregson be freckled put head in said frowsy beast for particular reason except that felt cheerful say plug come in minute said david havehave one of bag orange dont mind if do said plug politely be if bag doesnt mind whats row oh nothing be just jawing about cribbing thought might help not much to jaw about remarked plug dead cert that nobody ever got out of toveys without if mean that why thats mistake said bag if nobody cribbed fellow must get out of toveys just same didnt say that said plug mistake yours said nobody ever have got out of toveys without cribbing more have what must happen if nobody cribbed aint question one always have cribbed in toveys since year one cant help with owl like tovey blaze crib he three quarter way down whered be without blaze bim said david promptly there be then cant think why dont crib more get higher such silly rot said bag youll crib into lower fifth time nobody crib in lower fifth wherell be then will be in lower fifth remarked astute plug thats what crib for then will stop cribbing start again fair besides there sort of sport in cribbing may always be nabbed itit sharpens faculty oh there lot to be said for must sharpen just same to learn work said bag might must take longer can learn thing in time if use crib say blaze there extra confirmation class evening whole of second part of catechi oh blast said david plug got up left arid orange skin on table jolly good orange said now ive got squash court want to play cant with extra confirmation racket said david dont know word of crib said plug quite short though tricky just like third hole on link lot of little bunker david jumped up yes think will said ill do catechi after dinner ill be changed in two shake bag idea in discussion about cribbing be limited to possibility of being made systematic must be at once premised that sense of dishonourableness of practice so much a entered head be absurd that there must be standard about at present everybody in toveys cribbed according to light to get full mark others more half heartedly like david to avoid imposition owl tovey in view be responsible for be not fellow detected in cribbing who ought to get into row tovey who made state of affair possible a stated before in parallel form bag graced by presence cribbing be unknown be probably owing to fashion doubt extraordinary quickness of eye possessed by bill williams form master have something to do with there be anyhow nobody cribbed in bill everybody cribbed in toveys same number of boy be terminally promoted from division into lower fifth bag ran decent chance of promotion half whereas david have none knew that have not david brain yet half of david for instance have be proxime accessit in scholarship examination last summer whereas there have be question of bag going up for be rum world bag david shared study together presumably in equal quantity be easy to see be master mind from certain aspect of master body room measured ten foot by twelve appeared to be chiefly given up to david possession implement there be couple of racquet in press bag of racquet ball squash racquet for presently

to belong severally to have be chiefly annexed by david since golf ball five glove such paraphernalia usurped one while other be littered with book bag excavating corner for when occasion absolutely demanded predominance of david belonging be not accomplished so much by greed on part of david a by bag consistent self effacement when david interest clashed with own indeed indicated one of most popular point in bag character namely that a everybody said be so deucedly easy to get on with david be easy to get on with too owing to intense appreciation of humour of life in general even when be not humorous thought be be cheering way of looking at thing of two david publicly privately be substance bag shadow shadow danced in obedience to threw morning bagsthe nickname have stuck to in new school for be simpler than crabtree there be not anything else in particular to say about himbags be meditating dance of own independently of david felt certain that if david have be in division parallel to one mildly cribbed in where cribbing happened not to be vogue must probably be somewhere near top of form though a be be three quarter of way down david bore weight of thing a be with complete equanimity for there be cribbed sufficiently to avoid tedium of imposition not sufficiently to secure decent place appeared to be quite content with state of affair except in so far that might lead to having private tutor in holiday whereas to bag seemed gross miscarriage of justice doubt if david turned to worked with industry zeal might make difficult way upwards be tremendous handicap to be obliged to sweat eye out in order to get on level term with people who slowly correctly construed out of english translation of lesson david must have be first to turn up nose at proposal be le trouble to sit seventeenth in form avoid imposition bag be not very good at independent action line be action that fell in with other people wish meditated over possible idea might suggest to in new rle must have liked to tell adam confidentially of course remove relied so largely on toveys well known shortsightedness apart from general feeling that must be sneaking there be considerable doubt in mind a to how adam must take adam be splendid chap of coursethat be only possible view to hold of be undeniable that didnt want to be bothered liked thing to be pleasant liked fellow to come sit about in study with clean hand parting in hair to be happy contented liked also to be interested in general topic to bring work to for help did not like to know that school rule be being broken that house be not getting on in saintly successful manner wanted to manage own affair while like genial father coming home in evening to family saw only bright cheerful face round once bag remembered cruikshank have consulted on case where bullying be suspected bag at cruikshanks invitation have be present a witness cruikshanks reception though perfectly cordial have not be of sort to encourage confidence adam have thanked have appreciated good intention have told that be sure feeling of house must prevent such occurrence in future feeling of house be best jury wished to leave matter in hand of prefect bag conjectured quite easily from recollection of be likely to be own reception if informed adam confidentially that remove consistently cribbed must not do david have be horrified at idea of maddox being told then quite suddenly scheme of independent action be taken from bag somewhere down passage door be opened david name be shouted david in case be not here having gone to play squash though voice be maddoxs bag saw reason for going to tell if david did not answer must conclude that david did not hear probably maddox only wanted in general sort of way then came step along passage from bath room where prefect study be along corridor round corner maddox entered genial cordial a usual david out asked why didnt shout not at home when come in might tell maddoxs eye wandered round study say what god forsaken mess david keep room in said pile of book golf ball in between whats maddox suddenly took up from table book in dark blue cover be english translation of thucydides edited by obliging mr bohn be yours asked yes said bag instantly well will confiscate will whack better come be whacked now get over damned bad plan to use crib bag when get into fifth form youll find youre end of way behind fellow whove worked way up instead of cribbing way up got more of silly thing let have dont want to search study know must much sooner gave of told there arent more word of honour know bag thought feverishly moment there be several more said right let have bag got down from table where be sitting feeling rather limp physically quite resolved to see through meantime unfortunately maddox have opened volume of bohns thucydides with idle habit of book lover turned to title page wrote david name in though be yours asked here be awful complication what unspeakable as be david so thought bag to write name in crib remembered doing now in greek character quite intensely wished have not said be own that proposed to stick to if maddox chose might think guilty of unutterable meanness of owning crib writing pal name in yes wrote blaizes name in said in greek did not say particularly well maddox be confoundedly sharp probably oh thats lie isnt said bag be between devil deep sea other uncomfortable neighbour be possible to boy have be quite prepared to take whacking on david behalf though flesh be weak spirit really embraced opportunity now just a likely a not be going to take whacking on own behalf without getting david off be pretty bad how must have foreseen that maddox must look at title page have forgotten that david have be juggins a to write name there so being landed in awkward place made up mind to stop there thats all right said wrote blaizes name there maddox looked at so seemed to bag with certain respectful sympathy in david handwriting asked making of forger be doing thucydides half david be know because ive often given construes youre in other remove arent be use lying about bag surrendered told truth yes in remove b said then cant be doing thucydides because always do different book oh cave in out with well then blaizes crib said unsuccessful bag so knew why did say be yours dont know said bag think then bag threw sucked orange third of into waste paper basket because thought youd just whack there wouldnt be more bother said maddox again looked sympathetic just to save blaize whacking asked bag suddenly took courage maddox be such ripper must understand not altogether said felt id sooner let think be than he so awfully proud of didnt want to know oh blast added desperately maddox kicked door shut didnt want to know cribbed said because then shouldnt think awfully decent chap about said bag maddox nodded youre good chap bag said ive found out that david crib in spite of will whack for tisnt fault did very best rather good one too to prevent cribbing be rot hadnt idea david cribbed do other fellow in remove crib much then bag saw opportunity made for from beginning to end here be maddox who mattered so much more than adam one else asking for information instead of being reluctantly saddled with for moment hesitated since david have be so horrified at thought of maddox being told then maddox said taint sneaking bag im not going to make visitation cept on david in fact want to clear thing up bag hesitation vanished yes crib in remove said itsits just fashion blaze doesnt crib much only enough to avoid impots other fellow crib to get mark thats why he so low never thought of said maddox why must there be do fellow at top of form crib asked maddox remember youre not giving anybody away in sneaking sense rather thats why theyre there maddox have sat down on pile of book golf ball there be rolling about spilling a got up thanks said ill think what can be done remember know nothing about fact that ive found crib of david be matter send to when come in there be piercing cheerful whistle outside at moment quite unmistakable david burst gaily in hullo maddox said hullo say ive got thucydides crib of yours here with name written in silly as collect crib youve got bring to study im going to whack waited moment just to make sure that david be not going to say that everybody cribbed in remove of course david said nothing of kind went back to study bag as said david innocent of bag have attempted to do why didnt sit on something when came in couldnt there simply wasnt time david searched shelf swearing softly to result be rather voluminous load will simply descend to bottom of form said private tutor too in easter holiday oh damn think might have managed something maddox lay on too blasted affair david have grown in breadth le than in height during last half year be extremely limp figure appeared in maddoxs study few minute afterwards with eight volume of mr bohns classical series have felt rather queer morning sight of racquet handle on table gave unpleasant qualm maddox took book from be david asked yes thats lot anything to say asked maddox david might have have something to say namely that everybody cribbed in toveys never occurred to however remotely to say said cept that ive got beastly thin flannel on so see im not going to jaw a well a lick cribbings utterly rotten game always whack anybody whom find doing so get over chair will give six gosh said david quietly presenting maddox gave four not in fun be not meant to be fun david felt cold sweat stand on forehead must just prevent from cry out there be not much to spare felt doubtful if must stand two more maddox at same moment felt that certainly couldnt threw racquet handle into corner thats enough said david straightened up turned round wiping sweat from very white face youyou can whack said say feel rather bad may there be sudden singing in ear maddox caught a reeled put gently down into chair a leaned on david faintness be only momentary recovering almost instantly saw that maddox be looking almost a queer a felt im all right again said say thanks awfully for not giving six rotten of to feel squeamish couldnt help say for god sake dont crib again david said anyhow dont let catch david smiled got up rather gingerly understood nothing of what be in friend mind knowing only that have be caught with crib that summary retribution have be most effectively carried out ill jolly well try not to said right shake paw then said maddox by way bag tried to make think crib be histold so in factbut then found name david stared jolly decent of bag said did do for expect he rather fond of remarked maddox maddox gave two day consideration a to question of next step to be taken found rival claim of honour justice rather hard to reconcile a far a be concerned cared not one farthing what remove must think of in case if a thought might have to do went to adam head master with information that cribbing be fashion in form realised that must never do if came out somehow that bag be source from whom information have be derived remove must argue with irrefutable logic that somebody must have sneaked must take step with ingenuity be to find out who have done so again there be david on whom suspicion might fall must be certainly known that maddox have licked for cribbing must very likely be inferred that in self defence though self defence have proved singularly ineffective have tried to justify by saying that practice be universal one be precisely what david have refrained from saying must be rankest injustice that must be executed for cribbing disgraced by supposition that have attempted to justify on other hand cribbing be rotten system maddox intended to do best to stop be not easy to decide what to do turned acute boyish brain to solving of problem to seemed one of utmost delicacy importance made difference to well being of house quite rightly be to world remove must cease to crib that must be unaware how news of habit have come to authority wanted to take wisest course have considered matter trivial one must have be in sphere for age whit a culpable a prime minister of state who shrug shoulder at astounding national abuse mattered immensely indeed more than knew for right management of affair of such small kingdom a house form in public school go to build up foundation of right management of affair of big kingdom character judgment be formed there responsible boy take into big world exactly that have learned in smaller sphere maddox may be remarked not being prig did not indulge in edifying reflection only said to a scratched curly head im damned if know what to do wise boy brain worked explored burrowed two day after went to house master hate bothering sir said im in fix cruikshank asked adam who knew there be not much cordiality lost between two for respected cruikshank loved maddox oh crookles be getting on right thanks thing adam a have be stated disliked exercising authority held slightly dangerous creed that house managed best when left alone that public opinion be most effective check on irregular practice always manage house affair much better than must frank said dont know about sir affect more than house mr adam lit pipe rather wanted to play golf maddox seldom bothered with problem might be well to listen fire ahead then said well sir have to lick david couple of day ago for having crib began maddox why isnt little beast higher in form then remarked adam be coming to learned fromwell from fellowthat everybody crib in remove absolutely regular thing be rotten also learned that david crib only about enough to avoid impots whereas other fellow crib way to top of class isnt fair sir adam decided to go into shut door frank said of course say be confidential unless give leave to mention go on well sir really oldits mr toveys fault said maddox see he so jolly blind that fellow practically must crib then david have be suffering vicariously for mr tovey remarked adam maddox laughed yes sir about that said adam relit pipe funny thing must have happened just now said for mr tovey have be sent to bed with flue maddox gave cackle of delight gosh what luck said why instantly scheme lit up in maddoxs head why sir might suggest to head that of prefectsparticularly meanshould take of mr toveys work he rather keen on sort of thing dont remember told to take form for couple of day when be laid up last half well sir if must manage descended on out of blue say to morrow morning before know that mr toveys gone sick bet can reap lot of in theyre sure to have learned work with crib then see ive got david crib can tell if construing come out of crib o lord see adam considered how about telling head that form crib asked perhaps hed join in take of work maddox laughed again gosh what time remove a going to have said head mustnt make retrospective must all be found out afresh sir if see what mean adam nodded yes said head will understand that later in day conference between power hostile to remove be held power in question being head adam maddox diabolical plan of campaign be hatched classical work of form hitherto presided over blindfold so to speak by mr tovey be to be taken with suddenness of thunderstorm by maddox not word be to be said be simply to march in at early school next day open fire on own system lesson be virgil that evening closely studied excellent translation a given by mr bohn in volume have confiscated from david construing began from top of form boy after boy translated with extreme elegance fluency maddox be beaming complimentary among other weird accomplishment knew shorthand screened by sloping cover of desk made accurate transcript of what translation of boy have be yes very good very good indeed said when be finished quite lot of have got full mark opened lid of desk took out of virgil crib have confiscated from david three day before hadnt time to mug up remarked so will just read through translation out of crib whichwhich came into possession few day ago began read line two then stopped consulted shorthand note then nodded to top of form just expression used said genially went on little farther think be how translated plugsi mean gregson observed to second boy be not quite comfortable uneasy glance passed about who must possibly have expected that maddox must bring crib into form there be really distressing parallelism between rendering given by most of boy in consequence there be pensive face maddox made further comment proceeded to ask few question about grammar now said will turn on hundred line farther translate on paper twelve line beginning at line will use book at for dictionary nornor other there be quarter of hour silence broken only by scratching of labouring pen unlucky gregson who have be positively brilliant over prepared line must make head tail of fairly elementary passage maddox have set ventured on protest say mr tovey never give unseen said dare say do remarked maddox suppressed giggle be rather score do allow laughing added decidedly hour be not going very comfortably alleviation be possible for be somehow quite hopeless to think of ragging maddox be also very nearly hopeless to translate unknown passage then thing far more dreadful happened than have gone before door of class room opened head entered in rustling silk gown nodded to maddox who got up going well said in mr toveys absence form did not think so unfortunately head have not asked be doing with maddox said virgil lesson sir said weve have prepared lesson ive set short unseen very good practice said head mark for seen translation be satisfactory yes sir very said maddox excellent please take unseen translation over to house after school will look over isnt fair to give work yes sir said head still lingered by maddoxs desk in rather beastly fashion peered be little short sighted at maddoxs shorthand note be cabalistic symbol asked just note took in shorthand of fellow translation sir answered have will like to compare with unseen write out for maddox will bring over to took up volume of bohns translation maddox have be reading out of bohn sir said maddox brought in hadnt time to learn up lesson thought id better have crib by head so thought eager audience looked rather stern for moment then quite naturally laughed will confiscate that said looking pleasantly round better practice for maddox to get up lesson without one rustled out again leaving uneasiness behind have be rather sport to see maddoxs crib taken from behind somewhat superficial pleasure there be vague idea dangerous thing be getting into dangerous hand maddox have be bidden to supply shorthand note of prepared translation must reveal parallelism between mr bohns rendering of remove must be dreadful thing if head in abstracted moment consulted mr bohn also added to that there be fact that head be going to look over unseen work must doubt be struck by amazing contrast between prepared lesson be almost too much to expect that must credit form with such extraordinary industry taste a to have prepared set piece so perfectly yet to be so lamentably wanting over unseen such at least be private meditation of most of remove who wished severally collectively that have not be so brilliant over first part of lesson breakfast desultory confabulation when form assembled again for next lesson have not tended to make thing more comfortable there be nothing whatever to be suspicious about a to manner in ill omened decree of fate have unfolded mr tovey have happened to have influenza head have happened to tell maddox to take place maddox have happened to set unseen to take shorthand note of previous translation head have happened to come in to see how maddox be getting on have taken for own delectation crib shorthand note made manifest dreadful attempt at unseen be hurriedly debated after remove assembled for second school awaiting arrival of maddox who be little late so be sarcastically said be probably mugging up thucydides lesson in crib then uneasiness increased into dismay for door opened there appeared not maddox at head have packet of paper in hand be rightly instantly conjectured to be virgil unseen of hour before dr hamilton did everything rather quietly slowly be distinguished for politeness of manner that on occasion became terrible have never be a far a school be aware notable for athletic prowess in spite of defect be always keen observer of cricket football match be certainly intelligent about matter so that heart be felt to be in right place be quite certain also that head be in right place for have be senior classic chancellor medallist at cambridge fact be viewed in light of strong testimonial in favour of dead language quite apart from of accomplishment be cause of awed respect in be held though sixth must not have told why be so impressive person reason except to boy be not far to seek be justness bigness of charactera thing not definable by whose character be not yet formed quite clearly appreciable by to please head be worth effort praise be of nature of decoration may be added that be quite a well worth effort to avoid displeasing went with rustling gown gathered up in arm straight to desk mr tovey be wont to occupy for five awful minute without slightest allusion to thucydides continued reading from sheaf of paper carried with did not look at pleasant a occasionally made note occasionally drew thick blue pencil across page time hapless remove sat in state of confirmed pessimism be noticed that have divided sheaf into two packet came to end of tore up across across larger packet of two rest numbered perhaps dozen sheet then spoke have never seen worse set of unseen translation than form showed up to maddox morning said half dozen be passable one of blaize be good nearly so blaize yes sir said blaize what be place in form by half term mark seventeenth sir said david from lowly abode head glared at spoke very advisedly be disgraceful place for boy who can make such decent unseen translation observed have precisely effect that diabolical head have intended rather bad luck on blaize reflected form generally to be whacked for cribbing then to be slated by head for being so low head paused moment may close book for present said listen to what have to say to be extremely serious matter before doing unseen construed piece of prepared work out of twenty four boy in form sixteen got practically full mark for may remember at last lesson took away from maddox crib have brought in with also took transcription of shorthand note have made see by referring to crib that think nearly of boy who got full mark have used that crib have not even sense to alter translation so indebtedness to must not have be so glaringly obvious be fool in fact a well a knave have use in remove in other part of school for now have not slightest intention of asking of if used crib not because without telling know that did will just take one instance first come to hand gregson translated prepared lesson perfectly in used three expression be identical with expression in bohns translation unseen on other hand be simply beneath contempt use name only a first occurs to single out a being worse offender than many others do wish of to confess still le to deny that used crib alike be very rotten set of fellow form generally during quiet biting address be growing stiff with horror gregson who a plug have conversed so lightly in bag study about advantage of cribbing be feeling singularly empty be one thing to talk airily about merit of system be not so apparent when head spoke like about demerit let sink in for bit without looking at poor plug more than at anybody else then continued have looked through mark of half term said be quite inconceivable to that such high mark a earned by boy who be at top of form must have be come by honestly be therefore going to cancel whole of mark to day determine place begin fresh with mark for unseen have just looked over will therefore now take place in new order will read out whole of mark of term hitherto be cancelled if boy high low in newly constituted form have slightest protest to make will please state fully will listen to with respect be not talking sarcastically only want to do justice roughly doubt to best of power dare say have used crib to certain extent want to go into unless one wish to be dishonest to use crib at there be end of matter will however go into individual case for purpose of doing justice may talk over among yourselves if wish while do so will leave class room come back when have made up mind if boy wish to go will please hold up hand go will notice will be taken by of owner of hand be held up must appreciate that there be justice about commanded respect though head promise be implicitly trusted by present not hand be held up head gave ample time for take then be satisfied said at length will therefore take place in new order take book out of desk before take new place will read list boy will take place according to mark a name be read there be scraping of boot stir of changed place in couple of minute new order be established now said head boy will look in new desk give to previous occupant content with exception of crib that there may be there now make exchange place crib find in front of desk there be impression at point that head be showing ignorance must have known that most crib be not brought into school at that large majority of be securely reposing in owner study here reckoned without host dozen book be given up very meagre total form generally wrong once more expected that head must make desk to desk visitation did nothing of kind will now said of go to house study of boy whose place now occupy bring crib find there have told maddox to go round after sincerely hopesincerelythat will find nothing to do if doe consequence will be quite serious will come back here in exactly twenty minute will expect to find book ready piled here maddox will go round after have finished report to of share study with other boy will understand that crib found therein will be brought here whether belonging to member of form not now have opportunity of consulting other before must not consult now if of dont know house to owner of present desk belongs ask head got up rustled down room went out looking to right left perfectly silent form dispersed be back again in place before reappeared in front of desk be solid pile of book did not even glance at will now do thucydides said who be top boy of form blaize what chapter of what book be at book three sir said david chapter fourteen read greek then aloud till stop then construe rather trying half hour followed form generally be addled with emotion be almost relief when maddox appeared from search have fresh incriminating volume with might have left outside well said head sir said couldnt find more eye fell almost respectfully on appalling pile already found thanks said head be glad please take lesson to morrow morning instantly resumed thucydides gregson read translate said poor plug at end head got up there be need to speak to further said because think understand may say however that boy found using crib in future will be flogged degraded into fourth form will find unwise to try at least think so gathered up gown for first time apparently saw heap of book piled in front of desk lowest six boy of form will bring silly volume across to house said head boy will count here then come across when be removed count again to see that number tally understand blaize yes sir said david be ashamed of said head chapter x david soft grey hat with house colour on be tilted over eye to screen from sun lay full length on hot dry sand above high water mark on beach at naseby stupefied simmering with content arm bare to elbow in rolled up shirt sleeve be extended kept filling hand with sand letting ooze out again through interstice of finger in pleasant tickling manner hourglass fashion though action evoked in edifying melancholy reflection on subject of passing of time beside lay two coat two bag of golf club for maddox with whom be staying have just come back from morning round of golf have gone down to shore to bathe before lunch have tossed up a to of must go to fetch towel maddox having lost have just disappeared up steep crumbling path led to top of sand cliff where be perched house mother usually took for summer holiday few hundred yard farther north cliff broke into tumbled sand dune stretch of short velvety turf where green nestled in elysian valley surrounded by sahara maddox must be absent ten minute david let lazy thought float down stream of very pleasant thinking made up extreme contentment did not direct let drift going swiftly here eddying round there while memory shore of last few month glided by in first place perhaps most important of be staying here with friendthis be eddy went round round in though have be here three day already passing entirely with maddox playing golf with playing tennis with bathing with quite continuously talking to david must not get used to amazing situation called frank too just a if be nobody in particular at thought of david rolled over on to side wriggling said lord be little more than year ago that have be in own phrase scruggy little devil with stag beetle capable be true of hero worship able to recognise hero when saw for have not heart burned within when going up for scholarship examination demigod have thrown careless word to be quite sufficient then that maddox handsomest fellow in world best bat probably that marchester have ever produced altogether most glorious of created being must have noticed at indeed be more than sufficient be sufficient that maddox must exist since then only year have passed here be calling frank leaning on arm when so disposed tossing who must get towel staying with mother often must say something to in french unconscious language talked frank must answer in french seemed wonderfully romantic though age be so diverse for frank be eighteen david fifteen three year when combined total be so small make vast difference here staying with david hardly felt gap at school be otherwise hundred season sundered here be equal difference be swallowed up in friendship friendship even swallowed up hero worship sometimes david dwelled gluttonously on step have led up to there be that meeting at baxminster with splendid adventure of second edition of keats here made agitated excursion into fate of that margery have decided to sell have got enormous sum of twelve not ten pound for glory of have be abruptly extinguished for father have insisted that equal share must be invested in saving bank to roll up at beggarly rate of interest do good to anybody really grown up people be beyond word dismissed distressing topic hitched on to maddox again public school life began with installation a fag there hero worship have soared like flame day by day until afternoon when after playing squash with bag in rain have gone back to house for bath david have always avoided thought of that remained moment quite sundered from rest of intercourse with frank embarrassing to be forgotten like momentary opening of cupboard where nightmare dwelt anyhow have be locked again instantly key thrown away never sound have again issued therefrom thereafter came flood of jolly thing to swim in after new arrangement in remove consequent on monumental cribbing row have got into lower fifth at easter must when went back at michaelmas find in middle fifth frank have made work with intelligence industry a well though distraction of summer half have be frightfully alluring for david be really coming on a wily left hand bowler have be extremely difficult to give more than casual attention to commentary of julius csar when inmost mind be wrapped up in cricket be not hundred of over thousand of david delivered in imagination when ought to have be crossing alp with hannibal challenging medea strange use of pluperfect when infuriated lady be in act of stabbing child have got remove satisfactory report of work so that there be peace joy at baxminster father sanguinely prophesied that must go up into fresh form term a have done half way through summer half have come most intoxicating possibility namely that have chance of getting house colour for cricket very first year at school be thing nearly unheard of though of course maddox have done have be tried in house match have done rather well then that hope have gone to grave for when maddox put up list of completed house eleven name did not appear have known that be not going to do so already manner of exclusion be secretly to almost greater gratification than appearance must have be that too lying on hot sand turned greedily over in mind licking chop of memory have happened thus have come one afternoon into maddoxs study just before final promotion be made maddox opened subject david must be fearfully sick if didnt give house colour asked abruptly david have already allowed to hope for even to expect sunshine went out of life think must said not that matter hang say im going up town do want anything thanks just wait minute oh dont look like david face have taken expression of most stygian gloom sorry said of course be as to hope werent said maddox ive be bothering about thought id talk to like ozzy have about equal claim if werent such pal think must toss up of gave colour to house must think be favouring if put in there thing too ozzys last year first dont know that matter so much so if find left out itll be because be pal see david moved step nearer woe have gone from face gosh then leave out said ii prefer being left out if thats really asked maddox yes rather andand thanks ever so much there have be no need for more than jerked telegraphic sentence david went up town treading on air with secret heavenly pride be certainly among rippingest feeling have ever have congratulated ozzy with complete sincerity here be frank sliding down crumbling sand path with towel frank threw towel at knocked off hat mother lunching out said so can bathe just a long a please without being late oh said to need youthats yougo away on saturday said id ask david have hesitation over of course neednt said at least at least said frank emptying sand out of shoe mean be sure im not being bore must love to stop of course wont mother get blasted sick of dont think will said maddox gravely will rather doesnt matter in fact be wondering whether perhaps youd mind going on friday instead of saturday david laughed thats poor shot at getting rise out of said absolute failure shant go away on friday saturday frank just shrugged shoulder stifled yawn with dreadful versimilitude david gave one short anxious glance that wasnt poor shot after said frank just for second wondered if be in earnest didnt said david promptly thats lie said frank david gave up lay back on sand again beginning to unbutton know be said yawned jolly well frank picked up handful of dry powdery sand let trickle gently into gap of shin showed between end of david trouser beginning of sock caused to spring up lord whats that said oh see funny thought be bug of sort well if will grow so that trouser only reach half way down leg what else be to be done with interval asked frank grew two inch last half said david will be taller than before ive done very likely will be image of piece of asparagus if like certainly if grow up to size of foot youll be big enough will call spondee david shirt be half over head paused spoke muffled because why asked because spondee be two long foot david gave great splutter of laughter a shirt came off oh quite funny said wish have guessed jove doesnt sea look good im glad be made andand didnt die in night didnt bring down anything to eat did isnt bad to bathe on empty tummy be full one dont know im going to bathe on own anyhow david there sharp line round neck where clothes begin when youve got a if youd painted neck with sprain stuff iodine did said david fatuously standing nude come on ripping old sea waiting for tide be high beach steep so that few step across belt of sand tremble in heat few stroke into cool tingling water be sufficient to snatch away from solid thing give buoyancy of liquid existence sea slept in windlessness of august weather a if with long taken breath silence alternate whisper of ripple broke along rim far out fleet of herring boat with drooping sail hovered like grey winged gull above unclouded sun shone on shining watery plain on two wet head one black one yellow moved out seaward with side stroke flashing of white arm clawing sea amid smother of foam farther farther moved out till at last david rolled over in water floated on back oh ripping said good old mother sea frank turned over also lay alongside like something read yesterday said a heart of usoh something somethingathirst for foam seem to remember well dont yes what be anyhow who did fellow called swinburne good man be swinburne at time lord can lie down on sea like sofa if get balance right oh dear yes swinburne know trick two for instance when hound of spring be on winter trace mother of month in meadow plain fill shadow windy place with lisp of leaf ripple of rain bright brown nightingaleoh how doe go lay with head wash eye half closed against glare spell of magical word framed more distinctly in mind o listen david said drink in for winter rain ruin be over season of snow sin day dividing lover lover light loses night win time remembered be grief forgotten frost be slain flower begotten in green underwood cover blossom by blossom spring begin david must have appreciated in case never have poem so romantic setting a when frank repeated to here a lay side by side right out away from land away from anything other liquid paradise of living water oh oh said rapturously whats name of go on though frank thought moment cant remember next verse said atalanta in calydon oh shes chap went out hunting with maiden said david confidently be look out there jelly fish right floating by say water a warm asasi dont know think youre babbling said david go on about atalanta did have good sport maddox laughed forgetting that be balanced in briny sea swallowed large quantity of whats row asked david what did say maddox ejected a much of water a be accessible oh be such kid said keep forgetting david kicked into perpendicular position trod water well im getting older a quick a can said in self defence blast wish must go on for ever what a if didnt know being in sea being with being alive so on same here said frank lord wish must be sea a well rather jam dont think id allow everybody to bathe in said david dog yes people not must charge shilling let anybody maddox pushed upright in water fraid ought to come out said must be latish ill race to shore right oh give twenty yard start measure very carefully said frank well twenty stroke then said wily david shoving from frank shoulder to get movement on then taking very long slow stroke letting impetus exhaust now said boy swam with overhand side stroke breathing whenever head happened to be above water ploughed landwards with wave of bubble broken water behind frank overtook other in last thrilling ten yard won by length of arm head panting still cool lay for little in willow water then reluctantly went up over beach to where clothes lay there hot sun soon rendered superfluous towel frank have be at pain to fetch presently after laboured up sandy path to house slack hungry content with half of wonderful day still in front of once on upward ascent david paused mind going back to magic of word o o oh said again rapturously blossom by blossom spring begin will read more of after lunch lunch took considerable time for david appetite like bone muscle seemed to grow larger with food ate be not till have taken frank evil advice drunk second bottle of ginger beer that declared able to turn attention to literature again be going to play golf once more in hour david staggered out on to lawn to lie on shady terrace bank for short spell of swinburne frank went to fetch from bedroom letter have arrived during lunch found one for one for david with swinburne daily paper must contain one important matter namely result of county match between sussex surrey took out with there letter for said there swinburne daily telegraph what order of merit oh telegraph first said david bet that surreyoh letter from margery might just see whats going on say know exactly how balloon feel be jolly good ginger beer frank flopped down on bank by began opening letter what else do expect said if inflate with gas a did at lunch dont expect anything else said david thickly be who suggested think must see what happened in match first well let have look too selfish devil said maddox putting down half opened letter cant turn over put paper on grass here so that can read together lord said david at least itd be risk can sit up if do slowly sussex have good fortune to be david county for felt rather responsible have done credit on occasion have won by dozen wicket rest of paper did not seem to contain anything mattered throwing aside frank began on letter margerys be quite short though good of kind having finished david looked up saw that frank be reading that there be trouble in face oh say be anything wrong asked frank did not reply at once ive heard from adam said at length there be row letter have be found hughes isnt to be allowed to come back in september why what sort of letter asked david then a frank be still silent oh something beastly be asked what as

well im awfully sorry just a be said if fellow will be brutesold adam seems end cut up about somehow id ceased to be pal with hughes wheres swinburne still frank did not answer david knitted puzzled brow whats up said maddox turned over on to back tilted hat over eye till face be invisible might have be hughes said again memory of what david always turned face from came into mind oh rot said lamely hating subject maddox be silent moment tisnt quite rot said then there came thing dare say youve forgotten only havent came in from playing squash one wet afternoon innocence made suddenly see what beast be david must not help giving little shudder moment after be ashamed of dont care what be like before said what im perfectly sure of be that since theni remember very wellyouve be right yes there be then said david frank be still lying with hat over face now pushed back looked at david serene for said because youve always be straight chap different for feel just rotten david scratched head in perplexity whole matter be vague repugnant to did not want to hear more know more there be such heap of jolly proper thing in world to be interested in curious about understood without vagueness at with very opposite of repulsion that friend be in trouble that wanted sympathy with so whole of devoted little heart went out there be bad trouble too worst trouble fellow must have must be perfectly beastly for said im a sorry a can be youre sorry what more can chap do if werent sorry must be different there thing too to set against what youve done thats how youve behaved to youve be absolute brick to youve kept that sort of filth away from know have david paused for moment morning alone on hot beach mind have dwelt long eagerly on wonderful friendship now just when be very thing be wanted to comfort frank aspect of struck remembered how often frank have by seemingly chance word discouraged from seeing much of certain fellow in house remembered night when hughes came sat on bed with what extraordinary promptitude frank have ejected remembered how dormitory have be changed have be put in frank have since then slept in bed next with swift certainty started into mind with policy lay behind frank have consistently kept nasty thing away from here be atonement so went on eagerly know what youve done for said youve alwayssince thenhad eye on kept filth away im end grateful since youve done that chalk up on other side youve made easier for to be decent oh damn im jawing david suddenly became aware of stopped abruptly rolling over on to side with face to friend havent be doing that on purpose demanded must give heap of instance well yes then let chuck whole subject said david in moment just want to tell tried instead of corrupting to uncorrupt did be doing made ashamed david gave shy little wriggle towards never heard of anything so ripping said though sound rather cheek maddox sat up thats what youve done said if be cheeky other name of be salvation there be silence moment probably david have never known such intense happiness a tasted then just because be feeling so deeply idea of anything approaching sentiment be impossible have be said harvest be garnered frank felt that too must not feel differently from other just then away went whole subject mountain few minute ago now light a thistledown on summer wind done said oh what be other thing brought out atalanta in calydon wasnt first chorus yes must be ripping said david at same time just struck three be to play golf at three jove so be how must have jawed for one second david be not quite certain whether frank be trying to get rise out of not with such naturalness did speak sorry said quickly im afraid did frank laughed david sport trying to get rise out of said simply rise at anything really didnt think youd rise at oh right said david then be nice surprise for come on if youll give stroke hole illill probably get beaten added in sudden accession of modesty most unusual say what ripping day being taint bad youre not bad little devil bordered on past conversation again hastened away from go get club david said lost toss about towel morning thats not fair said david tossed morning thats finished well toss again head well then isnt tail ill go if like be still very hot link although usual august crowd be at naseby be nearly deserted since seemed to most of world to be better part of wisdom to sit quiet till heat have little abated resume activity again after tea two boy therefore have empty green before since finance in case happened to be precarious there be need to keep place on green took caddy on right along first hole lay sea shimmering still so near that be easily possible to say least of to slice ball on to beach in front lay fairway of course stretch of velvet grass interrupted by tossing sea of sand dune fringed bearded with coarse bent while flag planted thereon showed where lay direction of desired haven then came trudge through sandy place with breathless suspense to see whether ball have carried last of bunker in other case equally vivid conviction that have done nothing of sort must be found nestling in little steep bare hollow be devilled hiding place david in especial found frequently in amazing awful place of satan have certainly be architect in spite of intimate nature of have passed between two so few minute before unbroken solitude together did not produce in of least wish to re open subject have be closed door have be triumphantly slammed on so that even if golf have not be so absorbing must of have mentioned again yet deep down in unknown to have passed have taken root be silently germinating making fibre in unconscious mind building up stem on character burst into blossom many word be consciously spoken many thought thought word thought did not stray beyond fortune of little white india rubber ball at marchester golf be recognised school game played on own link for two winter half when did not interfere with cricket frankit be just like so thought davidhad become fine player with really trouble at have only played for two year at school be scratch player here at naseby have just won medal prize starting from four confessed that have come easy to everything seemed to to david observant eye did not seem to do anything particular caused not to top one drive send next spouting in air like geyser when came to approaching be with same supple ease that flicked ball high with little fid of turf flying after appeared so perfectly simple merely hit ball with middle of club at time if be playing against thing became almost monotonous must be said about david play must not be called monotonous gave excellent example of method afternoon at third hole slicing far gorgeously from tee out on to sand there have be no interest in frank drive have merely gone straight very long way so came with david to walk up ball be found to be lying fairly well silly as said to a david took out iron prepared to play with take niblick make certain of getting back on to grass must get on to green with iron if hit said david excitedly then must be there in two cant get in le than two ive got stroke must win hole off if putted first near right oh said frank never mind ifs not atom said ball be not lying so very badly there be really certain excuse for david so took iron hit ball rather firmly on head went about fifteen yard in injured manner settled in moat of what have be child sand castle itll take deuce of putt to get near hole from there remarked frank david a always took game very seriously for moment felt merely wild with rage impotent ineffective rage nobody cared hell began then admirable temper asserted before settled what hell be going to do oh dear youre always right frank said niblick be wish have be before now im going to take trouble shifted with foot in loose sand a frank have told to do till got firm stance then frank have never told to do took most prodigious wipe at ball shut eye a sand fell in shower round didnt see said what happened somehow other have hit ball clean hard perfectly straight for green wasnt niblick shot at nobody david least of knew how have happened well of almighty fluke said frank probably on green david bubbled with laughter oh say what sport said now know how to play golf if lie rather badly take iron make worse then take niblick hit home went back to course to walk up frank ball be lying impeccably twenty yard short of shored up bunker guarded green for once be not monotonous chipped at with lot of back spin bounced against board of bunker fell at foot thereafter played racquet against board then gave up david reckless unreasonable be lying just foot beyond bunker in such wise hot heavenly afternoon went by dreadful delightful thing happened frank after long consideration a to whether must get over brook with drive at tenth hole decided to play short with cleek pitched full into david with two stroke in hand putted four time at eleventh before got down of trying to carry far bunker at thirteenth topped into near one instead there be delightful incident to balance distressing one frank holed mashie shot at sixteenth at next david ran through two not one bunker off topped drive third with second shot deep down below basis of enjoyment be friendship thought how easily that priceless possession might have foundered be lost in quagmire frank won wholly loathsome putt on last green went into hole not by honest front door even with kick at honest back door with stealthy sideway entrance after circling round hole decided match oh good putt said david politely instantly politeness broke down gosh what fluke added rot tried to hole did said frank well said good putt once said david cant say again simply cant after tea at club house seemed necessity to play again time regardless of financial stringency frank treated david to caddy went forth with pomp now playing seaward into hazy east now westward into blaze of declining sun absorbed in game yet absorbed in friendship of boy love hot a fire clean a trickle of ice water on glacier knowledge of talk have made frank able to turn away from bad business of adams letter instead of brooding on irremediable worst of took hold of be best by side be david friend of friend now with arm linked in now excitedly addressing cupped ball with largest driver now brilliantly slicing among untrodden sand hill now dancing with exultation at success of shot be wholly beyond expectation now half whispering to oh rippingest day then followed lawn tennis till be so dark that ball must hardly be seen at in consequence david standing at net got hit full on end of nose bled with extraordinary profusion indeed have murder be committed that night at naseby a frank said when went down for hurried dip before dressing for dinner must have required sherlock holmes to draw certain quite erroneous conclusion that deed have be done in david bedroom body carried down to beach afterwards with idea of being taken away out by ebbing tide seaward current slop pail with blood stained water analysed by professor pepper found to be mammalian must be discovered in bedroom at interval down path to beach further trace of same incriminating gore cool sea water put end to david bleeding a dressed began to feel delightfully uncomfortable a in attic of baxminster so grimly gravely did frank reconstruct history of crime with fearful imaginative detail thrown in little way from on beach be something vague black humped up frank suddenly pointed at do know what be asked david in whisper black thing what body said frank of course be nonsense david peered at through gloom frank suddenly gave deep hollow groan startled quite awfully wasnt utterly dead explained tried to call for help couldnt call loud a throat be cut from ear to ear just groaned body be that of boy of fifteen tall for age david well nourished david must not help have to run in bare foot to where supposed corpse lay kicked came back only seaweed said now murderer did in room say mean cut well nourished boy throat there then carried down to beach wont do there be only quite few drop of blood on way down if throat have be cut from ear to ear thered be more blood not at said murderer held two edge of wound togetherno hed want hand to carry bodyhe pinned edge of wound together withwith safety pin so that only just leaked carried down to beach like then took out pin because have saving disposition let boy bleed to death a said thought tide must carry away didnt be found there next morning lobster have got at though howked piece out of there lobster for dinner to night then police traced bloodstain to bedroom found slop pail be kept in prison till be sixteen then hung at norwich what did heii dont know be corpse murderer youre said frank pin be put back in pin cushion on dressing table where saw just now there be stain on that looked like rust werent rust be be blood said david mammalian frank looked hastily round for more material for horror saw fisherman coming down steep path just behind carrying two lobster pot be luck for david have not seen being employed in putting shoe on frank went on without pause after that beach at naseby said be not place where prudent people cared to be after sunset especially during month of august particularly onon august tenth be exact day when murder be committed prudent people avoided for there be doubt be haunted figure be often seen coming down steep path just behind carrying ghastly burden david looked quickly round with intention of reassuring that there be one there be dreadful mistake there be frank after one glance at figure have not looked at path again good lord said david in whisper there something coming down now coming straight towards then saw more distinctly gave great cackle of laughter oh oh oh only fisherman with lobster pot said did give turn said that awfully well when looked round saw that old buffer coming down must have screamed say do lobster really eat deaders whenever can get there be good many about now too cook told that one be going to have for dinner to night have man finger in claw when brought up to house best one oh dry up shouted david youve foul mind frank laughed oh kid be immortal day over yet man eating lobster be in turn eaten by man after dinner frank read to mother david neglected atalanta after played ridiculous game till bedtime frank room david communicated with other a undressed further detail embellishment of horror be added to murder story through open door to one of frank most gruesome invention there have be response looking in saw that david be kneeling by bed at that went back to room again silence be not of long duration in moment david called to what be last frank said sounded jolly beastly wasnt attending frank repeated david squealed a drew bed clothes up to chin think thats enough said will have gory nightmare oh hasnt be jolly day ripping good night david good night what pity cant be morning again frank lay long awake night before slept slid out of bed followed david example chapter xi david with tip of tongue stuck out at corner of mouth be engaged in delicate apparently until know reason meaningless task of lashing two pen together with piece of cotton so respective nib must be fixed at particular distance apart from other distance a took pain to measure accurately be exactly that between first fourth line on piece of scribbling paper if be neatly doneand david with deft finger be doing very neatly indeedit will be clear that if pen be dipped in ink one writes certain word along first line of paper second pen duly adjusted will simultaneously be writing same word along fourth line similarly when first pen be engaged in second line other will be engaged on fifth thus provided pen be securely lashed behave reasonably sheet of scribbling paper of sort hold twenty line can be filled with hexameter from given part of highly over rated adventure of pious neas in time that without contrivance must take to transcribe ten of line boy moreover such adult a still preserve brain of moderate ingenuity will easily guess why pen in david very superior contraption be lashed together at distance of three line for be lashed together at distance of one even two line apart engaging scheme by two line be written simultaneously must be much more easily detected a david have to write out fewer than five hundred line of piffling neid thus hoped to be quit of task in time that must take le ingenious devil to write two hundred fifty be already getting dark at close of half holiday afternoon towards end of february bag while david be engaged in preparatory process be making tea for in study shared together be considerably larger one than have inhabited during first year david belonging seemed to have grown proportionately to own limb still usurped by far greater portion of available room task though tiresome be not one required much concentration of attention be mere dull transcribing work must quite well converse a be going on besides be very short time since have copied out same page before have certain familiarity with finished adjusting pen found that have got distance to nicety gripping on place where handle crossed dipped in ink then a refinement of ingenious engineering took bag inkpot put in place that two pen be dipped simultaneously infandum regina jubes said what awful gasser neas be talked straight off for two book suppose dido didnt go to sleep cause be so mad keen on why cant copy out something decent like keats swinburne instead of mouldy old johnny must really rather like perhaps thats why dont let said bag giving cup of tea shouldnt wonder if be thanks awfully bag did put four lump of sugar in oh then two more please a regard patent pen of course there be certain risk that owlers of course be mr howliss will spot will have to do again aint likely three line apart great security in three line apart youve spent most of time half writing line said bag know dont seem to be able to keep out of row dont want to be late cut chapel go out of bound dont seem to be able to help adam jawed morning said didnt know what to do with im sure couldnt tell maddox be rather sick with too matter more say play goat too much doesnt

difficulty of managing two pen with success be wonderfully uniform written in david neat vigorous hand ill get on with page of if like suggested bag fellow say write exactly like thanks thats jolly good of said david do write awfully like wonder why used not to a when maddox spotted handwriting in crib oh suppose being with said bag vaguely knowing quite well that have long tried to write like david out of affection admiration for pertained to pal ill begin at line hundred will so that when get there can skip next hundred go on at line two hundred yes thats trick said david thanks awfully sure doesnt bore say will lash couple more pen for dont think must get on well with said bag lent term about half of be now over seemed to david very poor affair in comparison with other term rugby football be finished with cricket of course did not exist weather have be consistently diluvian so that golf link where have intended to pas most of leisure be generally half flooded other fellow be true be busy on athletics david seeing through frank eye have sympathy with just running when there be ulterior object except to run quicker than anybody else in fact there be game except five racquet demand for court being largely in excess of supply must not get one a often a energy needed thus since there be so little that might legitimately be done have chiefly occupied in breaking school rule a bag have said have really passed most of half in writing line though took time merely bottled up instead of relieving of exuberant vitality furthermore since there be not slightest chance of getting out of middle fifth at easter only genius of whom be certainly not one did that david have argued that le time spent over work better worst of be there be so very little to do maddox have jawed david on subject of playing goat before suggesting that devil have entered into be not quite that really be only rampageous energy of david youth seeking outlet be growing enormously a sometimes happened process did not make languid slack seemed only to increase vitality stirred bubbled in a in long legged colt making throw up limb scamper simply because be vigorous growing escapade general obstreperousness somewhat exercised friend a well a house master who at present moment while david bag be writing line together be talking to prefect about house in general affair of david in particular general line a have be said be to let senior boy run house while enjoyed tranquillity that management brought david persistent adventure have protruded into notice consultation with maddox

work like good little sap cant work in dark let let just get at said maddox a david dodged round table ill teach david squealed with hideous resonance well wasnt fault said only jabbed with knife wow spare have mercy upon wow frank drove david to corner punched heavily in rib boxed ear smacked head summary effectual justice being then done observed david patent lashed pen know that trick said what

hundred line be use trying not to laugh idea of owlers jawing seal be too much for maddox three went off into peal of laughter didnt spot seal at asked maddox at length rather not went tottering out at end of hour just reminding seal to show up to morrow david took up double pen again oh wish somebody else have done said for missed owlers jawing seal be idea maddox got up well youll get into worse trouble if dont look out said im talking over with adam oh may come listen outside door may not well stick up for said david encouragingly maddox went back to house master still giggling well

frightful cheek said maddox well dont know only reminded that know more about racquet than do be perfectly true well be off tell david not to make so conspicuous maddox went upstairs again after to study where fag be putting out tea thing david of course after promotion into fifth form have ceased to be in state of servitude successor be small bony youth called jevons who usually have cold in

with tried to encourage to look world in face little more wash little more not drag foot a walked be dismal change from being attended to by adroit willing david david be true sometimes smashed thing by running with from excess of zeal in cleaning inside of tea cup be better than finding forgotten tea leaf in pot one day crumb other foreign substance in sugar little bit of butter sticking to bottom of plate though maddox be kind to spiritless youth david on occasion when came across be severely critical seemed to dreadful affair that place must be filled by so abject specimen mixed with contempt for jevons there be certain jealousy that must go in out of maddoxs study a chose joylessly perform office in david have delighted fifth form boy a be must have loved to continue fagging for maddox for sake of seeing that be properly looked after for intimacy must give now since age place sundered so widely in ordinary school life david necessarily saw much le of than before knew that must be so did not make like jevons more there be sound of cheerful whistling going on from bath room where david be washing up on own account when maddox came up to study ceased a jevons went in to fill kettle half cracked admonitory voice took place well have put nice bit of butter in milk jug to day askedthe voice be a unmistakably david a whistleor have rubbed round edge of tea cup lord rinse

pas on adams message of course can be swished if like nothing easier head make feel bit cheap first afterwards lay on david sighed heavily suppose ought to promise to be absolute record for saintliness said use something go fizz inside cant help playing fool wish be older younger if be older suppose must see what rotter be if be younger must simply do what told know youre right then come minute cant help doing something foolish on account if know what mean david looked round study again made feel rather melancholy hadnt seen much of frank term for frank have be working hard again sense of distance be apart in world of school severed be greater now that be independent person in fifth than have be when be frank fag in remove intimacy have be theirs at naseby be no longer possible at school at moment also tooth began suddenly to ache gave series of staccato stab with really brilliant touch gosh ive got toothache said suddenly begun hurting like hell sorry said frank

be done again bag friendly help be vain labour also bag have be opposed to patent pen system on ground that be liable to detection though theoretically saved time didnt save so much a nobody must wield double pen with same swiftness a single one consequently made renewed offer of help with regard to reimposed imposition david have to stop in at twelve next day after excruciating interview with dentist instead of playing racquet parsimonious dentist quite refused to whip out aching tooth have done with pang to david have strung up said must be saved salvation thereof included whizzing drill stuffing of with something painful to feeling obnoxious to taste implied further visit day after to morrow then followed brief interval of delightful happening while baleful star hid tooth be comforted reinforced so that must be bitten on again even with nut unexpected mid term largesse of ten shilling from father crown from margery be almost insanely noble of turned up with bag for partner david won school junior five competition be triumph of juiciest kind for europe must have known that bag be five player of class at portion of civilised europe saw final be aware that david practically played single butting about from side to side of court while bag effaced in manner of shadow against wall so a not to be in way meant sovereign have to be expended in purchase of small silver commemorative cup to sum added five shilling out of tip from home bought for black polished stand of pear wood with plated shield on be engraved name that of innocuous partner first of cup announced when came home jolly well will not be last wont be ripping when have whole shelf full of im blowed if have tea in ordinary cup pour in here bag ill drink good health for getting out of way

unplayable owing to flood have remembered word of frank if want to improve go out with dozen ball practise mashie shot on to green when youve got there putt out so for last week david have slacked out with mashie putter found green be not under water have put hint into practice be dull then there be nothing else to do reward looked within reach have be entered with handicap of fifteen thanks to practice be already stroke two better than that have met maddox in second round receiving eleven stroke have beaten then encountered gregson whom played on level term emerging by skin of teeth from have wiped up floor with cruikshank who gave six brought to semi final then from behind cloud out popped baleful star again shed dreadful beam on with peculiar effulgence first of maddox went up to cambridge for scholarship examination david who have never known what school be like without sense of being there who be first person saw when woke in morning last before went to sleep at night felt lost rudderless next in dormitory be empty bed day long knew there be chance of frank dropping in calling to study then bag got influenza disappeared also leaving david bereft of two great friend to find out for first time how solid comfortable pal bag be then came semi final of golf handicap in be completely off game got beaten on level term by mild spotty joynes to whom david felt competent to give four stroke in round such proved on fatal afternoon not to be case be gusty boisterous day david liable at time to be rather wild given to exuberant slicing sliced in manner probably without parallel with loose arm must drive very long ball to day be disadvantage rather than otherwise since sent to remote cover point be exasperating joynes who usually have honour exasperated further for having gone not far straight up middle of course overwhelmed david with sort of envious condolence by jove what long ball must say a david drive started on insane career wish must drive like oh wind catching bad luck look where going mile away itll be rotten bad luck if on road again david must make astonishingly feeble putt joynes again showed sympathy pity wasnt little harder be dead on line wish must putt a straight a hullo youve missed second one too leaf three for youd much better make putt out can miss anything hullo gone in sorry sort of thing goaded david to madness presently must bear no longer say must mind not talking quite so much said politely awfully rotten of think put off upon joynes hermetically sealed lip till came to fourteenth hole where match came to abject end be sufficiently depressing there be quietly sympathetic bag to be comfort be there bag to get tea ready struck david really for first time to day how invariably bag did must not find milk jug when did smelled sour for have not be washed up there be nothing to eat must have to go up to school shop to get cake be deplorable on way met gregson victim in third round suppose disposed of joynes right blaze asked no disposed of easily a anything said david hurrahi mean sorry see bet shilling must congratters said david insincerely wind have turned bitterly cold spike of sleet half frozen have begun to fall a came back from shop again seemed to david part of conspiracy to make life a disagreeable uncomfortable a possible nature have joined in did not want to be unreasonable if on top of thing be going to snow felt that even job patience must break down snow ruined everything be incompatible with form of exercise mournfully went back to solitary study when have drawn curtain pulled chair up to hot water pipe so that must rest foot on divided attention between ravenshoe held in one hand have got to where gu flora be naughty in church tea in other thing seemed to cheer up little outside evidently weather have got worse for wind squealed round corner of house on pane behind thick red curtain must hear muffled patter of driven snow after there be bright side to snow for must mean that there must be prayer in house to night must not have to turn out to go to chapel maddox must be back on saturday be thursday evening already also bag have written to from sick room saying that be better expected to be out again by sunday david spirit began to improve kicked off shoe in order to enjoy greater intimacy with hot water pipe burst into shout of laughter a flora announced that have left purse on piano must have be poor heart did not rejoice next morning for during night wind dropped so smart frost have set in snow lay hard crusted on ground must be clearly possible to go tobogganing on slope of down at twelve at breakfast moreover there be postcard for from frank with highly coloured photograph of great quadrangle at trinity on back couple of line to say must be back by mid day on saturday that cambridge be topping place warmed david heart to think that frank must have remembered with prospect of tobogganing at twelve cheer of frosty shining sun spirit went up to pitch of inexpressible buoyancy a slid along trodden path to go to ten oclock school path have be swept in schoolyard between various class room rest of broad space lay white untrodden david got there while still wanted five minute to ten hung about with few friend outside class room door till hour must strike there be quiet exchange of small snowballing furtively delivered for be very strictly forbidden in quadrangle david have just lobbed one not bigger than racquet ball with extraordinary success just between collar neck of joynes who have not vaguest idea who have done now be moulding larger one in hand with absent eye in joyness direction shoulder trembling with suppressed laughter for joyness attempt to scoop snow out be really very funny when gregson came up to jolly good shot said saw bet cant chuck snowball right across quad bet can said david in one word put down book took couple of quick step discharged snowball have prepared have aimed high howitzer sort of shot at blank wall opposite went rather to left at exact second of throwing door of master common room opened out came owlers lord ive got squealed david though have not intended to get anybody immediately behind owlers came head david be quite right snowball got owlers just in middle of waistcoat head saw very quickly delicately group of boy among whom david be standing dispersed into two class room stood side by side david with amid stifled snigger took place immediately afterwards head entered stiffly rustling did boy here throw snowball across court just now asked david stood up at once be good not doing that for unless gave up be quite certain that there must be punishment for whole of two form in corner of court be not to be thought of blaize said head yes sir very well knew that snowballing in court be forbidden yes sir said david who be house master mr adam sir be for present after school david saw head talking to adam remembering adams warning felt prepared for worst tobogganed without particular zest subsequently day adam remarked laconically so youre determined to have way david next morning school porter entered class room with small blue paper presented to owlers peered at in short sighted manner blaize to go to head at twelve said going to head at twelve implied knocking at door of small empty class room barely furnished next sixth form room head be there waiting standing in front of fire looking vexed blaize have be talking to house master about said tell that have given great deal of trouble term tell also that have warned that next time made nuisance of yourself must send to did get that warning yes sir said david very well then will give good whipping said isnt for just throwing snowball understand for accumulation of silly disobedient thing have done have be gated several time term have have frequent imposition form master give exactly similar report of punishment dont seem to have made impression on so will try plan use going on like im not going to have rule be made for to obey whereas seem to think may break not exactly a please be not made without purpose be going to show that can not be broken indefinitely without great inconvenience david have not quite allowed for horrid effect of head tongue have faced fact that be going to be swished have not faced fact that head must take stuffing out of first so to speak just when wanted stuffing be not going to whip for amusement continued walking towards cupboard far le for yours be whipping because wish to give something by to remember that must keep rule instead of breaking reasonable method have be tried with dont succeed be going to treat a if werent reasonable hurt dont like doing will like much le want to understand that lower method of treating boy like who be quite big enough clever enough to know better have be behaving like unreasonable animal instead of sensible boy be going to be sharply reminded to have more sense in future now get ready david have not imagined must be pleasant be great deal more unpleasant than have anticipated head never swished unless meant there be such thing a light swishing that fact be most clearly comprehended by david during next minute be there consolation from executioner when be over will do said richly deserve what have given dont let have to send for again david went out biting lip have really be very hard not to cry out under stinging blow considering how very abject felt before have begun almost worst part of be waiting between stroke be delivered with pause for thought got through without giving away went down to house feeling rather glad that bag be in sick room since interval to pull together again in solitude be certainly desirable hardly have got into study when there came tap at door maddox entered hullo david said ive just got back did get postcard half wondered whether must come up to station say whats up just be swished said david what for accumulation so that blasted head told throwing snowball finished oh infernal as said maddox jolly well deserved at that devil le entered into david anyhow never deserved being expelled said very evilly frank looked at moment then without word left room for few second david be not in least sorry for speech be smarting if frank have to say be that deserved be glad to have made frank smart too then with sudden sense of sick regret remembered who frank be frank have be to on moment be out of study off down passage to frank went in without knocking say im damnable chap said im frightfully sorry dont know if can forgive put out rather timid hand instantly be clasped held didnt mean said felt mad david old chap said frank stood there for minute in silence for really there be nothing more to be said then david smiled think id better not make as of more said beastly good idea said frank chapter xii david be sitting on step in front of cricket pavilion in school field with pad on leg glove on hand icy lump of nervous fear inside canvas shirt to take place of heart nobody paid least attention to gave single word of encouragement cared at for panic stricken condition because everybody be utterly absorbed in what be going on at wicket whole school whole staff be there watching end of final tie in house match in absolute tense silence except when run be scored smart piece of fielding prevented one being scored then roar went up from round ground cut off again suddenly a if hand have be placed over mouth of many throated beast a bowler received ball again during pause between over buzz of talk rose a if cork have be taken out of bottle where sonorous bee be confined talk be silenced a next over began probably such final a have be seen before did not detract from tenseness of excitement present position arrived at through many delightful adventure be that adams wanted twenty more run to win with two wicket to fall maddox luckily be in still cruikshank miserable performer with bat be in with if of got out forlorn trembling david have to take place last wicket to totter down step walk apparently about twenty mile to wicket in full light of day with eye of world on maddox of course be only hope of salvation david cruikshank must even by most optimistic friend be considered a capable of doing anything getting out against such strength of bowling a have against in order to make david quite happy comfortable about there be indelibly written on tablet of memory fact that have got out second ball in first inning without a school paper must record on saturday having troubled scorer what if paper added that in second inning proved a independent of scorer again so while group of boy round regaling while on bag of cherry basket of strawberry seethed with pleasant irresponsible excitement david be merely perfectly miserable a waited for roar must go up round field to show wicket have fallen must not be abruptly cut off like tumult succeeded run piece of fielding toveyites must go on screaming well bowled well caught until marched out across field that must think of in hour of waiting be fact that have be completely bowled by second ball received in first inning after having be completely beaten by first tomlin who have kindly sent down fatal delivery be bowling now doubt must be bowling still when went in match have be full of entrancing agonising vicissitude adams have batted first piling up respectable total of hundred eighty two gave cause for complaint then toveys have gone in have be ignominiously dismissed by cruikshank mellor for eighty one sage be inclined to think that match be a good a over have followed on instead of being dismissed for eighty one again have amassed huge total of three hundred twenty nine cruikshank demon of first inning have be hit completely off length david have be put on a first change not having bowled at in first inning glorious personal result of afternoon work gave encouragement now for mind be filled to exclusion of else with fact that in previous appearance with bat not ball tomlin have beaten twice bowled once yesterday when be bowling toveys must hing with bowled captain anstruther in first over after being hit twice to boundary by have proved altogether too much for rest of side wicket be fast true there be reason for not being able to play except excellent one that bowled extremely well be left handed with very high action have a accessory cultivated terrifying prance up to wicket with crooked run change of foot in middle of like stumbling horse after delivered slow high ball while now then not too often laced one in a hard a ever must with precisely same delivery in end have taken seven wicket for ninety run while rest of three hundred twenty nine have be scored off other bowler of side who have captured two wicket one being run out between there came roar from ring of spectator round field shout of derisive laughter from group of adams boy standing near david forgetting everything else for moment added piercing cat call whistle to general hubbub tomlin have changed field with obvious intention of getting maddox caught in slip sending mid on there making fourth of then proceeded to bowl little wide of off stump maddox have let three ball go by fourth pulled round to exactly where mid on have be scored four for oh great stroke one must tell perhaps not even maddox how be done there be one more ball of over be wonderfully important that maddox must score one three five off so a to get bowling again be use attempting to do anything with ball be must do to play so cruikshank got bowling well be better that cruikshank must face crawley than tomlin if only tomlin must receive telegram saying that father mother three brother four sister if have be seriously ill that have to go home absolutely minute be clear that cruikshank be nervousdavid knew of somebody else who be nervous toobut presented dull solid wall to two straight ball then with extreme caution lobbed one up in direction of long off ran like devil come on shouted to maddox for be just a anxious that maddox must get bowling a be rest of adams maddox wanted run a much a anybody be completely taken by surprise at impudence of there be cruikshank half way up pitch meant wicket lost if told to go back so too ran like devil situation only lasted couple of second made up in quality what lacked in quantity if long off who already have ball in hand have thrown in to end from cruikshank have started have good chance of getting maddox run out while if threw in to bowler close to have practical certainty of running cruikshank out be not nearly so important simultaneously wicket keeper bowler shouted end threw wildly to about middle of pitch there be fifteen more run to get to win seemed to david a watched forgetting for moment two maddox be feeling strain especially after last unmerited escape spooned ball feebly in air short only just short of point next though scored two off be most dangerous stroke a unlike a possible to usual crisp cutting still might be only that there be something dreadfully unexpected about ball caused to mi time if only must kindly not mi time ball for little while longer then came last ball of over hit out at completely missed be nearly bowled so cruikshank have to face fatal tomlin there ensued piercing moment there be appeal for catch at wicket confidently made be not upheld cruikshank proceeded to play like clockwork doll imperfectly wound up after failing to play two ball altogether hit out a hard a must at third intending to drive snicked between leg for one gave maddox bowling again off last ball scored one thus secured bowling again little faint glimmer of hope came into david heart there be bye for two left eleven run only to get perhaps perhaps must not have to bat at if only maddox must hit three four in succession feat of be perfectly capable match must be over david thought must be quite impossible ever to stop shouting again for nothing in whole world mattered to now except that must win nobody mattered except two white figure at wicket yet one be frank david so far mastered trembling knee a to go to scoring box to see how many have made score be just eighty so that must not get century even if scored rest rather pity certainly nobody must care le than frank at third ball opened shoulder gave little skip out to drive celestial stroke be ball flew along ground rather to right of long off seemed a if must go for four odious fellow just reached stopping with foot made beautiful return instead of four be single only cruikshank have bowling roar have gone up on account of smart fielding of last ball be instantly silent again now there went up not so soon coming to end for cruikshanks leg stump have be sent flying there be ten more run to get david got up put on cap then with great deliberation took off again didnt know if wanted cap not be immensely important to settle that be sunny sun be still high must not really come in eye certainly wanted something to drink for throat have suddenly become gritty dry like side of match box wanted to run away hide to do anything in world rather than cross that interminable stretch of grass across cruikshank be now walking a soon a cruikshank reached pavilion must have to go impossible feat have to be accomplished bag have be sitting by thoughtfully eating cherry after david have refused be long since have have clear consciousness of bag of one else except white figure in field at awful moment bag proved friend in need oh david how ripping will be said in voice of complete conviction that maddox win cock house match for up till moment possibility have literally not entered david head have be entirely absorbed in prospect of losing for suggestion put little bit of heart into instead of cold fear by gad said drawing long breath went down step on to level field moment got moving even though be only moving to place of execution found that be not so impossible a have appeared in anticipation have seemed out of question at crucially critical period in history of cricket be more important than history of world to face now there be going out alone bat in hand did not sink into earth fall down with few hollow groan then two other thing encouraged further neither of have contemplated a tall slight figure detached from crowd in front of pavilion real cheer went up not from boy of house only from school in general told that be not cheering david blaize only last actor in enthralling piece of drama in spite of felt much healthier for second thing encouraged be far better for maddox leaving wicket have come half way across ground to meet walk back with david old chap isnt ripping said even a bag have said that just jolliest thing must happen dont bother about run theyll come right just keep end up dont take risk bowling absolute piffle so long a dont try to hit then have to part company going to wicket there be so david remembered with hideous distinctness two more ball of over after taking middle leg have look round two point struck most be that other wicket seemed nightmarishly close to be bowled at from that there be apparently about thirty fielder then a crawley walked away to get run rest of david nerve now that time for action have come be completely restored to have never felt cooler clearer of eye in life received first ball at first thought be going to be full pitch then saw be yorker saw in time heard sweet a honey to mouth chunk with hit centre of bat close to end there be doubt about second ball be half volley well outside leg stump david made one futile attempt to be prudent resist temptation be quite incapable of danced out yard smote for be worth heard solid impact of bat telling have hit correctly andthere be ball already beyond high above mid on be not worth while starting to run since be boundary hit if ever there be one andalmost more importantthis be end of over opposite saw shaking fist at a roar of applause went up mingled with shout from particular friend of well hit blaze smack em about david swaggered out of ground to slap perfectly true place on wicket with bat looked up with deprecatory smile at frank sorry have to said little devil said other silence more intense than ever settled down over ground a last shout consequent on david immortal feat died away for tomlin proceeded to send down perhaps best over have ever bowled in life once completely beat maddox must have shaved varnish off bail from rest batsman made attempt to score being quite satisfied with stopping at end anstruther looked round field wace take over at crawleys end will said then that period deadly for newly arrived batsman have to be gone through when fresh bowler have few practice ball rearranges field made david fret long on have to be moved two yard nearer one yard to right cover point have to go much deeper point have to come in little slip went through mystic dance being concluded wace proceeded david opened with appalling stroke must have be easily caught by cover if only wace have not moved thereupon wace brought in again so david with even worse stroke spooned ball over head so that if have not be moved second time must have caught for scored one amid derisive exultant yell maddox hit at with bat a crossed other there be four more run to get then end came maddox played two ball with great care unfortunate wace then sent full pitch to leg there came sound of striking bat next moment ball bounded against paling by pavilion maddox have played last house match frank waited to see ball hit paling then ran across pitch to david didnt tell so said wasnt ripping that must do hullo theyre coming for let run round ground crowd have broken up wildly shouting going towards pavilion others headed by detachment from adams streaming out on to pitch two boy ran towards pavilion dodging first few of be caught carried in starfishwise then again again first maddox alone then together have to come out on to balcony while house school generally shouted hoarse for entrancing finish indeed honour be fairly divided for if maddoxs batting have saved situation to day situation must have be impossible to save if have not be for david bowling yesterday then by degree crowd dispersed shouting died two sat for while there happiest pair perhaps in england blunt telegraphic with other david little devil said frank frightful cheek hitting that four second ball received too david gave cackle of laughter dont rub in said apologised juicy shot too say tomlin sent down over of corker after nearly spewed with anxiety said frank absolute limit of over wicked fellow tomlin quoth david glad didnt get of som damn glad else of course nobody can bat except said david cant anyhow weve won have really dont interrupt must have added that can bowl cant said david getting level filthy exercise ill take down to bathe if dont bar washing then ill take to school shop may eat there be lucky im flush right oh thanks awfully said david wont be flush long got up to go at door maddox paused best of day ive have at school david said same here said david school bathing did not begin for hour maddox have sixth form privilege of bathing whenever chose adam whom ran to catch up on way down gave david leave to go with have dutifully delightedly watched ball of match have helped to carry david into pavilion a there be chance of assisting at entry of maddox yes by mean yes youyou blest pair of siren said quoting from milton ode be to be sung at concert at end of term take care of david jonathan dont let sink from being top heavy with pride will want to bowl next year trotted on for little in order to arrive at bathing place in greatest possible heat say wasnt that ripping of said david didnt know knew be pal jolly cute observed maddox how did know dont go about together in public lord here head coming lucky ive got leave have gone through gate into master garden beyond lay bathing place be penetrable only by master by sixth form there be turning back avoiding what be to david rather formidable meeting be quite illogical that must find so since have leave have not met head since interview in disused class room halo of terror still shone about head nodded kindly to boy a dropped into walking pace took cap off then stopped fine inning of yours said congratulate too blaize lot to expect wasnt that must bowl mr toveys eleven out one day keep up wicket to win match next very glad did successfully david still rather awed shifted from one foot to other thanks awfully sir said iive got leave to bathe from mr adam head looked at moment with certain merriment lurking below gravity quite sure asked david saw be joke laughed want just word with maddox said head will go on blaize head waited moment about blaize wanted to speak to maddox said how be getting on have to give good whipping last term be moremore rational he come on tremendously sir said maddox he getting on excellently im glad think that because believe he one of most promising boy weve got know must think better than of maddox wondered how on earth head knew that adam might know how did head dont want cricket to interfere with work said middle fifth have to write essay last week told mr howliss to send in to to look over two three be dreadful rubbish blaizes be excellent a youre trinity scholar a well a being captain of eleven can see point of view do think he getting cricket out of focus ought to be higher in form know maddox shook head oh dont think blaize be bit unbalanced about cricket sir said always rub in cricket doesnt matter at least usually do though didnt to day because couldnt after hed bowled like ill rub in again after to morrow why after to morrow asked head because be going to put into twenty two to night sir though doesnt know yet must let enjoy bit then there eleven against sixteen on saturday next after whole record in house match just question whether oughtnt to play for eleven there be four place left trinity scholar have certainly got absorbed in captain of eleven mean have chance of school colour asked head yes sir if go on developing like said maddox five week yet to lord match easily possible may be best slow bowler in school maddox paused moment hell have to practice lot said hell have to think about lot three quarter of slow bowler be brain know sir must rather didnt try to bring on at cricket wouldnt notice hasnt slightest idea how good be even if have well said head maddox dropped surname altogether see david best chap who ever lived said be tremendous friend if didnt put in twenty two even hed think be perfectly all right a youve talked to about sir want to tell ill do what think best for must naturally put into twenty two evening because deserves a said be thinking of playing for eleven next week if think not if think must do more good round to be kept back well will there fellow in school uppish if mean that be head wanted have got at david character a seen by maddox with far more completeness than maddox knew do just what seems best to a captain of eleven said there be lot of fellow who want watching take work off shoulder if know that elder steady men be doing watching for good luck to of if live till youll never find better thing than friend at least havent maddox found david wallowing in tepid water at interval making hazardous experiment from high header board be instructive a showing flight of heavy body through space be occasionally followed by further interesting result a showing what happened when heavy body flatly met flat incompressible material thereafter went to school shop david ate way so to speak from in at one door to out at other be long sumptuous process for place be full congratulation be hurled at tomlin diabolical be there among crowd taking defeat in wide minded manner thought have once twice during last over said maddox to fiendish over tommy tommy considered twasnt very bad one said think must have liked to have sent down to blaize instead of jolly good match though hullo blaize youre rotten bad bat know ill stand strawberry mess be perfectly impossible for david not to feel elated at sitting down to strawberry mess with two member of eleven in full light of day in sight of school generally having dreamed night day of being good in house match not to feel exalted when dream have merged into reality so far exceeded imaginings in little while maddox tomlin began to speak in undertone david rose with sense private conversation be going forward think ill be getting back to house said thanks awfully for strawberry mess tomlin wait minute said maddox im coming down in second go blow out little more david thought part of wisdom not to do strolled outside to wait for friend glorious a thing have be there be nothing so glorious a frank have be associated in that friendship meant more to than cricket sort of open recognition of till now age place in school have necessarily divided in public so to day be best of delicious happening when frank joined went off together head asked after afternoon david said frank made inquiry told be fairly rotten david did not rise at always stick up for chap observed anything else yes may a well tell a everybody else will know by chapel time fact be im putting into twenty two to night on saturday next week youre playing in eleven sixteen match for eleven david stopped quite dead then thought saw frank have tried to get rise out of just now failed of course be trying again wasnt really quite nice of to try to get rise out of over such matter then didnt know how dreadfully david cared oh jolly funny said walked on again david do think im such brute a to try to get rise out of with sort of thing asked frank b b do mean true asked david suddenly stammering as thats what wanted to consult tommy about agrees cant have kid like bowling eleven out so youve jolly well got to bowl sixteen out instead ill take away twenty two cap if dont oh frank cant quite believe said david whats for what have done thats one of bad point a told head said frank said be filthily conceited lord said david well congratters on twenty two can bring preparation to study if like ill give construe havent got work to do come of being scholar of trinity remarked david fled frank have written out list of promotion into twenty two when david came to study with copy of dipus coloneus be lesson for next day pushed over to ive stuck in first said to prepare for appearance next saturday now well leave silly business alone whats work dipus coloneus yes twenty five line of chorus thats simply beastly said david finding place there line frank looked over shoulder oh not without merit said now look out word dont know then try to make something of for hour after ill give construe talking oh wont construe first asked david itll save lot of trouble did suppose wanted to save trouble asked frank david sighed thought might said rather flat working after afternoon isnt youve got to learn that people like sophocles matter more than silly house match twasnt silly house match said david dont talk david looked round lend dictionary then said ive left mine in study david have very vivid sense of beauty of word though took time to whistle mind away from splendour of afternoon from glory of list lay on table must soon be displayed before eye of entire school became conscious before long that word of beastly chorus be open before be beautiful thing meaning so dictionary told be beautiful also for be about horse nightingale thicket ivy colour of winethis be rather puzzling unless perhaps meant crme de mentheand clustering narcissus then by degree became absorbed in time be slightly ashamed at being able to be interested in mere greek chorus when name lay on table a heading list of promotion into twenty two absorption gained on why ripping said to under breath whistling softly hunted up jewel of word then lost again diving into wonderful translucent depth gosh ive done more than twenty five line said at length never noticed say give construe frank ive be more than hour want to hear how sound in english frank drew chair up to david so that must share same book right oh said let read through first be education of david frank be tremendously anxious to construe beautiful passage well took five minute more going over while david glance fed on list of twenty two promotion then began stranger said blast that wont do sound american guest suggested david yes thats better o guest in land of horseman thou hast come to most fair of earth home to gleaming kolonos frequented by nightingale bubble liquidly in shelter of green glade making habitation amid wine dark ivy untrodden bower of god myriad berried unseen of sun where dionysus master of revel ever tread companied by nymph nursed o o oh said david pushing back yellow hair still rather shy of liking fed with heavenly dew sweet cluster of narcissus be flowering morn by morn immemorial crown of great goddess golden beamed crocus be blossom dwindle ever sleepless spring whence come wandering water of kephissus day flow in stainless tide over plain of earth ripening bosom giving speedy increase have choir of mus abhorred spot golden reined aphrodite maddox paused thats twenty five line said oh ripping said david really be absolute do go on told have merit said frank proceeded to end of chorus why better than atalanta said david at conclusion despite barbarian instinct thing like beauty of greek literature might perhaps be thought about hardly talked of maddox however have such notion of course be said time if work frightfully hard love youll find a head told other day that simply laugh at thought of translating at youll know cant be translated will be reward of work for will mean greek have got into blood that part of do mean head like asked david same think must sooner translate like dont understand must if have heard other day have plato lesson with instead of going through single line of something set off talked to for whole hour about athens life led there never heard anything so splendid must go up to acropolis in morning look at frieze pheidias have put up in parthenon procession of horse boy riding to temple on athene birthday showed picture of be mountedoh lord have good seatsand others be still putting horse bridle on one horse be rubbing foreleg with nose tother way round pheidias asked david yes biggest sculptor there ever be far ahead of michelangelo rodin one when have seen that friendyou iswould sit on wall of acropolis looking over town out to mountain purple crown of mountain a called hymettus where honey came from pentelicus where got marble for parthenon onewhats nameoh parnes then to south must look over sea blue dim out towards salami a head said be trafalgar of athens where beat stinking persian then must lunch off grape fig cheese wrapped up in vine leaf yellow wine go down to theatre just below to hear perhaps very play by sophocles first performance end of excitement then perhaps must see pericles awfully handsome chap biggest prime minister there ever be queer ugly fellow must go by who must be socrates boy young men be fearfully keen about game quite a keen a be because used to date year by olympic game same a use ad bc lord im jawing wish must tell a head did oh go on said david well wasnt only game that be so keen about loved sculpture painting writing so much that one ever touched at before since be consummate age so head said then when came to fighting little potty place like attica no bigger than small english county just wiped persian up in everything so head told athenian of great age be type of perfect physical intellectual life oh david let save up go to athens rather why did roman walk over frank got up bell for chapel have begun because became corrupt beastly what awful pity say made feel awfully keen with construe telling what head said havent thought about twenty two forfor ten minute one got to try to get at by sapping yes thats how youll get to love sound almost worth while said david liked game a well thats comfort frank took up straw hat took up also list lay on table come on said want to put up on notice board before chapel oh dont said david fellow will see will turn crimson when stand up for psalm one expects david volatile mind went back to greek talk pheidias be said yes sculptor man said frank david usually solid sleeper must not take usual plunge into dim depth night on getting into bed did not make particular effort to do so for be really waste of time not to lie awake when there be so many delightful thing to think about round round in head turned like bright wheel now be event of last three day house match in other word now more immediate happening of evening promotion into twenty two much huger honour of playing for eleven next week sparkled on wheel again sudden illumination with regard to greek fed contemplation up till now have not be real to that people who wrote tedious difficult thing have to learn be once a alive a that beauty have inspired to make play statue even a beauty have inspired keats swinburne until frank have given gist of head discourse never thought of play a being performed in theatre before audience who have not to look up word learn grammar consider what governed apparently isolated genitive account for irregular aorist be not bookworm scholar men boy who ran race crowned victor have trafalgar just a if be english be vague decidedly there be new light on matter concerning sophocles permeating thing be inspiring spirit frank who lay in bed next whose face must dimly see in light from unblinded open window just opposite then for first time be borne in upon david with sense of reality that in few week more five piece to be accurate frank must have left at thought pleasant interesting thing have so delightfully entertained waking hour be struck from mind sat up in bed giving little despairing groan hullo said frank softly awake too whats groaning about oh nothing said david lying down again well then what isnt about david slewed round in bed facing a leaned on elbow only five week to end of half whispered andand dont come back know foul be thinking of be keeping awake david be silent minute then frank spoke again im sorry to leave for whole heap of reason said one more than whats said david fellow called blaize thought must just like to tell now dont groan more go to sleep swell in twenty two right oh fellow called maddox said david chapter xiii david be sitting on bank below pavilion on last afternoon of term waiting for frank who be paying certain bill in town to join take cricket thing away to save time david have packed for emptying locker into cricket bag now own ready packed lay beside on grass plan be to sit here talk till chapel bell began when must take belonging down leave at lodge in readiness for bus to station next morning be last opportunity of being alone together for after chapel must have to go down to house to dress for concert after concert be house supper in honour of having won cricket cup must all be exceedingly public rejoiceful frank must have to make speech david be afraid must want to groan again instead of applauding be quite out of question a occasion be one of uproarious mirth last five week have passed with awful speed have worked good deal have played cricket good deal though have not got into eleven everything have be tremendously prosperous have be tried twice for eleven once against next sixteen once against team of old boy from cambridge in match have bowled with considerable success then weather have changed instead of dry crumbling wicket suited there have be ten day rain wicket be soft slow certainly must be for match at lord day after to morrow david have become about a much use a practical bowler a baby in arm must have be so crawley only morning have be given last place in eleven be absolutely right for crawley must bat a well in last school match have taken wicket made run slow ground suiting style in respect in same match maddox have scored hundred in inimitable style david have shouted hoarse thing be dead done with apart from cricket work have taken up good deal of time work mere silly work in class room taken by mr howliss have assumed different aspect have come out of talk with frank when translated chorus from dipus coloneus on occasion david have realised that pheidias be real person pericles real prime minister that socrates be jolly to young fellow told heavenly story about god have become people who went to theatre like anybody else went to olympia just a anybody now might go to oval have play writer like aristophanes who made just same sort of joke a people make nowadays out of evening too have resulted fact that david instead of occupying modest unassuming place way down middle fifth have heard to great astonishment name read out at top of distinguished form prize be consequence of presented that morning at prize giving by royal duchess who said be very much pleased be distinctly civil of thing be dead also have happened there be little more to happen little mattered there be concert in david be one of group of tenor who must take part in milton ode must be rather jolly there be delightful passage at end about o may soon renew that song name blest pair of siren have aroma about adam have quoted to maddox just after cock house match when have asked for leave to go down to bathe what good day have be perhaps best day of dead day then after concert must be uproarious house supper with farewell speech from frank david felt empty inside at thought field be speckled with group of boy straying about in idleness of last day sat on grass be playing stump cricket seemed unreasonably cheerful now then two three passed near exchanged friendly hullo with sometimes must ask to join in stroll david reply be always same sorry promised to wait here for chap then bag detached from passing group sat down by david must talk to with freedom oh bag feel beastly said what rot end of term be youre going to have rather decent time arent asked bag oh yes there cricket week at baxminster theyve asked to play in two match awfully good of to want to come stay with ill let know a soon a ever can depends on pater perhaps be going to switzerland come whenever like said faithful bag will be at home holiday think might enjoy there lot of rabbit potting in august know partridge in september be easy to shoot asked david lord yes get on right havent got eye well awfully good of must like to come if may dont care about

youll swagger horribly youll frank must not manage to pump up more consoling reflection be beside point so like sensible boy left alone went to point instead david old chap said dont believe two fellow ever have such good time a weve have must be rot to pretend not to be sorry that bit of have come to end dare say will have splendid time together again there doubt that be over on other hand must be equal rot not to feel jolly thankful for chance be million to one against ever coming across other at so buck up a said david have rolled over on to face at sat up picking bit of dry grass out

beast said david all right again be silent for while rather ripping verse in psalm morning said frank at length be there wasnt attending well seemed rather applicable thought for brother companion sake will wish thee prosperity just a if other david not be talking to school there chapel bell beginning sat still moment longer then frank rose must go david said wouldnt do to be late a last time give hand ill pull up david stretched out great brown paw frank hauled to foot david stood there second still holding good old psalm said chapter xiv david be sitting in front of fire in house master study one afternoon late in november occasionally reading sporting dramatic otherwise listening with strong inward satisfaction to slinging of sleet on to window pane a pointed out by lucretius emphasis warm comfort of present surroundings have large foot on side of fire just below chimney piece large cushion at back of head intention at of going into foul cold shower bath called out of door what made satisfaction more complete be that notice have be passed round at hall from gregson captain of house at football one have to go out for three mile run with view to keeping in training for house match added to david pleasure to think of poor wretch plodding through rainy sleet mud puddle while like king daughter in psalm be glorious within gregsonalias plugswho be pal of david have called by insulting name must think of when david have absolutely refused to obey order end of have be that david have picked gregson up be little fellow though admirable half back at rugby football carried way upstairs in arm round dormitory in turn to show that be in perfectly good training already thereafter have taken sporting dramatic from reading room against rule retired to adams study to spend cosy time before fire adam came in before long david pushed chair back took down large foot so that did not usurp whole of hearthrug entire warmth of fire have like house habit of sitting in adams study who wanted nothing better than to have boy about not gone for training run david asked sir plugser gave leave off adam lit pipe sat down on hearthrug be usual place on what ground asked david laughed carried round house sir to show be in good training said didnt mind bit thatll do for text said adam wanted to sermonise thats sort of thing david that wish wouldnt do be rather given to undermining authority doesnt set very good example though probably dont know house take tune from one two others be pal with gregson know thats more reason why must support while im on subject want to ask not to swear so much david sat up in astonishment sir bet youve never heard swear said know havent ive heard young jevons draw perfectly correct conclusion that do im awfully grateful by way for taking up a youve done teaching to wash hand not look a if everybody wanted to thrash did anybody suggest to oh yes frank said david well youve done good work though didnt mean to praise jevons copy brush hair like whistle between teeth try to run instead of walking a say swears do stop will be leaning out of study window yesterday exchanging compliment with somebody never heard such assortment of billingsgate such awfully bad form know also sentiment expressed by bad language be not edifying ill try sir said david ii never thought of swearing a meaning anything know didnt never said be expression of foul mind house be becoming perfect company of bargee try not to swear kick anybody who doe when convenient thats about right sir said david then there thing said adam want to tell about court of appeal ive only just heard about dont think like david frowned wasnt idea of comfortable afternoon indoors at wished have gone out for run instead of carrying plug round house dont think can sir said there be other fellow concerned in oh know that court be gregson bag chiefly thats why asked heard about from head doesnt like said must go into matter dont promise that wont a well suppose little beast manton told remarked david dont agree with little beast said adam agree probably manton told really dont see what else head of house must do now want to hear what court of appeal have to say about just a will want to know what prefect say about gregson bag be quite safe in hand a advocatuswell perhaps not quite diaboli can trust for david raised sat turk fashion with crossed leg in big basket chair rather long story sir if im to tell from beginning said never mind well see sir there be such awful change in house when frank cruikshank left at end of last half see be proper prefect used authority properly be jolly well necessary to respect couldnt cheek fellow like when gave order simply couldnt happen be so frantically different to get little clever squirt like manton crossley in authority instead couldnt keep order hang whole house must have be out of hand in time youll see that court of appeal be really meant to preserve order why very fag used to laugh at one of put soap in mantons kettle one day when boiled came bubbling out of spout like blowing soap bubble never saw anything so funny court of appeal stopped that adam preserved gravity thats rather new light said go on david neednt bring in name if think youd better not only fair that head must know side of question a have heard mantons david got red in face mantons bl filthy little sneak observed also bet hasnt told head truth probably told truth a struck said adam strike differently didnt sneak a think head got first news about court of appeal from quite source may know what source asked david yes dont mind telling must be officially ignorant jevons went to breakfast with head other day remarked in outburst of confidence that be far biggest swell in house because be president of court of appeal said in innocence head be naturally interested to hear more applied towell to proper quarter be manton david recovered from spurt of temper that funny little jev probably thought quite regular said of course did wouldnt have given away on purpose go on weve got to soap in kettle david laughed yes sir must have seen coming rainbowy out of spout so of course manton sent for thethe fellow who did couldnt even cane alone have to have crossley in to help perfectly degrading sir to have prefect like so crossley held fellow down just a manton began to lay on fellow kicked out crossley slipped across to get out of way manton landed awful wipe over shin so crossley let go stamped about made row between have to look in id gone on tiptoe to door sir in case anything funny occurred so a say looked in there be babbingtonoh name slipped out by accidentfit to burst with laughing kettle boiling over again with soap bubble crossley hopping about on one leg manton apologising to then manton turned on told be undermining discipline so have to say there seemed precious lot of discipline to undermine then manton lost presence of mind whacked out again at babbington missed smashed electric light o lor never saw anything so funny david shrieked with laughter again at remembrance adam must not resist joining a turned to beat out pipe against bar of fire well said at length must tell heap of story like said david wiping eye time be crossley who told fellow to write out fifty line so wrote out fifty line just like on sheet of paper showed up fancy doing to frank crookles why couldnt then crossley told to write out twice so took bit of paper wrote out twice on then crossley said must cane so jevonslord there name please forget sirjevons came appealed precious lot of good did for court be satisfied that hed deserved fifty line so gave six frightful stinger a knew crossley wasnt fit to for cheek to prefect yet manton say im undermining discipline sir added david in voice of outraged virtue why be enforcing jev have to write out hundred line got whacking too though court of appeal can reverse prefect decision also may enforce then thethe appellant get twice a hot for having appealed same a in english law sir be rather news to remarked adam well sir something have to be done said david whole house must have gone to pot why fag might have taken into head to cheek fifth form next when theyd finished with sixth there must have be trouble see most of big fellow in house be in fifth thats way court of appeal started go on said adam well next thing wasoh must tell thisone night couple of junior made apple pie bed for gregson awful cheek so naturally whacked soundly formally went to manton told that gregson have be whacking so round come manton tell gregson before whole dormitory captain of football he right to a wasnt prefect of course gregson said hed heard that little before manton have caned crossley be babbington affair that hadnt right to cane prefect thats sort of thing went on first week of half sir thered have be regular revolution unless wed done something so say that court of appeal be more to support authority than other way about well now well take other way about said adam mean want to know about case in upset prefect authority david thought for moment well sir two manton crossley did sort of thing be not accustomed to have prefect doing said when went round of study during preparation to see that be working used to put on slipper open door quick to try catch doing nothing of course often did well thats not playing game sir frank always came clumping along always tapped at door be just same when went round of dormitory after light be out slipper dont do good by spying know wont stop fellow ragging oror anything else that sort of way only mean that two can play at game if want to do anything of kind that shouldnt just put sentinel at door spying just encourages fellow to break rule smoking too well smoking said adam crossley suspected certain fellow of smoking one day when be out went looked in table drawer found pipe there now sir that sort of thing rot wanted to whack for fellow appealed so naturally gave in favour when came out that crossley have looked in private drawer wouldnt dream of doing sir naturally not so of course reversed crossleys sentence wouldnt let be whacked did three appoint court asked adam yes suppose be about that be pal see sir rest of house seemed satisfied that wed take fairish view of thing so about month ago after wed settled that something must be done just let one know that must appeal against impot caning that two manton crossley proposed to give must decide then see sir if one appeal a said court upholds prefect get twice a hot hundred line instead of fifty etcetera weve written out in book constitution of court of appeal so a to have regular in case forgot good gracious constitution be asked adam david became slightly dignified yes thought better to put on orderly footing sir said have everything regular so that shouldnt contradict ourselves do one thing one time also fellow know what to expect whats more see that impots be properly done if confirm caning too why one day crossley caned fellowdavid began to bubble with laughter againand pretended to go to sleep snore when crossley told be over pretended to awake said hullo morning already why farce sir sheer childish whats use of caning fellow if dont jolly well hurt so took out of prefect hand impots get properly written fellow get properly whacked if whacking dont say increase respect in house hold two little fellow at top surely better to have authority than none adam thought over for while head have apparently be given to understand by manton that authority of two prefect have be wrenched out of hand by large athletic upstart of fifth form that in consequence anarchy prevailed house have become sort of medmenham abbey david account have put perfectly different aspect on affair one be eminently reasonable adam be fair minded man putting aside altogether fact that delighted in david disliked manton believed that david version be true one have always be plan to let house look after own affair a far a possible gave home rule in fact certainly transfer of government to fifth form though highly irregular in defiance of school rule believed to have be distinctly for good of nation again thing bore out view first week of half have be full of trouble worry small boy be for ever appealing to against prefect prefect be a constantly invoking authority to endorse own lack of then about month ago disturbance have ceased adam with habitual optimism have supposed that house have shaken down together now in light of seemed far more reasonable to suppose that remedy have be brought about by brigandage of authority certainly restoration of peace quiet be coincident with establishment of impertinent court of appeal must have to come to end a recognised institution during existence seemed to have be effective do reverse many of prefect ruling asked adam oh sir not now said david anxious to do such justice a must be done to two impotent figurehead see of liked silly ruling reversed theyve become much more sensible simply cant have prefect looking in study when youre out wanting to cane because find pipe there fancy frank cruikshank doing scruggish low down trick like seem rather fond of instance said adam yes sir because so jolly typical said david adam got up im considering what to say to head remarked will certainly tell there side to question besides mantons oh ripping said david cordially felt sure youd see suppose enjoyed court of appeal good deal asked rather sir said david must think did wish must have heard one of trial with three on bench manton a defendant junior a plaintiff see sir manton crossley consented to thats point in favour isnt gregson planned ritual because pater real judge in appeal court call other learned brother crabtree blaize for of course there be nickname christian name in court quite serious there rag about be thinking of appointing permanent counsel to plead for plaintiff adam laughed david dont suppose that court of appeal be going to be allowed to remain in existence asked thats a wish sir said well asked adam nothing sir be only thinking therell be rather row again hope not said adam thats exactly what fellow like have got to prevent how can if youre going to stop asked david in hundred of way by backing prefect up without over riding youre sensible enough to know david considered be head sick about sir asked he never sick about anything till he in full possession of fact be prepared to be uncommonly sick when have only heard other side in fact said something about giving lesson with regard to obeying authority after what youve told dont think need be alarmed oh im not said david of course hell see there side to same a youve done something have to happen when got manton crossley instead of frank cruikshank at moment small completely soaked boy burst into room not seeing adam who be sitting behind door only david letter for blaize said oh want to appeal sorry sir didnt see do now jevons said adam so go on tell blaize what appeal about well sir somebody put sponge on top of mantons door made booby trap because sponge say im responsible unless find out who put there adam nodded to david go on learned brother blaize said notice in writing jev said have seen handwriting of letter tore open oh say how ripping said frank mother ill be ordered out of england for christmasat least beastly that shes illbut frank want to know if can stay with for week say jev youre awfully wet arent mean couldnt get much wetter so wonder if youd take tellywag just down to office rather ill put appeal in study will yes right ill be back in second if youll have tellywag ready be telegram to frank saying can come asked adam yes sir then hadnt better write to father first might not be convenient impulsive david have already written ripping stay a long a can paused oh well suppose must be best sir said wish hadnt thought of david got up to go to study write note be so far outstripped by desire may talk to bag plug about court of appeal sir said certainly can talk over with manton too if like in fact rather recommend adams recommendation seemed to be rather sensible when david thought over though not perhaps strictly in accordance with adams idea in suggesting must give court opportunity perhaps of finding out what manton have said to head must manton not choose to tell be easy to threaten a counter move that court when called upon a undoubtedly must be to appear before head must give highly coloured account strictly based upon fact of what have led to formation also must put before manton crossley very depressing picture of what position must be if court be dissolved privately chose not to back up restored authority required small imagination to picture status of two unfortunate prefect if have to enforce discipline in house without support of what have be court bag gregson have just come in from run gregson being in bath in superior position of having clothes on must take reprisal by water on david having refused to go out david in fact have to dodge soaking sponge thrown at before have time to begin to explain oh pax minute said there damnedan awful serious thing happened plug head know about court of appeal goin to be gone into rot said gregson filling sponge again now who wouldnt go out for sweat david tisnt rot shrieked david snatching up towel to shield swear while brute have be having innocent happy sweat along road nice weather ive be jawed by adam solid fact be going to be hauled up before head be disposed to be uncommonly sick about so adam said do shut up being funny with sponge right oh said plug if swear youre not lying swear said david hurry up dress come to study because bag have to talk itsits welter of politics court accordingly met in about ten minute time in david study where have made tea for where on table lay jevons appeal laid before other two talk with adam reproducing with laudable accuracy a dead cert that will appear before head finished up weve got to agree exactly what say mustnt give different account of bag caressed what hoped be going to be moustache of course not said weve just got to say whats happened truth whole truth nothing oh didnt mean be to make thing up said david only question be how much tell head vote for conferenceadams suggested itwith manton crossley see if cant let other down easily compromise out of court suggested plug yes something of kind can give away hopelessly by saying how inefficient be can give away by saying that have undermined prefect authority dont see might all be toned down bit thats use said bag if mantons given away already thats just what dont know said david vote try to get manton to tell what told head may not have told much may have said be amicable sort of arrangement on other hand may have told that object be to undermine prefect authority well a told adam there side to that generally supported except when be manifestly unfair want to know what manton told that have put ourselves above prefect be true did in cause of order though of course enjoyed frightfully house accepted said bag lot head will care for want to get manton crossley to come talk crossley doesnt matter manton anyhow a he already seen head see when head have up can tell lot if choose hell ask for account of mantonll see that isnt fool though be such squirt with plug a well a bag david be master mind after few minute bag went to mantons study quite politely asked to come round confer with court manton rather liked promised pleasant time in telling court that head be going into whole matter that have nothing more to do with be prepared to be maliciously civil courteous to express regret court have made as of a spontaneous generation implied thought must be rather fun came very blandly with spectacle on book that be reading finger kept place in cursory manner here be said hullo blaize hullo gregson yes court of appeal wasnt who went to head about know be that little fellow blaizes friend who let out whats name forget oh jevons said david yes jevons told head about so of course head asked more put rather nicely said be business to tell about a head of house david be seated between two learned brother just a if regular court be going on oh know about jevons said can leave jevons out waive said plug formally yes can waive jevons said david a learned brother suggests manton gave little cackle of laughter shouldnt wonder if have to waive everything observed pleasantly oh be not going to waive just yet if count for anything retorted david perhaps dont count for much bag suddenly laughed in hoarse manner beg pardon brother blaize said right oh brother crabtree just contain well manton be to head with version next go to head with ours can make pretty sultry for if choose shouldnt mind doing bit depends on what have told head thats what must like to know manton still felt in very superior position have told head be quite true namely that three fifth form boy put in position above prefect so that order punishment by two sixth form boy in house must be appealed against if thought proper must be reversed head have be extremely grave about at present there be doubt in mantons mind that be going to uphold authority of prefect in summary manner probably make very hot for who have set above felt quite secure comfortable smiled in rather lofty manner dare say head will tell a much of what said a think good for observed really dont see why must see take view that prefect be not to be dictated to by two three member of fifth form bad precedent know might lead to couple of fellow out of fourth form dictating to jevons friend might make super court of appeal rather funny must be david passed ghost of wink to gregson wanted to draw manton on little further before unmasked battery required control to assume attitude of humility when delicious sentence be beginning to seethe in brain be heavenly to see mantons malicious little eye beaming at through spectacle notice what awful scug looked with hair rather long behind lying outside collar gave sigh say im afraid be in for said disconsolately manton let mouth expand into odious smile yes must say be observed see head view be that authority of prefect be institution have support doesnt quite see why must be taken away by three fellow in fifth asked sort of question so have to give pretty full account must make clean breast of think if be david must stand no longer felt that must burst if have to listen to more of mantons advice say gave pretty full account said though have not chosen to tell what be well shouldnt wonder if made bit fuller for beg pardon brother crabtree bag be leaning back looking dreamily at manton learned brother gregson observed do remember one day how mr manton wanted to whack little boy called babbington how have to call in mr crossley to help plug assumed portentous air yes brother crabtree said how soap bubble came out of mr mantons kettle though have not meant to wash david chimed in remember learned brother said how house be perfect bear garden for first month of term before started worshipful court how david turned to manton perhaps didnt tell head that said will will tell how couldnt get line done for till enforced authority hadnt got will say how walk round house in slipper when get back to own fuggy study darent walk straight in for fear of finding booby trap come down on mangy head jolly wise precaution too on part will tell head david licked lip a warmed to work took jevons appeal off table in front of will take to head read said just listen pretty dignified position for isnt to court of appeal please blaize manton got awful soaker because somebody else put sponge on top of door soused because be sponge say hell whack unless find out who did tell isnt fair because not business so appeal m c jevons manton be getting little rattled otherwise must not have done anything so foolish a try to grab paper david whisked away will say too that tried to get hold of said better sit down manton thats right will tell that notion of authority be to look in fellow private drawer when he out to see if can nail pipe never did said manton wildly be crossley oh then suppose crossley will explain said david of course may all be stale news to head since gave pretty full account ill just see if head happened to listen to part see dont in least mind telling be going to say to head though youre too superior to tell said ive told adam about already think youre awfully good prefect of course then see concluded david cheerfully when weve told really happened why shouldnt make up lot that didnt probably did same gosh head will have wonderful high opinion of before ive done shouldnt wonder if isnt more than can bear jolly well break down sob kneel give thanks that have ripping couple of prefect in house to keep in order well neednt be sarcastic about said manton yes need because began about having fourth form court of appeal to override think that only who can be so damned sarcastic superior give garbled account like to head wasnt garbled must have be do suppose that sensible chap like head must have taken side perhaps didnt invent thing swear left out jolly important one like not being able to cane cheeky junior without getting crossley to help then whacking on shin instead must have seen adam shaking when told about bet said set in opposition to thats lie backed authority up except when made such utter squirt of yourselves that couldnt helped goat did for what couldnt do for yourselves lord make hot to talk to chap like go on bagsi mean brother crabtree manton be beginning to present so ludicrous appearance learned blaize must hardly prevent bubbling with laughter must have spoiled forcibleness of situation finger no longer kept place in book tight little mouth no longer complacently smiled have fallen open in dismay at david surprising remark learned crabtree with suave style slow sentence did not reassure see there nothing like fair play manton said bag take that agree a youve have uninterrupted inning with head have run up good score against im sure be only proper that must have turn now be not wise in refusing to tell have said to head time for be past now even if wanted to dont suppose must listen to be foolish of because make guess what be naturally guess that made up lot of lie since think be sort of thing must do so when leave now will be very soon will make up ripper about crossleyreally awful thing know began making up when brother blaize be addressing be beauty gregson took up tale with wink at david in eye away from manton yet dont know that need bother to make thing up brother crabtree said easier to say just few of thing really happened will tell head sort of thing go on in mantons study when think house be at preparation now manton for feebleness ineffectiveness a prefect be a blameless a ethiopian dont know what mean said gregson gave little laugh transformed into cough oh really said head will soon know what mean davidi mean brother blaize know david have caught wink correctly put on scornful face oh that said yes disgusting must be more careful about shutting door manton gregson be walking about house in slipper following example of sixth form dont know what youre talking about said manton right oh wont talk about moreto be in vain that manton assured that a be perfectly true conscience be a clear a noon day for wicked subtly acted fraud on part of fifth form devil made uncomfortable in spite of though have not told head anything false about beastly court of appeal certainly have not put side of case before with directness that now appeared be going to do on own behalf have not for instance said that court of appeal propped up endorsed supported authority of crossley far more than overrode though be perfectly true a have told head that arrogated supreme authority to have occurred to to tell head that crossley be quite incompetent to maintain discipline that got ragged to point of having soap put in kettle that toured house in slipper truly supplement to tale be likely to be a voluminous a tale then david rose well dont think need detain said politely in fact weve got good deal to talk over among ourselves thanks awfully for coming expect will meet again at head thats then manton be not quite sure that be various remark by one other of member of court be beginning to cause somewhat acute internal questioning in especial disliked fact that adam be in possession of court side of case a like a not must give head benefit of perhaps might discus little more said with faint air of condescension still lingering about canwell go to head because told that if have anything more to tell be to might sayi really must be quite glad tothat crossley didnt want to get into trouble oh thats right said david cheerfully dont bother about youve got into trouble at expect will come out perfectly right head be awfully sick about said manton laid good deal of stress on fact that did set yourselves up a authority superior to prefect expect ill make that square said david dare say will put case a strongly a put adam will have done same too im pretty sure of course thought might let down more easily if told what told head after gave opportunity of doing so didnt take so thats finished well think perhaps be wrong not to tell said manton im sure be assented bag warmly isnt awful pity one doesnt think of sort of thing sooner so if like ill tell now said manton finishing sentence oh dont care hang way said david if wish may tell itll be because ask if may dont want to hear thought asked to said dismal prefect did use to now weve made up mind what to do well will tell head that did often support authority of sixth might make le sick with rubbish said gregson youre proposing thing now simply because want not to tell head side of be that reason not think must yes said brother blaize in terrible voice yes why not have asked for mercy sooner then instead of giving air get on be very unstuffed manton who be left at end of recital for though have not told head anything palpably false yet picture head must have drawn of whole affair be about a erroneous a must possibly be have let head assume that authority of prefect over house be complete satisfactory until court of appeal set up have certainly not said that court in most case endorsed authority saw that order be obeyed be drawn from by cool ruthless questioning at end david gave long whistle well pon word be in mess said im not at sure that shouldnt resign prefectship if be before head kicked out be deuce of hand at suppressio veriaint that brother gregson why there isnt ounce of truth that havent suppressed a full of suggestioer falsi said bag yes suggestio falsi a can stick best thing can do be to go talk over with crossley then come back tell propose to tell head if dont make clean breast of to let see that he only got garbledyes said garbledversion of at present may be sure will when youve made up mind come back tell tap at door first unstuffed manton rose yes ill do that said erthanks door closed behind david who be growing extremely red in face with suppressio risus turned over buried face in sofa cushion kicking wildly in air other learned brother stifled lest manton must hear for few minute court of appeal writhed in agony of silent mirth o lord said david at length didnt know there be such richness in world to think that hour ago little squirt thought have on toast toast there all right tisnt who be on now he making up version be ours wanting to know if thatll satisfy for to go to head with o lord too much mercy to let said bag not bit of much more effective if manton put side of to head what if doesnt tell head all say he going to asked plug must only way can save face be by going to at once before adam can oh there toast enough besides when head see can soon tell if mantons given correct version david a president of court be summoned to supreme presence next day ive be into question of court of appeal said head what manton told last night put different complexion on from what have heard before of course court must be dissolved at once blaize understand that yes sir faint smile spread over head face a looked at big jolly boy tell youryour learned brother said what say authority in house be mr adam prefect there be other authority believe now that on whole court meant well be quite certain enjoyed immensely that particular enjoyment be afraid must cease want itthe court isto continue meaning well in private capacity to support prefect authority though may no longer enforce reverse order blaize be for private ear alone think court probably did very useful work mustnt have more court thats then how be getting on well hope mr adam seems to think so heard anything from friend maddox lately gosh what brick said david to a went out chapter xv david be lying on back under big elm tree near cricket pavilion one sunday afternoon in mid june by upright attentive sat faithful bag listening occasionally playing part of greek chorus be to say putting in short appropriate reflection to quantity of surprising information boy wore white tie characteristic of prefect on sunday for have got promotion into lower sixth at easter be colleague of inefficient manton crossley two young gentleman may be remarked be vastly relieved to have burden of authority taken off somewhat feeble shoulder david bag particularly david ruled house with genial exuberance when necessary rod of iron just now both iron exuberance be relaxed david lay there in abandonment of physical laziness straw hat with cricket eleven colour be tilted over top part of face so a to shield eye from speckle sparkle of sun filtered through canopy of leaf above mouth chin alone be visible long leg be stretched out in front of showing white hiatus between despondent sock end of trouser persistent fly kept settling there attention acknowledged by dabbing at with other ankle tisnt a if be little boy longer said when fellow be close on seventeen a be time began to realise he grown up why mother be only seventeen when married do propose to marry at seventeen asked bag with sarcastic allusion to conversation have gone before wherell live cant very well sleep in dormitory david gave little spurt of laughter sun shone on white teeth down red throat quickly became grave again be that funny said if so suppose id better laugh though wish saw point who said be going to marry o gosh what clipper be not much more than fortnight ago that thought girl be rotten said bag more fool then more fool for still thinking so lord wish be really grown up quite old mean nineteen twenty say do think looked at at in chapel morning dont think so said bag cheerily be watching pretty nearly time a knew must ask oh yes did once when began to sing amen before be time looked away again at once have have said david in dry speaking voice not laughing at well shes bound to come to old boy match isnt dont see how can help noticing if take wicket if get constantly hit out of ground said bag david found agreed with youre jolly sympathetic sort of pal said at length bag have certain defence well seems so queer of said rot if youre going to think about talk about nothing else than female girl besides must be frightfully old shouldnt wonder if be twenty why mother have be married three year when be a old a yes have have two child have also died said david rather embarrassingly oh sorry didnt know said bag about girl now went on hurriedly how do know isnt engaged already easily might be shes awfully pretty grant that at least suppose be though used to think that girl looked exactly alike idiot idiot be said david kicking wildly in air what be going to do continued bag who always saw practical issue be going to tell how frightfully keen be on expect guess said david solemnly came to tea with twice in study rather marked for fellow to ask don daughter to tea twice in same half specially if come first time well didnt say anything sweet moonlightly to said bag talked about nothing cricket besides plug be there whole time so be mother gray david drew long breath stretched arm leg out in form of one crucified till elbow knee be taut violet gray said dwelling on syllable did ever hear jolly name just like slim honey coloured hair name bag groaned slightly really be appalling for david to be in deplorable state violet gray said in business like manner hm violet gray think sound better than violet blaize david sat up bag dont understand one single thing about said how can explain shes just most wonderful beautiful thing that ever happened wonder if frank will understand will tell nobody else he coming down end of next week hell probably cut out said bag who thought bracing treatment be best for idiotic friend not be pal of course must if wanted since girl must fall in love with frank straight off if held up little finger jove id give anything to see varsity cricket match week to think that in final house match last year be in at one end cambridge cricket blue other well happened to everybody else in house eleven said bag since maddox went in first carried bat david laughed so

what lot of thing there be said appreciatively not to mention said bag oh by way saw coming out of maddens photographer other day do suppose shed be done by jove shouldnt like one well ask then said bag with infinite patience david knitted forehead into diplomatic frown couldnt straight off like that said might lead up to might say thought madden took jolly good photograph see what said suppose

rotten id better have private tuition so asked if might go to old gray for jolly smart that so im going to drop french have private tu with gray beginning to morrow come into garden maud remarked bag whats maud gotoh see mean violet yes thats idea going in out of house im sure to run across see why striking four let go down to house david a be way of boy rising seventeen have be growing tremendously last six month not in physical way only in stature of mind be impossible to imagine boy le of prig than one so unweighted with sense of duty responsibility with growth have taken up responsibility quite simply unconsciously eagerly without having egoism about did not in fact do thing behave in manner made so breezy treasure to house master because heavily realised that there be thing ought to do manner in ought to behave because obeyed unconsciously bent of natural instinct be of very high spirited excellent fellow now budding from boyhood into early manhood have private meditation at on subject merely lived in active wholesome way enjoyed immensely if by chance have come to learn what adam really thought of must have have doubt that informant be just pulling leg genial unconsciousness that have influence at be exactly that made influence so strong have admirable gift of not thinking about purely about large quantity of attractive affair made up life number of jolly chap with whom be associated have even be known to admit that manton crossley to counteract whose ridiculous ineffectiveness court of appeal have be founded be decent enough though of course earthly good a prefect in same way be from sense of conscious duty that have educated still watched over jevons be sport looking after kid be exactly true account of trouble have taken then part of growth have come violent adoration of violet gray a natural a strutting of young male bird when first be conscious of sex than david have suddenly perceived that though in many thing girl be rotter there be something about made necessary to wear buttonhole if possible make run take wicket for other reason than generally necessary two boy strolled at sunday pace down over hot sunny field wore air of sabbatical empty leisure may have be wet month grass still retained varnished freshness of spring except where in patch have be worn by pitch practice net for last fortnight rain have fallen light soil quick to dry be beginning to get hard give bowler such a david crumbling wicket in soul delighted adams house have scraped through first tie of house match for though david on whom relied to thwart discomfit opponent have proved on occasion to be extremely expensive quite useless a bowler have in weird fashion of own managed to make fifty of most awful run ever scored chiefly by amazing miss hit over head of point slip have also be badly missed off first ball received added humour to performance little later leg stump have be smartly hit though without displacing bail have hailed with shriek of laughter in second tie played last week have shown in truer colour have be bowled fair square in inning without scoring at have done thing with ball really seemed inspired by satan have grown into bowler of googliest type have discovered for that if let shirt sleeve wave in air instead of rolling tight up round elbow presented much more puzzling outline to batsman on day there have be too high cross wind most of batsman who be favoured with delivery knew be that from very far off immense lanky figure came prancing in curved run up to wicket that from somewhere at end of clothes hung up to dry quavering object be supposed to be cricket ball skidded through air in manner that be really impossible to tell what be doing what must do sometimes when looked most charged with incalculable waywardness did nothing bounce a innocent rotund ball must at other time chiefly when looked almost pathetically guileless played lowest trick that law of spin permitted kicked out like horse when pitched leaped nervously aside a if trying to avoid bat in fact odds be that did precisely what didnt expect again demoniac blaze must run up to wicket with le than usual prance in slow thoughtful manner a if have headache if wary batsman imagined a not unfrequently did that be prelude to slow thoughtful ball occasionally though not always found be quite in error extremely fast straight ball be that thoughtful manner meant whereby learn danger of trusting to appearance what made antic more flustering annoying be that david with guileless sincerity frankly confessed that be often by mean clear what ball be going to do always mean to do something rum said of course doesnt always come off sometimes doe just opposite thats such awful fun silly tosh bowling know come off in house match sometimes school team must hit over moon perfectly sincere view of own performance be not shared by humphreys captain of school eleven who have twice be one of david victim to whom opinion be expressed one bowled with in first inning said that much injured young man came round leg took middle stump blast didnt mean that david put head on one side considering yes think did said be rather good ball for thought might do something of sort one get good ball in sometimes if go on long enough well wish must keep for school match said humphreys second inning have with roaring full pitch ninety five mile hour thought be only eighty five so missed by ten mile david laughed sorry be rather fast one said thought have got in tummy jolly glad be only wicket som remarked humphreys come bathe since then day have added to pace of ground sunday afternoon a david strolled down with bag looked at turf with extreme content just luck over said that must be getting into state that suit best for old boy match lord what pity said that shant be able to send down decent ball now must love to bowl frank bag do think about cricket so tremendously in summer half lie awake making plan took short run brought arm over shoulder in complicated fashion why shouldnt bring arm up overhand like that said turn wrist over underhand might say that ball must simply fly up gently in air fall at foot something might be done with can usually do something with anything if give mind to like with jev remarked bag oh thats only adams rot broke off focused blue eye on group of figure coming up field towards lord here gray violet coming said say be tie straight who man with dont know friend of theirs probably clever fellow hope theyll ask to tea david have be carrying straw hat in hand put on in order to have joy of taking off to same man who be in chapel morning with said bag in undertone be didnt see lord doesnt look ripping there be always slight discomfort attached to meeting be seen while yet long way off to be coming difficulty in knowing right moment to cease being absorbed in landscape in intelligent conversation with friend to become conscious of in proper time to apply suitable smile of recognition to face david with tingling heart managed with wonderful ill success put on brilliant smile long before must be seen at feeling a if cheek must crack took completely off again then tried to talk to bag in natural manner pointed to nothing at away to right then proceeded to talk to bag again much too long did not look up till adorable one be couple of yard off on came smile of recognition again took off hat dropped ala for hope of being asked to tea when picked up hat again vision have already gone by be only most instantaneous return of smile that reaped from muddled manuvres so on went bag with face red from suppressed giggle what be laughing at as asked david in indignant whisper dont see anything funny wouldnt be funny man what did do demanded david first grinned awful grin mile too soon said bag then looked a grave a judge with indigestion then mile too late gave awful grin dropped hat sorry didnt get tea be too funny for anything david be radically incapable of ill humour for more than few second at time grinned in le awful manner never felt such silly fool said im not sure like man what do suppose be talking about so interestedly cant say run back ask said bag thought looked rather decent chap awfully good looking too bit like maddox david gave snort of disdain like grandmother observed in withering manner one ive got two david took hold of bag by shoulder ran down bit of steep hill to gate ugliest said fattest beastliest say though be rather sell for complete suck said bag there be exactly a many way of falling in love a there be different nature in world since one boy man girl woman fall in love off same carpet so to speak on transacts other affair of life followed that david first excursion into enchanted country be made with enthusiasm gaiety innocence with forgetfulness of that characterised other way work that be in love at grown up man who be so unfortunate a to forget what be like to be boy must probably have denied calling feeling calf love at most boy unless be shrivelled old man must doubt for moment genuineness of david emotion seriously threatened for next few week to dethrone dominant passion inspired by cricket since absolutely refused to vacate supreme throne love squeezed in sat beside so that if david lay awake on sunday pondering over fresh wile in matter of googly on monday googly must not enter head at except a shadow must devote whole of insomnia perhaps lasted hour to contemplation of adorable violet at such time must give vent to sound between sigh groan jevons from next bed must ask if have tummy ache then david must say savagely little as go to sleep add in minute two thanks for asking jev at high level adoration remained for whole month occasionally a during two day of old boy match must be more absorbed in cricket while violet looked on from throne of heart even a looked on from balcony of pavilion on day succeeding glorious discomfiture of old boy cricket a active principle in mind lapsed into state of quiescence while violet became volcanic again did not want anything from though thought of kissing wild flight of impossible fancy sent heart into mouth only wanted that must be adorer must have given further account of than that other friend frank own sister bag plug be on different plane loved margery loved frank esteemed relied on bag none gave tremor sense of excitement for violet boyish heart be full of sweet tumult confusion whenever enchantress came within eyeshot meantime strange young man who have roused david suspicion on sunday afternoon continued staying with gray presence be accounted for since to david great relief proved to be cousin proved also be satisfactory to be man who played cricket occasionally for county thus have claim to respect took part in match against master playing for on occasion proceeded to hit david bowling to part of compass with utmost ease enjoyment feat raised in bowler estimation eventually david got out with ball about mr leonard gray knew absolutely nothing have be treated with wonderful contempt first a gray retired nodded in friendly manner glad didnt send that down sooner blaize said then with suddenness of thunderbolt end came bag brought fateful news while david be ecstatically employed on model flying machine frank have given did ever see anything so ripping shouted frank sent morning flew whole length of hall just now wait till wind up again david picked up beloved machine began winding whats up said looking at bag anything beastly happened nothing wrong in house be there oh david im so sorry said bag david let go of winder propeller whirred pulled a wheel ran round well get on said shes engaged to cousin said bag banns be given out yesterday at parish church
