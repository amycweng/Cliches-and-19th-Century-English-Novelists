ruthless system of cheating moment thought that miss grantham eye be occupied in other direction rolled ball by stealthy movement of foot into more advantageous position for next stroke made little surreptitious adjustment might tend to confound adversary unfortunately be very short time before miss grantham awoke to manoeuvre proceeded to take counter offensive measure of more than neutralising character for instance moment have aligned mallet bent down for second time to pick up spectacle shifted position of ball at have taken aim if possible put wire of hoop between if be not feasible

want to mix with be stateliest in birth in intellect in aristocracy of kind of science of art of industrial pre eminence of politics of public service be with idea in mind that name occurred to a being most capable among london hostess of bringing together such assembly a will be perfectly characteristic of be most splendid in social life of nation well balanced handsome expression did not deceive dodo for moment rightly interpreted a being amiable doxology must introduce subject of revision of list of guest must not help interjecting remark two more than highly charged syphon can help

ball must pull out wing feather sooner than allow worse than must be thought of allowing anybody to cut out name of friend of mine because be fit to meet maharajah friend be perfectly fit to meet anybody so dear may put into own cigarette smoke probably lord cookham have never be so surprised so wantonly outraged in feeling since unhappy day when have be birched at eton for telling lie subsequently proved to be true just a on tragic occasion youthful sense of own integrity have rendered impossible for to conceive that head master must lift up hand against defencelessness so now even a dodo tongue dared to lash with stinging remark must hardly believe that be indeed who be being treated in so condign manner have not finished yet apparently on side dodo have quite unexpectedly to lost temper be thing extremely rare with when did lose lost with enthusiastic completeness up till few minute ago have be vastly entertained by glorious speech of master prig viewing objectively licking lip at gorgeousness then a swiftly a by turning of screw viewed subjectively gazed more at gorgeousness felt impenetrable insolence proceeded appear to astonish said be very good thing for to

direct question in usual manner a youth be sent to oxford said where have honour of being contemporary of have be asked in fact to put in way of knowing interesting people directing mind by example rather than precept towards serious study be asked in fact to look after influence in way one young man can influence slightly junior after leaving oxford spent several year in england be quite well known believe in certain section of london society personally rather lost sight of for went in for sport in fact rather more frivolous mode of life than suited pray think blame in way for that succeeded to principality only few week ago on death of father dodo have stood up during impassioned harangue now sat down again anger died out of face eye grew wide with dawning of stupendous idea ca possibly be that be talking about jumbo asked that believe be nickname given at one time said lord cookham in allusion to dodo put elbow on table went off into peal of inexplicable laughter rocked backwards forward in chair tear streamed from eye for long time be perfectly incapable of speech for at effort to control mouth into shape necessary for articulate utterance broke away again oh oh must stop laughing gasped oh hurt rib ache be agony what be to do jumbo fuss about jumbo jumbo be one of oldest friend how must guess that have become maha have have rajah of bareilly oh lord cookham apologise for have said for have laughed be too silly for anything why did say be jumbo at once instead of being so pomp mean know what mean dodo collected wiped eye drank little tea choked in middle eventually pulled together jumbo said faintly be possible that never knew that jumbo used to be absolutely at foot suppose that belonged to time when be frivolous lost sight of dear used to send large pearl be obliged to send back to then sent again what cost in registered parcel post baffle conjecture what be address must write to at once must think too odd for word if gave dance did ask wonder have not be to see already when did get to london last night only said lord cookham be staying at at moment telephone bell rang believe in miracle said dodo rushing to yes who be said be talking to

cookham yes lord cookham have told that have made engagement for night said will put down in book so there wo be mistake what dodo paused moment gave little gasp spoke in great hurry yes lord cookham be here with now said in very room mean close by do want to speak to all right then now will rush have bath then will be ready for jumbo be frivolous be not alone hush during remarkable conversation lord cookham long practise in dignity self possession have enabled to appear quite unconscious that anything be going on by expression on face might have be sitting on slope of hymettus contemplating distant view of acropolis hearing only hum of classical bee so detached did seem from anything that dodo happened to be saying to telephone being without sense of humour especially where be concerned being also pleasantly encased in armour of own importance actually did not occur to a possible that be being spoken about from other end of telephone with anything deepest respect perhaps instrument be not working well be why dodo have said so very plainly that be sitting in room with put receiver back on hook tried to be grave once more broke down must send away said because be beginning to laugh again must have bath be settled quite satisfactorily be oh dear what funny morning be having dodo made heroic effort with gave loud croak a swallowed laughter be beginning to make mouth twitch again lord cookham disregarded that even a have disregarded telephone though must never have admitted to others that dodo have failed in respect to faint inkling that have done so must have percolated into inner consciousness for when spoke permitted to speak with irony deadliest most terrific punishment for who have be impertinent to when addressed anyone with irony supposed that soul popped shrivelled up like leaf cast into furnace good bye lady chesterford said instruction to then be that highness will dine with go to dance on sixteenth will have honour of conveying to proper quarter did not look at a spoke addressed air about foot above head for moment silence in doubt soul shrivelled austere gaze remained there when answered voice trembled so much that felt have be almost unnecessarily severe yes be said what nice talk have have delicious of to have spared hour went out into hall with even a footman opened door for exit motor drew up huge gorgeous figure stepped out saw lord cookham bow low hat in hand next moment jumbo caught sight of bounded up step into house dear what fun said how be jumbo be ever so welcome though did tell to come in hour not three minute oh be be too killing will tell word a soon a be ready go into room wait be ever so glad to see dodo be admirable mimic jumbo rolling about on sofa almost fancied be back at oxford again being influenced by lord cookham chapter v man hand whenever dodo be in london for sunday a be case on day preceding ball always gave up hour until teatime inclusive to david uninterrupted society breakfasted together at half past nine immediately afterwards usually before jack have put in appearance at set off on top of bus if weather made that delightful form of progress possible to attend service in dome of st paul cathedral mere sprinkle of rain did not matter because then crouched underneath umbrella played at being early christian in small cave while if inclemency be too severe for reasonable christian to remain in small cave dashed to tube station at down street after traversing extremely circuitous route like early christian in enormous rabbit burrow emerged at post office station where dash took into shelter be in fact only on most tempestuous sunday of that be reduced to degradation of ordering motor going there in dull dignity did not always wait for sermon david have option of going away remaining for dodo considered that tired boy listening not listening to sermon be likely to get gloomier view of religious practice than if have be allowed to go away when have have enough play early christian in cave again have to decide whether must remain go away while preacher be being conducted to pulpit be stipulated that if decided to stop must abide by choice not retire in middle of sermon since be not polite to interrupt people when be talking to to day david have made most unfortunate choice preacher be entertaining for few minute merely because have high fluty voice echoed like siren in dome said nothing of smallest interest have idea whatever when to stop between sentence made long pause dodo have got briskly to foot during one of thinking that discourse be now over so have to sit down again david trying to swallow desire to laugh have hiccupped loudly made three people in row immediately in front of turn round together a if worked by one lever look fixedly at be embarrassing one of happened to be lord cookham seemed likely that dodo must hiccup next then from front chair close to choir edith arbuthnot got up curtsied low in direction of altar before turning back on began walking towards down gangway why did curtsey mummy be prince albert there asked david in whisper yes said do feeling capable of explaining just then one of edith boot creaked exactly octave below pitch of preacher fluty voice sounded ever louder more cheerfully a got nearer stopped when came opposite to stop for second service dodo said be going to sing mass ca be playing golf at richmond good bye creaking boot sounded in gradual diminuendo a tramped away down nave mummy began david in piercing whisper if mr arbuthnot may go out in middle dodo conjectured what be coming because be not grown up said hush david be impossible to listen to flute like preacher for word ran together like ink mark on blotting paper dodo gave up idea of trying to hear what be saying have not slightest wish to follow edith to sit quiet in huge church dim cool charged with century of praise worship have soaked into be like coming out of glare of noisy noon day into green shelter of tree moisture dodo have already finished saying prayer tried to say to not very successfully twenty third psalm seemed to expressive of feeling then abandoning that gave over to vague meditation deep down in very effectively screened must be allowed by passion for excitement mundane interest of life there existed chamber of contemplation for soul real edifice quite solid established be not in nature to frequent very much stood vacant for remarkably long period together just now be ecstatically content with david by side to sit there while voice of preacher hooted round dome there recaptured consciousness of eternal secure permanent underlay feverish motion of day be like boat tossing on surface of wave yet time anchored to rock lay deep below movement agitation thus in such season of calm weather rested in state of inertia be yet intense vivid be from just power of conscious tranquillity that drew so much of indefatigable energy never seemed to grow le with advancing year for sens be rest for soul be wordless prayer concentration be said david suddenly jumping to foot dodo came out of place of rest with more shock than with awoke in morning observed that preacher have left pulpit then lord cookham passed with fixed unconscious expression made dodo think that be cutting until remembered avowed habit never to recognise even nearest dearest in church on way down nave be filled with consternation to find that entire financial resource consisted of one shilling sixpence of be absolutely necessary to enable david to get home on top of bus so what be to be done about offertory plate knew must be presented to notice near west door must hardly like to ask verger for change in circumstance thought might venture to appeal to lord cookham who be yard two in front of still without sign of recognition gave new crisp five pound note also out of very opulence rather than exiguousness seemed to stand in need of change idea of applying to again with confession that did not want so much a be clearly unthinkable noticed however with rapt appreciation that own alms be not on magnificent scale for with silent secrecy so that left hand must not know what right be doing slid half crown into dish be fearfully wonderfully like to hand larger sum reserve for smaller according to sunday usage david have filled one of pocket with maize to give pigeon bowed strutted about pavement outside west door be not till early christian have boarded bus there be need to day for cave beyond afforded by parasol that must seek solution of such theological difficulty a have occurred during service first be a to why spirit must long faint for converse of saint did converse mean opposite in case spirit longed fainted for wicked people then there be knotty point of special grace preventing david must only suppose that meant very long grace such a bishop used when stayed at winston prevented from sitting down to dinner converse of early christian drifted away to more mundane question of what be to be done after lunch here dodo have privilege of suggesting though not of deciding suggestion of zoological garden led to immediate decision will see blue faced mandrill said david said be so like prince albert will stand in front of cage say 'good morning prince albert dodo have forgotten that have made odious comparison must do anything of sort darling said mandrill must be at pleased monkey hate being told be like people just a people hate being told be like monkey david considered will have to hate then observed doe cheat at croquet too there be salvation army said dodo skilfully changing subject lion in trafalgar square will see lion fed afternoon yes will see mandrill fed doe mandrill eat a much a not so much a lion said be going to say be going to say 'does eat a much a prince ' oh mummy look there be jumbo hi uncle jumbo bus be just moving on again after stopping opposite carlton hotel there on pavement majestic jewelled turbanned be that potentate who have already won so honourable place in david heart that have be promoted to brevet rank of uncle looked up at nephew shrill salutation saw dodo with celerity marvellous in one of bulk skipped off pavement bounced bounded along street after presenting so amazing appearance that conductor instead of stopping bus stared open mouthed at oriental apparition after few second maharajah giving up thought of further hopeless pursuit stood in middle of road waving arm like great brown jewelled windmill blowing handful of kiss after well run uncle jumbo screamed david what pity thin middle aged lady like flat fish probably person who tell public who be in park looking lovely sitting on seat next dodo peered over side of bus turned to with air of haughty reproof must teach little boy better manner said than to go shouting such name at maharajah of bareilly yes david said dodo with glance that completely understood sit down at once be so rude shouting name at people in street be that really maharajah ma'be very proper behaviour appeared to mollify flat fish dear yes said be maharajah of bareilly be so good natured be sure wo mind wear pearl valued at million sterling indeed said dodo must make very good natured too must flat fish fingered very brilliant cairngorm brooch wore to great advantage at throat in case dodo have noticed have so affable pleasant too said dear yes oh

committing very full of engagement be during brief visit here to morrow dines with marchioness of chesterford lady dodo a friend call dodo gave awful jump a name came out with such unexpectedness

fancy not knowing chesterford house beautiful ballroom daresay be very pleasant living in country be strange thing now for moment when came up on to bus though seldom go by bus reminded of marchioness

know too drew up few yard down piccadilly conversation be interrupted by exit down gangway of dismounting passenger during pause flat fish be probably saved from direct perjury by violent hooting of motor immediately behind looking round dodo saw jumbo dismounting from car having evidently pursued up lower regent street new friend looked round too beamed with excitement here be maharajah again exclaimed now be quiet little boy will have good look at dodo rapidly considered dramatic situation seemed highly probable that jumbo must board bus a soon a outgoing passenger permitted to do so

by ambassador two shook hand prince came down three step opposite dodo motor be drawn up be open there must have be doubt about seeing struck that intention be to walk away without appearing to notice that of course be quite impermissible bisque soup said by way of greeting scouring london for lobster gave sort of start that dramatic rhinoceros might be expected to give if intended to carry impression that be surprised ah lady dodo said be indeed be heartbroken at not coming to house to night princess have to go into country there be getting out of so sad also will make long stay in country know when will get back will take humble compliment to princess will not will take also regret that will not have honour to receive to night amiable papa be to have lunched with to day now

carriage door well said excellency be quite well again morning lady said that too be rather straw like drive on said just a impulse rather than design governed greater part of dodo conduct so intuition rather than logic be responsible for conclusion have not agreed last night with edith reasoning now with glimpse of own jumped to deduction landed so to speak by edith side a yet there be nothing definite except unpublished news of austrian ultimatum to servia hurried meeting of cabinet morning to warrant ground for real uneasiness a to european situation generally a far a dodo knew anything definite indefinite to connect germany with now with fact that dinner have be put off last night ambassador be quite well morning coupled with own sudden intuition that allensteins be going back post haste to germany leaped to conclusion seemed firm to landing in flash simply found believing that germany intended to provoke european war then characteristically enough instead of dwelling for moment on menace of hideous calamity contemplating huge unspeakable nightmare thus unveiled found exclusively entrancedly interested in situation a at moment be expected entire diplomatic world german austrian included at ball night already telegraph wire between london european capital must be tingling twitching with cypher message that flew backwards forward over austrian ultimatum eye

dodo be caught in block at top of st james street suddenly made up mind to stop at hotel say good bye to princess albert two motif contributed to first being that though alike have be very rude throwing over with so needle absence of ceremony politeness have better not descend to level second must be confessed be far stronger being overwhelming curiosity to know for certain whether be right in conjecture that be going to get behind rhine a soon a possible dodo found princess sitting in hall exactly opposite entrance hatted cloaked umbrellaed jewel bagged with short sighted impatient eye on revolving door towards whenever moved directed glance through lorgnette a dodo came towards princess turned head aside a if like husband seeking to avoid meeting next moment even while dodo paused

be fault a for dearest dodo kiss on cheek thank for kindness pray for happier meeting than be also parting afternoon there began to be publicly felt beginning of tension grew until breaking point came in first day of august for dodo shining example precept ball night might easily have resolved into mere conference again again at beginning of evening floor be empty long after band have struck up while round room group of people collected talked together on one subject dodo seemed to be absolutely ubiquitous whenever saw earnest conversationalist at work plunged into middle of broke up like dog charging flock of sheep to morrow must do for talk to night be ball special prey be group have a centre excited female fount of gossip who began sentence with tell whenever fatal phrase caught dodo remarkably sharp ear instantly led utterer of away to be introduced to someone on great red dais managed to lose in crowd went for next offender rumour that allensteins have left charing cross afternoon for germany be dangerously interesting topic whenever dodo came across strenuously denied regardless of truth asserted that a matter of fact be going down again to morrow to stay with father at vane royal then perceiving not far off looking at dais with expression of dante beholding beatific vision have dived into crowd again told that if must assert beyond possibility of contradiction that be case must presently introduce to anyone on red dais whom might select a pondered on embarrassment of such richness be off again to break up dangerous focus of conversation hour of wild activity be sufficient to set thing really moving avert danger of ball becoming mere meeting for discussion of european situation presently found five minute rest in window of music gallery from must survey ballroom marquee adjoining in thirty year experience a hostess guest have never be present at ball seemed quite to touch high water mark here felt that without lord cookham assistance have provided exactly sort of evening that have designed in honour of jumbo have happened like everybody be present in riot of colour rhythm that seethed about at moment dais stretched from side to side of huge room be empty for one of occupant be dancing observed that even lord cookham who have come in official capacity have deserted place behind row of chair be majestically revolving with princess making little obeisance a cannoned heavily into other exalted personage whole of diplomatic corp be there german austrian included there be german ambassador quite recovered from curious indisposition waltzing with italian ambassadress same spirit have animated dodo in breaking up serious conjecture conversation seemed now to have spread broadcast be conspirator to make ball last of year most brilliant memorable from utilitarian point of view there be more to be said for than for gorgeously plumaged bird strutted spread jewelled wing yet time be symbol expressing not alone what stood for glory of great name wide world commerce invincible navy endorsement of empire lay behind glittered shone like great diamond in illumination at moment might be obscured by menace of thundercloud if be last ray must shine on before darkness that even now lapped edge of enveloped entirely that gloom must suck light from not soften crush heart of adamant from moment that ball got moving dodo abandoned to enjoying to utmost wanting a be characteristic of to suck last ounce of pleasure from have that indispensable quality of good hostess namely power of making most fervent of guest never have appreciated ball so much not until floor be growing empty morning light growing vivid between chink of closed curtain did realise that be over jumbo dear said why ca double a one doe at bridge then somehow must be eleven o last night must have over again be really going what pity stop to breakfast dear what pearl ca believe be real let go to bed at yes do know be quite true though have be lying about quite beautifully allensteins left for germany afternoon mean yesterday afternoon oh want to begin again what will next day bring wonder stood at street door moment while went out into pregnant toneless light precedes sunrise when thing look unreal pavement road outside be pearly with dew needle head light of motor a purred way up to door gleamed with unnatural redness in house floor be quite empty now band silent crowd of men woman eager to get away besieged cloakroom in ten minute more dodo found alone for servant already beginning to restore room to ordinary state felt suddenly tired going upstairs drew down blind over open window wanted to get to sleep at once to shut out dawning day that might bring chapter vii dodo apprenticeship morning paper be late that day when arrived dodo snatched at automatically turned to communique from french front there be list of name of village have be lost to ally be unfamiliar meant nothing to then looked with sudden sinking of heart at accompanying map shewed by black line new position of front be intelligible enough for last fortnight have be moving westward southward with regular incredible rapidity like advance of incoming tide over level sand occasionally for little have be held up flood frankly irresistible always swept away that have caused momentary check in next column be account of german atrocity compiled from story of belgian refugee dodo have come back to london last night from winston where have be seeing to conversion of house into red cross hospital just now felt like intolerable ache sense of own uselessness life have found perfectly easy to do thing wanted to do have supposed to be efficient person now when there be need for efficient people what did qualification amount to must ride a few woman in england must ride be possessed of enormous physical nervous energy be inimitable hostess must convert dull party into brilliant one by sheer effortless out pouring of own wit infectious vivacity for practical purpose from organisation down to knitting be a useless a girl straight out of nursery where everything have be done for by assiduous attendant be even more useless than child for child at rate have adaptability power of learning appropriate to age whereas dodo a have lately be ascertaining have life be pouring energy down certain definite now useless channel in consequence channel have become well worn energy flowed naturally with seemed to refuse to be diverted with useful result elsewhere must ride must play bridge must a despondently told talk hind leg off donkey must entertain be entertained till everyone else be dying to go to bed one wanted to do of thing now there be absolutely demand for when came to knitting stocking being personally responsible for thing being done instead of making cook groom butler responsible for have notion how to set about very characteristically when david nurse have announced intention of being trained for hospital work dodo have warmly congratulated determination have given enormous tip have bundled off to station in prodigious hurry saying that must look after david herself thing that small boy required to have done for filled with dismay at own incompetence when have to do if got foot wet fresh sock have to be found for if breech be covered with short white hair from ride must be brushed off button have to be replaced there be end to ministration dodo must not get on at with stocking be knitting supervision of storing of furniture at winston while have to produce neat daily david incidentally failed to do so advertised for nurse without delay david be exceedingly relieved at arrival dodo be luckily incapable of prolonged despair with regard to own shortcoming by way of self consolation thought turned to fact that before left winston have contrived arranged charming little flat in wing of house for herself david jack whenever must find time to come there for be in charge of remount camp knowing a certainly did be to be known about horse from to z dodo mind harked back for moment to own uselessness in envious contemplation of solid worth in practical way of husband knowledge for through frivolous year have be content with fact of consummate horsemanship have hand have seat have complete confidence well warranted in ability to manage trickiest most vicious of four legged thing there knowledge rather instinct stopped whereas jack mere lubber on horse compared with be perfect encyclopaedia with regard to equine matter of be profoundly ignorant must size up horse by looking at in way incomprehensible to dodo knew about sore back bran mash frog sickle hock now lore have never troubled to learn more than have troubled to decipher doctor prescription understand ingredient be precisely that made jack at crisis when efficiency be needed so immensely useful however after have be useful too for have planned that delicious little flat at winston necessary since house be to be made into hospital must give accommodation to everything of course be quite simple have put in two bathroom with usual paraphernalia of squirt douche spray have converted peculiarly spacious pantry into kitchen with gas stove white tiled wall naturally since house be no longer habitable have to be done at once energy have driven through in very short space of time expense have be rather staggering especially in view of cost of running hospital so dodo have sent bill to father with lucid explanatory letter thought of delicious little flat must be so economical with gas stove for cooking very simple central heating in case a jack gloomily prognosticated there must be difficulty about coal before war be over made dodo brighten up little diverted thought from on creeping barbarous tide in france sense of own uselessness after somebody have to contrive to invent even though plumber upholsterer effected material conversion daddy paid bill have come up to town in order to superintend similar change at chesterford house be to be turned into hospital for officer dodo be determined that everything must be very nice ballroom must be ward so also must be biggest of three drawing room dining room have better be left just a be in anticipation of time when invalid must come down to dinner again intended to keep couple of room for herself one for maid since must not be at winston year round then suddenly perceived that behind charitable plan there be reservation of complete comfort for herself cost nothing in personal sense to live in wing at winston cosy corner of house in london there be not ounce of sacrifice about yet have read with certain complacency very morning that lord lady chesterford have set noble example to rest of wealthy class in giving up not one only of big house now complacency fell down like house of card jack certainly have given up something for day be passed in real personal work be on staff with nice red band on cap tab on shoulder spur here even in moment that be damning own complacency be back in old rut thinking about sign decoration instead of what stood for there be black line of tide creeping over france three column of casualty in morning paper one of german atrocity dodo be expecting edith to lunch since chef have gone back to france to rejoin colour there be only vague number of kitchen maid

burst by way happened before fourth of august seems century away now can only dimly remember what used to be like european war for ten year at least have be sort of unspeakable nightmare nobody ever really believed in here be plunged up to neck in edith seemed to have something in reserve go on said helping to admirable omelette want to know how affect dodo finished omelette in hurry drew basket full of wool knitting needle from under table out of took long sort of pipe made of worsted made few rapid pass with needle have be frightfully busy said if be not busy time begin wondering if power

exciting about blocking up door in room at winston so a not to have vegetable smell coming up from kitchen thinking how tremendously clever be being waited till have quite finished talking then said 'but how will ladyship get into room ' be same with awful stocking dodo exhibited work look said leg be over two foot long already for three day past have be trying to turn heel a book say heel wo turn stocking go on in straight line like billiard cue can never do one so even if heel be kind enough to turn now must have to advertise for man at least seven foot high who have lost one leg

pipe in case of severe frost even then must have to rip up from top to bottom to get round pipe cut off water supply take pipe down then fit stocking on to then again when david nurse left said must

end of projected outside station arrived at winston so dodo made extremely comfortable in luggage van feeling perfectly blissful to be alone though in luggage van to be inaccessible to intrusive call of duty for three whole hour indeed almost hoped that train must be late that must then get longer interval of solitude than have luncheon basket pillow fur coat book promised to be amusing have very prudently thrown morning paper have not yet read out of window for fear must get interested in think about war if there be good news must wait for till got to london if there be bad news thought must wait for ever friendly guard rather shocked to see preference for luggage van rather than fraction of seat in crowded carriage have drawn iron grille across entrance so that resembled dangerous caged

renew sense of travelling in train at rush past crowded platform rise fall of telegraph wire a post flicked by procession of green field blossoming orchard stream running full with spring rain cuckoo fact of being on way to london after four solid month of hospital life at winston thought of luncheon basket with purposed soon to refresh have sweet savour of remote ordinary normal life about semblance of pre war existence even when must last for few hour seemed extraordinarily delicious almost more pleasant be smell of springtime streamed in through window indefinable fragrance of moisture growth greenness drew in long inhalation of for of late world have seemed to contain only three odour namely of iodoform of cooking dinner of virginian cigarette for last four month have not spent single night away from winston even then have only gone away a be doing now to have look at how thing be going on in officer hospital at chesterford house never in life a far a must remember have spent anything approaching four month in same place dodo who few year before have literally no first hand experience of what fatigue really meant felt very tired morning have got quite used to to have be stranger for so many year now seemed a much part of general consciousness to be always tired a did in old day to feel always fresh have found that when have arrived at sufficient degree of fatigue got worse remained steady constant now accepted a permanent did not think about sight sound be veiled with chronic weariness took keen edge off sensation smelt listened to odour sound of springtime a if through cotton wool looked at radiance a if through smoked glass cut off brightness of sun ray presented with sepia sketch instead of coloured picture still be very good to be quit of smell of iodoform sight of bandage busy life in hospital have now for year half cut off from pursuit in hitherto life have be passed so even while recognised brook have jumped fence have fallen at realised how remote doings of day have become be severed from not merely by two winter of abstinence from hunting much more crucially by chasm of huge catastrophe have wrecked be still wrecking world memory must accurately recall old incident to in own consciousness must not recall atmosphere in day have be lived at most seemed to have be read about in very vivid book not to have be personally experienced by realised that be probably only symptom of general fatigue false claim a christian scientist must have told falsity be extremely plausible convincing fatigue however symptom arising from be just thing be bound most sternly to suppress when be at work value such a be in day long routine lay a be well aware in being gay ridiculous without apparent effort giving frolic welcome to task a if be greatest fun in world have in fact to pretend to be what have always be deep down in hoped believed that mainspring of vitality be unimpaired for now a train sped onwards something within hailed springtime like awakened brunnhilde with ecstatic recognition only did not thrill through a custom used to be there be hard fatigued crust on sens what missed most thing that did actively continually long for be society companionship of friend just a week have done nothing work so have seen nobody except professionally engaged with legion of friend be with one exception a busy over war work a be younger men with terrible gap already in number be fighting on one of many battle front older men be engaged with office work other mission for more mature woman girl alike be nursing typewriting washing dish running canteen be too busy to see just a be too busy to see be very real deprivation to dodo for have le than genius for friendship many of however be in london dodo proposed to do something towards making up arrears of human companionship during next week daughter nadine graf be dining with to night going to theatre edith sole exception among war working friend be entertaining to morrow with evening at opera next day there be small dance somewhere must be full of boy from france girl from hospital social engagement two day seemed to dodo after month of abstinence to be positive orgy ate sandwich with awakening zest for life fell fast asleep day be beginning to flame towards sunset when got out at london terminus at sight of crowd brisk busy occupied with various affair sense of stimulus be vastly increased there be little fog in station with smell of smoke of grimy beloved old london hanging there everyone seemed to have two leg two arm not to be bandaged not to limp one have sling crutch involuntarily there came into dodo mind verse from bible about lame blind be hated of david soul for one moment a intoxication of freedom independence of crowd brisk movement mounted to head felt secret sympathy with monarch sentiment be so literally translated into actual conduct by edith who still refused to have anything to do with war work occasionally wrote to dodo saying how magnificently new symphony be progressing even while sympathised with david detested edith interpretation of though realised that not having single drop of artistic ichor in blood must not possibly understand temperament led to remain one unpatriotic individual in circle edith similarly refused to talk hear about war at because mention of interrupted that aloofness from disturbing thought be necessary to give full play to artist creative power dodo must not however let divergence of sentiment even on so vital topic interfere with friendship edith have right to own conviction odious though might be to ordering of own life only if own thought action be entirely concerned with war be difficult so dodo found not to let trace of creep into conversation however when met edith to morrow must do best dodo have several business to attend to before went home when finally rather behind time drove down piccadilly on way to chesterford house sun have long set such lighting a in view of hostile raid be thought sufficient illuminated street blink of kind shewed in blank front of house road pavement presented most fascinating harmony in subdued variegated tint glass of street lamp be painted over with violet of others with red others be heavily blacked on top surface not obscured below so that octagonal patch of pavement be vividly lit whether delightful scheme of colour helped to confuse possible raider dodo did not consider be quite content to enjoy aesthetic effect did seem very bewildering street be still shining with moisture of shower have fallen earlier in afternoon furnished dim rainbow of reflected colour while whole paint box of various tint be held in solution by serene light of moon now near to full swinging clear above tree in park thought of raid night struck a rather attractive for have not yet be in one re awakened interest in life welcomed idea of new experience be just turning in at big gate of chesterford house when became likely that wish be to be gratified hooting of bicycle horn sound of police whistle began to pierce shrilly through bourdon rumble of wheeled traffic grew swiftly louder instantaneously there came change in movement of foot passenger who be strolling leisurely along first stopped to verify what have heard then proceeded on way at far livelier pace many of breaking into run soon tearing along road came dozen bicyclist hooting whistling shouting take cover dodo have just got out of motor be absorbed in new happening when nadine in cloak evening clothes came running in at gate oh mamma be that said be lucky have just got here in time let come in at once dodo kissed darling simply ca come in minute said leg refuse to take want to see what happens so dreadfully what do do next how about theatre must be nice to be there for raid much mind if ca go will have cosy little evening together oh must go in said nadine get on nerve have to sit in corner shut ear get cold knee tremble what do do next do ask drop enormous bomb on let off gun in world at be most unattractive must come in before gun begin dodo promised to do so a soon a nadine have gone inside house went out of big gate again into street already wheeled traffic in road have mysteriously melted away almost entirely ceased though pavement be still full of hurrying foot passenger most of whom crossed road hundred yard further down towards entrance of tube station be already black with people a went spoke jerkily nervously to other a if vexed irritated in ten minute have vanished leaving street entirely empty seemed a if uncanny enchantment must have waved over town spell withered up life so that be now city of dead pulse of traffic beat no longer down artery not light appeared in window trace of animation remained in not whisper of wind stirred remote moon shone down on emptiness dodo holding breath to listen found stillness ringing in ear suddenly silence be broken by distant mutter very faint muffled sounding not like little noise near at hand great noise long way off for low a be buffeted air dodo felt that nerve in body be sending urgent message of alarm to brain with there went along same wire message of tingling exhilaration be real thing be war in hospital have lived till have got used to with whom wild beast have torn mangled sound of gun here in secure centre of london be different in kind from that be war not effect of war knew that outer defence away somewhere to east be already engaged with enemy whose machine laden with bomb be drawing closer moment with speed of swallow on wing then that remote mutter ceased again absolute silence succeeded dodo to intense surprise found that hand be icy cold that knee be shaking quite clearly though have not known brain be acting on alarming message be pouring into more vivid than be intense curiosity a to what be coming next exhilaration in excitement of again silence became intolerable filling air like dense choking fog one part of must have given anything in world to be safe back at winston huddled in cheerful recess of tube with prudent crowd have hurried by part that more potent must not have accepted bribe to miss moment of superb suspense then somewhere over green park much nearer at hand there came flash a of distant lightning silhouetting tree against faint violet background gun barked into night shell whimpered squealed several time be that repeated then other gun barked more loudly fiercely at dodo intense curiosity must have conveyed to for moment be quite satisfied before fairly knew what be doing foot have carried scudding across gravelled space in front of house finger be fumbling with latch key at door did not feel in least afraid of german bomb fragment of english shrapnel be consciously desperately afraid of silence of noise above of solitude for next hour there be need to fear silence so few moment of silence be there to be afraid of sometimes firing died down to distant mutter like with have begun then without warning hyde park gun from close at hand broke in with bouquet of furious explosion scream of squealing thing making window rattle in frame then just a suddenly must cease more distant firing seemed echo of tumult between report must be heard drone of engine of hostile aircraft once for space of minute noise came loud throbbing down chimney showing that machine be directly overhead two three time detonation infinitely more sonorous than sharp report of gun gave news that bomb have be dropped clanging bell grew louder died away again a fire engine dashed up deserted street outside dodo nadine sat together in sitting room that dodo have reserved for herself when gave up rest of house to be hospital table for early dinner before theatre be half laid since raid began arrangement have be left incomplete now that be within wall not alone longer dodo fear have passed off altogether found merely restless excited incessantly going to window raising corner of blind to see what be visible outside park lay quiet under serene wash of moonlight now then tracer shell lit new momentary constellation among star ray of searchlight swept across sky like revolving flail of gigantic windmill nadine meantime sat in remote corner of room directly underneath electric lamp with book on lap on be quite unable to concentrate attention finger ready to apply to ear when noise proposed to shut out have violently assailed once remonstrated with mother for excursion to window be really rather dangerous said if bomb be dropped in road outside window must be blown in glass must cut into small piece of mince darling how can be so sensible a to think of sort of thing in middle of air raid asked dodo though be quite horrible brutal be so amazingly interesting must like to go up on to roof in bomb proof hat must remember be first air raid even most unpleasant thing be interesting first time happen remember so well first visit to dentist do air raid make most people thirsty be terribly thirsty nadine shut up book laughed be lovely person to be with said mind nearly a much a usual hark hear whistle dodo listened beamed certainly said what doe mean be raid mamma of course not said nadine what awful idea be signal 'all clear have driven out of london be blessing also rather disappointment said dodo let have dinner at once will be dressed in five minute then can go to theatre after be exciting be cramming lot in weird melodrama thrilled dodo that night general thrill be renewed again next morning by telephone message from edith that bomb have fallen in road exactly in front of house completely wrecking two front room wanted to come round instantly to see dodo over very important matter arrived quarter of hour late boiling with conversation fury insured yes be insured shouted what have insurance got to do with if took up poker dodo smashed looking glass must find consolation in fact that be insured must be infernal impertinence brutality must concern brute deliberately bombed who have always well know what attitude towards germany have be will leave at that there be twenty page of score of new symphony be on

extremely strenuous week took convalescent out for drive in morning to matinee in afternoon got up variety of entertainment for who be in bed many of friend be in town busy also sandwiched in between hospital duty prodigious quantity of social intercourse yet spring sunshine aroma have for present gone out of used to render life agreeable be effort hardly worth making in day when effort be valuable to wear even semblance of light heart when there be nothing more to be gained beyond passing of pleasant hour for fatigue of mind soul lay within like cold lump must not be dissolved have sort of spiritual indigestion made amusement taste queerly apart from mere stimulus of human companionship tearing about attempt to recapture little of pre war insouciance be hardly worth exertion in ward must be amazing there have purpose to play fool with purpose see fulfilling be altogether different affair be easy enough what be difficult be to play fool from mere ebullition of high spirit edith came to station to see dodo off on return to winston have meant to stop couple of day already be fidgeting to get to work again what clinched decision to go back be that medical inspector have given notice of visit to hospital to morrow morning be unthinkable that must not be there have secured seat in train two strolled along platform till be due to start be waste of time energy said to

magisterial must be too person be typist said edith be one so ought to know in week time will be absolutely proficient dear how clever of said dodo forgetting to be disagreeable what will do then will make round of hospital do correspondence for for week will come to winston will be lovely said dodo what about munition factory say be too old to stand hour to stand standing old indeed also may smoke be more important one have to make most of one faculty if must smoke day must be at best have got to learn efficiency will win when do best have come out of dim arch of station dodo helplessly giggling sat down on bench in sunlight be so deliriously like said practically say that war be won because have bought typewriter be right spirit too feel red cross may be happy in mind so long a be at winston same abstract question be interesting feel that only way to laugh nowadays be to make other people laugh have got to take short view get through day work get through to morrow work to

if new dress did come up to hope never saw again now wear dress for year instead of taking special catch slow train humbly travel in luggage van think will ever go back to old day even if have enough money left to do so looked round sudden misgiving dawned on where train said ought to be standing there what have happened be soon clear what have happened hour later dodo left in special at staggering expense in order to get down to winston night chapter ix mid stream morning paper have be brought in to dodo with letter opened quickly at middle page german assault on verdun be being pressed ever more fiercely seemed impossible that town must hold out much longer second of protecting fort have fallen smashed pulverised under hail of devastating steel dodo read more than summary of news be bad everywhere there be not single gleam of sun shining through impenetrable black cloud have risen out of central europe nearly two year ago still poured torrent on to broken land on eastern front of germany russian army be being pushed back british garrison in kut be completely surrounded even sturdiest of optimist must do more than affirm that fall of town must not have real bearing on war generally have said precisely same when few month ago gallipoli have be evacuated just a when in first stupendous advance of enemy across france flanders have slapped silly leg shouted that german line of communication be lengthening daily presently ally must snip through so that army of hun must drop neatly off like thistle head when sever stalk with stick at rate how many how grave disaster be sufficient to have bearing on war perhaps fall of verdun must be blessing in disguise disguise certainly seemed impenetrable optimist must pierce dodo pulled together remembered that be optimist too though not quite of order that be not consistent with creed to meditate upon irretrievable misfortune indeed to meditate upon anything at when there be dozen private letter of own to be opened at once probably thirty forty more connected with hospital work waiting for in office certainly be not conducive to efficiency to think too much in day especially if nothing depression be to be result of thinking if must do be to see to affair of hospital be surely better to do than to speculate on present data about result of fall of verdun tap at door david voice demanding admittance reminded that after have attended to immediate requirement of hospital be to have holiday to day a david be going to school for first time to morrow day be dedicated to thus there be reason for liveliness must

be reasonable too not having to run for instance if really be tired so when have gone downstairs emptied bath water out began again since be really unreasonable to expect to get into fragrant soup david have treated to be nearly up to time in interval have learned exciting news that keeper wife have given birth to twin led to question on abstruse subject of generation appalled parlour maid dodo adhered to gooseberry bush theory must not budge from position hour in business room after breakfast be sufficient to set in order thing that must personally attend to came out on to lawn where david have decreed that croquet must form first diversion of day be deliciously warm for spring be bursting into young leaf apple blossom on day that dodo have gone up to town three week ago be now in last

out convoy of gassed men did well under stimulus dodo roused for effort of not thinking did not even think how odd be for to whom activity be so natural to be obliged to make effort day mounted into week week into month ceased looking forward looking back be enough to get through day work day be little too much for so too be effort to keep mind absorbed in actual work lay to hand perhaps tired more than work chapter x silver bow dodo be lying in bed just aware that strip of sunlight on floor be getting broader be not precisely watching consciously knew that have once be line of light be now oblong rest of perception be concerned with fact that be extremely pleasant to have be commanded in way that made argument impossible to remain where be not to get up think of doing so until doctor have visited for there be nothing so repugnant to mind at moment a idea of doing anything believed that have breakfasted in drowsy manner believed with perfect truth that have gone to sleep again afterwards for now sunlight made broad patch on floor collecting reasoning faculty remembering that room looked due south arrived at brilliant conclusion that morning must have progressed towards noon seemed something of discovery having arrived at conclusion went to sleep again dreamed dream being about a vivid a waking consciousness that be chicken be being put up to auction in operating theatre two bidder be interested in must not buy till awoke one of bidder be jack who stood on left of bed other hospital doctor on right before whose advent be not allowed to get up then dream be whisked off brain in manner of blanket being pulled from bed becoming wide awake be aware that disconcerting dream be a retailer of incredible story say largely founded on fact for there be jack on one side of bed doctor ashe on other did not look like bidder at auction at a waking consciousness assured did look at anxious doctor ashe seemed to have said fine sleeper jack a dodo opened eye remarked rather ironically so thought good afternoon darling annoyed why afternoon asked be silly then looking at patch of sunlight again seemed only real link with normal world saw have got narrow be on other side of bed very well then be afternoon said why must be never said be of course did said jack in absurdly soothing manner now will have talk with dr ashe dr ashe be not in need of great explanation for being hospital doctor be already in possession of main fact of case for last month dodo have be increasingly irritable increasingly forgetful have urged many time to go away have complete rest have warned her of possible consequence of neglecting advice have scouted idea of being in need of anything except strenuous employment then only yesterday afternoon have suddenly fainted recovering from have simply collapsed now accounted to dr ashe for unusual proceeding with great lucidity forgot about dinner said came on top of being rather tired only wanted good night rest like everybody else have have that be quite well again who be attending to store dr ashe slid hand on to wrist oh store be all right said guilefully have have sister alice under for couple of month have made wonderfully competent for own peace of mind want to answer one question go ahead said dodo hope be not crashingly difficult not bit supposing told to get up at once go back to work do feel that must be able to get through couple of hour of on oath dodo thought over trying to imagine active be difficult to imagine anything for seemed incapable of picturing otherwise than lying in bed even then everything be dream like dr ashe did not seem like real person jack dream like also have merely melted away be only conscious with sense of reality of enormous lassitude languor unlike anything have previously experienced even burden of answering perfectly simple question be heavy limb seemed weighted with lead bulk of lead have be reserved for brain have to make effort in order to answer at be not sure said because feel so odd think that if told to stand up must fall down ca be certain be only what think what be matter with dream like voice answered have got what asked for said must take holiday when must now have got to be just broken down sounded so alarming that dodo have to make joke be not going to break up be asked of course be not not chance of be to happen to then asked be to spend two three day in bed said after that will consider limit to for present something inside dodo approved strongly of that sound quite nice said will sleep then will sleep then will sleep anticipation proved to be quite correct dodo be roused for meal resented toilet for next forty eight hour be fast asleep at least dozing in vacancy of brain that found extremely pleasurable at end of time entered with zest into future plan with doctor jack may leave out rest cure said because if want to stop in bed for month wo must hate so much that must take care that must do good must be best thing for said doctor then must choose second best must make ill to stop in bed for month so must have to recover over again afterwards oh jack owl for god sake tell do want because know know lot of thing want want

with anybody anything be that dodo right arm lying outside bedclothes suddenly twitched who did that said why doe keep still have got jump want to be quiet ca either of understand want to go somewhere empty quiet asked jack yes have said so several time want to talk more left alone again after presently when returned appeared that jack have once spent couple of week one november at small norfolk village near sea object of expedition have be duck shooting a far a duck went have be disappointing for usually got up mile two away flew out to sea in straight line with speed of express train never came back more apart from duck village of truscombe have promising feature a regarded present requirement for jack be not able to recollect feature of slightest interest about squatted on edge of marsh there be sea within mile of supposed there be inhabitant for there be small extremely comfortable inn now in july there must not even be intending duck shooter there promised to be apotheosis of nothing at dodo roused to take interest in a colourless account of proceeded even under cross examination jack must not recollect anything marred tranquillity of picture yes there be post office where must get daily paper if wanted one on other hand if did not want one hastened to add need there be also windmill sail of be always stationary there be duck there be pier there a band nearest station be four mile away really in fact there be anything lust for nothingness gleamed in dodo eye sound delicious said when may go to truscombe dr ashe have couple more day in bed said then can go a soon a like if will promise not to make exertion for feel inclined be why be going interrupted telegraph to inn jack engage couple of room oh dear feel in bone that truscombe be just what want will meet at station with very slow old cab better still with dog cart sound just precisely right will call mr dodo of london be too blessed lovely three evening later accordingly dodo arrived at holt found dog cart waiting for exactly a have anticipated whisper of north wind off sea driver serene smiling octogenarian began by talking to for little conversation reminded of bubble coming up through tranquil water a asked how war be getting on did hear much about war down at truscombe crop be doing well though le said about apple better after information sank into calm sleep so did pony walked in sleep a vanished sun began to set north west sky on fire deliberate equipage emerged from wooded inlands into flat ample space smouldered beneath enormous sky across open sea gleamed like indigo wire laid down a in coloured map along edge of land spiced vivid savour set pony sneezing awoke with toss of head began of own accord to trot in time that unusual motion aroused driver jogged along at livelier pace air seemed charged with very elixir of life be like noble atmospheric vintage enlightened eye set pulse beating full steady presently came to village with brick facing of flint built house glowing in last of sunset night stock redolent in garden to left stretched vast water meadow intersected with dyke where loose strife willow herb smouldered among tall grass tasselled reed gave harbourage to moor hen out of inhabitant of truscombe one representative seemed to be in street slowly trundled barrow in front of let be known that have fresh mackerel for sale short spell of walking alternated with longer sitting on handle of barrow whether sat whether walked one bought mackerel laighton arm stood on curve of sole street through village dodo entered a into land full of promise old setter lying in passage thumped welcome with tail a if be already familiar friendly denizen just returning from outing dined alone at plain good hospitable board presently strolled out again through front door stood permanently open into empty street be night now sky be set with drowsy star glowed rather than sparkled up street there flowed not in puff gust with current of slow moving tide salt sweetness of marsh sea very soon strolling step have carried past last house in deep dusk stood looking out over empty level big grass grown bank built to keep out high tide from meadow zig zagged obscurely towards sea there be nothing there emptiness of land star studded sky waited just to see moon come up over eastern horizon light confirmed friendliness of huge solitude then returning found candle set ready for be clear invitation to go to bed looking out below blind saw in front stretch of low land with pool of water reflecting star six goose one behind other like frieze be crossing very slowly in direction of salt water creek wound seaward for next week dodo pursued complete intentional idleness with same zeal life have inspired activity got up very late after long hour of smooth deep sleep taking book packet of sandwich in satchel strolled out along bank to ridge of loose shingle ran east west along edge of sea at high tide wave broke against since walking along be exercise of treadmill laboriousness be content to encamp there in sunny hollow laze morning away sometimes for form sake opened book read paragraph two wondered what be about then transferred gaze to sea hour so passed swiftly in stupefied content then shifting position probably lay down on back bye bye hunger dictated consumption of sandwich refreshed revived must begin pencilled note to jack after few word usually found that have nothing to say watched sea gull supposed be sea gull patrolled edge of breaking wave for food dived like cast plummet into water then on retreat of tide ebb disclosed stretch of hard sand tattooed with pebble where walking be easy must wander away towards point of tumbled sand dune lay coast guard station stood there brought into touch with world by mean of row of telegraph post ran mile after mile straight a arrow along shingle bank defended from sea mile of marsh sand flat lay on landward side of through middle of broadening into glittering estuary when tide be high ran river debouched into sea beyond point at low tide be runnel of water threading way through enormous flatness of shoal mud bank where flock of sea bird hovered great stretch of solitude attracted dodo more even than familiar emptiness of sea once across bank of shingle sea be out of sight lay spread out strange untrodden wildness wearing aspect of hospitable loneliness sun steeped quiet narrow channel meandering dyke full at high tide empty at ebb zig zagged about marsh be clad in unfamiliar vegetation there be tract waist high in stiff heather like growth between lawn of sea lavender now breaking out into full flower above high water mark clump of thrift sea campion horned poppy overhead gull slid chided balancing on stiff pinion against wind relaxing that tense bow of flight be swept away out of sight across flat for mile there be one house set on spit of stony land even seemed outrage against spell of solitariness till dodo discovered that be undwelled in therefore innocuous for dozen day be enough for to sit on edge of shingle stroll through sea lavender of marsh hardly recording sound sight made up spell merely lying open to dew of silent enchantment then a vigour began to ooze into like tide imperceptibly filled channel in marsh extended radius came at last to sand dune be clumped together like hammer head on shaft of shingle ridge there telegraph post took right angled turn towards mouth of estuary where there be sign of inhabited place shanty nestling in hollow stranded ship made fast with chain with washing flutter on deck votary of solitude botanist ornithologist be told spent summer week here never saw petticoat trouser probably too avoided presence of others sought refuge in sand dune when fell form appeared just a must undoubtedly have done at glimpse of human creature here then while physically inhaled vitality tingled in marsh sea beach lonely place spent long solitary hour dozing among dune following arrow flight of tern wondering at plant seemed to draw nourishment from barrenness of sand yet time pushing root like into underlying fertility be almost sorry when mind stained deep with indelible day of unrelieved hard work in hospital began to show sign of own colour again mental fatigue too have stricken with far severer stroke than have be laid on body be with something of shock that began to be interested in surroundings instead of merely observing started first striving occurred during walk took along upper ridge of beach outside sand dune there have be shrill scolding screaming in air above from certain sharp winged bird clearly resented intrusion at moment have suddenly to check foot step sideways in order to avoid treading on clutch of four egg with brown mottled marking lay on protective colouring of shingle couple of yard further on be potential nursery soon found that whole of ridge be populous nesting place be natural to connect aerial screaming from hundred of bird hovered above with treasure at foot interest a opposed to contemplation awoke someone have told that very high tide in june have washed away egg of hundred of sea bird here be again industriously raising second brood have there be instead of bird hundred of human mother father yelling at to take care not to tread on baby must have fled from adult infant alike though still shunning own kind adored shy wild thing gabbled at wondered what be on way home noticed crop of transparent erect stalk growing thickly from mud bank looked like emerald green minute asparagus then what be shrubby stiff stemmed thing seemed to imitate mediterranean heath pink streaked convolvulus behaving a known convolvulus have ever behaved flowered out of sand really if wanted to avoid human being might be a well to make acquaintance with silent companion of solitude so thinking to start with known specimen picked sprig of sea lavender stepped into remarkably deep bog hole thereupon leg a far a knee wore shining stocking of rich black mud be necessary to cross bank of shingle wash in sea leave shoe to dry for sake of symmetry pulled off other shoe stocking paddled about rinsing out mud in tepid water dodo spread mired stocking out to dry on pebble just out of reach of crisply breaking ripple then saw most marvellous translucent pebble orange red in colour just being sucked into backwash of wave then small crab truculent menacing sidled towards next wave rolled over with gaping pincer returned cornelian to foot interesting piece of drift wood demanded investigation little further on found starfish threw back into sea then remembered stocking turned back there be sign of stocking other one two shoe be just recoverable from edge of incoming tide with in hand paddled homewards along liquid rim of sea that evening dodo sent immense telegram to housekeeper in london for standard book on british bird on british plant be to be despatched to immediately with field glass highly recommended for observation of small distant object that done spent studious evening in planning out scheme of study must take out with in morning book on bird flower make cache for in shrubby thing of must soon know name then for two hour must collect plant in marsh returning with spoil identify in book after lunch must take book on bird to commanding spot bowl out gull with field glass authority there must be note book quantity of well sharpened pencil two note book in fact one for bird one for botany imperceptibly instinctively after start have be made dodo began to run in strenuous race again bought bathing dress morning paper at post office bull eye there arrived for admirable field glass of german manufacture with copy of bleichroder bird of great britain in six volume kuhlmann english botany in eight be rather shocked at exhibition of hun industry speedily got over drove down to sea with treasure key of bathing hut proposed to convert into library with help of bleichroder bird zeiss field glass be almost certain that saw golden eagle hoopoe rare visitor to norfolk of made entry with query in ornithological note book then bathed then have lunch then after smoking four cigarette went to sleep in shadow of library have uneasy dream about berlin after botanised heathery looking shrub proved to be shrubby sea blite duly noted name in botany note book then there be orache thrift sea campion stinking archangel be thrilling to be noted down then returning to bird put down tern great black backed gull ringed plover sparrow probably tree subsequently crossed out golden eagle hoopoe for be hardly possible that first glance through zeiss must have revealed couple of such distinguished visitor of course be possible that have seen since possible must be stretched to degree of elasticity be better to be cautious wait for further appearance before astounding entire world of ornithologist dodo took volume of bleichroder bird back to hotel that night leaving rest of library in bathing hut contained admirable picture what really struck most about picture be vivid resemblance between bird portrayed human being shoveller especially with addition lightly pencilled then erased of spectacle looked precisely like dr ashe while richardson skua without addition at recalled edith with extraordinary vividness wondered who richardson be if have sent in card just then must have be entranced to have talk to about skua wondered also how be getting on at winston that evening wondered if jack have got back from france if david be asleep if edith be composing unrivalled symphony if lord ardingly be meditating on duty of upper class towards lower then became aware that human race be beginning to interest again up till now have at most be concerned with starfish tern shrubby sea blite thing touched mind impersonally now began to picture shewing pleasant creature to person of sort imagined directing david field glass towards richardson skua when have seen must restore bleichroder monumental work to shelf in sea library go to bathe suddenly thought of three week more have promised to spend here became intolerable if have to stay here alone

down street gramophone be jigging out lively tune dodo stole forth making pretext to herself that wanted to observe star of there be great number to night knew that longed to be near human movement again rhythmical thump accompanied gramophone shrillness wondered if there might happen to be little dancing going on soon localised sound there be room facing street with curtain discreetly drawn so a to conform with lighting order thump of foot went gaily on inside forgot about star belonged to steadfast imperishable thing called nature must be appealed to when be tired dance to wheezings of gramophone with handsome girl of village boy back on leave from france have become far more enthralling than bleichroder bird lying open on table in inn wheeling heaven above there lingered rather like ancient mariner without wedding guest to whom might soliloquise jack arrived on saturday night next morning dodo seemed to feel that what called picnic service on beach must be rather treat instead of going to church accordingly took out bible prayer book dodo whose bent be not strictly ecclesiastical read quantity of chapter out of ecclesiastes for first lesson for second lesson chapter

here be one might be feeling precisely a felt have supposed that day somebody something must come along begin to interest again then doubt must rouse have thought that jack must be most likely person to do that must propose month yachting few week in london be very watchful of by mean in power try to amuse knew quite well that faculty of living with zest have not left for long before first twenty four hour of complete laziness be over have pined for employment hailed fact of untidy business room a legitimate outlet for energy now found cast for very different part have imagined that jack must help on to foot again seemed that have to help for year have found in emotional stimulus without effort on part have never failed to respond to touch to do justice to answer need at moment though symptom be so infinitesimal namely failing to be amused at most trivial nonsense diagnosed failure of response at felt a if have be suddenly awakened by noise in night startled into complete consciousness meant danger a if there be burglar moving about house wit be about at once moved stealthily so that must not guess that anyone have heard be stirring dear have hit said in congratulatory voice why must do anything ought to do let oh jack be old be old for couple of year now have suspected that day be done have have hell of good time know have have hell of bad time let have more hell heaven for matter probably thought must want to go skylarking about again indeed have said a much told that have to stimulate get going again oh wish must convey to how hated idea of thought must come back with work over energy bursting to be employed again that must insist on ringing curtain up beginning old antic over again must have done too in order to please keep busy amused what relief to know want that dodo suddenly became afraid that be putting too much energy into renunciation of energy gave long tired sigh think of edith said how awful to have consuming fire of energy moment war be over threw typewriter out of window narrowly missed scullery maid in area have locked up piano know for period of war of course have lost key so broke open with poker sat down on middle of key in order to hear talk again have gone straight back to old life oh relief of knowing that want to must possibly have done without to whip on thank god dropped whip jack thought must expect to begin again must be disappointed if did so like good wife resigned to be spurred whipped just telling that must have to do joy of knowing that want to be tranquil too let go up to town to morrow next week until feel inclined dodo ran over what have said in mind thought covered ground have fully explained why have told jack that must be snowdrop sort of thing be convinced of wisdom when put up foot on chair showed sign of questioning sincerity have changed said want more excitement at least edith be volcano till now always thought be dodo made very good pretence at yawn stifled remember talking to edith just before war said told that cataclysm be wanted to change nature said that if lost penny have that have to play hurdy gurdy down piccadilly must still keep whole of enjoyment vitality so must well cataclysm have come though have ended in victory have done work a far a be concerned have played part have made bow will retire gracefully want to begin again be old be tired only reason for wishing to appear young fresh be that must expect to be angel dodo tongue may be stated be not blistered by enunciation of amazing assertion be not in least habitual liar sometimes became necessary to wander remarkably far from truth for good of when engaged in wandering called process not lying diplomacy have made up mind instantly that must never do for jack to resign to inaction for rest of life with extraordinary quickness have guessed that best way of starting again be not to push shove into unwelcome activity cordially to agree with profess same desire for reposeful existence regarded a quite certain that must not acquiesce long in abandoning activity of life must surely exert to stimulate interest again for be admirable loafer have just that spice of obstinacy about might make persist in lazy existence if tried to shake out of must be first astonished soon anxious if did same thing must exert to stimulate finding disconcerting even alarming if sank into tranquil apathy just now have asserted be so suitable to age inclination machiavellian plan then far from being roundabout oblique procedure seemed on reflection to be most direct route to goal left to might loaf almost indefinitely precisely similar course on part must certainly make rouse in order to spur flagging faculty time be who be spurring proceeded to clothe skeleton of diplomacy with flesh always used to wonder how particular moment must come to said though always used to say must welcome be secretly rather terrified of thought must be rather ghastly sort of wrench instead of being wrench have be most heavenly relaxation have warning see have taste of when collapsed went off alone to truscombe how delicious be darling that resignation so to speak have coincided with mine thought perhaps that must preserve energy longer than must have to follow faint pursuing that must fail first must have to drag along after way have happened make absolutely divine might have guessed perhaps have utterly grown into one jack have known that so many year dear be only one more instance out of thousand just same thing happened to mr mr browning who asked jack browning poet said dodo book after be mr though sound rather odd when one say so remember that delicious poem where sat by fire read book with spirit small hand propping forehead though never understood what spirit small hand meant thought be reading time be looking at dodo suddenly thought be going little too far be not quite fair to introduce into diplomacy quite such serious topic besides there be little too much vox humana about poked fire briskly 'by fireside be name of said here be must advertise think in personal column of time say that lord lady chesterford have decided to hing more side of grave letter will be forwarded inform large circle of friend that be quite well want to be bothered why jack be half past seven how time fly when one think about old day throughout march stopped down at winston subtlety of dodo diplomacy soon began to fructify saw from tail of eye that jack be watching that something bordering on anxiety began to resuscitate a tried to rouse once twice in warm day of opening april coaxed down to stream with for fishing be quiet pursuit not at variance with reposeful life to see if must not feel lure of running water be kindled in brightening fire of springtime if fish be rising well noted with bubble of inward amusement that must forget altogether for time then though hitherto have always discouraged even refused companionship when be fishing must come to induce to attempt to cast over feeding fish in water above so to please must take rod from instantly get hung up in tree oftener when proposed that must come out with must prefer to stay quiet in sheltered nook on terrace tell that be ever so happy alone once twice again succeeded in getting to come out for gentle ride solicitous on return to know that have not overtired eager for to confess that really have enjoyed then dodo must say darling be so good to perhaps consent to play game of picquet did not disquiet over thought that be ill for looked picture of health ate well slept well truthfully told that have not smallest pain discomfort of kind often be quite talkative rattled along in old style then in midflight must droop into silence again only once have moment of real alarm when found reading poem of longfellow
