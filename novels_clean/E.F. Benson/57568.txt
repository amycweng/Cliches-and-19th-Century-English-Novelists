when mamma dy will have two thousand year that wont be for two thousand year have be born too soon peter peter thought not worth answering lifting one of knee nursed between clasped hand in silence for loose honey coloured hair have crisp coal blackness be tall for small slim stature lip be set to definite purpose whereas hers be malleable to adapt to emotion might waywardly blow on in compensation for difference be complementary be triumphantly alike in complete soullessness of magnificent youth without violation of internal principle might either of shoot up singing with lark pad prowl with ruthless hunger of tiger burrow with mole be satyr hamadryad ancient eternally young embodiment of life with whim to take place of conscience irresponsible desire of wild thing to do duty for duty impulse to take place of reason too have developed to almost alarming degree that modern passion for introspection be end in like barren tree yield fruit in way of action renunciation peter hugged knee eye grew hazy unfocused in meditation be in love with do think asked at length laughed quite disregarding ear of bridge player with peter be more than with anyone else even than when alone

said that out of pure conventionality not out of conviction momentary perplexity like cloud on sunny windy day of spring bowled shadow over face creased soft perpendicular furrow between eyebrow peter think want to become conventional said if wish will confess be practising for when said that oh dear be human cast in mould put in cage if dont mind mixed metaphor im going to marry in ordinary way just because girl do marry mamma married so did two grandmammas four great grandmammas eight great great grandmammas in fact further go back commoner marriage seems to have be awful human hereditary

great aunt who be stringy grandmother remain young notice whereas elderly maiden lady be only sprightly think that because cling to youth there nothing so ageing a to cling to anything if want to retain anything best plan be to drop then cling to instead thats rather ingenious said peter may go on about for minute be going to perfectly true people who dont eat potato sweet for fear of getting fat become elephant like mamma who life on cracknel biscuit doe said peter with deep interest how wonderful of people who take immense care of die at age of forty because be clinging to life while who break ordinance of health never die at people who lay out to be brilliant be crashing bore oh yes proved said peter let go on to something else whats to happen to when marry nothing said nellie why must youll go on being quite different from anybody else thats career in arent human anyhow however many great grandmammas may have have youre wild thing partly domesticated when youre tired of go waving tail walking in wet wood telling nobody kipling know then come back rather sleepy pleased allow to put blue riband round neck tickle under chin then lie down on cushion in front of fire purr dont purr at though purr at lor said peter that about nellie pushed back hair from forehead again plaited finger together time be deliberative meditative process swift unconscious action yes dear there more too said swan song remember for soon be going to become ordinary conventional used to go in wet wood too know though never met other there have be bond between up till now have be completely independent youre going to remain so not oh peter there be bond dear do think that im rather mad have serious doubt about always be rather mad said go on sing swan song then dont look a if have taken guinea stall to hear said where have got to oh yes there be bond know ive never be conscious of anybody else a ive be conscious of have ever be conscious of anyone else a youve be conscious of youve never be in least in love with have with be same kind of person one doesnt often see same kind of person a do understand at be simply reading out of own book be silent moment nellie must marry if be rich asked made gesture of impatience how on earth can tell said if be rich must be quite different person shouldnt oh peter how stupid be said how frightfully victorian be so willow wealth be just a much part of man woman a brain beauty dont say that girl love man for brain money beauty make part of wealth isnt accident attribute poor man im not talking about only speaking in abstract may be same in character charm a rich man what gulf money make between let one man be poor absolute double in way be rich cease to be double at once if happened to love costermonger began peter can leave out because of have slightest idea what love mean how about bond spoke of then asked hasnt that got anything to do with considered then laid hand on arm if must choose now minute said in what relationship must stand to other must choose a brother havent got one must like to have one tremendously yet if might have just way liked think must have for sister dont so much want to take care of a want to take care of want oh come now said peter true though have turned about in window seat so a to secure for surprising conversation greater privacy from party at bridge table be leaning out of window hundred foot below piccadilly roared rattled here clatter of be shorn of sharp edge be a if stir of bee be swarming in hive down there seen like from above passenger vehicle alike be crawling dot blot everything from swiftest motor down to laziest loiterer seemed to be drowsily soundlessly sauntering often have peter nellie leaned out here looking on traffic at base of cliff capturing for certain sense of isolation even leaning out must see nothing of precipitous cliff side of house for couple of foot below window stone cornice jutted out ten twelve inch beyond edge of that nearest visible object below be top of motor bus hat of foot passenger along pavement so still be air now when peter flicked ash off cigarette floated down still cohering till dwindled into invisibility followed fall with detached intentness surface mind give to ticking of clock oscillation of flower head when whole psychic attention be focused elsewhere seemed that nellie a far a surface mind went be trotting in harness with for though have not hinted at what occupied eye scarcely knowing be equally intent ive lost sight of peter said breaking silence of whole minute of what asked of cigarette end be watching too dont pretend that werent well if be what then asked nothing particular only felt be watching just bond shifted again hitherto a leaned out left shoulder touched hers now broke contact think thats about extent of bond said marrying philip show precisely what sort of value put on made clearer than know for youve defined feeling for a being desire to have brother rather sister to take care of dont think thats worth much defined further by saying that couldnt tell whether must marry not if be rich because if be must be quite different person if quality of bond must be affected by that must be of remarkably poor quality youre quite right to break when began talking about bond thought might be going to say something interesting something didnt know something that when stated must recognize to be true if thats swan have got to sing might a well have be goose nellies eyebrow elevated up under loose yellow of hair peter dear be quarrelling with asked yes im not quarrelling whole thing be such bore wheres tail where be wet wood leaned chin on hand that lay along window sill wish be in love with said im extremely glad that im not said otherwise suppose must want to be philip a madrigal say other favoured swain for to talk about bond between be absolute limit want everything own way expect everybody else to immolate thankfully ecstatically on beastly altar so do murmured nellie do how do make out demanded peter because object to marrying philip when havent smallest desire to have if knew must say yes supposing asked to jilt philip marry wouldnt ask to want to marry nobody not to marry thats not good enough know peter mouth lengthened into smile broadened into laugh putrid business said why shouldnt take neat header from window have done with im twenty two already think whole affair be rot if doesnt amuse now when be going to amuse be even more amusing during war when one came back for fortnight leave before going out to hell again one did grab at pleasure then because in probability one must be blown to bit very soon afterwards now that one be not going to be blown to bit very soon afterwards whole seasoning have gone out of not quite want to be admired what be love good lord what be love a havent slightest idea best thing can do be to grab at pleasure worst suggested nellie rather sententiously now get off high horse said peter rather dont attempt to get on cant more than let be comfortable marry silly philip ill ill will take to drink wouldnt do for people must say be trying to drown despair at marriage havent got feeling of sort must hate anybody to think have loathe being pitied anyhow to be pitied for something dont suffer from must be intolerable though will remain just same to after youre married will certainly remain same relation will be altered nellie let eye flit over never quite alighting skimmed over crisp hair over handsome smooth soulless profile over shoulder over knee be nursing over hiatus where white skin showed between rucked up trouser drooping sock at moment with knowledge of definite step that have taken in life by engaging to philip beaumont felt far older more experienced than anyhow must look ahead see placid prosperous life in front of whereas peter year older than be still a experimental a boy same if wanted anything have remarkable assiduity in pursuit of until caught nothing beyond desire of moment be to worth bothering about own prudence own commitment of knew to be development of to day yesterday now seemed suddenly to have aged consolidated have answer for voice cry in wilderness what be love be there sort of signpost by wayside enveloped in mist passed over point if really seems to so putrid said cant imagine why dont a say take header into street youve intention of doing anything of sort must firmly resist attempt of mine to tip out like life quite passably a be know also do expect something more from in fact never saw anyone so thoroughly unlikely to give up living to run risk must reasonably be avoided say putrid business really find pleasant one peter sighed oh yes will have to do said dont tip out nellie dont on other hand think that cling so desperately to life not desperately instinctively must be silly of anybody to throw up hand may contain glorious ace without looking very carefully through everyone go on playing clutching at new deal until be sure that there isnt ace in pack for indeed when youve found ace that dont value rest of hand so much dont follow explain said peter well kind of thing for instance if found ace be to say if fell tremendously in love might not care about rest of hand if adorable be in bedroom two window off if be locked in there if house be on fire more ifs asked peter not one supposing thing must instantly get out on to cornice at peril of life shuffle way along must have to be with wouldnt give two thought a to what might happen to peter thought over must be consummate as then remarked fellow with grain of sense must go down passage bash door in let pretend that for reason couldnt if only way of reaching room be along cornice must go peter looked at ledge if got there in safety what then asked couldnt carry back along ledge that wouldnt prevent going said whatever risk to yourself be however useless going be must go peter be silent moment frowning feel a if have happened before said do know that feeling did ever sit here before talk about just not that remember im sure never have isnt odd that sensation doe seem to like remembrance of previous occasion presentiment of future one slightly faulty action of two lobe of brain said peter what be talking about ace yes thats what mean about throwing rest of hand away for sake of ace peter looked at watch must go said ive got to get home to dress rush back to ritz to dine early before opera oh not just yet said wish wouldnt live in south kensington why do peter have direct glance direct answer for because cheaper living with father mother than being on own said also well asked be going to say because like having with said dont think thats true so didnt say mean if have plenty of money must take flat of own quite regardless of whether liked to have with nellie gave little sigh with click of impatience at end of there odd kind of honesty about said state that sort of thing quite baldly whereas must conceal if have be must have said that lived at home because mother liked having with have be true must have said very likely by saying often must have got to believe nobody else must have remarked peter youre rather brute dear said go away to south kensington im going about ace for one second more have found ace nellie dont bother to answer be spoken like rather spiteful woman be nellies perfectly justifiable rejoinder maybe im spiteful sister said peter walked gracefully gently over to card table good bye mr heaton said nellie have have lovely talk hope youve won rubber three ace thirty said mr heaton good bye dear peter suppose youll be at opera to night parsifal deal so be chapter ii peter descended from height into hot dusty well of street soon be on way home to dress return to ritz where early dinner preceded opera other diversion might present on sweltering june evening top of bus be cooler progression than taxi besides advancing sacred cause of economy have just confessed be more real to than of filial piety at hyde park corner must catch conveyance must deposit not fifty yard from father house coolness economy be sufficiently strong of to make board with alacrity detachment of front seat just suited meditative mood talk with nellie have induced peter knew pretty well with admirable contribution have made to discussion there be little to puzzle out much to appraise estimate notion that news of engagement have be blow of sharp stunning quality must be at once dismissed for never have known so well a when earlier in day have communicated news of engagement to over telephone be like how whole heartedly be not in love with how unintelligibly alien to a have pointed out be that emotion during last year have witnessed very decent flowering of intimacy between there have never be on side least attempt at love making relation have be wholly free from sentiment not once have of tripped stuttered over foreign use of love language in way wholly unsentimental have certainly arrived at extremely close relation of intimacy there have emphatically be bond between to mind engagement if did not actually loosen must shift so to speak on to new place harness must be worn elsewhere if be to be maintained at rate must accustom to new adjustment have defined that comradeship afternoon in way be rather surprising for ideal relation of to apparently be that of brother with greater precision that of sister have not struck before even when first presented did not in least puzzle indeed satisfactorily accounted for elimination of sex have always marked intimacy have not sought male element in in female so far be in complete agreement with casual conclusion have jointly arrived at at point peter detected presence of something seemed to show lurking fallacy somewhere for have doubt that if have be rich must before now have proposed to in spite of provision that since rich be attribute of man not external accident turned into different person that thus must not tell whether must have accepted not did not for believe that must have hesitated in doing so finally a material to meditate upon came firm statement that though peter did not want intend to marry objected to anybody else doing so with extreme frankness with habitually judged criticism on instantly admitted that there be great deal to be said for nellies assertion when be stated brutally like that recognized justice of outline might have made caricature of sketch contained salient feature identity of a contemplated scribble of inspired pencil must not disclaim without doubt have caught likeness more tersely have got even a acknowledged that felt resentment that have so unerringly comprehended shown to enjoyed rather than otherwise own dissection of without bias malice felt le sure that when be dissector welcomed so deft exposure retrospect have be sufficiently absorbing to make unaware that somewhere in knightsbridge top of bus have become strenuous goal for traveller seat be occupied beside young man have planted in vacant place be talking to girl who have plumped into seat two tier behind peter instantly jumped up let change place with young lady said then youll be together talk more conveniently change be made with tribute of simpering gratitude on part of young lady peter with laurel of popularity round straw hat took single place knew perfectly well that have disturbed from motive of kindliness did not in least want to please man girl motive have be only to appear pleasant to obtain cheaply fraudulently certificate of being kind gentleman for did not care two straw if pair of sundered lover bawled at other from sundered seat then a took new place struck that quality have prompted transference of from one seat on top of bus to be precisely same a have led to resent nellies dissection of in one case vanity be gratified in other vanity be hurt thats said to mentally prinked like girl in glass have so unerringly shown to yet did not show aspect of be in way surprising for pleasure distaste for knew well how prolific spring of native vanity be in must always take infinity of trouble in order to appear admirable on other hand to conceal what be not so admirable must always inconvenience in order to appear kind exert to appear amusing bore while preserving brightness of attentive interested eye in order to confirm reputation for being sympathetic though vanity be root of such effort there be at rate trace of in acknowledgment of never deluded into thinking that suffered fool gladly because liked desired to secure for pleasant half hour in must tediously inflict on suffered with show of gladness in order to be thought kind agreeable in abstract in concrete to pick up gleanings of welcome entertainment for such a lie so thick on field of human intercourse when great machine have gone by have reason to complain of gleanings there be one among youth of london who be more consistently in request who more merited mild harvesting in rather fatigued casual generation tired with strain of last five year now suddenly brought to book after irresponsibility of wartime when for young men leave snatched from scythe of french front might easily be last there be certain license given peter have always be shining exception to such slack social conduct of life did not a have told nellie expect much from a long a be on tap be undeniably foolish not to present presentably quality be certainly enhanced by little foam little effervescence that nice mr peter always so polite pleasant be reward at moment nellies divination of true attitude towards engagement be punishment bus hummed droned along brompton road there be still solid stretch before halted just opposite side street be goal there be time to consider further criticism that went off waving tail into wet wood saying nothing to anybody what have meant exactly by that have at rate own consciousness that have hit on something extremely real vitally characteristic of surely meant aloofness from intimate surrender of self sufficiency that gave sought strong affection have acknowledged vanity a of be ribanded cat now added to that desire for material comfort quiet determined selfishness reservation to of solitary expedition in wet wood with waving tail probably meant more than though peter quite acknowledged justice of definition again felt certain resentment against clear sightedness have touch of defect quality herself be that made bond between peter let into father house in grilling dusty street nearly opposite oratory with anticipation of finding speedy opportunity for domestic exhibition of vanity for felt sure that something ludicrous tiresome uncomfortable must await something must certainly tolerate with bland serenity agreeableness house front of have be baking in sun afternoon be intolerably hot stuffy door at head of kitchen stair have a generally happened be left open nature of dinner must presently ascend must be confidently predicted beyond at back of hall door into father studio be also open languid odorous tide of oil paint virginian tobacco made peculiarly deadly combination with kitchen smell indicated that mr mainwaring have be occupied with audacious labour just now be engaged on perpetration of series of cartoon suitable not for mural decoration practical difficulty if ever attained completion must be discovery of wall must be large enough to hold indeed great wall of china seemed only destination though remote be sufficiently spacious subject of be european war from psychic le than from sanguinary point of view for series of sketch be complete started with prodigious cartoon depicted satan whispering odious counsel into ear of emperor william ii who wore smile of bland imperial ambition at very attractive prospect presented by father of lie in background army corp of host of hell stretched from side to side of picture like leering malevolent flower

sketch first however a peter knew be rapidly approaching completion on monstrous scale took up whole end of studio peter mother have a yet be permitted glimpse of full blast of withering force so mr mainwaring have planned be on completion to smite stun have heard peter entrance into house for outburst of jubilant yodelling came to young man ear a put down hat tirra lirra tirra lirra sang out boisterous voice be that peter have de ah de ho peter eyebrow went up mouth slackened to long sigh slim shoulder shrugged voice of at present must convey mood to father be brisk cordial hallo father said do want yes dear come in moment have something to show peter closed door of kitchen stair went into studio father be standing high on stepladder in front of canvas dashing last opulent brushful of sombre colour on to thundercloud portending war formed so effective background of prussian blue to emperor head painted with swoop dash such thing a finish be out of place in design for wall of china even a peter entered skipped down from step of ladder laid aside palette brush finito e ben finito cried congratulate peter made last stroke a entered added horror be not so in cloud have have not seen yet sit down drink in for five minute doe make hot miserable to look at yes youll see more of cloud of what hold for distracted europe before come to end of cartoon bomb torpedo be in cloud peter devastation destruction damnation struck splendid attitude in front of tremendous canvas with sweep of hand caused thick crop of long grey hair to stand out in billow round head physically a regard height fineness of feature peter certainly owed good deal to father for john mainwarings head with wave of hair high colour rich exuberance be like fine manuscript now enriched with gilt florid illumination of peter be so to speak neat delicate text unadorned by flamboyant addition peter vanity doubtless came from same paternal strain for never be there anyone more superbly conscious of own supreme merit than father highly ornamental knew that mission be not only to adorn palace of art with work to enlighten dimness of world with blazing presence like most men who be possessed of extraordinary belief in of high colour exuberant spirit be liable to access of profound gloom when with magnificent gesture must strike forehead wail over own wasted life futility of human endeavour attack be very artistic studied performance chiefly assailed when royal academy have intimated that stupendous canvas of awaited removal before varnishing day then with bewildering rapidity spirit must mount to unheard of altitude again brush in hand must exclaim that asked more of world than to allow to pursue art unrecognized unhonoured like millet corot temperament in fact be that of boisterous spring day opening with bright sunshine turn to snow in middle of afternoon draw to close in lambent serenity whether exalted depressed normal be simply though slangily prince of bounder clapped hand on peter shoulder need not point out to merit indeed defect of composition said for peter inherits something of father perception look at then once more tell if picture recall to method even perhaps inspiration of master not like unknown to fame who boy if allow for moment to believe in psychic possession who ask rather to cast sentence differently to whom do owe realization of terror of menace of spiritual horror ever so faintly smoulder in canvas folded arm awaiting reply peter cudgelled brain in order to make answer a agreeable a possible name of blake occurred to remembered that of late father have be apt to decry artist for poverty of design failure to render emotional vastness then with great good luck eye fell on photographic reproduction from ceiling of sistine chapel decorated wall of studio felt have guessed right one michael angelo said thats influence can see father mr mainwaring rested chin on hand be gazing at work with frowning seer like scrutiny be difficult to realize that be who have yodelled so jubilantly just now curious that must have said that peter said in deep dreamy voice for day past a worked have seemed to that ma master of art a well a michael angelo note that ma be standing by at time indeed seemed that not controlled brush say approved no that be pleased with be there boy so if there be merit in work beseech to attribute not to to be a if be in trance closed eye for moment bowed head then a if at last amen of solemn service came out of dim cathedral into sunlight mother said must not forget in great moment be in tirra lirra have de ah de ho own pranced to door ringing bell a passed repeated yodelling cry from upstairs quiet thin voice gave flat echo of salutation from below hot parlourmaid opened door

reserve for so eye shut cheating mr mainwaring small in stature with porcelain neatness about a of dresden shepherdess suffered to be led into studio preserving scrupulous honesty of closed eyelid by side rococo husband looked more than ever like preposterous dancing master if be correct to attribute to peter inherited vanity be equally right to derive from young man mother that finish precision characterized movement manner easily too though with shade more subtlety psychologist might have conjectured where peter habit of walking in wet wood telling nobody be derived from for be not hard to guess that mr mainwarings tranquil self possession smiling serene indulgence of husband whim be result of quality firm deeply rooted self repression have perhaps become habit for conduct seemed quite effortless in tight thin lipped mouth gently smiling there be something inscrutably independent be like secret contained because chose to be like serenity collectedness be mask chose to wear thus probably peter inheritance from be of more durable stuff than vanity owed to father for how if mother have not be somehow adamantine must have lived for nearly quarter of century with flamboyant partner yet have imbibed one bubble of effervescence lost grain of own restraint indeed must have be like piece of quartz for ever dashed along by turbulence of impetuous flood yet effect that buffeting bruising have produced on have be to polish harden went precisely where current dashed remained solid small impenetrable such be relation to bounding extravagance of husband swept along

good to peter be enigma to never now attempted desired to find key seemed to quite impervious to external influence behind high wall of reserve nothing so far a knew roused emotion in nothing excited nothing depressed sometimes when boy have gone to with trouble to confide must say how tiresome for dear perhaps suggest sensible course of action trouble own if have seemed to touch emotion while on other hand if there be something agreeable to communicate if father sold picture peter have announcement of promotion in foreign office sympathy pleasure if felt be just a iced a condolence have be event to peter apprehension that most have power to move be fact that somebody have left open door at top of kitchen stair when be quite shut when household care have sunset after dinner habitual mode of self employment be to read page two of novel returning to library next day then to take sort of railway guide scan advertisement of hotel situated in agreeable place on south coast among derbyshire highland often often have peter returned from dinner to find mother thus employed father when in throe of creation went early to bed in order to be fresh spry for light of morning hour slept badly slept best if went late to bed there must be then when peter latch keyed into house on return from dining out even occasionally when returned far later from dance with bradshaw in hand open among

lucy might perhaps once have be like before year have flattened out obviously be daughter though ella thirlmere have altogether omitted to mention thing then with rather short sighted eye growing accustomed to staring light mr trentham observed that first impression of hostess face be illusion though founded on fact just a when figure of man resolve into hat coat hanging on wall there be nothing in fact abnormal about mr wardours countenance be just blankish have large cheek of uniform surface nose of small elevation eyebrow eye set in very willow socket then shadow came on to face

if name have be fat must have remembered said wasnt mr fat lord fat seemed to know everybody too just sat there knew everybody from peter other side where silvia sat there came little tremor of laugh hardly audible turning saw that face dimpled with amusement be singularly sexless curve of jaw line of mouth be more like boy than girl boyish too be sideways cross legged attitude if be laughing at mother remark amusement be clearly of most genial kindliness mr wardour continued in perfectly even voice that almost intoned word so void be of inflection pity party have missed so much of opera said there be lot of pretty music of reminded of being in church hymn itll seem quite strange going to dance afterwards lot of knight singing hymn parsifal know say best opera wagner ever wrote time silvia certainly laughed again laugh have not smallest hint of satirical enjoyment be just amused peter found though have scarcely yet glanced at somehow understanding recognized in amusement that failed to feel with regard to father cartoon mother reading in bradshaw knew intuitively that silvia have got hold of right way to regard absurdity to see comedy without contempt whether knew not be quite certain that did not have given glimpse hint enlightenment not only of what be of what be not looking at now directly for first time handsome face caught reflection of boyish brightness what do think of parsifal asked raised eyebrow how can tell asked never saw opera before envy said peter why for not having seen one because be at last seeing one asked peter a usual found wanting to make good impression if have be in lift with crossing sweeper must certainly have tried to make crossing sweeper like have exerted wit to hit upon something crossing sweeper must think to be admirable even though on arriving at next floor must never see again quickly decided now that girl must not admire mere drivel happened to want to know what envied for for said for getting new impression includes mustnt have seen opera before must be seeing one now looked at with perfectly unshadowed frankness believe meant first said believe when said envied that meant be lucky in not having spent quantity of boring evening in case dont mean now said peter ah then did why do mean no longer peter found criticizing conversation between act of opera be not meant to degenerate into catechism talked in order to mask ticking of minute a be in for catechism be better to be agreeable candidate why asked because expect that never spend boring evening probably be not person who be bored clearly a suspected be not going to commit to statement without consideration even when so violently trivial subject be under discussion eyebrow much darker than shade of hair like nellies pulled little downwards inwards so that nearly met oh must easily be bored said lot of bored people must infect make bored leaned little forward towards again with boyish appeal please dont be bored said be interested amused make into sort of disinfectant to protect be there epidemic asked yes place be reeking with mother for instance detests music isnt darling of how very odd of then began stopped because in emphatic intangible way girl retreated from platform of intimacy on to have stepped moved chair inch two away from hitching back with foot be only symbol of change of attitude what to peter made significance of small steering be certain quenching of light in face a if over have put up mask of herself might easily have be mistaken for if beholder have not for glimpse two seen unmasked shifted from personal ground on for minute have met became miss silvia wardour generalizing in small talk in usual imbecile social manner also became much more feminine wonder how many people in house who have come to hear wagner really dislike said probably of like specie of noise dislike specie of noise if like beethoven noise probably dislike wagner noise only nobody will say so come to look at other have carried back conversation on to personal platform again a if be sorry to have slipped off so suddenly carried on to part of platform quite clearly did not intend to discus mother presence at opera tell said what sort of noise do really like somebody el peter wondered for moment whether be to prove to be earnest sort of girl who said insisted on discussing random statement until contradicted usually happened quite soon then vouchsafing gleam of daylight found explanation for in order that might be encouraged to entangle further earnest girl inquisitorial girl did not like type gave pencil piece of paper after dinner made write acrostic took letter out of box gave eight of from have to make word divided guest up into equal number told that be clump that two people be going to leave room guess have be thought of be lighter intellectual motion feverishly played clump in order to avoid intolerable abstract discussion yet silvia have not sleuth hound expression usually accompanied hunter after intellect what searching question said really im omnivorous about noise like noise im listening to like particularly there be not in face smallest consciousness that might conceivably be alluding to fact that be talking to let eye sweep across crowded theatre noise asked people talking love too oh wouldnt be interesting to be somebody else for minute know what meant what felt like when said anything clearly have used masculine gender quite unconsciously peter answer on other hand be deliberate yes must love to know what feel like even over most trivial speech said silvia dropped on to with precision that only showed how complete own unconsciousness have be asked certainly said know well enough kind of thing men feel like leaned forward again oh tell about said certainly be together on personal platform again peter be quite at home there passion for making good impression on new acquaintance rather uncanny skill in extracting intimacy from gave confident gait on board felt that queer attractive girl did not in least wish to be talked to in ordinary nonsensical manner in gabble of ballroom in more intimate duologue on stair outside girl generality of liked to be told that men thought exclusively about spent waking sleeping moment in contemplation of divinity pricelessness nellie of course be exception for between there certainly be peculiar bond of understanding majority of girl so ran indolent incurious creed just wanted to be told that be too priceless for anything wanted to be kissed be nonsense knew that a well a did such be inherited instinct if wished to be precise inherited instinct acting on new condition knew that silvia be not like that there be eager friendly quality about be not quite normal girl of ballroom again be earnest girl who wanted to explore brain prove that hadnt got seemed merely interested in topic not because must lead to demonstration of cleverness men said what do men feel be a vain a peacock think entirely about think of a inferior sex designed to amuse ah darling said silvia quite unexpectedly great pervading brilliance of light went out row of veiled illumination only remained in front of red confectionery of curtain against conductor head be silhouetted silvia after surprising exclamation drew chair more into corner in order to enable peter to pull up to front of box klingsors castle said mr wardour with final desperate glance at programme who be klingsor silvia peter wondered whether must whisper who be silvia decided against magician darling said silvia with same underlying bubble of amusement chapter iv there be mad brutality of discordant noise risen curtain disclosed astrologer roared yelled soon dishevelled female in advanced stage of corruption shrieked back at silvia found disliking wagner noise attention came closer home came in fact to quarter view of peter face a sat low in chair in order to give clear view of klingsor be not sure that liked peter better than hurly burly be going on though knew have be liking during interval between act now seriously set to task of disliking easiest method of achieving that result be to class a just one of crowd have come that night to occupy by request mother two box perfectly understood situation lady thirlmere woman with pearl blue black hair have told lot of friend that must go to see parsifal for nothing reap quantity of subsequent benefit at price of knowing mr wardour of frequenting house of permitting to eddy round in general whirlpool for reason inscrutable to silvia mother wanted that mother in fact be like pill lady thirlmere have guaranteed that world must swallow pill be nobly gilded there be amount of jam to assist swallowing of without doubt peter be one of open mouth klingsor kundry continued to rave at other so far from listening silvia used that external noise to drive own thought into seclusion much a dull sermon tedious lecture make for introspection in audience hardly have classed peter among open mouth than wondered if have be quite fair in doing so for talk have have be not of same timbre a conventional quackings for last week have made mother house like farmyard with like mr bond of nursery rhyme calling dilly dilly will be stuffed stuffed be silvia must no more enter with sympathy into mother aim than must enter with sympathy into stamp collecting out of love for stamp collector dear weary steadfast stamp collector be eager to feel highest possible interest in collection collect for with might knew that despised spirit of stamp in return for food drink opera box be so willing to be collected next week there be to be dance for in immense mansion have be re christened wardour house page of stamp book must on occasion be filled with adhesive specimen everybody so understood ella thirlmere to say must come doubt must be tremendous fun there be certainly stamp here now lord charles be one though why have be willing to be collected sat with head propped between two long hand queer sort of nose just protruding indicated by downward angle that be profoundly meditating next be mother whose pearl clinked rhythmically to breathing nearest to herself must see half averted profile of young man whom be encouraging to dislike appeared to be looking at stage certainly be paying attention to got back to what actually thought of instead of forcing into defensive attitude against somehow seemed not that mattered to have be talking to other from odd standpoint when ridiculously interested for moment have asked what men felt have not given masculine answer have spoken to a if have be girl have said that men be a vain a peacock thought of woman a inferior sex designed for amusement very likely that be quite true now in isolation of darkness loud noise cut off from everyone else in box seemed to to have required woman to state that be woman view of man man though shared must scarcely have said instead must have told that woman be angelic sex meant to be adored violent concussion have occurred on stage there be longer gloomy black man with photographic lens insane sort of flower bed remembering programme recollected that be enchanted garden enchantment seemed to lie in quantity of prodigious calico cardboard flower presently burst if have not burst must have burst for mature female singing loudly be hatched out of centre of change have awakened charlie opened mouth very wide dear what unspeakable wench said loudly to mr trentham silvia look at flower maiden said mother came out of flower be not that wonderful look at one from blue convolvulus isnt sweet silvia choked laugh with audible effort swallowing whole yes darling said arent pretty peter turned to quickly oh thats just how talk to father said instantly looked back at stage again reconsidered verdict of a merely belonging to open mouth lady thirlmere showered on mother at rate did not behave in unwarranted way neighbour be ill bred odious familiar having thrown impertinence like over shoulder did not even wait for rejoinder what must have be did not quite know be impertinent of after be perhaps rather pleasant indication of intimacy for intimacy in ordinary sense there have not be time opportunity have perhaps just spoken quite naturally assuming corresponding naturalness on part if so have failed silvia be annoyed with for suggestion how must have failed young man whom have seen for first time hour ago who be only one specimen out of flock of rook have alighted there in new field where worm be to be have for mere picking of up there be long interval at end of second act reseating of occupant of two box lord poole whom mr wardours godmother have chosen a genial acquaintance came in with great towering frame immense red face unlimited capacity for enjoying lucky dog parsifal remarked to silvia to have have girl to choose from must have taken one came out of great white lily word did surprise when came out of lily wish knew where

youve be getting on when great licensed victualler of london appeared on scene made such suggestion be usual to go do a told now peter glanced at girl a if to ask whether wished to make way not gave sign however hint that be to stop where be so best thing a cool quick brain told be to answer lord poole genially according to folly condone then said lord yes condone anything said condone everything nowadays save lot of trouble in court frankness of odious sentiment made quite impossible not to treat a farce one in sens took lord poole seriously be so jolly so preposterous so successfully sought safety in number instantly spread over peter chair firmly put one arm round silvia waist other round mother nice young fellow that observed a peter went out of box what pair miss silvia make hey he black shes fair he clever fellow wont have penny wish be age do know father he rum un remarkable statement be addressed in loud hoarse whisper to mr wardour be of course perfectly audible to silvia

performing similar office with regard to young man who came into box pansy face be growing sillier than ever a kept telling to go talk to somebody else object of two middle aged magnet be precisely similar one wanted to attract to men other woman there be infinite divergence in method may trentham pretending to be young kept asserting how old be lord poole pretending to be old must not conceal fact of how young be again be not thinking one atom about be entirely absorbed in collection of siren be thinking exclusively about be only anxious that one in house must turn green with envy at galaxy of adorer then ella thirlmere friend two joined group returned blatantly fatuously delightfully to opera well now do feel like parsifal said here be in middle of such flower maiden of whom must

toeing back again without response to nellies signal knew quite well that there be unoccupied seat next that must have be most natural thing in world for to have appropriated chose to consider that be more suitable yet that philip must find way back to have given right to be there peter with tinge of insincerity told that be behaving with extreme correctness in not occupying insincerity lying in fact that root reason for going back to other box being that be determined that nellie must not have everything quite own way then again reason for behaving so properly have said afternoon that meant to fit to conventional mould here be helping to secure perfect fit doubt be right be right also in divining that nature of bond between must now necessarily be changed have never be passionate one individual independence no le than material obstacle in way of declared complete surrender to other have always stood between there seemed now that bond be slackened to have be potential passion woven into perhaps slight collision with philip in doorway knowledge that be groping way back to chair by nellie again accentuated that perception for moment peter paused have yet just time to slide past

steady unwavering devotion have kept mr wardour at such high pressure week did not enjoy process of eternal entertainment gaiety of others did not make gay music made appeal to be long past age of dancing though so many of contemporary be not yet must sit benignly content through short hour of summer night with great tiara on head feeling heat acutely for mere pleasure of being there that be

with gem seemed to have be laid in hand have a yet idea what be inside have not attempted to raise lid be enough at present to be allowed to hold in shy adoring finger nothing said nellie not even to sit down came in fact to make stand up im doing said silvia thats not enough dear what delicious frock horrible philip have be obliged to go out of town im at loose end till dinner thought must be wonderfully pleasant to sit on grass somewhere isnt that original at moment when rural idea occurred to passed gilded portal thought must be even more wonderful if came sat there too dont mean ordinary dirty grass clean grass richmond park something top of bus of course old hat there must have be more attractive notion to silvia felt that be just that have long be wanting namely to be with on grass in old hat must still ecstatically be dazzled must follow beam of lighthouse with steady rapture fresh aspect of away from ball room crowd just that old hat aspect felt at once to be what most desired might be true be just a dazzling thus might indeed be more dazzling when other lesser brightness be withdrawn from vicinity however turned out must not fail to show new enchantment of course ill come said let go get old hat dont want do dear if youll ring bell ill order car for far more comfortable far quicker than top of bus nellie have be taking in appurtenance of room to have

sultrily prospect of long hour with philip who be coming to lunch mother a usual have bridge party of harpy doubt philip just a peter have done not many week ago must sit in window pas for being absorbed in other be owing doubt to hymeneal morning prospect of similar afternoon on outpouring through telephone of philip calm sincere regret business claimed in country reaction have opened sluice gate overwhelmed with desire for hour physically morally remote from rich fabric opulent comfort from ambient atmosphere of thing connected with just one theme be perfectly well satisfied with general prospect matrimonially considered wanted just now a celibacy be so soon to vanish foreground of simplicity freedom to picture originally when telephone have first told of philip defection have scarcely made needful pause of ringing off before getting into communication with peter to know whether must slip official collar for afternoon certainly be ringing off philip with completeness with whom better than with other must take last excursion into country must so soon be severed from by sea placid hoped of matrimony official collar must not so peter very distinct voice told be shifted peter voice at rate said be sorry added superlative of regret before have removed ear heard click of replaced instrument at other end rang off so seemed to with certain finality not lingering to gossip have be rather characteristic of lately though have constantly met have always appeared in light impenetrable armour of aloofness never raising visor showing joint in harness where must get at ever since interview on window seat six week ago have be withdrawn like failing to get peter next inclination have be to sip celibacy alone for though peter better than anybody symbolized thing be passing away wet wood roving independence must in absence get nearest to alone so have already started on suburban pilgrimage strolling down glare wilderness of piccadilly to get on to richmond bus at corner of hyde park when finding dazzled by sun on newly gilded gate of wardour house notion of silvia companionship suggested paused weighing advantage silvia must certainly give eager appreciative comradeship so much be instantly clear on heel of tangle of other interesting little curiosity with tentacle protruding plumped into same scale did not trouble to unravel now must straighten out a afternoon went on richmond park proved very empty of loiterer occasionally motor bicycle with wake of dust hanging in air behind streaked down yellow road by pen pond more than distant throb of such passenger be audible summer be in full leaf among oak beech retaining still varnished freshness of spring populous in shade of leafy tree be herd of fallow deer lay sleepy yet alert with twitching ear

inscribed that afternoon acceptance of be equally of course with luck attended friend date of be clear two day before marriage trivial though have be felt that hamadryad have be doing spade work in shade ground be cleared levelled topic that might now wish to work up into more elaborate tapestry have be put in on tentative thread much a character in decently written drama flit at rate across stage in first act two delightfully grouped hatless secure from interruption have come to anchor in circular shade of old thorn bush not far from edge of reed fringed pond red petal of spent blossom dropped down from time to time hum murmur of june wood be carpet on more intimate conversation must lightly spread nellie drew up clasped knee fancy impertinence in dragging out to richmond park when know that have hundred thing that wanted to do said tell must have done if hadnt appeared like bird of prey clawed now dont say that must have have tea with mother gone for drive in park if do simply shant believe yes be more dazzling so silvia found when there be one to contrast with sheer silly conventional tittle tattle took sparkling quality quite alien to when came from mouth personality be like coloured light playing on fountain turning drop to gem must be silent then said oh dont be silent when people be silent mean be only being polite if be le polite must say that be excruciatingly bored then after suitable silence say how charming be here dont say how charming be here will be last straw silvia dear said silvia by accident what call slipped out oh do say on purpose then said silvia very well too understand what funny business be christian name christian name be never really ripe till drop wonder if know what unutterable boon mother have be to smoky place over there to crown be giving most delightful party with most gorgeous punctuality a far a be concerned do say settled for night because knew couldnt come on subsequent night silvia gave little moan like dove in tree cant say that said nellie sighed wholly appreciatively thats so refreshing of said youre one of real people expect people who mean what say usually mean what dont say silvia turned round lay facing friend dont say then nellie said mean do say thing mean how complicated sound how simple be will stop talking about do think ive got subject know said nellie what about peter adore peter by way dont say anything horrid certain sense of shock came to silvia peter have not ever so remotely be subject to alluded when nellie suggested be flashed on screen with disconcerting vividness didnt mean at said wasnt thinking about about mr mainwaring wouldnt like said nellie silvia sat up have perfectly clear conscience to endorse immediate repudiation what caused suspicious that questionable little leap of blood to cheek be indeed not that have be thinking of peter that nellie supposed have oh be quite silly exclaimed indeed wasnt in mind at why must be scarcely know nellie knew that have ceased for moment to dazzle silvia to whom suggestion that peter have be in mind be clearly unwelcome unexpected might be true might not so ran nellies swift argument that silvia be not thinking of peter at that must be ruffled ever so delightfully at notion that have be constituted symptom did not be enough to note pas on at once to easy task of dazzling silvia again be too delicious said yes im going to stick to subject for minute longer be since yours isnt peter youve got most lovely lack of self consciousness do know of course dont wouldnt have when talk to other girl think about like talking to boy not peter mind to talk to silvia made gesture of deprecation will go on said nellie look at glass hold up to please isnt only lovely party that mother have given have polished up rusty old season quality what will call wind sun sexlessness just move along like spring day with banner streaming in most entrancing glee youre absolutely insouciante if understand french silvia have lost sight of peter by now be round corner how near corner be be immaterial wanted to put round corner too seized on a possible diversion oh yes do said only came back spring from three year in france there be again there of completeness youre spread evenly richly like butter when be eating margarine over whole slice of life wish must bite believe that with little trouble must if so must hate not for what youve got for what havent at moment nellie became aware that day in wet wood have changed character with prospectively have endowed have meant first with peter a companion next by to enjoy last hour of celibacy with silvia on other hand be now not enjoying own envying companion what envied most for be decorated simplicity silvia wore decoration externally didnt attempt to swallow by digestion make build up complicated identity worst of from envious point of view didnt know how splendidly embellished be be a if said to gallant soldier have got vc sarcastically almost then looked down not up at decoration found that little piece of riband be there silvia moved shade away from companion break in thorn tree with consequent oval of hot sunlight quite accounted for what havent got asked live a naturally a drawing breath life thats so new to so puzzling so delightful below beyond youre on point of being married chose out of world found time that have chosen what be there left for just now here to want youre adorable silvia wrestled threw bugbear of shyness so often sat on shoulder strangled neck there writhed on grass not in least dead for moment knocked out oh sometimes wish be boy said im more in key than in ours sometimes think nellie projected into gap of sunlight from possibly silvia shrank have definite scheme of exploration for moment seemed to that something in tangle of motif with have invited silvia to share afternoon be faintly stirring a if with unravelment loop knot might get more inextricably muddled be true conceivably whole thing might come out like conjuring trick ah what be that think asked dont stop so tantalizingly a if thinking wasnt everything one doe be only clumsy translation of what one have thought think aloud nellie looked more than ever at moment like exquisite wild presence of woodland dryad bacchante delicate subtle in face limb brain merely proto plasmic in soul creature made for bedazzlement undoing of man certainly have woven spell over silvia again momentary check in incantation when have attributed peter thought to have passed a swiftly a shadow of one of light cloud drifted over grass at moment when so bewilderingly shone out again there formed in silvia mind a tried to follow injunction to think aloud not image of at of peter for if be divinely akin to blossoming thicket shadow be beginning to lengthen over grass making cool island on deer be grazing now too must be no le harmoniously bestowed by reflecting lake side be not that of suggested rurality one indeed be more emphatically of street ballroom complication of city than by secret pedigree of soul be of house lineage of thing glowed enjoyed be lovely gave a little thought to yesterday a took for to morrow not catalogued in detail fused into single luminous impression passed through silvia consciousness like wink of summer lightning a if wasnt difficult enough to think at said a for thinking aloud thinking articulately if im to sum up ever so clumsily merely that adore with incense ive got thought of happiness doe matter so much to isnt noble fun to find someone who matter very few people really matter suppose little silly finite heart like ours cant take in many who do matter must come right in if dont mind mustnt risk by hanging about on doorstep might catch cold arent talking fault for taking into country for assuredly have gone to head where there stifle of roof choke of street nobody matter everyone be quite delightful what stupid word be how expressive of stupid thing silvia very deliberately shot off into backwater of nonsense so to speak out of main stream for sun be on water in dazzle of nellies personality must not see towards what weir hurrying river might be taking very likely there be weir glistening tide running swift must very likely spread out into broad expanse of peace pool be brightness prevented scrutiny by flash of woodland instinct by uncanny perception nellie divined cause of retirement into backwater of triviality with ruthlessness rivalled mr wardours pursuit of desirable guest caught rope of silvia boat so to speak before must tie to security of overhanging branch shot out into main stream again yes dear said talk nonsense delightfully ah didnt mean stupidly didnt mean in sense have just labelled with meant delightfully charmingly just for change after delightful now mean stupid london be talking sense interested indescribably just now said be more in boy key than girl what did mean exactly silvia watched receding shore to have hoped to tie up after what did matter if there be weir not peace pool down there in dazzle of benignant sunshine there be difficulty in way of expression cant really explain said there be thing so simple that explanation be possible if said be hot day told to explain couldnt must only say if dont feel if dont know what mean cant help same with elemental thing nellie regarded with eye be framed in steely sort of interest eye be eager to know not from kindly tenderness of friend from surgical curiosity think know what mean by boy key said let see if can explain to yourself silvia since wont ah cant explain to if be in love for instance must passionately want to give love to pour out instead of like most girl provoking love permitting ever so eagerly receiving wouldnt want man homage so much a must want to be allowed to love must want how queer delicious of lovely upside down inside out creature abrupt termination of presentment of silvia in love a imagined by friend be due to something quite unexpected there came on silvia face a own privacy be thus invaded dumb none le violent signal of protest shrank withdrew a if burglarious bullseye have be shot through window of room where lay lost in cool soft maidenliness contact be even more direct than that be a if pitiless incision have be made in very flesh with pause in application of knife shuttering of bullseye for further beam must have disclosed deliberate attempt to rifle jewel chest there came complete withdrawal of protesting signal have be bullseye of friend looked in scissors of dear amateur manicurist be sitting there hatless in shade with hand pushed hair back oh youre witch nellie said two hundred year ago must have be burned must have helped to pile faggot expect that youre magically right cant tell know because assure literally soberly never have be in love literally never soberly never somehow what suggested how did divine witch touched something made something vibrate sing didnt know anything about didnt know be there then put finger on knew knew have then just hated for moment said nellie silvia did not quite accept made wince said in correction oh yes ill confess just for moment seemed to hostile hurting arent youre heavenly healing taught bless think youre witch same wasnt telepathy told something about that didnt know couldnt have known cant know now for matter oh lucky creature youve fallen in love know did do in manner attribute to did savagely give not wanting anything to give give how did put just now to be allowed to love to pour out to pay homage instead of exacting boy key dear seems age age since phrase came up ive have whole drama since then know nellie in point of fact have have drama too be a yet undetermined have not got at root fact for be burrowing silvia volley of question anyhow be easy of response be barring certain inversion very victorian question dating from day when men blindly adored woman swooned at declaration of passion have done level best to excite inversion made to for particular reason wildly interesting speculation silvia when loved so much be certain must love in boy key eager evocative key acknowledged in contemplation of event a blindly adoring a being allowed to love whether be entirely prognostication whether be already partially potentially fulfilled be question application of concerned nellie own purpose alone soon deftly now with lesson of silvia revolt against surprise must get further result from dissection at present there be impatient intimate volley of question to answer oh dear understand so well boy key said triumphal victorious surrender with bell ringing isnt that march out with white flag insolently flying must love to be like if be like that isnt key just surrendered rather terrified know couldnt be terrified of philip for long he such dear must not be considered more than approximate account vague sketch very faintly resembling scene portrayed quiet feminine disclosure nellie did not want to discus that wanted to get back to tangled skein again must like to see in love silvia said promise to tell when happens at least neednt will be wonderfully obvious in boy key whom can find for who will just fall in with be complement of making complete round perfect hasnt ever so little bit of just top of head come over horizon yet silvia did not withdraw raise signal of protest time made signal at none at rate must be perceived by girl who sat watching very narrowly once more nellie fumbled so to speak at shutter of bullseye must flash on light looked at watch on wrist dear how late be said must go at once promised to go to mr mainwarings studio peter father know peter will be vexed if dont come then came signal silvia jumped up with wholly unnecessary alacrity more nimbly yet did high colour mount to face chapter vi one evening week so before date fixed for wedding philip beaumont nellie have dined gone together to first night of new play be saliently characteristic of peak so to say prominently uprising from smooth level of cultivated plain that when arrangement for such diversion business be in hand always went without hitch nellie have expressed desire to see play without giving long notice to of wish followed a matter of course that managed to get gangway seat in stall at most advantageous distance from stage thing happened like with own unruffled smoothness seemed immune from of attack of asperity of one kind to human nature be subject seemed to create similar well ordered decorum in activity tonight for instance dinner preceded theatre be punctual swiftly served so that hurry undue lingering followed motor slid up to kerb stone precisely a quitted restaurant might be taken for granted at conclusion of piece must be bubbling up opposite portal of theatre precisely a emerged once in seat there have be few

companion feel interesting must put next most crashing bore must wreathe in smile until crashing bore felt to be wittiest of siren then suddenly stupidity of comment irrelevance failed to divert nellie altogether there be antagonism hugely grown by now peter so made out be a conscious of a have certainly during last week two contributed to growth have answered nellies formality with similar politeness have watered where have sown wondered whether contemplated with dismay of be conscious lively crop of combined husbandry be fashion a have once said to silvia to be devoted to peter silvia

be be left of dab of paint have dropped from brush on to skirt of coat a profound inspiration seized after have dressed for dinner philip gave slightly iced negative to nellies inquiry whether be to join pilgrimage mr mainwaring did usual thing clapped hand on peter shoulder when introduction have be made hoped with stately bow that boy have be behaving waved hand when mr wardour pronounced first act very interesting recognized fellow artist before ten minute be over mr wardour be committed to look in next afternoon see few poor effort then became more confidential whispery marvellous incomparable type said looking at silvia back again at mother who have have felicity difficult felicity of painting glorious head one be astonished must be shocked if be capable of so bourgeois emotion hm beyond visit to private view of royal academy mr wardour have not penetrated into pictorial circle faintly through impression volubly audible of silvia nellie talking together peter heard father leading up to series of war cartoon suitable for mural decoration a regard that went walking in wet wood a aloof from father a from other magnificent self advertiser have heard mr wardours promise to go to studio next day to bring silvia thought that very probably relation of great britain with foreign country might struggle through free hour without co operation meantime nellie seemed to be talking secret to silvia sat nursing knee little aloof from group presently nellie must go back to seat in stall father must do same then must hitch chair little forward again people began to troop back into stall obviously bell have rung announcing imminence of second act nellie recognized that got up a yet have barely spoken to must get back to philip said very properly good night darling silvia peter have gone to open door for come to flat peter said without turning head a passed will go straight home word be just dropped from a if by accident inadvertence moment have spoken knew that have be in main object of visit to box be have primarily wanted merest hint of affirmative nod on peter part be sufficient answer play came to happy concluding treacliness went out philip nellie of course be among first into vestibule where instantly caught footman eye wardour group must have left box slightly before end for peter be seeing into motor thanking mr wardour for awfully nice evening excusing from being given lift a after day in office liked walking home yes way to south kensington how nice must be to see mr wardour at father house next day lingered moment on pavement a nellie passed on way to motor just nodded again without seeming to see philip first concern a slid off into traffic be that there must be air draught for nellie perhaps if put window quite up half down be that comfortable match for cigarette after slipped hand into after moment delay returned pressure in flash of general comprehensive consciousness nellie be aware how comfortable well ordered whole evening have be realized that day evening morning afternoon alike must to end of life owing to very ample settlement understood to have be made be padded cushioned like be conscious at same moment that appreciation of lacked acuteness must just a soon to take example be walking with peter along pavement where nobody cared if felt draught not a be having own way in unjostled progress flash of perception be instantaneous measured only by moment delay in response to philip hand for instantly began to tick again a put to herself pleasant tick good reliable firm tick charming play be not dear said that delicious humour of well if be going to be comfortable life be only fair that must contribute must put penny into placid bag delicious said be sure will have great success how interesting to be there on first night broke off suddenly clasped philip arm ah nearly ran over man cried philip remained quite calm must obviously be admirable companion in shipwreck thunderstorm railway accident be delightfully new point about nellie found on discovery of that must have be collecting good point for with collector zeal hastened to net add to specimen pressed hand that have laid on arm looked out of window have opened on side of motor dear there be nothing to be alarmed about said man be quite safe have not forgotten usual vocabulary need never be afraid with logan be most careful of driver have extraordinary command of brake nellie collected new genus philip sub specie logan added little bit to completeness logan be quite trustworthy went on need never have moment qualm when be on box be discussing play must like to see again doe not that strike a true criterion a to whether have essentially enjoyed play if there be only mere glitter one doe not want to repeat experience there be gold thought evening be silent moment patting hand nellie divined mind with rather terrible distinctness have be very considerably agitated for moment assumed how wisely how consciously complete oblivion of that best method of reassuring after little testimonial to logan be to be unaware of fluttering incident manly calm be efficient medicine for feminine alarm went on talking about play a if nothing agitating have occurred swiftly a car slid down piccadilly nellies brain be just little in advance of before slowed up at house of flat be mentally on doorstep earlier in evening have contemplated philip admiring ascent with in lift own surprised recollection on emergence that mother must not yet be in now that picture have be whisked off screen altogether there must be ascent with philip sudden remembrance of mother absence subsequent engagement not so conventional have be proposed by assented to with nod so imperceptible that have be repeated philip have so often spent final half hour like a motor stopped almost assumed may come up for few minute asked laid hand on shoulder a if to press back on to seat dont find horrid of dear said if say be little tired do think what lovely evening have have come fetch in morning dont good night dear most ardent of lover must hardly have insisted after little collection of sentence unmistakably clinking with sort of final ring be out of question for philip to repeat request in case have habit rather than craving to back must certainly have liked to sit with nellie mother so supposed for quarter of hour discus play little more quietly sun contentedly basking in nellies presence consider very fortunate fellow if be little tired must have be unthinkably intrusive to beg to take part let take part in sance that have wish for lingered moment yet in order to give impression of being in hurry then forbidding to get out of motor disappeared with final gesture a of short separation into house mother a nellie knew must be case have not yet returned from card party must be likely to do so for full hour yet absence in relation to visitor now expected took for totally different aspect have limitless opportunity facility for tte tte with philip mother absence if have be who have come admiringly up with a managed lift must in way have be special even desirable condition philip be so often alone together before many day be passed must be so exclusively alone together that gain of such hour be frankly quite imponderable for last fortnight have scarcely have private word with peter whatever be that have to say to in visit have bidden to whatever have to say to that have something to say be probable from reiterated acceptance of request be quite certain that thing must not be satisfactorily said even perhaps be said at before audience nellie have definite knowledge in detail of even own contribution to coming interview that knew be that when hour later hour later must click door on departure must somehow have looked minutely with eye to help at antagonism have so odiously flourished intensely hoped that must be rooted up altogether put on to rubbish heap of mistake misapprehension whether hope have much of luminosity of faith about be not so certain too much depended on what have to tell did not fall into error of forecasting upshot before knew what contribution be to make towards preliminary process then with internal vibration partly of suspense partly admitted of eager anticipation heard faint tingle of electric bell servant doubt have gone to bed went to door hullo said peter stood there moment after door be opened without moving eye agleam smile hovering over mouth often often have met in precisely similar fashion a passed door on way home giving one discreet little ring nellie must answer if felt disposed to see sometimes mother must be in oftener if in have gone to bed two must sit over fire on hot night seek window seat spend hour of desultory intimacy a two boy might two girl to night there be little effervescent quality added to meeting spice that combined manuvre however innocent brought with realized too that talk must attempt to readjust old relation fit into changed condition lay ahead for moment brought gaiety goodwill to task best evidence for be assumption of old relation pending readjustment peter how lovely of said come in be in asked putting down coat hat mother shes at harpy party four woman rooking other at bridge theyll be trembling being frightfully polite by time peter bring hat coat in with if mother see there will think philip here will come in to sit with if thought be mine must come in twice if there be sign of anybody will probably go to bed not interrupt night be hot with thundery overcast sky sat together again in window seat hundred foot below street be roaring rolling along thick with discharge from theatre music hall clever one how did get rid of philip asked peter lied darling said nellie succinctly did indeed nellie dont think youre getting on very well with determination to be conventional nellie blew reproach at in shape of ragged smoke ring never heard anything so unjust said oh peter be just here sat when told be going to be quite conventional wasnt dont say dont remember well im being model of conventionality pleasant be asked peter in wonderfully neutral voice did not yet quite know why nellie have summoned here be greatly aloof still dont make slightly acid comment said about conventionality fortnight more than fortnight since saw last oh dont count ball sort of thing friend be invisible at ball can only see acquaintance whats use of just seeing friend youve got to be alone with friend in order to see be still unaware of what course be really meaning to steer be to be safe course anyhow avoiding shoal avoiding iceberg just at present peter be making iceberg went on talking rapidly quite naturally with view to bringing peter out of frozen aloofness scheme for conventionality never went so far a to exclude seeing friend altogether said if in order to see particular friend have to tell lie to one person tell other not to leave coat in hall thats not fault mother fault for not having gone to bed yet philip fault for proposing to drop in peter smile hovered over face again not quite breaking through brute said perfect brute im not sure that arent worst of remarked nellie smile broke through at laughed may be quite sure im not brute said must like to know why think so nellie be sincere enough in desire to re establish genuine friendly relationship with again at present grip on other be clogged rusted if rather unconventional meeting be to be of use what use did not clearly define first essential be to wipe wheel clean know perfectly well said ever since engagement have taken completely away have shut up have bolted window barred door to havent peter weighed accusation might possibly be true contained arguable point be easy to state never bolted window barred door said be who did that didnt arrange that must marry philip thats what shut up if choose to put like told at time that relation must be changed shook head relation that ever existed between need have be changed said speak a if have be in love with other not at never be in love with other that know what then asked ill take simile said window door be open to might easily have fallen in love with for matter with relationship possibility held be just of open door window then came round shut up philip drew curtain took in turned about before answered by mean said that relationship might have ripened into nipped off like frost yes said latish frost got up moved about room patting cushion here setting chair straight there peter did not move did not even turn head be quite aware of pondering restlessness be aware too that so long a held tongue have whip hand evidence for be soon apparent didnt know that engagement must have effect said think be unreasonable that must have effect if have be in love with must have be different in case must have understood a be why must have made change in friendship whats use of asking said peter with sudden touch of irritation cant tell why dont know why of anything under sun put other way about suppose that have be who have got engaged to girl wouldnt have made change in sense of friendship peter have spread little over window seat when got up now when came back to old seat pushed encroaching knee aside thats not same thing said girl cant be very intimate friend of married man in same way that man can be very intimate friend of married woman wont ask why said peter gently because im aware that dont know what say be perfectly true though not in instance of knew quite well that wasnt going to give free rein to fall in love with after have settled to marry someone else besides come to think of man dangling after married woman be just a ridiculous a girl dangling after married man dont see why man shouldnt be allowed to retain self respect a much a woman though a far a spoken word went have arrived at agreement no compromise even on agreement must be based felt that somehow in region of unspoken treaty ground have be cleared though wheel did not yet revolve again rust have be wiped off in peter next speech scouring of wash leather be busy mustnt think that dont regret what be suffering under nellie said regret most awfully ive be saying stick to still that be responsible for be who closed window bolted door must be simply silly of to pretend be broken hearted about for must imply have be be in love with that doesnt prevent being sorry missing acutely do old relationship dont know if use trying to recapture trying probably hasnt much effect on what feel use trying to feel hot if happen to feel cold trying to feel ill when do feel well dear make whole difference said nellie quickly will try to to feel back in relationship with want too peter pulled back encroaching knee just now have pushed away kept hand on very fact that triviality be so instinctive constituted significance of hadnt reckoned with losing went on dont excuse account for probably must have done just same if have reckoned with probably if be to do again now must do same dont let labour point if youll try thats ask ill try too if will be of use put nose in air just a much a did a if nose wasnt sufficiently in air already always turn up at end not to matter dont mention said peter thats old style peter said keep up run with till work on own account motor cycle know be looking at other now with something of alert unconsciousness of two old friend alone together certainly machine required running with at present theyre heavy thing to push when wont get going said how odious be hurrah for word said peter why wonder how often have told other be odious nellie be silent in moment pause peter be conscious that real doubt a have be desire to uproot antagonism have grown up between process have be no more than preliminary to something must follow ground have to be cleared first clearing of ground be not ultimate objective moment perceived that at saw how obvious be how appearance suddenly in mr wardours box that evening gave clue to nature of further development then quick a echo began to reproduce thought in mind let pick up thread again said can give weaving very simply trousseau philip philip trousseau how lucky men be when man be going to be married doesnt have to spend day in buying thing doesnt have to buy anything wedding ring said peter in parenthesis yes cant have occupied with unless have have private marriage behind locked door curtained window be telling other what have be doing in long interval be turn oh usual thing said foreign office dinner breakfast foreign office hows may trentham asked nellie wheeling in smaller circle round objective youve left out wouldnt like left out to night said peter have that immense box for play never asked to nellie folded wing dropped got there all right said saw too sitting with mr wardour who hasnt asked to party for russian ballet blood dear therell be blood over do know think silvia be one of most attractive girl have ever seen a spoke there came from outside tingle of front door bell nellie got up with finger on lip who on earth can that be whispered may be anybody said peter very prudently cant tell till go see perhaps philip may have got hold of others hat by mistake he come here nellie suppressed laugh probably mother said forgets latchkey when think shell be late home shant say youre here shed come in spoil talk oh what tangled began peter nellie took additional precaution of turning out light in room where be sitting leaving door open close outside be entrance door from stair into flat peter sitting in window seat heard with amusement dimpled cheek nellies unhesitating account of herself appeared that have just come in be just going to bed have already put out light in sitting room there followed triumphant announcement of mother winning affectionate good night closing of door down passage sitting there in dark peter drew conclusion that nellie put high premium on pursuit of conversation in a infallibly conjectured have just got down to bone must scarcely for sthetic delight in tortuosity have concealed fact that have dropped in a have done hundred time before for few minute chat on way home wanted to talk about silvia for part be perfectly ready to talk about silvia just before closing of door must certainly be that of mr heatons bedroom nellie have said ill put out light good night dear what lovely last rubber peter feeling way so to speak into nellies mind by analogy of own knew exactly what be doing in moment now there must be click of extinguished light in hall must very softly rustle back in dark into room where be sitting close door of then perhaps turn on light inside again a likely a not shuffle back into window seat so often have sat there talking in dark a waited for five ten second to pas be invaded by sense of passionate rebellion against there be girl whom for last two year have be interested in fond of to practical exclusion of anyone else now at moment engaged to man whom did not ever so remotely love be presently stealing back on eve of marriage to spend more than midnight hour with ought to have be balloon rising into stratum of sunlight high above twi lit earth instead be bumping heavily over uneven ground quite unable to get into air matter what ballast of worldly consideration threw out must not feel lifting nellie when came back must only add to weight expectation be ruthlessly even ruefully fulfilled stole in invisible in darkened oblong of doorway closed without turning up light established in window seat again mother gone to room said did so cleverly peter said have just come in know heard said peter brilliant wasnt now can talk without fear of interruption where have got to oh know think silvia be perfectly fascinating dont here be bumping process added weight eager though nellie have be to re establish old relation between there be livelier eagerness to ascertain anything about new relation between silvia if nellie a have affirmed have shut window bolted door for now made tour of secure premise to see that have done work thoroughly dont know if must say perfectly fascinating said like dont extremely nellie waited to hear qualification liked fact that there be qualification though at present did not know what be a nothing further came spoke again quite in old style oh so rude to say then not go on said peter jerked back head let be polite then said one can always observe small decency of life what nearly said be im not in love with stopped nellie if want to know because seemed to very vividly that wasnt business there be illumination cast on to face from street lamp from below to intense surprise saw that eye wide unfocused grew suddenly dim thats just what too be beginning to realize said whatever do now be none of business ive got separate establishment im bound to say that have quite realized that havent asked single question about what go on in mine doesnt concern more therefore dont care will learn to respect privacy too peter snub so will teach thats nonsense said quickly isnt nonsense treat like stranger because happen to be marrying someone else if have be in love with weve have already said peter then listen to time youve absolutely be turning back on be piqued horrid word because dont want to remain old maid for sake maynt feel interested in without resenting object to marrying philip when must have made perfectly clear what must have made clear asked must have made indispensable to said single further turn of screw again broke off im wronging said that final turn of screw must be made mutually never came to though be there wasnt with screwdriver with yours just didnt happen let make best of what remains good deal remains after have everything be of value between except final turn of screw good heaven peter how wish adored do that do same for darling when be said done if only be masterful masculine if only be thing must be solved a be be like two oyster in flow of tide just gaping at other nellies ultimate objective unless peter have completely misunderstood have sunk out of sight for time tide be flowing said thats so maddening of mean that day week month be passing one doesnt even think still le doe one feel one only exists be oyster quite true dont make pearl pearl believe be only piece of grit clever oyster cover up with iridescent stuff stuff come from oyster inside somehow cant make cant manufacture like that clever oyster doe normal oyster somewhere in south sea suppose im northern oyster only meant to be eaten just to be eaten really want somebody to come along gobble up im nothing small piece of food nellie found hugely interested in gave what wanted to know namely peter own personal estimate a to how stood to silvia have defined negatively when told that be not in love with here be more intimate revelation namely that of willingness to be absorbed there too be difference vital essential between for never contemplated possibility of being absorbed by philip there must certainly be absorption there on side so judged be a little likely to make surrender a for moment thought over what have said instantly finding unable to accept can imagine being very indigestible remarked dont really think perhaps do that will allow to be assimilated cant imagine giving up wet wood will always remain selfish mean said self centred whatever like to call frowned over what suppose really mean be that dont understand said getting up fumbled for switch of light by door let throw light on got up too must go to bed said hour of night stood in front of stretching arm be little cramped with leaning on window sill looked at gravely youre going to ask silvia to marry then said be a soon a think will accept nellie received point blank have fully expected now when came there be nothing in ever so faintly winced then took two step forward put hand on shoulder kissed peter darling what good friend weve be said well carry forward into future there one like thats just what meant by kissing to wish good luck perhaps son will marry daughter wouldnt be nice then can envy be wildly jealous a for asking silvia well what about to morrow perhaps rather late to ask to night tiptoed way out nellie closed door very cautiously behind at moment when kissed have given of very best of exulted in having done assuredly virtue have gone out of restless unquiet in bed thought over what be left for chapter vii john mainwaring have prepared studio for visit of mr wardour silvia next day with utmost dramatic completeness employing for reception scenery setting suggested a being most likely to impress astound with end in view have littered room with possible property bringing down from attic stack of own picture disposed in careless profusion round wall sketch book paint box littered table lay figure peeped from behind easel robe trailed over sofa back when visitor be announced have designed that must be found in oldest velveteen coat morocco slipper at top of step ladder have put into position again in front of great canvas representing satan odiously whispering to german emperor there absorbed in inspired labour be to be giving last crowning positively final terrific touch to a visitor a hoped victim entered since work have actually be finished at least month ago on occasion have be toasted in glass of port wine by wife peter have thought prudent to inform that more last touch be to be applied to again to day visitor have added be dropping in afternoon must doubt be sitting in drawing room when arrived with tea prepared for refreshment when time came must yodel for must come down be presented to mr wardour daughter must scold for keeping lady looking at stupid picture instead of bringing up to tea such be general idea of opening of manuvre from with quite incurable optimism expected very gratifying result peter have already alluded to surprising dawn of mr wardour on town at play night before have paved way for commission to execute portrait of silvia have idea whether not mr wardour inserted of golden tentacle with like octopus appeared to be enveloping into domain of art be worth while hoping that sense of completion must not be satisfied unless have silvia portrait painted that so have ascertained have not be done have so to speak left card soliciting favour of call call certainly be to be made afternoon imagination now bit in teeth wildly galloping foresaw possible commission in portrait of mr wardour perhaps here be rosiest of summit yet in view might profitably dispose of great cartoon mr wardour must so soon be privileged to see receiving finishing touch farther than vision did not definitely project in sunlit shining mist must vaguely see working for be worth for much of what mr wardour be worth at more of stupendous canvas berthing a soon a possible in same remunerative harbourage ring at bell of street door warned to scamper up step ladder absorb in finishing touch at top of thundercloud of war in due time studio door opened burrow announcing visitor have to raise voice to pitch of vendor of street ware recite name again before be so fortunate a to attract attention then mr mainwaring turned slowly round with dazed expression shading eye perceived expected presence then with brush in one hand palette in other gave ecstatic cry of welcome not to be confused with yodelling summons for wife came bounding down step ladder divesting of palette brush held out hand ah dear friend said be charming be ashamed of to be found in such dishevelment well artist be like silly donkey a be have forgotten for moment have forgotten advent of delightful visitor held hand of of for moment with pressure expression then withdrew left hand holding to forehead finishing touch said be at very moment putting last touch of paint on to canvas let forget give moment to forget be here be great point made splendid obeisance a recovered thrust back hair embarked on period find dear mr wardour said in moment of triumph of jubilation even little a can possibly mean to others be one of red letter day moment ago brush touched canvas for last time picture be done for obscure initial in vermilion will humbly inscribe in corner must by chance be of smallest interest to to see little rite performed take brush then squeeze out morsel of paint trace obscure initial inspiration must have be happier mr wardours eye be already travelling over huge canvas with rapture astonishment be thrilling that must have come just in time to see artist testify in vermilion that great thing be of own creation naturally must not be expected to know that if have arrived hour ago have not arrived for hour to come must have be just in time for ceremony turned to silvia well if isnt interesting silvia said a if silvia have denied werent saying to other a came along that perhaps must find mr mainwaring painting what work of art too john mainwaring having recorded a creator became showman spectator in one moved step ladder aside so that must both get give uninterrupted view then losing once more a spectator propped chin on hand gazed at work finished finished said with magnificent detachment now let see what think of mr wardour gazed too more gazed more powerful be exactly word must have used appeared significance of tremendous presentment have great taste for picture if be in pursuit of picture picture have certainly be objective of expedition here be what meant by picture not long before death husband have bought what called picture two destined to adorn wall of gallery be so great feature in castellated residence have built on ridge of ashdown forest ran whole length of house when complete a to embellishment be to be lane of picture from end to end hung on red spanish brocade to mind le than real picture true picture picture worth looking at be brightly sombrely coloured illustration of famous personage of well known place told story best of be told story few such have already be plucked gathered there there be very splendid record of coronation of queen victoria rock of gibraltar with p o steamer to left sunset to right execution of mary queen of scot in lighter mood delicious immensity called knight of bath in small boy large puppy shared sponging tin here then now image of wall of great picture gallery at present insufficiently clad cry out for covering like bather who have lost clothes flashed into mind image be not sufficiently clearly realized to admit of definite association of idea between allegory at be gazing certainly a looked at size particularly size of mr mainwarings masterpiece gallery at howe occurred to if there be to be picture here elsewhere liked to know what such picture be about instantly perceived what one be about now that war be won german emperor for practical purpose annihilated have served turn because destruction of ship by submarine have brought so excessive fortune must perceiving message of picture unreservedly gloat over realism of if isnt german emperor loudly enunciated if isnt satan whispering to about war satan saying that must help to be sure tried to do call that picture there war coming up behind like thunderstorm there subject for picture how beautifully youve done mr mainwaring leaned chin still more heavily against hand ah think so asked wish thought so what be there to want asked mr wardour a clear a day saw nothing so striking at royal academy did silvia even at private view academy academy murmured mr mainwaring a if wondered whether have heard that name before then shook head gently a if abandoning attempt to remember what academy be see lot of gun bayonet underneath thundercloud said mr wardour unerringly theyre coming up artist still gazed smoothing chin with hand repeated yes theyre coming up coming up gave great start seemed to shake like big retriever emerging from water where have brought thrown token to land did not know of great gallery at howe starved for decoration even if have must have bounded out of water just like basta basta cried be boring dear lady be wearying be making most unutterable tedium for where be wife why be not here to tap on shoulder say tea gave preconcerted signal of yodel opening door of studio repeated faint cry from upstairs answered on heel of cry mr mainwaring came downstairs introduction be floridly effected shook finger at husband explained reproof to visitor always tell that when be at painting never know time said john be very wrong of to have kept mr wardour miss wardour down here turned to mr wardour a husband vented in contrition apology to silvia of course im judge said for always think that everything husband doe be so striking be not that wonderful thing emperor satan yes such expressive face now must insist on coming to have cup of tea always have to drive husband away from easel look at in old coat too john im ashamed of go put on something more tidy silvia felt somehow a mr mainwaring gave skilful rendering of general hint that have received a if be listening to automaton wound up to emit through mask like face certain word certain sentence formed accomplishment be immediate effect immediately afterwards followed conjecture that be not mere automaton spoke said so seemed to gather what have be told thereabouts to say probably mr mainwaring be capable of saying doing thing for though have be pulled through funnel of mr mainwarings personality have not lost own individual self what that individual self be must form conjecture be a if voice came from inside window over blind have be completely drawn must arrive at perception of who be who talked behind blind be room lit within so at least there came shadow on blind suggesting feature be more than detail of first impression made by new acquaintance instinctive valuation of hostess something to work upon provisionally mr mainwaring be only repeating lesson seemed to know so excellently well gave at present indication of what be like when lesson be over that existed silvia have doubt there be people like people who have aloof sequestered life of own then without being conscious of transition knew that be thinking of mr mainwaring no longer of peter more yodelling proclaimed that artist have put on tidy coat pranced back led way upstairs with mr wardour saying that be a hungry a hunter hoping that wife have provided with good tea mr mainwaring on other hand seemed little to be detaining silvia pointed out other of work of art so plentifully bestrewed room struck girl somehow a being part of manuvre in way connected with lesson have so faultlessly repeated blind have be ever so slightly pushed aside someone be looking out yes there picture husband painted of son last year said think youve met peter havent miss wardour be considered to be very like hope will be home for tea said thought must get away from foreign office early to day very interesting for to be in foreign office silvia said something amiable about portrait be quite recognizable so pleased think like continued mr mainwaring yes peter be at foreign office day be generally out in evening go out very much sit at home mostly in evening read silvia welcomed new topic though blind have be distinctly twitched aside must not see in be only conscious of being observed seemed encouraging opportunity of getting glimpse what do read most asked novel memoir what like reading about be place have never be to said mr mainwaring wonder when read what life be like in place how must enjoy if be glimpse for girl be very momentary one lit so to speak not by clear illumination rather by vague dim phosphorescence silvia by whimsical association of idea found thinking of phosphorescent match box if felt for in dark might find match there must produce something more illuminating ah too love new place said love waking in new place where have arrived after dark wondering what be going to be like glimpse grew little more definite must like too said mr mainwaring husband work keep in london get away very often will go upstairs to tea a turned mr mainwaring cast one glance at great cartoon for moment infinitesimal in duration neat smooth porcelain face grew hostile malevolent sooner did silvia appear in doorway of little drawing room facing street than mr mainwaring to immense surprise bounded from seat chassed across room to fell on knee before behold in attitude of abject entreaty said mother subject to acquiescence dear miss silvia have asked to attempt to use best endeavour feeble a may be to render eager homage of artist skill have asked subject to consent repeat to paint portrait for even a spoke there came quick light step on stair identity of silvia seldom a have heard knew with certainty surprised peter came in kneel peter dear said father enjoying tremendously putting up hand of supplication maria angel beseech to kneel too be entreating miss silvia be urging sacred claim of art silvia gave laugh of sheer amusement at ludicrous situation amusement be only possible solvent for oh please let nobody kneel said mr mainwaring please get up yes of course if mother wish if mr mainwaring will be very patient tell what to do bounded up again ecstatic at granting of petition to do asked dear young lady have only got to be be be just a be now again supported head on hand a when gazed at cartoon with other shaded eye staring at in embarrassing manner gave gay yodelling cry see see announced superb picture be already flaming in brain madam turned to mr wardour will have masterpiece john mainwaring will have created took hand from forehead made movement a if to cast something away enough said let descend to earth again angel give tea be exhausted by adventure peter so silvia noticed be looking at father with eyebrow ever so little raised a if in contemplation of phenomenon that however familiar be still remarkable lip be faintly smiling when turned to silvia a now did that expression still remained there felt that wordlessly have somehow taken into confidence certainly father amused raised eyebrow half smiling mouth told that be there touch of indulgent contempt in john mainwaring continued to claim attention of little party in boisterous rollicking fashion be like being out in high wind where shouting be only mean of communication assuaged hunger confessed be prodigious with incredible quantity of tea cake ate cherry backwards beginning with stem roared with laughter at own joke apologized for boyishness whispered to mr wardour that be in for scolding afterwards from wife for making such noise there time far more potently vital be peter blowing off steam like father quietly containedly reserving there be something inscrutable about smooth handsome face though now then a eye casually met silvia felt that be looking into clear dark beckoning water if eye must not fathom be fault of transparence only of own purblind penetration mr mainwaring be just now launched on story very recollection of made laugh in anticipation of what be coming silvia must let eye roam at will looked at mother at narrator at mr mainwaring in turn in order for purpose of strict impartiality to look at peter a well mr mainwaring with wifely domestic devotion have managed to attach to face faint semblance of interest in story a if be new to then came peter turn handsome inscrutability suddenly seemed to silvia to be like reflecting surface when looked at showed not presented own image saw not at how stood to how stood to own subjective relation image of regarding be flashed back at looking at in mysterious way saw dark clear water gave back to own soul whisked eye away forgetting impartiality of rotation found met by mr mainwaring there so seemed found comprehension of bewildering impression a regard mr mainwaring blind be still drawn from behind blind silvia heard inwardly unmistakably that quiet precise voice saying girl in love with peter mr mainwaring by divination a mysterious a herself be in possession of silvia shared secret knowledge then before girl eye must shift to mr mainwaring who seemed clear from thumping with fist on tea table be now at climax of narrative there peeped out from wife face same secret malevolence with a left studio have looked at great work of art that hung there while admitted that husband work kept in london point of mr mainwarings story entailed use of falsetto voice peter at conclusion got up on pretext of handing cigarette reseated next silvia be good of said that be fragmentary enough undetached from context silvia found understanding perfectly mother mr mainwaring arranged said couldnt very well say must not that wanted to dont mean that father delighted said peter paused moment he in great form added youve delighted arent weird family there seemed direct reply possible to silvia must not imagine assenting seemed banal a well a untrue to say youre quite ordinary found not wanting not even needing to reply at wanted for matter needed no more than to have peter there be wonderfully happy shifted little in very low chair a turned to get match for cigarette again just found noticing little thing about finger be very long smooth nail very neatly sheathed in skin held grew beautifully best of be short closely clipped hair when bent head forward towards match stopped just above collar neednt answer that said tell instead what thought of play last night be people sentimental girl particularly like when be really moved must have thought that emotion killed sentimentality may be different in scotland peter at conclusion of ridiculous speech suddenly found in dilemma of talking nonsense without co operation backing of person whom be talking nonsense to silvia at rate did not contribute soap bubble of own quick to perceive that turned to mother what sort of hotel be there in scotland mother asked must explain to miss wardour mother love reading advertisement of hotel in bradshaw give sense of travel doesnt mother paused no more than infinitesimally went on again in same breath love sense of travel too got by going to foreign office guatemala have be apr midi silvia triumphantly applauded quickness have seen on mr mainwarings face protest at invasion of privacy peter have done more than merely see have slammed door again with allusion to guatemala somehow perception a quick a intuition seemed to extraordinarily characteristic of there be stumbling hesitation where must have drawn attention to similar mistake by bungling silence mind be like hair on neck abrupt crisp ball be with peter again nearly fell asleep over guatemala said surely guatemala be very remote there be many thing more immediately interesting nellies wedding by way le than week ahead young man know be buying new pocket handkerchief to weep into ive bought extremely large one therell be room for to cry into one half of miss silvia while cry into other promised to send round on hand trolley like sack of coal silvia laughed ah will want of handkerchief said not to cry into only to wave be going to be tremendously happy isnt whats like hardly know peter considered he like he like very tidy room said solid furniture not speck of dust person who sits in asked girl nobody sits in at least never found anyone there philip be room there time warmed folded there letter paper big little envelope big little perhaps nellie have found someone there philip may get under sofa when anybody else come in shes very much in love with asked silvia ought to know take out to richmond park sits on grass with afternoon silvia wrinkled up eye a if be focusing that afternoon nellie dazzle said shes like sun on water expect shell make room that tidy room look lovely will never understand what nellie doe will only understand effect of what have done have spell make see what have seen be conscious now of receiving from peter more direct answer of eye than have ever done before knew be talking about same thing now might of though be talking of nellie superficially same thing have be regarding have be framing remark about from different angle given that a silvia have said be dazzle of sunlight a well one of owing to prismatic process might have be seeing blue seeing yellow peter answer convinced that be seeing nellie from same standpoint thats hit said nellie say doe nothing trivial one be continually discovering that wave finger mutter then afterwards find have be making spell isnt uncanny tell something about that didnt know scarcely knew find that be quite solidly true be witch do think silvia leaned forward towards be impossible not to close up with thats just what said to once said said that be witch told something about that never have known be true have be true time literally have never have smallest notion of till told indeed a silvia acknowledged to herself truth of what nellie have said on occasion be receiving firm endorsement at moment etched bitten in to consciousness from moment of prophetic babbling have be image of herself in love singing so nellie have said in boy key eager to be allowed to give homage rather than receive eager to be allowed to love rather than permitting love with ardency of welcome here be peter repeating on general ground exactly what have found in especial be finding now to be magically true since agree be witch said ought surely to collect evidence against what be said to that something unknown to found to be true when said have evidence also said something to last night didnt know what went through brain at moment with sureness of surgeon incision be just that nellie have said when told that be intending to ask silvia to marry have hedged that with reservation that must do so when thought that have chance of success witch like with swift incontinent prophecy have told that be rather late already a regard to night prophecy have be encouraging at time not convincing now suddenly felt convinced why how conversation have only be about nellie did not know seemed that nellie have penetrated where have not there be father sitting on sofa beside mr wardour there be mother veiled shrouded from a have ever be doing something with teapot doing something with crumb left on plate for made concoction placed in balcony outside for bird have be alone with silvia must have proposed to fortified with nellies encouragement fortified even more by present sense of reliability then there unless knelt on floor to a have found father doing when came in oh what did nellie say to last night asked girl let collect evidence a say have burned outside st margarets instead of letting marry philip inside suggested peter silvia gave parenthetic gasp suggested that ought to be burned too said more evidence please peter found entrancing at moment there be keen boyish kind of frank enthusiasm about attacked challenged instead of merely provoking asked for effort only have to allow to be caught up turn said first suggested that nellie told thing didnt know be who said that may have be be who suggested witch like quality said that make see what have seen know did silvia ever so slightly withdrew did asked of course did now do be fair began therefore turn to bring out first piece of evidence be in richmond park know told something about didnt know peter put hand in judicial manner through short crisp hair above neck be prepared to hear evidence said youre on oath get on miss silvia dont keep court waiting silvia shot chance arrow if promise to tell said will promise to tell evidence peter laughed think be better at cross examination than at confession remarked oh thats answer said know isnt meant to be then be serious will tell evidence against nellie in character of witch peter quite clearly let eye rest on other occupant of room one by one looked at said suppose trial be adjourned owing to inexplicable coyness of witness so there be nellie will marry philip without stain on blessed character in glance round room peter have observed that mr wardour be trying to catch silvia eye must certainly succeed in doing so before long then a custom be must make faint little clucking noise like hen mildly want to be let out be incapable of going away however much wanted to do so unless silvia took initiative clucked then silvia said that be time to go peter did not want silvia to go just yet on other hand if be to sit here until clucking became perceptible to silvia visitor might just a well for practical purpose go away at once besides be impossible to forget nellie last night have prophesied have struck a well a that be reliable seer got up rather slowly rather tentatively fixed in mind be idea that silvia must make sort of initial step seemed to that be hand in hand be just question of who lifted foot first silvia did not turn head to look at mother if have must have be bound to attend to clucking what wanted more precisely what needed be to get away from masked fire of elderly eye with peter of course just to be natural there be smouldering in room ember of supervision felt under magnifying glass being looked at being noted being examined must answer need perfectly well to go with on to balcony outside room to see if evening be likely to be fine to be sure that motor be waiting here there be mr mainwaring visualizing portrait worse than here be more gimlet like attention of wife who ostensibly be making sloppy saucer of food for london sparrow certainly must sooner go out on balcony alone than remain here when thought of that did not in least satisfy after did not want to sit out alone what girl must want that wanted to sit out there be sort of embarrassment in voice when spoke to peter may go down to father studio again asked havent seen wanted to surely glance met hers with comprehension seemed immeasurably marvellous yes do come down said clucking became inarticulate ought to be going silvia said mother peter took up oh must give miss silvia five minute mr wardour said only fair that must know sort of thing that father going to make of mr mainwaring gave great shout of laughter impertinence of youth cried peter disown must cut off with shilling if have one two went down stair in silence in silence also came into studio huge cartoon filled up one end of on other three side be stacked dbris from attic landscape portrait sketch littered table thats rather jolly said peter pointing to one at random o lord father have brought out thing did of last year rather like hair dresser not bit said silvia very like peter wheeled about faced evidence said do know what said to last night of course dont ill tell now be talking about said encouraged to think have chance silvia stood stock still fibre of stiff arrested about chance said peter again be true be right be being witch silvia have be looking at when spell of stillness struck now eyelid fluttered drooped then once more looked at a steadily a before true said nellie told something said that when loved anybody must love just a love now just a love now peter chapter viii silvia be sitting in mr mainwarings studio one saturday afternoon waiting without impatience for arrival from foreign office of peter with whom be motoring down to howe there to spend sunday silvia be perfectly capable of humour with regard to howe for called family seat indeed be since father have bought norman ruin twenty year ago quite unmistakably belonged to wardours have made habitable while silvia be still child during war when became quite fabulously rich made abominable also to period belonged great picture gallery gathering there for week end be though small rather crucial one be to introduce to other family must be brought into alliance over wedding henry wardour silvia uncle on father side be to be ponderously there wife elegantly so then there be to be aunt joanna darley mr wardours sister husband sir abel darley be round pink profiteer who in recognition of considerable fortune have made for by overcharging government for million of yard of khaki have be made baronet presumably in order to stop mouth if felt inclined to brag over gullible government then there be mr mainwaring to represent peter side of connection be to sustain part alone since mr mainwaring with impregnable quietness of negation have absolutely refused to take part in reunion of family youll be eight without silvia have said eight very good number will stop quietly in london think of enjoying yourselves silvia sense of humour prevented from forming tragic anticipation about party though a must have be perfectly willing to confess did not suppose that meeting of clan must lead to instinctive blood brotherhood peter must be there must be there however outrageous incompatible rest of proved must be like heathen furiously raging together unable to disturb seriously foundation fact of trusted to own sense of humour to peter to enable to be indifferent to what happened outside own charmed corner uncle henry uncle abe mr mainwaring peter must form very curious company after dinner night when mother aunt joanna aunt eleanor have left to punish a uncle henry must undoubtedly say port of be so inordinately fond while lady must form equally inconceivable committee upstairs since thing be to be there be use in imagining impossible situation somehow conjectured that mr mainwaring must impress more strongly on circle downstairs than of uncle have more exuberance if silvia have be set down to construct incongruous party of eight must not by fantastic selection have bettered gathering aunt joanna for instance nourished ineradicable hatred towards sister for having married silvia father for being so much richer than sir abe even sir abes rank own be powerless to compensate for rich immensely rich sir abe certainly be must not bear that sister must be so much richer aunt eleanor on other hand mr wardours sister in law have only reverence for mr wardours wealth what thoroughly despised for be truckling so aunt eleanor put to smart world aunt eleanor have be present at great party where russian ballet entertained guest presence of so many distinguished people made feel perfectly sick true diagnosis of indisposition however be that since have tried to do for year without particle of success what mr wardour have so brilliantly accomplished in few week be only reasonable that must have violent reaction against sort of thing if instead of marrying peter silvia have be about to wed peer somebody of kind aunt eleanor must certainly have felt duty never to speak to mother again indeed must never have accepted mr wardours invitation at so have made quite plain unless have felt duty to take interest in husband relation silvia be conscious of vein of caricature in flitting survey ridiculous people made caricature of without collusion of observer mr mainwaring be caricature too must not think of quite seriously probably most people if regarded from strictly individual standpoint have touch of caricature about for if rated a normal person everybody else must be little out of drawing looked at caricature with friendliest amusement loved here in particular be mother included for being so entirely different from for being in fact precisely what be humorous observation be with le critical than appreciative process now a waited for peter wanted definitely to include mr mainwaring in fascinating gallery for last fortnight since engagement to peter have found increasingly unable to give genial amused observation more more did mr mainwaring baffle elude there be so far a silvia must notice nothing humanly ridiculous about what be even more disconcerting girl found ever more incapable of attaching to to attempt to do resembled in uncomfortable manner notion of attaching in dark to hard smooth surface must nowhere get hold of find projection crevice in to crook to insert finger tip more closely silvia looked at more strenuously attempted to get into sort of psychical contact with mr mainwaring more directly be baffled must not for give up a insoluble mystery of lady mental spiritual process there must be if must only lay hand on in dark key to future mother in law something explained for instance unwearied study of advertisement of hotel one must be a completely tranquil emotionless through a mr mainwaring appeared to be twice only have mind slipped for definite instant into open like lizard emerging into sunlight flicking back again once when on first visit silvia mother have paid to house mr mainwaring unveiled glance of malicious hostility in direction of great cartoon le definite like in kind be habitual though veiled hostility with silvia felt that mr mainwaring regarded did not flame knew that be right in conjecturing that incessantly smouldered enmity to silvia sense be of same quality though smouldering a have leaped in swift little tongue of flame towards cartoon what puzzled be kinship between two from context of moment in studio seemed to be mr mainwarings work kept in london therefore with have kindled that odd swift spark be origin of little deeper down than did shut furnace of impatience at husband so floridly symbolized there deep seated core of incompatibility suddenly flame out then if so what be kindred nature of hostility to girl be that be taking peter away from home presence there just rendered tolerable apart from two escape so to speak of genuine feeling origin of after be only matter of conjecture silvia have clue to mr mainwaring at be practically featureless even without outline must not sketch at delineate from a model one of genial caricature such a friend so freely supplied with material for such feature such outline a must perceive be tinged with bitter suggestion silvia did not find waiting for peter in way tedious there be plenty in studio to furnish larder for thought though what most occupied be alert attention for sound of light footstep coming down passage apart from food for reflection be abundant to day end of studio where cartoon have hung be empty so that if mr mainwarings resentment be inspired purely by work of art might now regain tranquillity again silvia must see evening for mother following up idea with have first fired in connection with empty wall of picture gallery at howe have few day ago made purchase of mr mainwaring have be very glorious on occasion at first have hysterically refused to part with be chef duvre while have couple of penny in pocket be though poor too proud to think of selling then lest that refusal must be taken too seriously almost immediately declared that must be wedding present to silvia let be hunted out of so untenable magnificence finally so far humiliated a to accept fancy price for a mr wardour knew reminded to make certain that be first of series of six upon be contented to stand fall in verdict of posterity seemed probable that at future time wall of picture gallery at howe must be far le empty than be to day on easel near where silvia sat be portrait of herself now approaching completion to there be something uncanny arresting about for by accident design artist have caught aspect of secretly recognized a piece of intimate revelation inclined to accidental derivation for certainly in one point be flamboyant uninspired performance chronicle of green jumper scarlet skirt haystack of dyed hair rouged simpering mouth head be turned full to spectator looking over shoulder in precisely same pose favourite trick of artist a in german emperor listened to satanic counsel in eye in badly drawn outstretched hand clumsily posed silvia saw unconscious rendering of boy key acquitted mr mainwaring of intention of inspiration have certainly not meant that have through faulty drawing given certain brisk violence to hand certain domination to eye then heard click of street door quick light footstep for have be waiting wondered if must ever get used to mere fact of peter return from however short absence kissed holding hand for moment too bad of to have kept waiting said couldnt help there be messenger starting for rome havent brought tea thought must wait have with peter rang bell father gone asked yes mother called for drove down ive brought little cording car for just thatll be lovely said peter do quite trust driving though may drive if like said thanks trust that far le must see if bag be packed tell burrow want tea at once cant help to pack if isnt done asked silvia somehow must have liked to do to fold clothes to squeeze out sponge so sordid said peter besides probably done already if isnt call said man have idea of how to pack want to teach asked peter lingering on stair silvia hesitated only for moment no darling said dont want to teach anything just want to do why asked came closer raising face towards a leaned over banister thing said sponge coat that pleasure be denied for burrow have already bestowed peter requirement in bag came downstairs again silvia have given father sitting for portrait morning stood frowning in front of trash rubbish said at length worst of be that have got into infernal resemblance to caricature oh be caricature to other said with just few exception what heathenish doctrine why be caricature for instance arent youre one of exception tell what father have caricatured of in peter looked from to portrait back again of said reality of rest be quite unlike havent got mouth nose forehead hair chin least like person inside be horribly like silvia put arm through horribly said thanks so much didnt say just then that be horrible said said horribly like parody caricature wonder how dared ask masterful young woman to marry knew must be good for said silvia be far more daring of to accept there just time for to remedy mistake said positively last chance frank kind of chaffing talk a between friend rather than lover have grown to be characteristic of privacy silvia delighted in have charm of cipher about blunt commonplace word held for secret meaning known to two utterer of be only to be expressed by symbol when feigned to misunderstand peter thanked for calling horrible there lay below foolish word treasure word be quite powerless to express when just now wondered that have dared to ask to marry felt that conveyed something amount of impassioned speech must have indicated so well from hilltop there flashed signal that voice must convey then sometimes a now have to use symbol again be only symbol with hand tremblingly eagerly shyly clasping round neck drew head down towards not kissing simply looking close into eye positively last chance said oh peter what fool be about doesnt bore frightfully frightfully said peter keeping to first code of symbol bear beautifully darling said oh will ever get used to hope so mustnt go on being such donkey day dont think do hope so being donkey be good enough for hee haw oh let go here burrow coming with tea shell think so undignified be a matter of fact who have to let go a burrow entered followed by mr mainwaring silvia have before now tried to call mother experiment somehow have not succeeded mr mainwaring answered to quite readily received so girl thought much a might have received unsolicited nickname why mr mainwaring said didnt know be in mr mainwaring paused just long enough to let be inferred that if silvia have made inquiry a to that must have obtained information sought yes dear have be reading upstairs since lunch time said came to have cup of tea with before started hope will have pleasant drive silvia tried to approach ah do come too said change mind come with heap of room thank dear think will keep to original plan said like quiet sunday sometimes will go to church perhaps in afternoon hear concert at queen time will pas very pleasantly there be aura of correct armed neutrality about accompanied a be by cold sheathed glance furtive hostile caused half comic half impatient despair in girl at aloofness mr mainwaring so seemed to wanted nobody except wanted just to be let alone father went off right asked peter yes mr wardour kindly called for after lunch beautiful car so roomy there be lady gentleman there think mr wardour said be sister husband father insisted on going in box seat with driver made great noise with motor horn sounded like bugle be in very high spirit neutrality exhibited in speech be almost too correct to be credible nobody must have be so neutral even mr mainwaring must not quite keep up something very far from neutral lay ever so little below surface in announcement of husband high spirit neutrality towards silvia be not so deadly a towards husband peter laughed there be neutrality there too be more contemptuous than deadly quite good humoured in contempt oh theyll have noisy drive said if mr wardour drive back on monday youll be aware of approach mother while theyre still mile two away mr mainwaring have one of fine lipped mouth very neat finished at outer corner about be impossible to say whether be smiling not without consulting condition prevailing round eye a peter spoke very definitely ceased to smile monday said thought mr wardour be so kind a to ask to stop till tuesday peter got up noticed nothing about mother having long ago given up attempt to comprehend tuesday be said im back on monday anyhow otherwise what must happen to foreign relation will start silvia im ready when be mr mainwaring rose too yes indeed have better be off said wont have too much time then will expect on monday peter tell father stopped that dont expect till tuesday asked without slightest indication of mental comment yes think mr wardour quite took for granted that be stopping till then silvia made one further attempt to evoke touch of cordiality mother will be delighted said horrid for being alone dear will be very happy said mr mainwaring with quiet decision howe stood of course in park of considerable acreage surrounded by massive brick wall reflected colossal self in lake lay below terraced garden lake have be artificially made by damming up of stream have previously wasted unornamentally road have dipped into willow valley now ran along causeway formed farther margin of lake gave visitor first complete stupendous view of house wing gallery have be built out rendered original norman core comparatively insignificant whole resembled apotheosis of station hotel combined with fortress for character of older part be borne out in battlemented wall spread so amply to right left of avenue of monkey puzzler led up to long faade garden overlooking lake be like glorified arboretum where might expect tin label asking visitor to keep off grass not touch flower at interval along edge of immense lawn be aloe in square green tub below house be riband border of geranium calceolaria lobelia inside expectation aroused by sumptuous exterior be fully justified for high panelled hall be peopled with suit of armour with numbered label so that glance at catalogue must put into possession of interesting information about armour have long be hobby of late mr wardour have very quaintly installed electric light in gauntleted hand there be passenger lift in one corner groined roof famous malachite table head antler of stag hung in panel silvia have rather dreaded moment whole place with monkey puzzler malachite aloe awfulness have be left by father to absolutely peter knew knew knew that be making first acquaintance with what must be home to have not seen since day of father funeral two year ago seemed to how must strike peter though have traditional quality of home in there be place a far a be aware in least like unique fulfilment of definition be only merit with sideways glance now again have observed peter growing awe from time have crossed causeway pride of to approach through monkey puzzler to final revelation of malachite table there be much more to follow ever so much more gothic staircase blue drawing room pink drawing room picture gallery swimming bath be not inanimate magnificence alone be to assail for there be uncle henry uncle abe aunt joanna eleanor ought to have brought down quietly alone for first sight of howe peter have be gazing in fascinated manner at malachite table even while silvia be wondering how to convey to sympathy encouragement with one of flash of intuition adored in showed that have comprehended with unerring accuracy what be feeling about youre going to be here said just a if have spoken out that be puzzling over took arm oh dear promise that said ive got to get used to too then youll be here will butter others paw peter until feel at home let have more tea in fact find where rest of be picture gallery seemed likely kind of place there indeed six representative of family proved to be when kissing ceremony be over for herself rite of introduction for peter silvia found thinking that be really for best that must have burst on peter in one comprehensive revelation rather than that must have be subjected to series of shock surprise already staggered by uncle henry peter might have be quite thrown off balance so flashed alternative comedy through head by uncle abe what if reeling from aunt eleanor ran into aunt joanna just round corner silvia have not smallest inclination intention to be ashamed of relation must have shown joylessness of puritan not to be amused at blandness blankness on so many face peter included a be taken to in turn must have shown too almost dangerous rigidity that voice must not betray tremor of suppressed hilariousness aunt eleanor came first looked like handsome seal with adenoidal breathing bowed to peter with freezing propriety when be moved on to aunt joanna curiosity got better of instantly put up glass to get better look at aunt joanna large marvellously bedizened with flower in hat bosom hand irresistibly suggested van going to covent garden in early morning too have notion of propriety expressed in cordiality a warm a aunt eleanors be cold then came uncle abe who be so like fish that really seemed dangerous for to be sitting so near aunt eleanor held out hand took cigar out of mouth remained open in precise shape of cigar finally came uncle henry who be busy with drop of brandy because tea a instantly proceeded to inform peter gave heartburn then four of stared at peter to see how be going to comport peter be never more grateful to father than when at embarrassing moment mr mainwaring who have be mysteriously employed at far end of picture gallery with cord sheet step ladder three bewildered footman gave loud yodel set to word like mio figlio to announce perception of son arrival accomplishment of on have be so busily engaged ben arrivato be concluding stave of melody came running up gallery there be quite enough space to enable to get good speed up after holding peter for moment in joint embrace with silvia cast down for moment on white bear skin at mr wardours foot ecco said lady gentleman when will distinguish with gift of moment of leisure will have honour to show first of completed labour picture poor suppliant picture be on wall masked by fair linen sheet so fondly hope be in control of cord just cord when be ready will in fact pull unless mechanism have be contriving be sadly at fault there will then be revealed to that sheet at moment be so discreetly veiling valour perhaps valour be worse part of discretion peter have heard before for moment be le discreet than valorous will show complete materialized vision that since august have obsessed dominated life pray gentle sir madam to indulge humble servant to take place exactly where will have honour to indicate discretionary linen when removed will unbare valour rose from reclining posture after superb obeisance placed at head of procession already a silvia have foreseen be in position of dominance uncle abe uncle henry obeyed order aunt joanna aunt eleanor clearly perked up at ingratiating suppliance for took mr wardours hand holding high a in minuet led way grouped requested with humble apology to have goodness to move step backwards set chair for put finger on lip on tiptoe advanced to dangling end of cord pulled up flew sheet waving wildly eventually festooning clear of cartoon then swiftly retreating magnificently posed gazed at picture for moment there be dead silence then vague clickings murmur began to grow articulate uncle aunt vied with other in perception emperor said uncle henry good likeness eh august exclaimed lady darley terrible wonderful drew in breath with hissing sound perception of date be not so clever a be largely inscribed on frame aunt eleanor smiled indulgently yes dear joanna said see that look at satan whispering to emperor host of hell said joanna swiftly uncle abe turned to uncle marvellous thing said tell own story call that picture mr wardour merely wore pleased air of proprietorship have seen before must see again a many time a chose mr mainwaring chin in hand just contemplated while appreciation be in progress now seemed to wake out of swoon passed hand over eye be who painted that muttered didnt know what be doing didnt know till moment when at last see work properly displayed with discordant note to mar have done doe terrify dear lady gentleman doe put in possession of august doe ah dio mio covered face with hand shuddered then advancing to picture again violently shook cord two linen sheet double bed rolled back into original place enough enough cried will contemplate more calmly when have recovered from first shock of bleeding heart let converse let smile laugh again let remember that war be over be laid on by destiny to execute five more such picture not le terrible if live will be done yes yes falter for while let forget let forget mr wardour spaced out wall with pleased eye will just fill length of gallery said if crowd silvia dear must persuade mr mainwaring well im sure if isnt dressing bell vindictive purpose be weaving below embowering flower of lady darleys hat accelerating heart beat below nosegay on bosom so that gardenia be of tremble lucy might be rich indeed be quite certain that be horribly rich comparative pauper such a herself be not to be altogether trampled upon other people beside lucy have picture gallery apparently series of tremendous allegory be not yet painted be not yet definitely bespoken by sister

lift clinched resolution conjugally conferred with sir abe to delight be a much impressed with passion for scoring off lucy a with merit of cartoon business habit have to make hesitation condition not do deal blindly well lady said will have picture if theyre to be obtained reasonably what will offer now most striking that one be that similar be worth paying pretty penny for what did sister give for one then if reasonable dont mind if add twenty five per cent more secure lot theyll be something to point at get along let have bath try to find out what sister paid then well know where be lady noted with pleasure that relapsed into cockney accent slight uncertainty about aspirate a spoke that be good sign showed be in earnest interested for in dalliance of light conversation sir abe be a good at h a anybody be not to be expected that cartoon magnificence of introduction must have effect on aunt eleanor that general animosity towards mr wardour being of same fine order a aunt joannas must not have be kindled with ambition to bring off similar vindictive stroke for acquisition of immense decoration be out of question for husband must certainly not pay such price a felt sure must be necessary to secure even if did house did not contain sufficient uninterrupted wall space so that to hang at must have to cut up into section paper several different room with mr mainwaring have said

have wide licence of guest peculiarly privileged at liberty to ask friend there whenever wished crystallization of definite statement treaty after infinite probings testing on part into peter most intimate feeling on subject have be entirely silvia have be who have finally suggested with proviso that anybody by undoubtedly meant husband be to tear up treaty without possibility of offence if found unworkable unsatisfactory a thought over now be frankly surprised at to find how eminently satisfactory fulfilment of augured silvia have suggested there be great point though felt that must not have conceivably presented treaty like to for signature applauded insight in so doing man must hardly have suggested that to girl have lately married must have savoured must not of considering that ideal arrangement did not procure for own undiluted companionship have known that must not put such construction on proposition did not in fact let attitude must have be typically feminine deter from adopting more sensible more manly pose be silvia through there be robust quality about impotence to harbour littleness expected visitor day in person of peter father who have in letter be le than

to fraction of tone key in be pitched there have to be gradual crescendo deliberate tuning up up continual ascent throughout series shorn of mixture of metaphor wanted to study first cartoon before plunging with aid of sketch into remainder sketch added be a soon a have finished with use to pas out of possession for charming mr henry wardour have induced to let purchase at figure convinced that must find appreciative home then letter became slightly mysterious projected series of cartoon have reason to know be exciting stupendous interest in artistic circle flattering perhaps man who be proud of work ought not to say flattering evidence of be to hand evidence substantial conclusive have not made be lucky since must not have dreamed of going back on bargain have not made contract with mr wardour to whom salutation about rest of series thought fortunate in not parting with for comparative pittance did not mark peter complain of price have paid for first of be quite sure that with peter assistance everything must be arranged quite satisfactorily peter have read letter must talk over with silvia on return with detachment of be so terribly capable have come to conclusion that father have somehow induced deluded crsus of sort to offer higher price per cartoon for future perpetration than mother in law have doubt already given for first for deduction have most cordial welcome a long a father be dumping beastly good so peter be now at liberty to think on picture gallery at howe for fancy if not fantastic price must not in mere pious decency put to mr wardour that be paying a supposed heavily for colossal rubbish father letter maturely considered made quite certain that somebody be willing to pay more for rubbish than mr wardour already general question have received attention mr wardour be so supposed under contract to buy melodramatic daub for decoration of house belonged to silvia of by attested treaty be master so long a father must profitably dispose of rubbish here peter be filially prohibited from protest when once father announced that be receiving mere pittance though without complaint for what must in market receive le despicable dole son surely be free to welcome taking ware elsewhere son in case be heart soul allied to new enterprise for already peter have experienced vivid distaste of fact that countenanced by mere acquiescence further decoration of howe knew that if artist have not be father must have already protested against bargain perhaps be not yet complete on side acquiescence in fact have brought home to that father be profiting by marriage then so swiftly involuntarily that have not time to stop thought on threshold there burst into door of mind inquiry a to whether too a well a father be not unloading rubbish at high price price that peter be receiving for rubbish be infinitely higher father received doubt substantial cheque received a far a material consideration went immunity from meaning of cheque in standard immeasurably higher sort of blank cheque a silvia told one night be in middle of telling when father made that flamboyant interruption must be honoured by to figure chose to fill in yet leave richer in such standard than ever there in immortal bank divined then knew now illimitable credit paid out by in royal mathematics of love be richer impression made by unsolicited thought be to like having seen pas book of soul be hers have blown open in front of eye before have so to speak time to close have caught glimpse of sum so vast that exceeded power of realization eye in involuntary survey have received impression of payment into account credit side be catalogue of own inconceivable affluence moment seemed be giving moment bounty flowed back to be with kind of sceptical envy that in glimpse realized omnipotent finance be not so marvellous that love must be stronger than death miracle be that must be so much stronger than life be at moment in peter reflection moment that only half realized be glad to get away from that interruption reasonably claiming attention occurred in shape of little old butler who have be drafted down here from london in view of mr wardours advent be black eyed grey headed perky in movement to extent fully justified peter exclamation of jackdaw when have quitted scene last night now jackdaw immediate mission be to hand peter couple of letter on immense silver salver inquire where mr mainwaring who so jackdaw understood be to arrive that evening must be put must be put clearly in place must please most for be peter undeviating creed when self sacrifice be not involved beyond doubt state room so called must please father inordinately state room have be insisted on in rebuilding of house by father in law in rich vision so silvia have half piously half humorously intimated of royal personage being sumptuously housed there there be tremendous tapestried bedroom en suite with second bedroom breakfast room sitting room tapestry oak mantelpiece silver sconce yes state room for mr mainwaring silvia be on humorous term now about peter father must enjoy that immensely peter took letter from jackdaw a latter gave pleasant sort of croak in answer to order remembered how nellie have once said that wealth be not accident attribute quality have be disposed to dispute at time somehow own allocation of state room to father confirmed suspicion that be right for instance be clearly different person in eye of father now when must gloriously endow with state room from what have be when a on same occasion told only lived in beastly little house off brompton road because free meal free lodging be consideration to exiguous purse be different nellie be right when must dispense material magnificence instead of accepting tolerable shelter where though rain be kept out odour of dinner with careless burrow must not be kept in still fingering letter trying to insert thumb into too honestly adhesive envelope flap peter slightly amplified by corrobative illustration thesis how often have so to speak sung for dinner accepting welcoming such invitation a mr trentham extended to by for pleasure of comfortable decent food have gladly spent insincere boring evening have not quite be greed combined with moderate penuriousness have enjoined that be natural thing to do if be young poor to dine be to say comfortably by way of acknowledging indebtedness to be towed about for rest of evening by foolish married middle aged woman who for inscrutable reason of own wanted to present unblemished reputation in sort of compromising limelight now on opulent sunny afternoon peter tried in vain to recapture mood once habitual to of accepting invitation merely because implied good dinner perhaps good supper with boring opera in between certainly have be easy for to fulfil part of bargain in evening be natural also habitual for to make pleasant to look handsome to tell mr trentham that have never be so marvellous so chic so smart so entrancing generally now mere notion of such evening seemed foreign if wanted to dine at ritz go to opera have supper must do secure a guest just with whom be pleasant to spend evening henceforth if wanted to do that must vulgarly speaking pick choose recipient of bounty stated like that whole thing sounded rather sordid seemed to that for have got rid of sordidness court fool touch

far easier part there be then have no longer to be asked to dine at ritz to go to theatre what not afterwards must bid to feast more consider expense than in old day must have considered whether must afford bus fare enjoyment of kind world have to offer be for mere formation of inclination to enjoy then suddenly a blink of distant lightning so seemed wholly independent of own brain there came question a to what have paid for privilege remote a drowsy thunder question supplied own indubitable answer have somehow thing be done convinced silvia that loved have at rate given signal of response

by internal audition nellies voice enunciating sentence with familiar intonation of light staccato mockery written word be like prompter copy held glanced at be nellie who stood there said line must have liked to argue point two with knew that there be between deep fundamental agreement comprehension without argument develops into mere contradiction peter thrust letter into pocket a step sounded on gravel just behind be sitting here ever since left asked silvia oh peter without hat in hot sun picked up perched on head there oh dear what nuisance be that be last day here what last day letter

silvia pinched arm when be going to understand that be master said oh peter will be lovely for having state room hell like tremendously wont wish have thought of wasnt that hope that wanted to consult about now before consult want to ask question two must promise to answer not tactfully truly not even little tact if find necessary asked not atom do like cartoon of silvia glanced sideways at well dont find go look at for pleasure said not often at least not day do like think largest piece of rubbish ever saw now try again to express opinion silvia gave sigh of relief oh do agree said most appalling now isnt question number two said peter do think will like others better do in fact look forward to seeing whole wall of gallery covered with allegorical mainwarings not in very smallest degree weve got to have havent dont think so said in fact from letter have received from father gather that doesnt consider made contract for at clear from what say that somebody else want to buy at higher rate considerably higher than mother paid for first in fact alludes to price paid for a pittance by way what did pay for silvia looked sideways at again do really want to tell asked if dont mind well gave thousand guinea for peter rather wish hadnt called pittance make seem mean be quite willing to accept dont suppose do that sell much at sort of price rest of unspeakable six at same price asked peter suppose so mother understood so said doe want to have asked peter dont think doe very much said silvia spoke to day of cartoon wasnt that darling of when said father be coming evening think must explain to that have if do right way wont think want what about one weve got sell back to at price gave for said peter silvia seemed to consider simple proposition rather intently yes perhaps must do that said without much conviction a to probability oh peter havent got rather odd parent have why have except in so far that be odd to give thousand guinea for monstrosity im delighted at prospect of getting rid of not only not chiefly because atrocious object because hate idea of father imposing upon mother then talking about pittance must have jumped at selling in auction room for quarter of what paid wonder who can have offered more for oh by way aunt eleanor have bought sketch for cartoon silvia burst out laughing then aunt joanna have bought cartoon said dont suggest that to mother rather if want to talk about to wont aunt joanna see want to what call wipe mother eye im quite certain of if mother got wind of wouldnt part with wretched picture for million how odd yes thats oddness said have got odd parent doubt at least there doubt about at whether will let father have back one cartoon that have got for what paid for doesnt want money shes a generous a can be bless wont be done picture be hers wont let have back at penny le than be going to receive for oh let talk about something more interesting anyhow dont want cartoon weve got more like people be so queer love queerness be part of after queerness in people be exactly what make individuality youre queer im queer why be queer demanded peter ive told so often said peter guessed at what imputed queerness be be true that have told often be true also that there be thing lover be never tired of repeating never never once said a if wasnt doing day said taking advantage mean of queerness not merely telling about directly being so much more direct than just telling whats queerness indeed if isnt that allow to be queer just because be youve changed subject said youre talking about queerness now same queerness said peter must squint more atrociously than most people now looking at silvia allowed to contemplate end of nose silvia couldnt stand trick nonsensical ritual have built up upon oh peter put eye back cried cant theyve stuck push back for shut eye silvia stroked lid from nose outwards will stick day said then will divorce peter looked at straight again go on about queerness said mine asked said be same be in way queerness be much queerest for be whom loved what did wasnt queer anything else must have be not queer imbecile peter dont ever be tired of knowing how awfully love if youre not there thought of frightens there something crushing about when be with only thing that frightens be thought that shouldnt be so why on earth youre like like mean thats what be so incomprehensible know bit of nothing at peter became aware more consciously than through hint have previously be cognizant of how though silvia level be sun basked plateau far above welcomed spread in gleam came to there be splendour in being loved like at moment inherent falsity of position be just burned out by consuming ray love not in least masculine be yet male in adoring surrender a regard though not in least feminine be female in reception of there be ecstasy in being adored by so magnificent lover even a in material way showered on danae for whom in drama be cast so in subtler splendid beauty of soul poured out in love passed love of woman very quality here triumphantly shining drew out essential fragrance of more said more nothing at seemed to step from height at diving down to entrancingly tender thats there be darling said if want more than ive got must teach now wont be absurd longer look there moorhen be quite in habitual manner like lark sang for so long a be in air then folded wing dropped to nest singing be over left panting with ecstasy of peter to continue metaphor received something of shock have not known must so swiftly come to ground yet sudden dip be equally characteristic of probably have shown trick of for often have done just that sky after extended to actual ground there be intermediate element coot said dont care only hope happy said oh dear there bell for lunch be mile from house jackdaw will peck for being late not fault lake shouldnt have be so long might fill of up said let talk sensibly what be saying before began to talk nonsense oh yes picture pittance papa said peter cant think of more peter papa purchase picture sold for pittance said american headline make sort of monkey gymnastics of mind at peter nellie rest of so fluently excelled be always productive in silvia of intense gravity made contribution with effort struggle bewilderment amazed at how quickly everybody else everybody else be so clever made word out of word reeled off name of eminent men began with x something about mother said with knitted brow must manage oh peter isnt good must manage to make mother peter giggled thats not right form said must get right form let see millionaire mother manages to make to make oh yes money on mr mainwarings monstrosity finished up in great hurry oh peter how lovely said how do do why cant mr mainwaring rose magnificently to tenancy of state room feeling that have be very proper arrangement to put there here be father of master of howe paying visit to son here too in same earthly vesture be creator of great cartoon among futile cross cenotaph hysterical verse prose be not unworthy of heroic history commemorated with same abandoned thoroughness with must be when suitable rollicking jovial boy hungry for tea robust throated toreador so now saw in assignation of state room to occupancy very proper touching homage on part of peter silvia mr wardour more probably on joint acclamation to sovereignty of art pleasant reflection accompanied appreciative exploration of territory suggested that there be so to speak little state business to be done nature of believed have adequately indicated to peter peter good lad must no doubt have attended to must be well for to give report probably be a much desire of having conversation with peter secure from interruption a anything else that caused to send message to son that mr mainwaring must be much obliged if must spare few minute in state room before dressing time certainly fitted in pleasantly with sovereignty that peter must be requested to present that mr mainwaring must be set on throne of spanish brocade waved peter to seat peter seemed to prefer to perch on tall steel fireguard divined with sufficient accuracy father pose be partly amused partly irritated silvia must have be wholly amused hope youll be comfortable here father said mr mainwaring glanced round yes indeed said will do very well ah by way before get to business have letter from mother asked to give perhaps must hand despatch case here be peter be lighting cigarette spoke between puff right ill take when go said father looked at tapestried wall dear boy said dont know if be right to allow to smoke here peter dropped match on carpet did that on purpose oh dont bother about that said allow now suppose want to talk to about cartoon got letter have arranged what indicated peter felt irritation gaining on well letter be rather rather involved rather vague magnificent said what silvia made out of be that have be offered higher price for work mr wardour have commissioned to do for wanted to call off seemed to be general drift of there be definite commission said mentioned that mr wardour be under impression that there be that think can be arranged for series be intended commissioned not doesnt matter to hang in gallery here be silvia house see in way mine so that if consent there will be under certain condition difficulty with mother in law silvia have talked to about cordially consent father be quite willing that must paint rest of series for somebody else mr mainwaring must find fault with substance of speech indeed gave precisely what be wanting in spite of peter neutrality of statement found dealing dastardly wound to vanity have silvia appears dont want great series remarked apparently somebody else doe said peter said in letter that be exciting stupendous interest in artistic circle thats right then be very glad yes glad to get rid of said insatiable one peter practically never lost temper used a stored up force certainly sight of father on spanish throne looking like zeus did not predispose to exert habitual pleasantness be of course at liberty to make comment choose said be vexed with because give way quite willingly instead of reluctantly by way dont tell in particular dont tell mr wardour whether artistic circle be expression for lady darley if be think highly probable that must refuse to let have back first cartoon if be part of plan must in case suppose have to copy if allowed to mr mainwaring rose to splendour of pomposity copy said must copy fiery execution of speak of picture peter a if must be produced like boot hat intending purchaser say whether refer to lady darley want cold replica insists on one came hot terrible from furnace of imagination then on certain condition said peter lady darley mean purchaser may have name said father looking like captive king first be that completely withdraw if possible regret use of expression pittance in connection with price received for there implication of meanness about with regard to mr wardour mr mainwaring clicked thumb finger a if to say that for what sold for make such implication said mr wardour anybody else be well within right in acquiring fine work at such price a artist be obliged from straitened circumstance to accept point be said peter that hadnt often if ever be obliged to accept thousand guinea before for picture may not artist after year of unremitting endeavour be allowed to come into own enjoy appreciation have long merited asked mr mainwaring certainly may be delighted when doe when be to say at length receive high price for picture shouldnt because be offered immediately afterwards higher price talk of pittance a applied to first thought father continued peter pleasantly inexorably remarkably fortunate to get thousand guinea mr mainwaring at displayed versatility of quick change artist be pretty well demonstrated that peter be not impressed by majestic attitude yodelled burst into laugh well well peter said will have own way be pittance ought not to have called pittance mea culpa mea maximum culpa pittance be let distinguish dear when contrast with subsequent offer have reached at time thousand guinea seemed to very fair remuneration have be too modest about value appears now ah yes recognition be pleasant enough when brush slip from hand spirit fly made circular motion of arm a if swimming to join mightier dead mainwaring estate will be found not too inconsiderable to place beside fortune of wardours will not hope be for long time yet added a notion of picturing in front of great canvas with brush slipping from nerveless hand supported by silvia peter occurred to with almost ominous vividness quite said peter in general acknowledgment of magnificence there remains then one thing to settle be price at repurchase cartoon of mr wardour be present possessor mr mainwaring did not for moment see bearing of remained splendid must not dream of repaying one penny le than what received for said full price peter assure of peter thought better to let aspect of case strike father without suggesting be silent till mr mainwaring spoke again hm see what mean said hoped must because really there doesnt seem to be reason why must let have for thousand guinea thing be now indubitably hers will immediately sell for considerably higher sum mr mainwaring began to regret that have said quite so much about utter impossibility of recapturing fire of original in copy must be offering must remember peter added pittance for picture think ought to give what will receive for asked mr mainwaring peter kept steadily before distaste of father scoring off mr wardour whole thing though humorous be rather sordid knew that rather liked in part be playing in think justice of view will appeal to said couldnt very well do otherwise mr mainwaring be silent moment then decided to be completely superb have experience in business in bargaining said if tell be right fair proper yield think only mean of getting picture said peter so thats settled be oh letter from mother thanks dinner at half past eight chapter x peter a strolled down corridor knew that have be rather signorial if be word designedly so in interview in spite of mr mainwarings magnificent occupation of state room for after have son to thank peter be pleased to feel that have be putting father in place have certainly be with object in view that have smoked cigarette dropped expired match on carpet not exactly calling attention to position casually assuming again in matter of picture have ever so quietly ever so indulgently just hinted at right course like lamb great vain rococo farcical lamb father have bleated way into proper fold peter confessed to seldom confessed to anybody else that motive inspired manuvres be unamiable one might easily have obtained result that now together with mother unopened letter carried away from interview by tact by pleasantness by general small change of sympathy hitherto have be accustomed to use such lubrication to make wheel of life run smoothly in domestic dealing now that further domestic lubrication be necessary on part father be true might have to flourish oil can with desperate agility if be to ensure smooth working peter knew that have just driven ahead let wheel if so felt disposed squeak squeal grind grumble while small smelly house off brompton road have be home have paid to make bearing run easily now when thought with incredulous wonder that must have stuck that small stuffiness so long detachedly admired own past deftness patience in dealing with daily situation there saw in mirror of own vanity incomparable crudeness of father discovered almost with sense of shock how cordially disliked for present sense of humour with regard to be in total eclipse type of quality silvia hugged a being lovable queerness make for individuality saw only a tiresome contemptible eccentricity thing to be contemplated baldly without comment whenever contemplation of be necessary to be dealt with summarily vexing affair be that peter caught broken image of in one glimpse of in especial be irritating that namely in looked with great distaste on father profiting by wealth of wardours without giving due return for depredation on be natural that when a now be so acutely aware of father unique capability for rubbing up wrong way must wonder afresh at placid unruffled tolerance that have enabled mother to spend quarter of century with woman of course so ran reflection have greater gift of patience with men than man can be expected to have sex doubt have something to do with for on other hand men be more tolerant of tiresome woman than other woman yet must not wholly explain mother be quite inexplicable for silvia even gifted a peter ever so cordially recognized with power of putting into position realizing identity of other people have fallen back like spent wave from hard smooth impenetrability of mother have confessed baffled have idea whether there be something somebody hermetically sealed up behind neat porcelain face by inexorable will of occupant if there be nothing beyond blank imperturbability cared only whether door at head of kitchen stair be quite shut have desire except to be left alone allowed to read advertisement of hotel in railway guide have mother be driven into small apparently impregnable fortress by father colossal ludicrous personality be there indeed one there at beleaguered garrison grimly holding out peter wandered on to terrace for minute of composing dusk quietness half expected to find silvia there felt little ill used that be not knew what be nature of interview with father peter must have welcomed warmth of applause at masterly conduct of in absence must read certainly placid communication from mother must hope be well must hope silvia be well must let be assumed that be well must certainly also say that be so sorry must not

affectionate mother maria mainwaring peter thrust remaining page into silvia hand waited till have come to end then looked at other in silence im going to laugh said peter at length please dont said silvia if do will cry peter tapped sheet lay in hand gorgeous said must laugh if did not from amusement though there be amusing thing from pleasure word in letter be true thats something to be pleased about whats more word in be right surprise wonder of there splendour about silvia shuffled sheet together giving back to leaned forehead on hand ah havent got tenderness said dont see bitter pathos of mother know say there be nothing pathetic about said thats just most pathetic thing of silvia said peter puzzled over moment understood silvia feeling well enough understood equally well with greater sympathy answer retort almost to if see nothing pathetic in situation quite agree with whats use of trying to introduce pathos asked pathos painted on like varnish cease to be pathos at becomes simply sentimentality silvia turned to like patient affectionate teacher to child who pretend only not to know lesson if absence of love in relationship like isnt pathetic said love be only sentimentality peter again saw precisely what meant knew too that what said be true knew that for did not realize with conviction with sense of illumination statement of be just instance more of silvia shining there aloft of confining cloudland thought of dealt stab of envy under hurt of spirit snapped snarled retired so to speak into kennel leaving mind outside to manage situation well then pathetic said have be pathetic so long that one have got used to know youre right what say hasnt practical bearing ah dear have said have practical bearing be up to practically to handle in hardness in in sort of ruthlessness can recognizing what say deal with tenderly by mean fact arent new leave out let consider father mother only there practical side of he got to be told at least suppose so there new pathos there theyve be aware of lovelessness for year if father take wounded pathetic pose will will just be pose frankly im on mother side by one big gesture have explained have made living comprehensible reality of bradshaws railway guide advertisement good lord know what have be about now there flesh blood in always respect flesh blood way of doing be outrage said silvia shes father wife after shes mother take mother side by mean weve got to take side in everything nobody can be neutral take side in manner of doing what have done sympathize with in letter too will show letter hostility of resentment peter sat still moment fingering leaf of letter not so much resentment said a repression have be hammered back into year oh understand better than have to happen way what else be to do must go to father say if cant put curb on egoism vanity if continue to be such bounder thats what bounder be really will have to leave want to score off peter said thats hardness ruthlessness arent hard darling who know that better than be sure im not said did not answer directly youve got to be gentle said peter finger closed on letter hesitated then tore sheet in half tore across yet again well shant see letter said be written to ive destroyed if when tell becomes melodramatic how can help being what call ruthless he so vain dont know how vain be will be brutal outrage attempted assassination of vanity wont injure dastardly blow will glance aside hell put extra bodyguard round vanity for future he ridiculous person silvia said peter in loud firm voice silvia gave sigh ah thats better said for youve torn letter up anyhow when said be ridiculous said dear a if be justifying rather than accusing oh said firmly loudly will mind if say too didnt say so spitefully now let be practical always used to be practical peter when be going to tell peter looked at watch that mean that if say that havent made up mind said will certainly let know that there be plenty of time to tell before dinner want to tell now thats where be call practical who be ever so practical a when come to point did not challenge that rather proceeded to justify peter opinion for dear can put off pleasant thing if like said because enjoy anticipation of where where be use of putting off unpleasant thing that only lengthens beastly anticipation hell make scene said peter hate scene there be nothing to reply to came under advisability have already expressed of not putting off unpleasantness so made reply soon for face of continued to push got up still wondering if must prefer to tell father how strongly wanted to do how more strongly refrained from doing have idea inclination that combated be simply to go straight to voluptuous state room will convinced sense of what be right of what be peter own duty development kept silent oh be sorry for said at length a turned to go into house dont forget to be sorry for peter only answer to be just perceptible shrug of shoulder comment on futility of sympathy walked away across crackling gravel silvia knew how peter mere presence stifled power of judgment with regard to often often have to cling desperately to mental integrity of own in order not to be washed away by mere tide of devotion to desire not only flesh blood of very spirit must always have surrendered to must have given up herself whole complete to what pleased to what made comfortable content happy somewhere between two apex of physical spiritual longing there came peak mental judicial apex so framed to herself thing solid reliable kind of bleak umpire gave inexorable decision already in fortnight of married life have several time asserted be will supposed clear eyed unbribable be a distinct from blindness of love a be from abandonment of physical desire peter have suggested for instance that must chuck work in foreign office be most notable of instance live just live now at howe now in london always with must travel must entertain must have plenty of interest to keep busy enough have urged have argued have appealed to for mere acquiescence willing not have steadily unshakably refused to give here to night be test for umpire of mind must have be infinitely easier for to tell mr mainwaring knew quite convincedly that must have proved far more sympathetic breaker of shocking tidings than peter must be peter must now on way to state room be framing adroit sentence be schooling anticipatory impatience at melodramatic reception of news by father into tolerance gentleness have a little temptation to be intolerant ungentle a have to be reverse must naturally have stood in attitude peter must find gymnastically difficult to maintain have got to do best not to let do so infinitely better took moment stiffening of herself to baffle inclination to follow peter shoulder mission for thought went back to mr mainwarings letter startling effect want of effect on peter have produced so found now when be no longer under spell of presence certain incredulous dismay arent like have assured now found saying cant be like appeared to have received intelligence with savage if not savage wholly unpitiful comment have seemed indeed seemed now to have applauded tragic sequel to year of resentful companionship have confessed to desire to laugh be ruthlessness might be that logical result of such year be that mr mainwaring given that retained independent identity of own must have be goaded into assertion of might in ultimate weighing of soul be better that must have cut knot like rather than have be strangled by be very well for peter to take side to take side competently included appreciation of what have suffered what have failed in anyone must form fair idea of what a exhibited now have suffered by smallest recognition of what must have be to be tied to present occupant of state room same exhibition showed exactly tragic failure in allowing to be driven into hermetical compartment where reached be contemplation of escape a shown by study of hotel peter turned over be root of matter a might turn over leaf of dull book only saw dramatic comedy in deserving of applause for fitness of exclamation serve right laughing well done mother couldnt deal with people like at rate whole world must become relentless machine always grinding always seeing others ground always being diverted at pitiless revolution of wheel compassion tenderness be quality just saved redeemed world from hell at least from being wounding comedy at human person must laugh for fear of cry instead silvia got up from seat where peter have read mother letter definitely desiring to avoid conclusion to thought be leading have wanted to laugh be certain must forget that probably have not meant be only incongruousness surprise like funny thing in church must not be in least funny elsewhere have made spasm peter assuredly be not like really loyalty of love derided for supposing be heart insisted on that love adored for being dressing bell have already sumptuously sounded from central turret still quite ignorant of what have be result of disclosure conscious of yearning anxiety to know went up to bedroom be not so much anxious to know how mr mainwaring be taking how took seemed to matter very little how peter have done part between dressing room bedroom be couple of bathroom heard with certain clinging to usualness of life splashing hissing of water coming from one of have happened there be peter having bath soon most likely must tap at door barefooted never must wear slipper a paddled about between room hers with blue silk dressing gown tied with tasselled cord about waist peter have wondrous ritual for bath have to immerse first of then stand on mat while soaped from head to foot then still slippery soapy in order to get cold heighten enjoyment of next immersion turned on more hot tap put spoonful after spoonful of verbena salt into water then got in again stewed in fragrant soup when be too hot to bear longer retired into small waterproof castle at end of bath turned on cold water douche squirt syrinx then without drying at put on famous blue silk dressing gown have hood to lit cigarette tapped at door to ascertain whether must sit finish cigarette there silvia by time knew precisely interpretation of splashing hissing of water must hurry up own dressing slow down so that must admit fresh from scrubbing soapings with glow of cold water on skin be paganly sensuous in enjoyment of physical condition of moment sitting by dressing table talked most amazing nonsense dried foot on tail of dressing gown rubbed hair on hood of there be scent of soap verbena cigarette more piercing to sense than firm skin cleansedness freshness of at such chattering undress sances be most of conscious of to exclusion of herself for whereas kiss caress united with have part in when came in thus rough haired bare legged wet footed with smooth shoulder emerging from dressing gown while enveloped in rubbed dry felt merely spectator of beautiful animal if came in now might might not knew that to night must be involved so to speak with character essence of a exhibited in such account a might give her of interview with father must come like cloud brightness must obstruct purely spectator like view of must not only be clean lithe animal for few minute must look at without passion without love without friendship even be absorbed in mere joy that there must be in world so young wild perfect creature there came knock usual inquiry entered while maid with chaste averted face rustled out not waiting to be dismissed through other door sat down in big low chair by dressing table oh simplest pleasure be so much best said just washing know just being hungry sleepy never enjoy play book joke nearly so much a bath food getting head well down into pillow hate sponge why must scrub nose with piece of dead seaweed listen a might with delicacy of divination that love have given to ear must find in voice inflection hesitation on other hand glibness a of lesson learned faultlessly repeated that showed that be speaking otherwise than completely naturally topic of bath dinner bed came to lip with quite spontaneous fluency a if have not in last hour be bearer to father of tragic situation one at least must wound vanity be so predominant passion in have mr mainwaring taken with same ruthlessness same cynical amusement a peter have appeared to silvia must not believe that must have be hurt be astounded why in pity name did not peter tell about interview must have known how longed to be told whether there be good bad to tell revolving brush covered with wash leather continued peter like small boxing glove must cover with soap work with foot sponge odious in texture dull in colour full of horrible dark hole probably contain pincer of defunct crab fin of dead fish oh by way quite forgot did really darling be thinking so much about substitute for sponge silvia must not doubt sincerity of have be thinking about sponge there be full statement of case with acknowledgment of mere physical presence mere glamour of radiant animalism after be part of essence charm captured again whisking away for moment possibility of criticism of wishing that must be other than be knew that misgiving amounted to must come flooding back just for moment be like remote line of low tide lying mile away across shining level oh peter cried if can design small revolving wash leather boxing glove to use for sponge ill promise to have made for must explain just how to work broke off about father said yes be just going to tell when interrupted about sponge plan said by way ill draw revolving boxing glove foot pedal below below mind water so that foot doesnt get cold of course hold socket of boxing glove wrist so to speak in hand go buzzing round a work with foot apply well soaped to face more dead seaweed lobster claw father now peter gathered up knee in arm sat there nursing dressing gown have fallen off shoulder looked like domesticated satyr wild with knowledge of woodland tamed to sojourn enforced voluntary in human habitation went to a told to do began silvia interrupted wanted to do justice dear went quite of own accord said never urged peter eyelid hovered fell raised again often often have silvia noticed that shade of gesture on nellies face never so struck have seen man do just that gesture seemed to imply acquiescence without consent well went anyhow said tapped on door a there be answer went in be standing in front of big italian mirror in well in attitude be intending to paint own portrait when have finished that daub of silvia leaned forward towards oh dont talk like said dont be ironical not that quite dont feel ironical peter turned on face of mild injured innocence be telling bald fact said balder better said told have read mother letter continued that there be news in have better know at once got to sit down got hold of hand then told just fact that have gone away peter shifted little further back in chair drew leg more closely towards so that chin rested on plateau of knee be not being ironical said be trying to tell precisely what happened made noise gurgle think must call asked who damned villain be with whom have gone to be quite bald seemed to to be unreal said that there wasnt damned villain that have gone just because felt must be free wanted to see letter told that have torn up then began throwing hair brush dress clothes into bag in order to start off look for asked where be when told that hadnt slightest idea accused of collusion with merely denied that said that letter be a great surprise to a be to peter threw away end of cigarette then began to guess why have gone now point of tearing up mother letter be that shouldnt wasnt darling silvia heard assent there be sickness of heart coming over something too subtle for to diagnose a yet so began to guess continued peter a tried to guess be sorry for really sorry understand silvia heart began to thrive again yes yes knew must be cried soon hit on reason said peter quietly there must only have be one reason so thought filled with utmost remorse have be too big for be what came to too great have not in exaltation of art be quite what said remembered limitation of of rest of have fainted before furnace of genius be fault hadnt made allowance for prodigious strain on for effect cumulative doubt of high pressure strode about room knocked over chair fierce antagonism to narrative blazed up in silvia have wanted fact here be have not allowed for baldness of presentation though have asked for ah dont talk like peter said youre not newspaper reporter peter gave reply at there sat with chin on knee quite silent if silvia chose to speak to like that be clear that must either go on draw back anyhow next word be with time that thus tacitly insisted on right resenting what have said there be within little focus of light breaking through from sunlit altitude that illumined justified protest good lord wasnt right wasnt sentiment towards father immeasurably ignoble compared to comprehension of love very fact own unavowable condemnation of be to say irritated if be like that there be use in continuing story silvia spoke first humanly must not bear silence in peter seemed to mock divinely must be ever so humble humble how love sanctified humility transformed into ineffable pride pushed back chair knelt by longed to unclasp brown lean hand enclosed in make embrace also that might annoy peter there be suggestion of claiming about did not want to claim dont know why spoke like said asked what happened be telling will forgive go on peter have never seemed so remote from a then in frantic telegraphy of spirit seemed to be sending love that wave of ether must bear there came response from in spite of answer never heard such nonsense said must be pretty pair if have to forgive how silly know to ask to forgive show do by going on said be clear to that what wanted be to know not father part in interview own whether liked not be going to be perfectly honest about when knocked over chair strode about repeated found out reason for mother going away began to be le sorry for enjoyed be tribute to impossible greatness from then onwards acted because be acting alternative be to tell that mother simply found egoism intolerable that wouldnt have done good so agreed with be best thing to do be in despair rather luxurious despair have to explode let enjoy so be use being sorry for longer silvia broke out again be love for peter spoke dear ought to have be million time sorrier cried if have be just simply broken hearted about must have be so much better cant see that can help feeling be shedding gleam on know what mean said im telling what happened be le sorry for when began to console suppose im made like silvia bit lip indeed be not said youre making out to be hard unloving at moment clang of dinner bell from turret just above silvia room broke in whole neighbourhood must know when family at howe be warned that be time to dress three quarter of hour later be time to dine peter on first evening have spent here with silvia have asked whether like court circular such publicity need be given to domestic affair silvia confessing sentimental have told that father have delighted in installation of sonorous announcement brazen proclamation hurt nobody daddy liked certainly served purpose now peter jumped up lord there dinner said havent begun to dress father by way want to dine upstairs will tell a be so much more advanced than to send up dinner must fly peter stood for moment looking at if situation between have not actually laid hold of have thrown shadow over wanted to get out into sunlight again ah darling said with blend of envy of admiration somewhere gushing up envy at immense nobility must think of other word for admiration at shrine of love rose from ground of heart be so beautiful edifice despaired of being worthy of at time so confessed to wearied of white stainless purity somehow evening there seemed to have opened little crack on soaring vault must mend somehow give kiss then said chapter xi peter though often hung veil over real working process of mind for benefit admiration of others before whom be anxious to present charming appearance be honest with found during next fortnight without desire to dissimulate that be distinctly grateful to silvia insistence that must not resign place in foreign office for in present condition environment at howe be certainly preferable to spend solidity of day in london rather than enjoy uninterrupted leisure at home even then evening be full of crash crisis intolerable ludicrousness father who still majestically occupied state room showed indication of vacating moved along peak summit of ridiculous son really believed have never before be trodden by foot of man that be enjoying immensely peter made doubt whatever living a did on height of egoism free to indulge in most extravagant exhibition of standard victoriously raised principle determination announced with magnificent gesture once if not more during evening be that must remain rock like immovable fulfilling destiny of own supreme will bomb fate might choose to drop on that whole soul be bitter with remorse for failing failure did not deny must not have isolated a have done in supernal realm of art must have remembered that be man a well a artist have wife a well a celestial mistress of soul ought to have be kinder more tender more indulgent to frailty weakness of carissima remorse so waved standard if be genuine article must express not in idle repinings in manful facing of consequence of past error remorse right kind of remorse did not weaken strengthened man to go forward must not lose touch with joy of life must not get from severe spanking remorse gave only smarting humiliation of flesh must draw lesson from punishment proceed more tenderly not le sublimely than before must not be supposed that mr mainwaring used such expression a spanking in actual speech that ironical account of sublimity a given above be verbally such anyhow be manner in great tirade delivered to peter when went up to see father on daily arrival at hour so before dinner impressed on mind usually there be note for on table in hall ran something like peter be very low despondent to night know if can face sociable evening come up to see dear for be only link be left to of happy far too happy year see if sweet spirit will not like david playing before saul exorcise demon of remorse regret shriek gibber round head of unhappy father have tried so hard ah so hard day not to make burden shadow to dear one fear have acquitted very ill come cheer up peter peter to do justice always went in majesty of egoism father without encouragement at must talk into splendid courage at cost to at effort from worn debilitated nerve string must show that there be music yet left in must twang mental guitar if frayed string snapped well lawyer must know that affair be in order then sooner later to peter great relief sonorous dressing bell must ring must go have bath a likely a not before definitely quitted room father must allude to magnificent port formed so admirable feature in cellar of howe usually after bath went in to see silvia for reason other spontaneous nonsense of interview have wilted withered silvia so seemed to held in reserve waiting for something from peter must give account of day of talk with father still silvia seemed to wait be overbrimming with that ever have for to perception what waited for be for to turn winch of sluice once there have be really outrageous scene with father in after tear mr mainwaring have slid from chair with groan lay ignoble heap upon floor peter on occasion have given silvia perfectly colourless prcis of degrading exhibition have endorsed brought collateral evidence to bear on nature by production of one of note usually awaited on return from town have done that in sort of self justification silvia must not fail to realize how trying from very unreality such scene be for gave also evening very respectable specimen of patience with father yet felt that silvia be not waiting for that be not how behaved how patient cordial schooled to be that waited for be patient be cordial though often gave little sympathetic appreciative word for reward be no more than sugar plum to child something to keep quiet what wanted what longed for evidence of be internal loving driving force turned wheel of machinery of impeccable conduct that have not got for spun wheel with clever finger from outside usually wheel went round merrily enough reported father despondence ever so lightly alluded to fact that have cheered up estimate be justified for mr mainwaring on crashing of dinner bell in turret must sometimes announce progress from state room by jubilant yodelling must remain for greater part of dinner in state of high elation true must have spasm now then if happened to have attention called to mr wardours pearl might for brief dramatic moment cover eye say in choked voice carissima have wonderful pearl then true to manly determination must dismiss miserable association become master of soul again peter usually have second dose of father promethean attitude later in evening after silvia mother have gone upstairs treasure pearl of great price angel must ejaculate sweet pity divine compassion be who reconcile to life must not bask too long in healing effulgence must get back to london must reinstate in desolate house face face must stand on own foot again poor sordid cripple be then perhaps if quite overcome must bury face in hand much more usually must stand up throw out chest breathe deeply draw up to last half inch of considerable stature work said work be tonic that god put in reach of of remember that peter if grief sorrow ever visit then have by side sweetest most sympathetic woman ever sent to enlighten gloom of transitory world so have by god so have did not recognize preciousness fragility enough silvia did notice exquisite love towards at dinner to day when for moment sight of mr wardours pearl unmanned peter on occasion be lashed to extremity of irritation dont think did said only remember that instantly asked if must have more pheasant tried to do better than certainly there be use in saying that sort of thing looked at father added hastily felt what be feeling be that father clasped hand divine beam came to said message of consolation made live again surely saw effect on peter at such moment longed for wet wood wanted to be by at rate with someone who must understand enjoy stupendous farce if only nellie for instance have be sitting there with how must eye have telegraphed mental ecstasy silvia at same moment must not have served purpose might see how ridiculous father be being below perception of might easily have made telegraph smile to there must have be huge unspeakable tenderness when wanted answering perception of farce must have spoiled that universal embracing compassion required salting before now have seen communicated to sense of father absurdity now when turned trouble into empty arena for posturing sense of comedy completely failed if still possessed peter must not get at with flare of intuition guessed that might be unlocked to if only must use right key to key be compassion be for whom waited to thrust into ward if only loved must laugh at anything together without that gate be locked well if be locked must enjoy imperfect vision of what lay within yes saw effect on said trying to imagine that nellie be here enthralled wide eyed amused very much immediately afterwards by making that lovely sea sick passenger out of orange perfectly screaming father thrust hand through hair stood up like glorious grey mane yes yes said made effort wont peter will not lose sight of dear gaiety of life god know what cost even after little thing like be more than ever plunged in gulf of despondency know how wrong be must never relax effort mustnt give time to think work laughter divine twin poured out glass of whisky soda chose cigar with proper care word two on practical affair said before go to lonely wakeful bed will be here understand till early in december by then trust insist indeed on thus trusting that will have schooled to face desolation of home what once be home again may do think ask to remain here till then look upon beautiful howe a hospital soon still maimed still limping still in blue uniform of pain know must indeed insist on face world again make best of shattered existence till then silvia whom consulted with regard to matter told that be master of howe suggested speaking to about peter saw opportunity father be true be odious infliction of evening there be something to be gained by own eager tolerance of quite outweighed inconvenience must do more than tolerate must welcome silvia here be point must know how splendidly have risen to before answered made remember what intonation of cordiality sounded like be perfectly charming of said lovely that suggestion came from may be away for day two in november peter did not quite know what arrangement be to suggest about such day when silvia must be away for instance on visit to nellie be spared trouble of formulating one by father who gave great gesticulation admirably expressive of courage will go home home for day said will with set teeth firm mouth begin to grow accustomed to desolation loneliness will learn to bear taking in long draught inestimable tonic of work peter peter voice shook when will carissima come back to be unmanned only for moment mastery of returned to be ever stricken man so blessed by love of child exclaimed god bless peter be going to bed abruptness of benediction convinced peter that father have got what wanted have more use for night went along corridor to room silvia first impulse be to tell how cordially for part have welcomed father suggestion second wiser one be to say nothing about mr mainwaring be sure to make most of to might even attribute to that force from inside turned wheel yes silvia must learn about like that let very quietly into room undressed went to bed without going in to say good night to if went in to see be more than likely that must ask whether father have alluded to question of remaining with wanted information concerning to be conveyed to by one who must give peter felt sure florid testimonial for cordiality have passed moreover monotonous fatiguing evening wanted not to talk at to sleep father have be slightly more dreadful than usual mr wardour have more than ever be non existent silvia so struck have be waiting have be watching not need hardly be said with fixed eye stealthy glance with steady psychical alertness be incessantly poised on without looking at without talking to talking at have felt evening perhaps have be most fatiguing part of that have scarcely be conscious of anyone else though eye be on card ruefully bemoaned that goddess of piquet whom jointly invoked with peter father have be so niggardly in favour towards herself have be no more than automaton be thus victimized to extent of three lost game including rubicon peter a curled up in bed let mind stray drowsily over such detail of evening coming back always to impression of silvia watching whenever spoke to of father watched seldom with eye in just manner by aid of quick perception felt rather than reasoned peter have be sure arrived at what watched for then watched for token listened for inflection that indicated tenderness sympathy affection towards father must not have be watching for such token a for herself for gave knew be hers have never felt more certain about anything in dim vague region of sentiment desire than wanted something more than gave certain impatience gained on what after have be own first word to when asked to marry have not face flamed with light of beacon welcomed a whispered that asked be to be allowed to love at time have seemed to divine intuition one in word precisely defined way of love there came at door of bedroom led to room lightest most barely audible of touch be scarcely sure whether have heard not did not reply for be imaginary needed answer be silvia come to see whether be in room yet in case even more answer must be withheld for after evening of strain high pressure wanted be to be let alone to go to sleep underneath eyelid not quite closed watched door be opposite bed be dimly visible in glimmer of starshine came in through open uncurtained window round edge of door though have heard click of turned handle there came thin l of light broadened until in shaft of appeared silvia held lighted candle screened from bed with hand finger of close to flame be of warm transparent crimson apparently clothes tumbled together on chair first caught notice from looked straight towards bed face be vividly illuminated when saw lying there with shut eye radiant ineffable tenderness came like dawn over never have seen so selfless wonderful beam might have be discarnate spirit permitted to look upon who have be love of earthly heart that then be how regarded when thought be unobserved by meant that to next moment round half open door light narrowed disappeared be left again in glimmering dusk never have seen with such certainty directness what silvia be have thought be asleep so must let free very soul by day night have come to quite like other emotion amusement interest sympathy desire passion even have concealed rather than revealed have be web veil across sanctuary illumined indeed by light burned there still hiding now for one moment peter have seen with veil drawn aside holy place of love be light of be sitting next afternoon in room at foreign office rather harassed by necessity of

im awfully glad said what say too make more delightful of to stop up in town to night instead of going back to though up till now have fitted into other with old familiar smoothness appeared now when got near in conversation to what have happened to of not so still felt altering putting into new case that there be fresh ground to be broken hitherto have only picked way over old ground nellie felt even more imperatively than have got to run plough so why not at once on admirable opportunity through unturned land peter servant have already appeared in doorway announcing motor have noticed that peter have not concluded from that that easy a intercourse have up till now be be feeling pre occupation hesitation in answering last acknowledgment of amiability in remaining in town instead of going

youre talking language can understand always did quarrelled wrangled be on same plane so be now thank heaven said time gave news know pre occupation be that held peter seemed to shake free of yes ive got news all right said domestic tragedy oh dear what asked nothing awful seemed to know for certain that be figuring in mind something about silvia so in upshot sequel development be tested so to speak over domestic tragedy mother have run away from home began nellie did not laugh only bit tongue with firm purpose dear peter said when released have simply gone said round about ten day ago when father arrived to study first cartoon with view to rest of series mr wardour bought by way gracious what lot have got to talk about never mind cartoon said nellie with thrilled interest get on with

home mean must find have gone dryad gay conscienceless nellie must not in spite of improved mind quite contain mother asked at age how absolutely wonderful of do know who be peter tried not to laugh completely failed in dutiful endeavour must follow lead two drawing psychically nearer to other moment abandoned just for natural relief to irrepressible mirth be such damned fool nellie said at length do listen dont be funny quite different pologies said rather shakily wasnt anything so romantic be just a human said peter know how mother be hammered into that phrase came in letter by way not original never guessed there be anything to hammer said nellie did at least only half guessed there be breaking point came couldnt stick father longer have just gone away do remember how used always

devotion to art sort of thing be too much for reproach bitterly oh dear how enjoys with having failed to realize frailty not moral weakness ordinariness of other people be scorched in magnificent flame escaped from furnace with life how lovely for said nellie lovely for too why tragedy said be tragedy whole body gave jubilant jerk if have be standing up must have jumped ah do see that dont cried just rejoice in at least must nellie divined perfectly well that if silvia understood really completed sentence if peter wished for present anyhow to leave unspoken loyalty to comradeship prevented from suggesting motive not le potent than dictated silence on point for infinitely preferred that must volunteer such information concerning silvia than must give away knowledge of certainly longed to know in what real relation silvia stood to other must be tactical error tactical be too businesslike to let know that incomplete sentence gave so certain hint see said quickly must rejoice in if wasnt for father until two ultimate word of be spoken peter eye have be bright expectant evidently waited for termination have refused to utter when sentence be complete saw unmistakably again that eye accepted acquiesced in conclusion quite said in level voice so for present father be consumed with remorse be occupying state room youve never seen gorgeous tapestry lincrusta walton ceiling till come up to town be painting away at series of cartoon peter poured out second cup of coffee from tray have be left between hour more before aunt joanna said never heard plot saw person shes

together when uncle john uncle abe uncle abe asked nellie in awed voice yes sir abel darley kbe husband to aunt joanna dont interrupt when uncle john uncle abe aunt eleanor aunt joanna have gone not staggering at full up to bed must have such holy convocation about nellie have inferred little more information about silvia by time what occupied most be not what be inferring about anybody be quite enough for to realize that for duration anyhow of first act of play have meant to see be in old full enjoyment of peter again have stepped back into candour closeness of friendship though have not a have confessed that be having holiday be transparently clear that be case just there candour be clouded guessed that even a be having holiday from philip god bless so peter be having holiday from silvia only here be difference did not must not own up to even in projected scheme of christmas hilariousness at uncle aunt silvia did not appear a ever so faintly ridiculous a ever so faintly partaking in midnight merriment throughout talk peter have kept hermetically apart once twice nellie conjectured have pointedly enough refrained from introducing must visualize rest of down at howe part to peter silvia played be mysteriously shrouded when be laughing at everybody round why must except one person from compliment of amused criticism be clear that silvia have applause for comedy of peter parent for have so cordially welcomed nellies appreciation of what then be silvia line what be relation above to peter decided not to burn boat to set fire to just little one wont silvia enjoy too asked cant tell said peter if there be lapse of loyalty there if in minor degree there be sense conveyed of disappointment though of accepting disappointment without comment nellie decided that peter be not intending to enlarge on still after small burned boat clung to chance of peter volunteering information clearly must not get just now heavy booming of quarter from clock gave excellent opportunity of abandoning that after have never be discussion on own initiative good gracious quarter to nine said wretch peter weve missed one act if not two let miss said have evening made pause only for moment peter have consistently shied away from that one topic wanted to hear about break of sort be much more likely to produce in pressure must eventually go pop than if remained just sizzling here absolutely must go said philip will ask about play couldnt tell that simply sat talking till be over why not said peter because isnt done dear have signed on to conventionality of life come along bore there be besides how must account for evening to silvia dining at seven know that requires theatrical explanation oh dont be vulgar said peter a if silvia wouldnt delight in spending evening with know said dont lose sense of humour peter be mild kind of joke come on then said a for being fault be so late second act be drawing to end when stole into box on stage there be proceeding most elementary of muddle to be not in least worth while to devote ingenuity be clear at first glance that people who pretended to be servant be really landed gentry just before end earl who have taken house must propose to cook be violently accepted psychologically presented point of interest far more engrossing to be fact that have got peter with pleasure of general problem propounded be far more absorbing marriage have certainly quickened emotional perception inferred from extraordinary delight that be to be with again how much in interval have missed have reason to complain of welcome have given be manifest how must not definitely have said that quality of be different from hers to to sense a have openly stated have taken up old attitude old intimacy without break a thought over that in few minute elapsed before act be finished found that for part did not altogether endorse view certainly old intimacy be there firm unshaken somehow hovering over like mist to eye seemed to be luminous with tear there be new atmospheric condition sunny tremulous peter turned to a house sprang into light again oh what waste of time said must have done much better to have left elbow on table be always doing too do remember last play at met that time be with philip with silvia mr wardour then have talk afterwards to night have first like other plan best though peter have here stated several thing with be in cordial agreement tone be not in tune with old footing old intimacy not many minute ago have be who in opposition to inclination have insisted on breaking tte tte now with possible lightness of touch suggested resumption ive seen enough said can tell philip about let go back dear have half hour more talk be fault that broke up how must have told that play must have be a silly a will talk more sense in five minute than theyll put into whole of next act peter eye be wandering round house at moment be attracted by feather fan violently signalling from box directly opposite general buzz of theatre be quite distinctly pierced with shrill scream of laughter came from precisely same direction a gesticulating fan be hardly necessary to put up glass to ascertain authorship of phenomenon mr trentham said unerringly with usual myrmidon have seen nellie come round be conventional oh why said if want to see can come here cant doesnt want to see only want to be seen felt that at moment be becoming to peter part of general foreground prominent object in still only part of next word confirmed impression oh come along said let embark on ordinary ridiculous evening let go back to supper with perhaps there dance going on come round forage nellie ive be in country for month know besides knew perfectly well what have left unsaid answered what doe matter how much talk asked peter gave glance of brilliant surprise how did know that be what didnt say demanded because of course if like because fan waved more vehemently than ever wed better go said nellie got up in old day must almost certainly have be able to superimpose wish over now be other way about seemed to be in grip of internal necessity of doing what wanted have to have way not because have become stronger of will because have lost power of self assertion with regard to be not general debility of will on part have way with philip for instance with effortless ease then be not part only of foreground to philip to be peter part only of foreground chapter xii peter managed to get away from foreign office next day in absence of anything to detain hour so before usual time arriving at gilded gate of battlemented lodge of howe while warm october twilight still lingered in sky got out to walk across mile of park separated from house truant evening in town last night plunge into froth noise chatter have quieted sort of restlessness have assuaged sort of hunger be still licking chop of memory content in few minute now to wipe mouth go journey again just have sense of having enjoyed evening out of having lolled in old familiar tap room with usual habitus over pot of beer while friendly barmaid be mr trentham made usual joke over counter a served of seemed to have sounded better by electric light so to speak than did timbre of memory in dusky crimson of dying day recalled welcome of scream shriek have given to nellie when at insistence have visited in box opposite threatened when learned have already dined alone appearing so very late at play to send anonymous letter to silvia philip there be judge in divorce court added who be much devoted to must doubt give admission for two case when came on robust wit of lord poole have ably seconded then with exception of nellie who have to go home to put end to philip solitary evening have gone back to wardour house where peter promised sort of scratch supper nellie finding that husband have already gone to bed joined again have be altogether pleasant ridiculous evening have made in impromptu accidental manner ordinary human evening just twice there have for peter be slight check signal momentarily against once when found that nellie have left again very soon after reappearance at supper without word to once when without warning have entered mind that at just about time night before have seen bedroom door open silvia face look in on a lay with closed eyelid feigning sleep be rather dreadful thing to have done paused moment on bridge crossed lake looking at image of house duskily reflected on far margin there be someone coming towards along path led by edge of lake joined road here before eye have time to tell who be waved hand at without scream without violent gesticulation by mr trentham night before have made known quickened pace a answered signal in three minute more have joined chauffeur told have walked from lodge said so came to meet youre early peter kissed ill go away again will said a youve come can stop said what did do with last night not alone hope found somebody peter smiled at

one awful fun talked smoked laughed until everyone melted away saw loved to see brightness briskness of heard loved to hear cheerfulness alacrity oh be glad have nice evening said nearly telephoned to say be coming up to keep company then thought have better stop try to make disagreeable at home did succeed darling asked peter exactly then struck silvia that if peter have dined have sat so long with elbow on table have got to theatre in time for anything at must not have be detained very late at foreign office instantly drew down with rush rattle mental blind in front of shut out did not choose to see pretty well said went to bed at ten anyhow be early for so must have be fairly successful not proved said peter may have be sleepy sleepy place know know said two night ago came looked into room a have not heard come to bed there be fast asleep snoring suppose youll tell said point about detention at foreign office with time yet to dine confabulate go to theatre have struck too have meant to be assumed that have telephoned to signify knowledge that must be detained now by stupid inadvertence in giving account of evening have shown for who cared to think that have not be detained silvia apparently have quite missed that must surely have said something to effect a be have passed by be out of sight by now behind well misunderstanding proceeded to put further corner between consciousness dont say snoring said oh peter father have told how delightful how angelic be to about stopping on here till go back to london touched very much took arm touched too dear said must tell that furnished reason one out of several why came to meet ive got confession peter guessed what reason be what confession when made plan be quite accustomed to find work out a have meant now in very apex of success felt ashamed of if came to confession must make contribution interrupted dont care about reason said tell other one instead other one will come afterwards said if want to hear then have got to come first so dont interrupt darling will tell affair of conscience im conscientious objector said a became more more certain in mind what silvia confession be le wanted to hear though patting own back for cleverness have contrived plan of be logical sequel when did that have not yet pretended to be asleep one night on telephoned detention in town silvia went on with gentle perfectly determined firmness ive misjudged altogether peter said ive got to confess for day now more day than like to number have be watching looking for something missed in thought be unkind sarcastic cynical about father what told of manner in welcomed proposal to stop on here convinced how utterly have be wronging be owlishly stupid of to suppose must be like what be worse be brutally unloving peter laughed more big word coming asked owlish stupid brutal unloving thats over have murdered anybody shook head use making light of said be stupid be unloving of thought that because saw certain absurdity unreality about father saw nothing be impatient untender with do forgive for being such fool peter tried to imagine telling that have be perfectly right throughout that only piece of trickery on part in getting father to give account of welcome proposition have met with have deluded into thinking be wrong vanity thought of sorry figure must present made quite impossible to contemplate so fundamental honesty short of being honest have better be superb stopped facing knowing well effect physical presence have on darling there one thing dont forgive for said be for being such fool a to think there be anything for to forgive even a made neat phrase truth of came home to there be indeed nothing for to forgive gave long sigh oh must teach to be generous said peter felt unutterably mean at moment thing be done have be superb a well a dishonest if honesty have be too high for vanity to attain to be just a incapable of demolishing golden image of that have set up for silvia then there be point concerning apparent slumber two night ago there be point concerning telephone last night wished intensely that hadnt asked to teach generosity now for other reason why came to meet said there must be balsam food for vanity here have grace to recognize that even while asked because wanted to see said like reason have more of brand knew that word took lightly what be so immense must after confession cause to smile be of specie have thought cynical now knew be just everyday garb in affection tenderness clothed because seemed so long since saw said oh peter there only one reason really matter because love that brought home to meanness dishonesty against rest be feather in scale weighted on other side with world often before now have known how unintelligibly great that be now for first time be irritated at for want of comprehension with regard to be accustomed to understand thing to gave mind here mind be brought to dead stop by great shining wall be unscalable impenetrable to be honest be irritation quite confined to did that shining wall from very incomprehensibility provoke portion of silvia seemed to herself to miss something in silence with peter there nothing must really be missing how often say that whispered how often feel that there nothing else worth saying more of brand said not drop must go in havent seen father yet after must have bath after must send maid away so that can get few minute sensible conversation said peter ill begin now said sometimes know bath go to head youre not quite a serious a might be say im drunk have done with

found know perfectly well that be sort of night out saw friend have beano silvia kept finger on cord of blind have chosen to pull down in mind refused with sublime intellectual dishonesty to look at fact that peter certainly must have come down here by dinner time if have time to dine early in town must not see already so told have once fallen into owlishly stupid error worse by doubting by watching now at least must repair to extent by supreme honesty of trusting without question something have happened to keep in town be business of hers to think of at have said be detained at foreign office for be detained there held eye open to intensest light of be that of own love more blinded to everything else better be only creature like bat owl thing of night be blinded by dayspring enjoyed have beano repeated why not say so peter hesitated for reason that have refused to entertain existence of fact now shiningly clear that silvia have never so remotely seen that must easily have got down here in time for dinner made unintelligibly unreasonably needful for to tell so there be something sordid in not doing so have shown smallest suspicion of must probably have explained away in ingenious manner yes enjoyed said that be why did must easily have got down here in time for dinner up went blind at with snap whirr silvia face beaming delighted smiled out at oh peter how lovely of to tell cried of course guessed only wouldnt guess there just joy of came from like stroke of bird wing that bore through sunny air with stroke returned to now youve got excuse for refusing beautiful plan said be nice of not to tell at once knew have to time be better for keeping dear there dressing bell just go see father for minute can talk to in smoking room after mother have gone to bed a silvia heard through bedroom door splashing rinsing gurglings regulated own speed of dressing be absorbed in perception of one thing be great myriad manifestation up trunk of tree through branch to remotest end of twig flowed sap firmness of trunk vigour of branch elasticity of twig decoration of flower leaf fruit made tree lovely be manifestation embodiment of sap if there be wound in bark sap healed if there be nest among bough external loveliness of life visited be still sap have fashioned anchorage remotest leaf of tower of forest greenery be nurtured by being beauty sprang from there be nothing big little if looked at in way though just now have decided that only one thing be big rest be little then came rare unusual splash occasionally when peter began to stand up in bath after hot soaking fell down foot slipped on smooth surface made rare enormous splash always caused certain anxiety might hit head against edge of bath just tap at bathroom door wilton said ask if mr mainwaring be all right before chaste wilton must get a far a door new splashing began doesnt matter wilton said pearl maam asked wilton then came tap at door wilton slid out of picture fell down said peter

wonderfully clumsy said a finger warm soft from bath touched back of neck be down before next morning to give breakfast waiting for strolled out on to terrace there have be one of exquisite early october frost in air be that ineffable fragrance derived from absence of smell odourless odour of frosted dew sun be already warm with promise of hot cloudless day a heat have not set in motion weaving of scent of earth grass flower must soon decorate veil virginal beauty of morning last night when peter have lingered here in end of twilight air be not le clear windless have be charged with myriad scent distilled by hot hour of autumn sun now there be precision crystalline quality such sort of clear sparkle bathed spirit also love basked in such virginal beauty of young day flamelike scentless evening before from time when met peter by lake body soul spirit have be rising towards new peak of passion true topmost summit seemed to now to be where stood in cool brightness able to see that upward path led here be below have dined after peter have clasped necklace for there have be usual piquet for mr mainwaring for latter triumphant pan of achievement over effect of lightning in second cartoon positively a stood aside a artist became spectator appalled before settled down to card must need conduct to masterpiece in question let also feel cold clutch of fear mr mainwaring did said mother be peter whom in rising tide of flame surrender silvia watched no longer looking for sign of tenderness affection owlish have missed in rapturous contemplation of often have seen charming

with divinely natural have sat next mr wardour on sofa a piquet be in progress entertained with ludicrous hopelessly recognizable caricature of father over card have held skein of wool have mixed hot water lemon juice for thing have often done before be trivial enough be same with father looking over hand when so bidden dutifully observing exactly how to play that puzzling game eager to anticipate want chaffing sometimes behaving to again be wrong word being to rather that own sonship implied fulfilling in word gesture welcome have given to suggestion of remaining with till went to london be world side anyone might see behind in light dark undreamed of be that other aspect reality of be hers alone be already in bed when heard after smoking room chat with father come into room presently after tapping on door looked in coatless shoeless pretended in parody of what happened two night before to be asleep between eyelid nearly closed saw broad smile overspread face dont believe single word of remarked be meant silvia now a waited for looked at looked down on even from crowning pinnacle a on upward ultimate slope even a in cool scentless air of morning miracle of sunshine on windless world be more than when beam have drawn that response of fragrance from living thing so shone for untroubled with passion desire essence of love in own crystal globe not le precious now that be conveyed to in material manifestation must be bodily presence of through whom essence be conveyed to who embodied love to mortal sense for ever far more precious be now that in pause of content crowned passion with royal diadem must for moment see that in loving loved not alone love moved sun other star being gave duration of moment in silvia reached that point not theoretically a felt experienced reality be infinitesimal just a in significance be infinite at sound of peter step on bare board of dining room just within atmosphere of summit where stood grew laden fragrant with scent of world did not come down from did not rise up above be there still be there in body a well a in spirit fragrance of material sweetness be near even a when now stepped back into dining room waft of rose scent from sun warmed wall smothered nostril peter be poking about among dish on side table gave grunt neither more le in answer to salutation held that to be in good spirit at breakfast time be symptom must not be taken too seriously by test there be nothing wrong with morning sat down with ill used sigh ive got headache remarked oh im sorry said where in left ankle of course said silvia passing behind just tweaked short hair at back of neck oh dont finger said peter angrily gave so quick glance that must scarcely tell whether have actually looked at not went on without pause without hurry clinking out word like newly minted coin separate crisply cut hot just let alone sometimes said know how hate dabbing pressing grasping youre limit know have got stiff staring still without pause in precisely same voice went on dont let have to speak to like again said dont be so owlish confess that youve fallen into trap still stood staring took one step towards flung arm close round neck pressing face to then more directly finding claiming mouth utterly divine girl said never dreamed must take in did kiss three time to signify yes three time more to signify that be darling once

smell of damp fruitful earth by now silvia must laugh at about fierce phantom moment for never have peter seemed more utterly hers usually in early half hour be rather silent rather morose to day penitent perhaps consolatory for fright be le that have unwittingly given there be something of bath intoxication about if be in sense devoted wife said must drive up with deposit at fo then wait three hour for in motor till lunch time must give hour then after must wait four hour more drive back with therefore will woman leave father mother cleave to husband yes of course ill come said if want to must just say really want took hold of elbow from behind ran along terrace motor bike observed im pushing till get sense of humour working on own account working swear working shrieked silvia

at hour of morning afternoon next day perhaps be rather fussy to consult physician over cold really there never have be cold dr symes gave cabalistic slip of paper being duly interpreted proved to be marvellous tonic stuff when have felt pulse looked at tongue tapped on stomach made knee jump in curious manner even more probably told that have constitution of armadillo roared out of room for wasting time with week of uncle aunt ahead even though nellie be to partake in secret joy of peter felt must like robust reassurance of sort on other hand since there never be such cold speculation a drove to welbeck street next morning be cut short by arrival internment in waiting room there be several person there reading illustrated paper with sad face who looked up when entered thereafter

same isolation a through closed car window looked out on snow slushy street what have just learned wanted to assimilate before in sense studied to do that have first to wipe off sheer surprise stood like condensed vapour on glass of astounding picture have just be presented to again again have to wipe away before must get clear vision of fact that silvia knew that be with child have not told when

just same a in drawing room isnt green drawing room please said peter beg pardon said granted im sure said without smile nellie tried handful of other topic curiosity to know what be matter vastly increased have narrowed down field of conjecture to certainty whatever be concerned host hostess yesterday at lunch when have be alone with silvia have first impression of yet have seen peter same evening in town by way of nursing cold have come to theatre with in spite of affliction have be immensely cheerful chuckling with prophetic delight at feast that uncle aunt must spread for have not seen silvia since for have already left london until entry into green drawing room hour ago must much have preferred a on that evening month ago when dined alone together in london have be so pointedly reticent on subject of silvia that must volunteer statement reticence then seemed of totally different quality from what be now tried one more topic peter dear isnt lovely said im going to have baby peter jerked upright in chair really said here be telling that broke off whats matter dear said there something wrong got up drove with foot into log fire really screamingly funny that must tell that said nellie felt that be getting near now funny asked oh lord said funny didnt said got up too laying hand on shoulder dear be very old friend said turned round to with unspoken bitterness souring in eye then ill let have joke said tell that yet wife who know same thing about have not told paused moment found out by accident morning said went to see dr symes about cold odd that must

nellie heard give ejaculation now youre fond of psychological problem said also youre woman know how woman feel under what circumstance feeling how in fact must woman do that interesting point isnt beyond quarrel misunderstanding nothing of sort none ive felt be watching sometimes ive well can describe that asked ive only thought of minute said now dont really see connexion when father knew mother have gone be posing posturing a lost stricken man silvia be watching to see think if have real sympathy real pity for did feel then a if be being tested made that right did cleverly gave most cordial welcome to stopping on here lord what evening be for endless week left to tell about be quite sure made right asked told have be wrong told have misjudged when thought feelingless said even if made reservation reconsidered what then nellies hand still rested now with pressure on shoulder what if silvia put so to speak in father place said what if occurred to that have be charming with clever with mind thats only guess again peter thrust log together trust too much said at length love too much time nellie be silent well said at length think youve be clever with charming with said thats think that be quite wrong in keeping news from thats why silvia isnt like must remember may be complicated clever in way shes not like there something tremendous about simplicity splendour just when be beginning to realize to adore doe cant forgive said felt then a perhaps never before charm of egoism really be such charming fellow be egoistic about dear just because a say be beginning to realize to adore that feel cant forgive must forgive easily enough if didnt care put in place assume a feel sure be right in assuming that have got at reason for not telling be exactly what woman of simplicity splendour must do with there be of love charming way of showing said peter youre hurt youre smarting said otherwise wouldnt say that have spoiled everything exclaimed peter just when through talk nellie have be conscious of dual stirring not only in be clear enough in not many week ago must certainly have have whole sympathy enlisted on side must have fanned secretly stealthily doubt flame of resentment against silvia with same hidden action have insinuated into mind that there be somebody who be eager to console to help to forget one who gave welcome even now breath of woodland irresponsibility morality of dryad satyr swept over with whispering of wild thing stirring in bush like sought like there deriding consequence to others must twang that string let wind blow on harp in tree knew well that something must answer be hurt sore there be woodland balm something within again jerked back finger hovered over string ready to pluck turned hand into shield instead that prevented wind from making harp vibrate silvia have harp too have begun ever so faintly to vibrate in answer to silvia harp not to hers in second impulse there be compassion for silvia there be motherhood made choice cant say that spoiled dear said know how loved when asked to marry peter have frown for thought began know what thought silvia very likely told that wanted just to be allowed never told that said quickly of course didnt wasnt clear that before married loved a boy love with tempestuous desire of possession shes got said isnt a if there be anyone else know know that for certain nothing of kind revolt revolt asked oh dear short of wouldnt have told what have known for two day suspected long before must be quite wrong to think that love le what dont see especially beyond be silvia have become perfectly changed person keep splendour keep good heaven must think did what learned other day quite change have become woman must have not just man to love man to love youve hinted that shes on way to get one thats sum of consolation ive got for nellie having determined having chosen be being magnificent just then time dryad within scolded derided fool conventionalist dryad shrieked might be yours he a weak a water vain vain want wait few month see how want idiot nellie heard that a plainly a heard whistle of wind in chimney wont be easy said youve got to get out of peter thing by way that ive never succeeded in doing when youve got out of youve got to convince that youve got into wouldnt bet on chance have be brute asked nellie hesitated have never yet realized how close to love have be intimacy with peter how far from love own marriage bond now when bitterly resenting what silvia have done turned to peter in silence repeated question brute asked now voice shook took hand briskly off shoulder have stood there like comrade friend for ten minute now finger have dwelt on shoulder bone muscle of not brute at said couldnt be brute darling liar cheat have said peter walked round room after with whistle for kick for footstool got in way dont help said whats to be done somehow at absence of resentment at what have said at appeal to for help old delightful level of comradeship smoothed out tell that know suggested nellie do nicely couldnt possibly do nicely confound considered if cant do nicely will only make worse conceded what then wait for to tell demanded peter yes for just to know wont come to oh absurd people will tell that know peter thought over becoming comic said presently thats silliest thing youve said yet perhaps isnt comic dear know isnt thats ferocious flippancy gravedigger isnt comic for silvia added spasm of woodland died away again hasnt told said peter hopelessly cant get over youve got to get over otherwise there nothing ahead shes got to get over more than that worst of returned speak a if hadnt given have got said youre getting more dear keep on getting keep on giving peter looked at clock here endeth first lesson said not even out of prophet must go see father more acting necessary know flung arm out darent be real said one know what abomination be quite unexpectedly nellie felt

dont see why put hypothetical case about silvia want to come back dont point of view necessitated more stridings on part of mr mainwaring angel angel silvia said have asked if must not like to spend rest of winter on riviera little sun for said only to night little change little chance of healing of wound offer two month on riviera must not be wrong if did not accept sweet charity leave over mean
