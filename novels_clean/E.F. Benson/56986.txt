night need knowledge to play at hotch potch verse in life for two year half at cambridge have associated with very many class there babe have never come across man whom must suspect of being capable of doing necessitated going to see man knew on errand a concluded rightly that though such people doubt occurred be not to be looked for with chance of finding at university town errand be not pleasant one be far from being easy one when knocked at felthams door few minute afterwards must not have hazarded vaguest guess a to what manner of exit must make babe be unfortunately strongly possessed by gambling instinct when night before friend of have come in after hall proposed whist if must get four babe said that if be going to play card might a well play something more amusing than whist seemed to a peculiarly unexhilarating mode of enjoying regarded a practical application of unmixed mathematics if broxton must raise two people to play at something more biting than whist babe must raise two others babe raised two without much delay broxton returned with only one however said have met chap called feltham who knew played must see whether must come babe must have played card with old gooseberry if must not get anyone else so broxton went off to see whether feltham must play found in willing played van john for while until babe began to yawn complained have only lost three six did know marmara be indifferently called only penny chiefly because dealt with sum usually much larger than of among be feltham did know marmara others be willing to learn so babe assuring that previous knowledge be required proceeded to enlighten everyone placed small sum say sixpence equivalent in counter in pool dealer thereupon dealt three card face downwards around three to then turned up next card have premise thus if for instance card turned up happened to be four of diamond player in turn have to bet before looking at three card lay face downwards on table whether contained diamond higher than four stake be only limited by sum in pool unless chose to fix smaller limit thus with four turned up must probably appear to player that there be fair chance of holding higher card of same suit must in likelihood stake pretty well a high a must must then turn up card if hand held diamond higher than four must have pleasure of taking amount of stake out of pool if not pain of paying into pool same sum game so said babe be amusing owing to fact that be pure hazard also because pool mounted up in way must seem to uninitiated simply incredible example of occurred at fifth deal at beginning of deal pool contained four shilling babe dealt turned up two of spade first player naturally enough went pool hand very curiously contained only diamond paid four shilling into pool thus raising to eight even more naturally since first player have held no spade second player again staked pool hand contained two heart club pool became sixteen shilling must have be midsummer madness in third player who be broxton not to stake pool a be november be perfectly sane did so hand revealed three splendid heart pool rose to thirty two shilling chance be thus enormously in favour of fourth player clearing pool accordingly staked a held diamond two club paid pool equivalent of thirty two shilling in mean bone counter belonging to babe there be nothing left for fifth player who be feltham to do to stake pool did hand oddly enough contained seven eight nine of club remarked quite unreasonably a paid sixty four shilling into pool that card have not be shuffled thus babe who have dealt have pool of sixty four shilling to win lose staked pool held one diamond one club ace of spade counted below two wrote o u for sixty four shilling a have not got enough counter paid into pool remarking that be better than whist at three penny point then pool in one deal have mounted from four shilling to one hundred twenty eight shilling be obvious that if similar deal occurred again now there must be very considerable sum in pool at end of babe in matter be like athenian somewhat superstitious said cheerfully that be mounting pool must have amusement pool showed by subsequent conduct that be right at end of hour held about about half of have be contributed by feltham whose luck have be abominable a be playing at present might be won by anybody since there be limit to stake babe with best possible motif since be only one present who must not be somewhat embarrassed by total loss of contribution to pool proposed setting limit of say twenty five shilling to stake feltham objected strongly alteration be vetoed everyone with exception perhaps of babe be little excited on edge for when two three be gathered together to gamble often generate spontaneously between be sober fact little demon hovers about unsettles nerve feltham especially hardly spoke except to name stake sometimes to swear when lost babe felt that be taking too seriously quite spoiling pleasure for liked little game because happened to amuse others be behaving a if cared whether won money lost money to babe thinking spoilt whole thing point of gambling according to be not whether won money lost money moment when be uncertain whether be going to win in abstract lose in abstract view be wholly unreasonable so be gambling instinct be broxtons turn to deal dealt badly holding pack from dealt nearly foot above table so that if of happened to be looking at card a be dealt to chance be that must get glimpse hint of what under one be once before evening babe have demanded fresh deal because a card be dealt must not help seeing corner of picture card time however be handing cigarette to feltham who sat on right a felthams card be dealt babe saw look up quickly saw face of one of so far at least that must have be ready to swear be picture card in club feltham at moment seemed to to open mouth to speak said nothing only glanced hurriedly at babe who did not look at again during game turn up card be nine of club first two player naturally enough a there be only four card out of fifty two must beat nine staked nominal stake merely turned up card one of held king of club must have won leaving only three card in pack must win took shilling amount of stake out of pool said wished have trusted to instinct be felthams turn staked be madness hand contained queen of club won very soon after babe renewed proposition that must limit stake time there be opposition a be already after one settled to stop a soon a pool have be emptied pool seeing change tactic also changed own instead of mounting continued to sink steadily now then must go up again by couple of limit stake constant tendency be to sink in three quarter of hour be empty broxton gathered up card counter feltham two of others said good night left room anstruther babe sat down waited babe helped to whisky tore up own o have paid for there be long awkward silence broxton got up closed door came stood in front of fire fellow cheated said at last saw twice did notice babe thought saw card be dealt once turn up be nine of club staked struck a unusual particularly a king be already out then cheated twice a jim said answered anstruther be convinced saw card once before time when jim be dealing jim damned fool said babe why cant manage to deal properly be damned fool think said broxton what business have got to ask fellow to play whom dont know who probably cant afford can said anstruther dont cheat be quite sure did cheat asked babe personally be said broxton arent anstruther good lord yes well whats to be done asked babe men who play with ought to know said anstruther babe got up threw torn up o into fire rot said cant possibly be certain im not going to ask to play again in order to watch seems to perhaps one degree lower than cheating own fault a jim said for asking dear babe cant leave a be dont want to do that only meant that couldnt tell other people what suspected unless be certain not even then cant be certain unless play with again that dont mean to do what do propose to do then propose that one of tell what thought saw if denies matter end there at same time to make clear to that three people separately thought saw thought saw said broxton certainly thought saw daresay isnt bad chap daresay be playing for far more than must afford be even possible will confess did cheat be quite possible that be wrong that didnt personally certainly thought did wouldnt take oath on who to ask there be short silence then will if like said babe thanks babe said jim youd do better than of babe lit cigarette finished whisky im off to bed said must sooner have played old maid than that must have happened of course none of say word about good night chap anstruther broxton sat on for bit after babe have gone devilish business said latter at length im sure babe will manage a well a can be managed babe isnt bad chap said anstruther dont think be in fact dont think ever knew better be off good night babe wrote note to feltham next morning asking if must be in at seven evening receiving affirmative answer thus came about that tapped at door at hour xviii confession qui saccuse sexcuse from french babe supposition that feltham perhaps wasnt bad chap be perfectly correct at same time be perfectly true that have cheated at card quite rightly be one of few social crime for man be ostracised have cheated knew be thoroughly honestly unreservedly ashamed of did not try to console by fact that have never done before by knowledge that must never do again because knew that must fail to find slightest consolation in though be perfectly true thing be done be past mending twice have seen card at rate have suspicion of one of when be dealt without saying anything on one of occasion what have seen did not help for saw only card of suit once when have seen queen of club traded on swindled company of how have come to do did not know thought devil must have taken possession of be probably quite right temptation be stronger because have lost a babe have suggested much more than must afford thing be done almost before meant to do more than half suspected that babe have noticed to do justice suspicion weighed very light in mind compared with fact that have cheated next morning babe note came suspicion that babe have noticed took definite form be manner of use refusing to see what must not make up mind about be what answer must give to confess must not help to make reparation to return a honestly wanted to do have won besides did not seem in anticipation particularly easy thing to do when babe knocked at door be still a much in dark a ever a to what if babe errand be what suspected must say to babe accepted cigarette sat down rather elaborately have determined not to remark upon weather prospect of early dissolution make foolish attempt to lead up to subject after moment spoke be awfully sorry said to have to say what be going to in two word be three men with whom be playing last night at marmara thought that once twice saw card one of card before staked be one of decided that only fair proper thing to do be to ask whether be so be very sorry to have to say babe behaved like gentleman be instead of looking at feltham to see whether face indicated anything kept eye steadily away from feltham stood moment without answering if babe have chosen to look at must have seen that paused because must not command voice babe did not choose to do so feltham must have given anything moment to have be able to say be true seemed to physical impossibility on other hand felt equally impossible to take high line to threaten to kick babe out of room unless went in double quick time etc etc to do of thing thorough paced swindler be supposed to do when honour be quite properly called in question be damned lie said at length quite quietly without conviction babe got up at once stepped across to where feltham be standing then wish to apologise most sincerely for myself other two fellow said if must like to knock down may will of course tell at once be mistaken believe what say entirely will shake hand feltham let babe take hand a latter turned to leave room sat limply down in chair from babe have got up babe have hardly got half way across room when feltham spoke again babe utter frankness have suddenly made impossible for feltham to let go without telling to tell now be not made easier by having lied about please wait minute said babe cigarette have gone out lit again over lamp then sat down in window seat waited outside grass be sparkling with frost clock chimed quarter past seven simultaneously feltham spoke have lied to a well said what saw be perfectly true cheated twice at least saw one of card dealt twice said nothing about once card happened to be immaterial once staked knowing must win have told babe be person of infinite variety if who knew best have seen now must hardly have believed be sat down on arm of chair where feltham be sitting to cursed whole pack of card from ace to king above jim broxton then aloud poor dear fellow said im devilish sorry for feltham who have be expecting to hear few biting remark else merely door slam behind babe looked up babe be looking at quite kindly quite naturally a if be condoling with on misfortune feltham began damn then stopped without moment warning burst out cry babe got up went to door sported then sat down again on arm of chair poor chap said beastly hard line fully expect a much fault a yours neednt trouble to tell never did before of course didnt fully believe that people who must confess that sort of thing dont do sort of thing twice be like perhaps be playing for far more than must afford didnt mean to do until somehow be done money be devilish contrivance yes be just like said feltham a told first time saw card didnt make difference though of course ought to have said so second time did before knew what have done have cheated why dont call swindler tell im not fit to associate with gentleman god truth corner of babe mouth twitched not concern then what must be good of saying that paused moment hoping that feltham must make certain suggestion be not disappointed look here there twenty pound what can do with can help babe thought moment yes give ill see that other fellow get somehow if youll leave to discretion know sound absurd for fool like to give advice if be shouldnt play card for money again use running one head into danger if not rude what be allowance two hundred fifty bally as yet dont know fault couldnt tell that pool must behave in manner know personally must find out of question to say one be playing for more than one must afford people call moral cowardice seems to perfectly natural reticence of course wont play again said feltham why have be so awfully good to havent what else be to do oh yes think respected for telling truth most fellow must have lied like george washington feltham smiled feebly that remains be said babe of course must tell other two fellow about two mean with whom talked can trust absolutely be impossible that anyone else must ever know about dont think oughtnt to tell stammered feltham babe frowned of course ought not why deuce must about money must be divided up between six into twenty about three pound ten rather awkward sum why six because there be six of cant take feeling have nothing to do with remarked babe money in pool of course belongs to everyone return others share of keep own well ill manage somehow will make absurd bet seventy to one in shilling will surprise nobody often do good lord quarter to eight if youre going into hall youll be very late so will for dinner must go oh by way did lose much altogether about twenty five

confessed to that have be quite certain that feltham have cheated that must own up to be fine babe who considered totally devoid of anything must possibly be construed into moral courage respected for also registered vow never to crack of doom cracked three day afterwards must play unlimited marmara again told that be not cut out for sort of thing that have just be through that be glad be over went
